AB This article uses census data and village histories to examine changes
   over the last 35 years in the four villages where the Institute of
   Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) Longitudinal Study
   (1969-77) was conducted and offers a rare picture of development and
   change in rural localities over a long period of time. In addition, by
   characterizing the environment in which the subjects of this study were
   raised, we provide context for and inputs into quantitative analyses of
   data collected at various points in time on these subjects. The villages
   have undergone massive demographic, social, and economic change. Initial
   differences have conditioned many of these changes, especially
   differences associated with agricultural potential and location.
   Originally these villages were rather isolated, but road and
   transportation access has improved substantially. The populations in the
   villages have more than doubled and also have aged. While marriage
   patterns have held steady, religious practice has changed a great deal.
   After many years of steady out-migration, three of the four villages are
   more recently experiencing net in-migration, a pattern associated with
   ease of access. Schooling access and outcomes also have improved, with
   average grades of schooling nearly tripling and literacy doubling to
   levels currently above national averages. Although agriculture remains
   an important component of individual livelihood strategies,
   non-agricultural sources of employment have become more important. Much
   of this change is associated with declining agricultural markets and
   increased access to non-agricultural jobs near the villages and in the
   capital. Accompanying these changes has been an improvement in living
   standards as measured by a number of indicators of household living
   conditions and consumer durable goods.

AB In this note, we calculate and describe proxy measures that account for
   variation in standard of living across subjects in the Institute of
   Nutrition of Central America and Panama (INCAP) Longitudinal Study
   (1969-77), at the time of the original intervention. Using principal
   components analysis, we construct two linear indices from an array of
   household consumer durable goods and housing characteristics, measured
   at the nuclear family level in the 1975 cross-sectional census. The two
   indices perform well on three dimensions. First, they are internally
   coherent in that average ownership and quality of housing
   characteristics increase with the principal component score. Second,
   they are robust in that the different approaches yield similar results,
   for example, in classifying nuclear families into tertiles. And third,
   they are consistent in that they yield results similar to scores
   constructed by previous researchers. The indices can be used as
   background controls in analyses of the INCAP Longitudinal Study
   (1969-77) data and subsequent follow-up studies, including the Human
   Capital Study 2002-04. Several articles presented in this supplement to
   the Food and Nutrition Bulletin used the 1975 index.

BP S110
EP S119
PD JUN 2005
PY 2005
AB In this article, we describe expenditure and wealth patterns, indicators
   of long-run economic well-being, for a sample of young Guatemalan adults
   interviewed for the Human Capital Study 2002-04, finding a number of
   differences across subgroups of the sample. The main difference across
   birth-year cohorts is that younger subjects tend to live in smaller
   households, with lower total annual household expenditures (and fewer
   durable goods), though per capita measures are similar across cohorts.
   This appears to be related to life-cycle fertility patterns. There is a
   clear positive association between parental socioeconomic status (SES)
   and current levels of expenditure and durable goods ownership. This
   association does not hold for all households, however, as there is both
   upward and downward "mobility" in the sample. Those living in the
   capital have the highest overall wealth levels, consistent with typical
   rural-urban patterns. Where there are expenditure differences across
   groups, they tend to be driven by differences in nonfood rather than
   food expenditures. Lastly, the study sample is relatively well off
   compared with their compatriots, with a poverty rate of 35% and an
   extreme poverty rate of only 3%, against national averages of 56% and
   15%, respectively.

AB This article examines marriage patterns among individuals who
   participated as children in a nutrition supplementation trial in
   Guatemala and were followed up in 2002-04, at ages 25-42 years. Of all
   1,062 known and alive couples, 735, or 69%, responded fully to the
   marriage assets questionnaire. Focus of the analysis is on the birth
   cohorts born prior to 1974, a total of 1,058 intervention participants,
   among whom four-fifths of men (82%) and of women (78%) were married at
   the time of the 2002-04 survey. Basic patterns are examined in current
   marital status, age at first marriage and related milestones, human
   capital assets brought to marriage (e.g., schooling attainment,
   cognitive ability, literacy, and pre-marital work experience), and
   physical assets and savings accounts brought to marriage. Measures of
   husbands' human capital at marriage are positively correlated with
   wives' human capital, but are consistently higher. Husbands also bring
   substantially more physical and financial assets than wives. A number of
   interesting patterns emerge, including (1) changes in the composition of
   assets that women bring to marriage from physical to human assets, (2)
   declining gaps in age and premarital work experience between husbands
   and wives, and (3) increasing gaps in schooling attainment and cognitive
   ability between husbands and wives. Given conflicting directions of
   change in spousal gaps in human, physical and financial assets, their
   net effect on changes over time in the bargaining power of husbands and
   wives is uncertain and deserves further investigation.

EP S77
PD JUN 2005
PY 2005
AB Fertility rates have declined in many developing countries and this has
   implications for health and development Of subsequent generations.
   Guatemala has the highest fertility rates in Central America.
   Reproductive histories were obtained by interview in 2002-04, in a
   cohort of 779 women and 647 men who had participated as young children
   in a nutrition supplementation trial in Guatemala conducted between 1969
   and 1977. Most women (77%) and men (79%) are currently married. Among
   the 700 women and 524 men reporting at least one birth, mean age at
   first birth was 20.7 +/- 3.8 years and 23.1 +/- 3.9 years respectively.
   Knowledge (>80%) and use (similar to 70%) of modern contraceptive
   methods is fairly high; knowledge increases with parental socioeconomic
   status (SES) as measured in 1975. Younger respondents have experienced
   fewer pregnancies and live births compared with older respondents,
   age-specific fertility rates between 20 and 24 years were 294, 249, 236,
   and 261 births per 1,000 women, respectively, for women born from
   1962-65, 1966-69, 1969-73, and 1974-77. Women in the top tertile of
   parental SES have had significantly fewer pregnancies (3.3) compared
   with those in the middle (3.7) and lower (3.8) tertiles. Migrants to
   Guatemala City reported greater knowledge of contraceptive methods,
   fewer pregnancies and living children, higher age at first birth, and
   more pregnancy and newborn complications as compared with cohort members
   who remained in the original villages (p<.05 for each comparison).
   Fertility rates, especially between 20 and 24 years, have declined over
   time. Differences in reproductive behaviors by parental SES and current
   residence suggest the role of social transitions in determining family
   formation in Guatemala.

AB The present study examined the effects of a school breakfast program on
   the activity level, emotional state, and social interactions of a group
   of Kenyan schoolchildren on the playground. Five hundred forty children
   in rural Kenya participated in the study. The first standard (grade)
   classes were randomly assigned to groups provided for 21 months with
   school breakfasts of equivalent caloric value while families with
   children in the control group were given a goat at the end of the study.
   The study aimed to determine whether enhanced caloric intake or diet
   quality influenced the children's behavior on the school playground. The
   results indicate that supplemented children were more active and showed
   more leadership behavior and initiative than did non-supplemented
   children. In addition, children given meat showed fewer periods of low
   activity and more leadership behaviors and initiative than did children
   provided entirely with vegetable source foods. These results support our
   previous findings from naturalistic studies in the same community that
   both diet quantity and quality are important for children's development.

AB Quantity and quality of schooling obtained and the resulting skills and
   knowledge acquired are important components of human capital. We
   describe the distribution of selected measures of schooling, educational
   achievement, and cognitive functioning among individuals who
   participated as children in a nutrition supplementation trial in
   Guatemala and were followed up in 2002-04. Among 1,469 respondents
   (response rate 80%), who were 26-41 years of age in 2003, more than 90%
   of men and women had attended at least some school; more than half of
   men and more than one-third of women had completed sixth grade.
   Schooling attainment of both men and women has increased across birth
   cohorts but the schooling gap between men and women has increased.
   Parental socioeconomic status, as measured in 1975, is a strong
   predictor of schooling attainment. Basic literacy is high among those
   studied, with more than 80% able to read simple sentences. The gap in
   educational achievement favoring men narrowed across birth cohorts due
   to increases among younger women. The greater performance among men on
   the Raven's Progressive Matrices test persisted despite increased scores
   in the younger birth cohorts for both men and women. Migrants to
   Guatemala City have completed more years of school and scored higher on
   the tests of educational achievement and cognitive functioning than have
   cohort members who have remained in the study villages.

PD JUN 2005
PY 2005
AB Psychosocial influences, such as the family or the school, and biologic
   influences, such as nutrition or the presence of environmental toxins,
   can be viewed as elements of a child's overall environment. Family and
   school influences define dimensions of the child's psychosocial
   environment whereas nutrition and exposure to toxins define dimensions
   of the child's bioecologic environment. This paper presents a
   cross-generation model specifying both the nature and consequences of
   linkages between the psychosocial and bioecologic environments, with
   specific reference to schooling, nutrition, and development. Data from
   two studies done in Egypt and Peru are used to illustrate this model,
   showing how duration of breastfeeding and quality of the young child's
   diet are positively associated with higher levels of maternal education
   and intelligence.

AB Background Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection confers long-term immunity,
   so mathematical analysis of age-specific seroprevalence in populations
   can reveal changes in the infection rate over time. HAV transmission is
   related to access to clean drinking water, personal hygiene and public
   sanitation.
   Methods We used an SIR (susceptible-infectious-recovered) compartmental
   model with age structure to fit a time-dependent logistic function for
   HAV force of infection for 157 published age-seroprevalence data sets.
   We then fit linear regression models for socioeconomic variables and
   infection rate.
   Results The proportion of the population with access to clean drinking
   water, the value of the human development index (HDI), and per capita
   gross domestic product (GDP) are all inverse predictors of HAV infection
   rates. Declining infection rates were observed in 65.6% of the surveys.
   Discussion This work demonstrates the utility of HAV seroprevalence
   studies to reveal patterns of change in force of infection and to assess
   the association between socioeconomic risk factors and transmission
   rates.

AB Three subtypes of autism based on social style have been proposed by
   Wing: active-but-odd, passive, or aloof. Previous research has shown
   evidence of an association between IQ and Wing subtype in untreated
   children and adults. Because IQ changes can accompany behavioral
   treatment, but often only for a subset of children, social subtype may
   be related to treatment responsiveness. We administered a social
   subtyping measure, the Wing Subgroups Questionnaire ( WSQ), at various
   points in treatment to younger children than previously studied with
   autism in early, intensive behavioral intervention ( EIBI). Thirty-seven
   children in EIBI (aged 39-71 months, amount of EIBI 0-44 months) were
   assessed to determine whether Wing's three proposed subtypes were found
   in this sample and whether subtypes were associated with current IQ and
   change in IQ after a period of EIBI. Results confirmed that all three
   subtypes were present and correlated with IQ after a period of
   intervention, as well as with change in IQ. Participants classified as
   aloof had significantly lower IQ scores and changes in IQ after EIBI
   than other children. Future studies should extend these findings by
   examining whether social subtype at pretreatment predicts EIBI outcome.

AB The effect of the social environment on post-copulatory mate guarding
   duration in Japanese beetles, ( Popillia japonica Newman), was examined
   in a laboratory experiment. The mate guarding durations of beetles in
   different sex ratios and densities were observed for 10 hours. Guarding
   duration was longer when females were larger, suggesting the presence of
   'cryptic' male mate choice. Densities, but not sex ratio, affected the
   duration of guarding bouts, with males guarding for longer at higher
   densities. This result implies that males increase their guarding
   duration under conditions in which their female may be likely to be
   encountered by other males. The lack of a sex ratio effect on the
   duration of guarding bouts is consistent with other studies on this
   species that indicate males have difficulty distinguishing females from
   males. Consequently, because the sex ratio on food plants is typically
   male-biased, a paired male may react just to density, treating
   surrounding individuals as if they were mostly males. The total amount
   of time males spent guarding was lower at lower densities and at
   male-biased sex ratios; this suggests that after ceasing to guard one
   female, males were less able to find a subsequent mate under these

AB The use of psychedelic substances within a context that emphasizes
   religious experiences and aims to provide spiritual insights is not a
   new phenomenon. However, the proscription of these substances in most
   modem societies leads to such use now typically occurring in an
   underground and idiosyncratic manner that often leaves individuals on
   their own with regard to the interpretation and integration of their
   experiences and insights. In contrast, the numerous examples in the
   ethnographic and the historical literature indicate that many cultures
   independently developed similar frameworks for using these substances
   for both individually and socially beneficial purposes and arrived at
   similar conclusions as to which of the substances available to them were
   the most appropriate for these purposes. This article focuses on a
   special type of socially sanctioned framework called a "sacrament" and
   contrasts this with other, more idiosyncratic forms of psychedelic use.
   It discusses how this framework helps to structure and channel the
   experiences induced by these substances, thereby increasing the
   likelihood of individually constructive and socially integrative
   experiences.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between intent to be pregnant

   STUDY DESIGN: In 19821983, 3,029 women who gave birth to infants without
   birth defects from 1968-1980 (the control mothers from a large
   case-control study of birth defects) completed a detailed telephone
   interview. This analysis examined behaviors reported in the third month
   of pregnancy because most women would be aware of their pregnancies by
   the end of the first trimester, and our primary interest was assessing
   exposures that occurred after pregnancy recognition.
   RESULTS: Women who reported unintended pregnancies tended to be younger,
   nonwhite and less educated, and tended to have higher gravidity than
   women who reported intended pregnancies. After adjusting for maternal
   age, education, race and previous adverse pregnancy outcome, women who
   reported unintended pregnancies were more likely to report smoking (odds
   ratio [OR] = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2, 1.7), illicit drug
   use (OR= 3.4, 95% CI 1.9, 6.4), not taking vitamins (OR = 1.4, 95% CI
   1.2, 1.7), and alcohol use (OR= 1.2, 95% CI 0.99, 1.4) than women who
   had intended pregnancies. No association was observed between pregnancy
   intention and medication use.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that women who report having
   unintended pregnancies are more likely to have some exposures that may
   result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB This article compares the classification systems between the American
   and French wine industries and reveals striking differences: American
   wines are classified primarily by grape variety, while French wines are
   classified primarily by appellation based on geographic origin; the
   classification in appellation is horizontally structured in the American
   wine industry, while it is vertically structured in the French wine
   industry. These findings demonstrate that classification systems are
   socially constructed. Building upon the literature and drawing empirical
   evidence from these two wine industries, this article develops several
   theoretical arguments on implications and consequences of
   classifications. First, classifications confer identities on social
   actors (,or objects), and inherently imply social control. Second,
   classifications create social boundaries and signify social standing of
   actors (or objects). Third, classification making often involves
   political struggles between different interest groups, and
   classification systems embody the political power. This article further
   presents a sociological framework to understand classifications,
   stressing the multi-dimensionality and complexity of classifications.
   Finally, it discusses the significance of the study of classification in
   sociology and, in particular, its relations with several prominent lines
   of research in cultural sociology. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB People often assume that clergy make job-related decisions based
   primarily oil spiritual criteria, such as a "calling." In this paper we
   challenge this sort of belief by examining clergy job search behavior
   from a sociology of work perspective. Using data from a 1996 national
   survey of parish clergy in two Protestant denominations, we build a job
   search model that identifies the factors that motivate ministers to
   search for positions with other congregations. The results indicate that
   push factors, like key job characteristics and community involvement,
   and human capital factors (skills and experience) affect ministers job
   search propensity. Pull factors, or the availability of positions at
   other churches, have no apparent effect on search propensity. In
   addition, calling appears to have little effect on a minister's decision
   to search,for positions with other congregations. We conclude that,
   contrary to stereotypical views of them as guided primarily by
   faith-based concerns, ministers consider many of the same factors as do
   other employees when deciding whether to search for new jobs.

AB Africa's dismal economic performance is directly attributable to its
   weakness in the production and use of modern technology. Even Nigeria, a
   country with immense human and material resources, coupled with
   significant scientific infrastructure, has not yet been able to manage
   the all-important technological leap forward. The situation was
   different in Biafra (1967-70), when indigenous scientists and engineers
   performed socially relevant science without the preconditions
   conventionally perceived as necessary for technological development.
   Anchored in structuration theory, this article explores the sociology of
   scientific and technological practice in Biafra, outlines the
   achievements of Biafran scientists and engineers, and offers
   explanations of why the Biafran technological success has not been
   replicable in post-civil war Nigeria. Discussion concludes with a
   suggestion for development-driven geopolitical restructuring.

AB Research on social reproduction focuses predominantly on the working
   class. Middle-class social reproduction is not as widely studied and is
   often assumed to be a structurally determined process lacking human
   agency. Using in-depth interviews with 41 college seniors, I demonstrate
   that middle-class social reproduction arises out of the interplay
   between agency and structure, specifically, from individuals' activation
   and negotiation of structural advantages. My analysis centers around the
   themes often invoked to illustrate working-class reproduction:
   resistance and contestation; the importance of the peer group; and
   familial structural resources-or the lack thereof. I discuss how these
   themes are reflected in middle-class social reproduction.

AB Contemporary sociology conceptualizes religion along two dimensions: the
   institutional and the individual. Lost in this dichotomy is religion's
   noninstitutional, but collective and public, cultural dimension. As a
   result, theories of religious modernity, including both sides of the
   secularization debate, are unable to recognize or evaluate the social
   power of noninstitutionalized religious communication. This article
   offers a reconceptualization of religion that highlights its cultural,
   communicative dimension. Original research on religious talk provides an
   empirical ground for a theoretical discussion that highlights: (1) the
   "invisible" nature of religion in modern societies, as theorized by
   Thomas Luckmann and (2) the social power attributed to communication by
   contemporary cultural sociologists and cultural theorists. I argue that
   conceptualizing religion as an evolving societal conversation about
   transcendent meaning broadens the empirical and theoretical grasp of the
   religion concept.

AB The single best word to describe the impact of George Herbert Meads
   ideas on the intellectual world is "ironic." Although Mead was a
   philosopher, his ideas have been more influential in sociology than in
   philosophy. Despite Mead's belief that it is the job of sociologists to
   study society, it is his notion of the self rather than his notion of
   society that has received the most attention in this field. Mead himself
   is first and foremost responsible for this ironic state of affairs
   because his analysis of society is so obscure at points that it is hard
   for most sociologists to understand. However, Mead alone is not to
   blame. The two main expositors of his sociological thought since his
   death, Herbert Blumer and Hans Joas, added to the confusion by not
   making clear that Mead sees society as a "body of institutions." To
   correct their distortions of Mead's notion of society, I provide an
   alternative exposition of that notion. I disclose how Mead addresses the
   three main problems that he believes must be resolved before society can
   be understood: (1) the operation of institutions in the daily lives of
   people; (2) the origination of early institutions, such as language, the
   family, the economy, religion, polity, and science; and (3) the change
   of these institutions after their inception.

AB Hispanics are a growing segment of the United States population and will
   be an increasingly important stakeholder in future allocation and
   management of natural resources, including wildlife. In the United
   States, Hispanics now are the largest ethnic minority and will remain so
   over the next 40 years. Texas supports the second-largest Hispanic
   population in the United States behind California, and it will have a
   Hispanic majority by 2040. Some analysts predict that this demographic
   shift will leave us with a less-educated population with smaller incomes
   and higher levels of poverty-posing not only a social concern but also a
   challenge for conservation of wildlife resources. Here we identify
   shared Hispanic cultural characteristics, such as family, socioeconomic
   factors, and language, and their importance in planning wildlife
   outreach programs. Recognizing differences among Spanish-speaking
   cultures is equally important. Knowledge of cultural characteristics
   will enable wildlife advocates to better expose wildlife issues in a
   manner receptive by Hispanics. It is in the best interest of wildlife
   and wildlife professionals to encourage Hispanic participation in this
   planning process because of their growing political and economic
   influence.

AB Objective: To examine genetic and environmental influences on drinking
   in a nationally representative study of genetically informative
   adolescents followed into young adulthood.
   Method: The average quantity of alcohol used per drinking episode during
   the past year was analyzed in 4432 youth assessed during adolescence
   (mean age of 16) and then 1 and 6 years later. The variance of quantity
   of alcohol consumed was decomposed into three components: additive
   genetic (a(2)), shared environmental (c(2)), non-shared environmental
   (e(2)). Four candidate genes were tested for association.
   Results: Wave (1) a(2)-0.52e(2)-0.48, Wave (2) a(2)-0.28e(2)-0.72, Wave
   (3) a(2)-0.30e(2)-0.70. Genetic correlations between Waves 1 and 2 were
   0.85, Waves 1 and 3 were 0.34. The DAT1 440 allele was associated at
   Wave 1 (p = 0.007). DRD2 TaqI A1/A2 was associated at Wave 3 (p =
   0.007). DRD4 and 5HTT were not associated. The DAT1 and DRD2
   polymorphisms accounted for 3.1% and 2.0% of the variation,
   respectively.
   Conclusion: Genetic influence on drinking behavior was common in
   adolescents longitudinally assessed 1 year apart, but was less
   correlated between these adolescents and their assessment as young
   adults at a subsequent time point. Polymorphisms in genes of the
   dopaminergic system appear to influence variation in drinking behavior.

AB Multilevel modeling techniques have become a useful tool that enables
   substance abuse researchers to more accurately identify the contribution
   of multiple levels of influence on drug-related attitudes and behaviors.
   However, it is difficult to determine the relative importance of the
   different hierarchical levels because, in the case of dichotomous
   outcomes, the variance components estimation involves calculations using
   a log-odds metric at the lowest level of estimation. We present methods
   introduced by Goldstein and Rasbash [Goldstein, H., Rasbash, J., 1996.
   Improved approximations for multilevel models with binary responses. J.
   Roy. Stat. Soc. A 159, 505-513.] to convert the variance components from
   the log-odds to the probability metric. This method provides a more

   illustrate this approach. We also conduct a stability analysis to

   available in commercial multilevel software packages. Finally, we

   45% current drug users and 17% AIDS diagnosed). Outcomes were access to
   the same medical provider, use of outpatient services and emergency room
   ( ER) use with or without subsequent hospitalization. Controlling for
   AIDS diagnosis, insurance, current drug use and gender, access to the
   same medical care provider was associated with more females in one's
   support network and more network sources of emotional support, financial
   support and instrumental assistance. Adjusting for confounders,
   outpatient service use was associated with more female support network
   members and more sources of emotional support. Controlling for
   participants' drug use and insurance, sub-optimal emergency department
   use was associated with a greater number of active drug users in one's
   support network. Contrary to other study findings, having a supportive
   sex partner was associated with lower access to medical care, and kin
   support was not associated with medical service use. Results indicate
   that specific sources and forms of social support had differential
   influences on the sample's utilization of medical services. The findings
   suggest that promoting HIV-positive African American injection drug
   users' support network functioning may help improve HIV medical services
   utilization among this medically underserved population.

   Animal and human studies suggest that variation in monoamine oxidase A

   conduct problems and criminal convictions amongst sibling-pairs from the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were tested for
   association with reports of maltreatment before and after the age of 12.
   MAOA promoter polymorphisms were tested for possible moderation effects.
   Maltreatment predicted conduct problems and criminal convictions. MAOA
   genotype did not have a significant moderating effect in any of the six
   analyses that were conducted. We did not replicate a previous report
   that MAGA polymorphisms moderated the relationship between maltreatment
   and conduct problems. There was, however, a non-significant trend in the
   predicted direction. Additional studies will be needed before firm

AB Conflict management is one of the primary requirements for social
   complexity. Of the many forms of conflict management, one of the rarest
   and most interesting is third-party policing, or intervening impartially
   to control conflict. Third-party policing should be hard to evolve
   because policers personally pay a cost for intervening, while the
   benefits are diffused over the whole group. In this study we investigate
   the incidence and costs of policing in a primate society. We report
   quantitative evidence of non-kin policing in the nonhuman primate, the
   pigtailed macaque. We find that policing is effective at reducing the
   intensity of or terminating conflict when performed by the most powerful
   individuals. We define a measure, social power consensus, that predicts
   effective low-cost interventions by powerful individuals and
   ineffective, relatively costly interventions by low-power individuals.
   Finally, we develop a simple probabilistic model to explore whether the
   degree to which policing can effectively reduce the societal cost of
   conflict is dependent on variance in the distribution of power. Our data
   and simple model suggest that third-party policing effectiveness and
   cost are dependent on power structure and might emerge only in societies
   with high variance in power.

AB PURPOSE: Well-documented errors in the reporting of drug-related
   behaviors have been attributed to several sources. These include: 1)
   respondent difficulties in understanding survey questions, 2) problems
   in recalling the information necessary to accurately answer these
   questions, and 3) social pressures that discourage accurate reporting.
   We report covariance structure models designed to simultaneously
   evaluate each of these potential sources of error.
   METHODS: Data examined are from a community survey of 627 Chicago adults
   which collected drug use self reports (via ACASI technology), multiple
   biological samples (including hair, urine, and saliva) that permit
   self-report validation, and a series of probes designed to collect
   systematic information regarding respondent comprehension and memory
   difficulties and social desirability concerns. These three sets of
   information were employed to construct latent variable covariance
   structure models that enabled an evaluation of the effects of each
   potential source of reporting error on the quality of drug use
   reporting.
   RESULTS: Social desirability concerns were predictive of discordant drug
   use reporting and drug use under-reporting. Memory difficulties were
   predictive of drug use over-reporting. Differences in the predictive
   power of these variables were found across race/ethnic groups.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both memory difficulties and social desirability concerns
   are independent sources of measurement error in surveys of drug use

AB The presence in a family of a child or children with epidermolysis
   bullosa (EB) may have profound psychological implications for other
   family members.
   To assess the impact of the presence of EB in one or more children on
   the personal relationships between their parents.
   Standardized questionnaires were used.
   In general, the presence of a child severely affected with EB had
   profound effects on many aspects of marriage. This included a lack of
   interest in participating in activities as couples [junctional EB (JEB),
   45%; recessive dystrophic EB (RDEB), 25%], a lack of energy to invest in
   such pursuits (JEB, 82%; RDEB, 50%), limitations in opportunities for
   sharing nonintimate physical activities (reported by most parents having
   children with some type of generalized EB), and negatively altered
   parental sex life (JEB, 55%; RDEB, 39%). This is consistent with the
   fact that 10%, 64%, 25% and 36% of parents of an affected child with EB
   simplex (EBS), JEB, dominant dystrophic EB (DDEB) and RDEB,
   respectively, characterized their relationships as couples as revolving
   almost exclusively around the day-to-day care of their affected
   children. The severity of disease in an affected child clearly
   influenced parental decisions about having more children: 24% and 64% of
   parents of children with JEB and RDEB, respectively, chose not to have
   additional children, compared with 26% and 54% of parents with children
   having EBS or DDEB. This choice was most often pursued via tubal
   ligation; less often, alternative means of surgical sterilization were
   chosen. Divorce was common among parents of children with EB (range: 17%
   in EBS to 31% in JEB) and, with the exception of parents of children
   with EBS, was usually directly attributed by one or both parents to the
   profound impact that this disease had exerted on their marriage.
   Physicians caring for children with EB need to give more consideration
   to the many psychological factors that may contribute to their patients'
   well being. They may need to assist these children's parents in seeking
   support and counselling to prevent destruction of the family unit.

AB This paper uses retrospective event-history data covering a four-year
   period to examine the timing of exposure to HIV/AIDS education and
   social marketing condom promotion campaigns, relative to the timing of
   changes in sexual risk behaviour in Tanzania. Analysis of the
   event-history data shows that the process of exposure to AIDS education
   messages and exposure to brand advertising for Salama brand condoms was
   very different. While exposure to AIDS education was early and gradual,
   exposure to Salama brand condoms started later, but was much more rapid.
   After one year of advertising, over half of the target population had
   been reached by the Salama advertising campaign, mostly through
   newspapers, radio and television. During the study period, condom use
   increased from 15% at the beginning of 1993 to 42% at the end of 1996.
   Increases in condom use were driven both by men who became sexually
   active, and by men who were not yet protected, or not fully protected.
   The results further show that it is uncommon. for men who adopted condom
   use to return to more risky behaviour, which suggests that behaviour
   change in the study population is permanent.

AB Evolutionary theory guides an investigation of foster parent selection
   in two northern Thai villages with different biosocial environments: one
   village has high levels of labour migration and divorce, and growing
   numbers of parental death due to HIV/AIDS, while the other village has
   lower migration, divorce and parental mortality levels. Focus groups
   examine mothers' and fathers' motivations and ideals regarding foster
   caretaker selection, and quantitative family surveys examine real
   fostering outcomes: specifically, the laterality (matrilateral versus
   patrilateral) and genetic distance of the foster caretakers of all
   ever-fostered children in these two villages. As predicted, in
   environments of high marital stability and paternity certainty, parents
   seem to prefer close genetic kin from either side as foster parents for
   their children. In low marital stability and paternity certainty
   environments, parents trust their own lateral kin, regardless of genetic
   distance, over close genetic kin from the other side. The striking
   exception to this pattern, however, occurs in the case of parental
   death, in which case children are fostered to the deceased parent's kin,
   regardless of the child's sex or other factors. In general, the foster
   parents for girls are selected with more care, reflecting the
   daughter/female preference expected in traditionally matrilineal,
   matrilocal societies. An ordered decision-making pathway for foster
   parent selection is proposed, taking into consideration the key factors
   of (a) the circumstances driving the fostering decision, (b) the gender
   of the child, (c) the gender of the key decision-making parent, and (d)
   the degree of marital and population fluidity (and subsequent paternity
   certainty) in the village.

AB Objective: The present study examined gender differences in the
   psychologic and physical symptom changes associated with written
   disclosure. Methods: Male (n = 48) and female (n = 46) college students
   were assigned to either a written disclosure condition or a control
   writing condition. Participants in each condition wrote on 3 consecutive
   days for 20 minutes each session. Heart rate was recorded during each
   writing session and the narratives were examined for linguistic content.
   Participants completed measures of psychologic and physical health at
   baseline and again I month later. Results: Participants assigned to the
   written disclosure condition reported significantly greater
   psychological and physical health benefits at follow up compared with
   the control group participants. No significant gender differences were
   found among those participants assigned to the written disclosure
   condition. Additionally, although heart rate reactivity and changes in
   the use of words denoting positive emotion, negative emotion, and
   cognitive appraisal significantly differed between the writing
   conditions, no significant gender differences in these variables were
   found among individuals assigned to the written disclosure condition.
   Conclusions: Written disclosure is associated with significant
   improvements in both psychologic and physical health for men and women.
   There was no support for the notion that men may derive greater benefits
   than women from written disclosure. Furthermore, the results of this
   study indicate that changes in physiological reactivity and word use
   associated with written disclosure do not differ between men and women.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether parent-imposed limits
   on 16-year-old high-risk driving are stricter in Maryland (MD), a state
   with graduated driver licensing (GDL) than in Connecticut (CT), a
   non-GDL state. In both states, parents and adolescents completed
   telephone surveys about the restrictions that parents placed on their
   adolescents' driving at night, with adolescent passengers, and at high
   speeds. In Maryland, surveys took place 1 month (294 parent-adolescent
   pairs) and 4 months (292 parent-adolescent pairs) after provisional
   licensure. In Connecticut, surveys took place the first month (132
   pairs) and the third month (108 pairs) after adolescent licensure. The
   findings indicated that after controlling for demographic
   characteristics, Maryland parents and adolescents reported stricter
   parent-imposed limits for adolescent passengers, high-speed roads,
   weekend night driving, and overall limits. Parents in GDL states appear
   better able to establish and enforce adolescent driving restrictions
   when the licensing state stipulates, favors, and supports regulated
   adolescent driving. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Context: Little research has investigated possible effects of
   neighborhood residence on mental health problems in children such as
   depression, anxiety, and withdrawal.
   Objective: To examine whether children's mental health is associated
   with neighborhood structural characteristics (concentrated disadvantage,
   immigrant concentration, and residential stability) and whether
   neiahbor- hood social processes (collective efficacy and organizational
   participation) underlie such effects.
   Design and Setting: The Project on Human Development in Chicago
   Neighborhoods is a multilevel, longitudinal study of a representative
   sample of children aged 5 to 11 years in the late 1990s recruited from
   80 neighborhoods. A community survey assessing neighborhood social
   processes was conducted with an independent sample of adult residents in
   these 80 neighborhoods and is used in conjunction with US census data to
   assess neighborhood conditions.
   Participants: A total of 2805 children (18.1% European American, 33.8%
   African American, and 48.1% Latino) and their primary caregivers were
   seen twice.
   Main Outcome Measures: Child Behavior Checklist total raw and clinical
   cutoff scores for internalizing behavior problems (depression, anxiety,
   withdrawal, and somatic problems).
   Results: The percentages of children above the clinical threshold were
   21.5%, 18.3%, and 11.5% in neighborhoods of low, medium, and high
   socioeconomic status, respectively. A substantial proportion of variance
   in children's total internalizing scores (intraclass correlation, 11.1%)
   was attributable to between-neighborhood differences. Concentrated
   disadvantage was associated with more mental health problems and a
   higher number of children in the clinical range, after accounting for
   family demographic characteristics, maternal depression, and earlier
   child mental health scores. Neighborhood collective efficacy and
   organizational participation were associated with better mental health,
   after accounting for neighborhood concentrated disadvantage. Collective
   efficacy mediated the effect of concentrated disadvantage.
   Conclusions: A large number of children in poor neighborhoods have
   mental health problems. The mechanism through which neighborhood
   economic effects operated was community social control and cohesion,
   which may be amenable to intervention.

AB BACKGROUND, Primary treatment for early-stage prostate carcinoma
   includes expectant management or, for curative intent, radical
   prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Treatment recommendations are generally
   guided by clinical factors such as Gleason grade, prostate-specific
   antigen level, comorbid illnesses, and patient age. Sociocultural
   factors may also have influences on patient and urologist treatment
   choices.
   METHODS. The authors used bivariate and multinomial logistic regression
   to identify medical and sociodemographic predictors of prostatectomy
   (compared with radiotherapy) and curative therapy (compared with
   expectant management) in a cohort of 27,920 non-Latino white, black, and
   Latino men without comorbidities in the latest linked Surveillance,
   Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare dataset (years 1995-1999).
   Predictors included tumor stage, patient age, marital status,
   race/ethnicity, and soscioeconomic status.
   RESULTS. Younger age and higher tumor grade were robust predictors of
   curative treatment compared with expectant management and of
   prostatectomy compared with radiotherapy. Sociodemographic factors had
   an additive role in treatment choice. Marriage predicted Curative
   treatment compared with expectant management (adjusted risk ratio [RR]
   1.28 [1.25-1.30]) and prostatectomy compared with radiotherapy (adjusted
   RR 1.24 [1.20-1.28]). Although blacks and Latinos were just as likely as
   whites to receive curative treatment, blacks were significantly less
   likely, whereas Latinos were more likely, to receive prostatectomy
   compared with radiotherapy (adjusted RRs = 0.77 [0.72-83]) and 1.24
   [1.18-1.30], respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS. Marriage was positively associated with curative treatment
   in general, and with prostatectomy specifically. Blacks received
   prostatectomy less often than whites, although they did not receive less
   curative treatment overall. Latinos received prostatectomy more often
   than whites. Clinicians should recognize the importance of cultural and
   social forces as well as biomedical factors in decisions regarding the
   treatment of patients with early-stage prostate carcinoma. (c) 2005

AB OBJECTIVES: To compare detection of cognitive impairment using the
   Mini-Cog and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and to identify
   sociodemographic variables that influence detection in an
   ethnoculturally diverse sample.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
   SETTING: A registry of the University of Washington Alzheimer's Disease
   Research Center Satellite.
   PARTICIPANTS: A heterogeneous community sample (n=371) of predominantly
   ethnic minority elderly assessed using a standardized research protocol,
   231 of whom met criteria for dementia or mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI).
   MEASUREMENTS: Demographic data, a standardized research protocol for
   cognitive assessment and dementia diagnosis, MMSE, and Mini-Cog.
   RESULTS: Both screens effectively detected cognitive impairment, the
   Mini-Cog slightly better than the MMSE (P <.01). Overall accuracy of
   classification was 83% for the Mini-Cog and 81% for the MMSE. The
   Mini-Cog was superior in recognizing patients with Alzheimer-type
   dementias (P=.05). Low education negatively affected detection using the
   MMSE (P <.001), whereas education did not affect the Mini-Cog, and low
   literacy minimally affected it.
   CONCLUSION: The Mini-Cog detects clinically significant cognitive
   impairment as well as or better than the MMSE in multiethnic elderly
   individuals, is easier to administer to non-English speakers, and is
   less biased by low education and literacy.

AB A "get-tough" approach has guided criminal justice policy in the United
   States since the 1970s. This approach has involved hiring more police,
   building more prisons, and handing out longer and more certain prison
   terms for a variety of offenses. Although scholars dispute the impact of
   such measures, they generally agree that these steps stem in part from
   widespread public concern over crime and the desire that the criminal
   justice system treat suspects and criminals more punitively. Prior
   research, however, has found that racial prejudice partly underlies
   punitive sentiments among the public. This article extends this work
   into another important dimension of public opinion on crime, the view
   that the criminal justice system needs more money to fight crime. We
   investigate a link between racial prejudice and this view using data on
   white Americans in the 2000 General Social Survey. We find that whites
   who perceive African Americans as more violent are more likely to want
   more money spent on crime. In specifying this general result, we find
   further that this relationship is limited to one segment of whites: the
   most racially prejudiced. Final remarks address the theoretical and
   pragmatic implications of these findings.

AB How did people in preIndustrial ancient civilizations produce and
   distribute bulk items, such as salt, needed for everyday use by their
   large urban populations? This report focuses on the ancient Maya who
   obtained quantities of salt at cities in the interior of the Yucatan
   peninsula of Mexico, Belize, and Guatemala in an area where salt is
   scarce. I report the discovery of 41 Late Classic Maya saltworks (anno
   Domini 600-900) in Punta Ycacos Lagoon on the south coast of Belize,
   including one with the first-known ancient Maya canoe paddle. The
   discoveries add important empirical information for evaluating the
   extent of surplus salt production and river transport during the height
   of Late Classic civilization in the southern Maya lowlands. The
   discovery of the saltworks indicates that there was extensive production
   and distribution of goods and resources outside the cities in the
   interior of the Yucatan. The discovery of a wooden canoe paddle from one
   of the Punta Ycacos saltworks, Ka'k' Naab', ties the production of salt
   to its inland transport by rivers and documents the importance of canoe
   trade between the coast and the interior during the Late Classic.
   Archaeological discovery of multiple saltworks on the Belizean coast
   represents surplus production of salt destined largely for the inland
   Peten Maya during their Late Classic peak, underscoring the importance
   of non-state-controlled workshop production in preIndustrial societies.

AB Background: College students tend to pour single servings of beer and
   liquor that are larger than commonly used standards. The reasons for
   this are unknown. Students might overpour because they lack knowledge of
   standard serving sizes. Alternatively, they might know how much alcohol
   to pour but simply have difficulty pouring the correct amounts.
   Misperceptions of standard serving sizes could lead to inaccuracies in
   self-reported consumption. If this is the case, then the validity of
   students' responses on alcohol surveys and the definitions of risky
   drinking that are based on them would be called into question. This
   study examined how college students define standard drinks, whether
   their definitions are similar to the definitions commonly used by
   alcohol researchers and government agencies, and whether their
   definitions of standard drinks are related to the sizes of the drinks
   that they pour. The study also examined whether feedback regarding the
   accuracy of their definitions of standard drinks leads students to alter
   their self-reported levels of consumption.
   Methods: Students (N = 133) completed an alcohol survey and performed
   tasks that required them to free-pour a single beer, glass of wine, shot
   of liquor, or the amount of liquor in a mixed drink. Roughly half of the
   students received feedback regarding their definitions of standard
   drinks. All students then were resurveyed about their recent levels of
   consumption.
   Results: With the exception of beer, students incorrectly defined the
   volumes of standard servings of alcohol, overestimating the appropriate
   volumes. They also overestimated appropriate volumes when asked to
   free-pour drinks. Positive relationships existed between students'
   definitions of standard drinks and the sizes of the drinks that they
   free-poured. Feedback regarding misperceptions of standard drink volumes
   led to an increase in levels of self-reported consumption, suggesting
   that students' original estimates of their alcohol consumption were too
   low.
   Conclusions: Despite the recent focus on alcohol education and
   prevention at the college level, college students have not been taught
   how to define standard drinks accurately. They tend to overstate the
   appropriate volumes, leading them to overpour drinks and underreport
   levels of consumption. Self-reported consumption levels are altered by
   feedback regarding the accuracy of students' definitions of standard
   drinks. The findings raise important questions about the validity of
   students' responses on alcohol surveys and the definitions of risky
   drinking that are based them.

   school-readiness. Our research, which involved qualitative interviews,
   ethnographic case studies, and "photovoice" methods, focused on families
   participating in the national evaluation of Early Head Start.
   While valuing academic skills, study parents emphasized the importance
   of social and emotional health in regard to both children's and parents'
   readiness to begin school. These developments are especially critical
   given the challenges parents perceive in local school environments.
   On the basis of a social ecology framework, we argue that psychological
   and environmental dimensions of school-readiness are public health
   matters and that understanding the perspectives of low-income and

AB Background. We recently provided two detailed reviews of sexual risk
   behavior research (1,2) in which we identified methodological
   challenges, reviewed new developments, and made recommendations to guide
   future research. In this issue, Catania et al. provide a commentary on
   our two reviews. Purpose: Clarifications. Method: We carefully reviewed
   the commentary provided by Catania et al. and respond to their critique.
   Results: Catania et al. emphasized three major points in their
   commentary: (a) When assessing sexual risk behavior, categorical
   assessments of unprotected intercourse may be preferable to count data;
   (b) quantification of sexual risk via counts of unprotected intercourse
   does not reflect the complexity of the sexual transmission of HIV; and
   (c) analysis of variance and analysis of covariance options in analyzing
   the effects of randomized HIV risk-reduction trials were overemphasized
   in our review. We address each of these points in turn and clarify the
   three points that were misunderstood. Conclusions: We remain convinced
   that count data of sexual risk behavior are the more useful, versatile,
   and valid indicators of sexual risk reduction in the evaluation of
   sexual risk behavior interventions. We urge interested readers to review
   our original articles, which provide a more detailed account of the
   challenges and opportunities of sexual behavior research.

AB There are few empirical tests of the acoustic mate-guarding hypothesis
   for the function of duetting in birds This hypothesis states that when
   females are fertile, males initiate many songs or answer most of their
   mates' solo songs to form duets and repel rival males seeking extra-pair
   copulations. We tested the hypothesis by comparing song initiation and
   answer rates of males and females in socially monogamous buff-breasted
   wrens (Throthorus leucotis) during pre-fertile and fertile periods.
   During pre-fertile periods, males often sang for short periods before
   being answered by their mates, yet first duets were formed earlier
   relative to dawn and more duets were given during the dawn chorus on
   pre-fertile than fertile mornings. Males initiated more songs during
   pre-fertile than fertile periods, whereas there was no difference
   between stages in female song initiation rates. The proportion of songs
   answered by individuals of both sexes C did not differ between breeding
   stages. Other mate-guarding behaviours, such as frequent copulation and
   maintaining close proximity to mates when fertile, did not appear to be
   important in this species, as no copulations were observed and there was
   no difference in the time pairs spent in close proximity when females
   were fertile or not. Parentage analysis revealed that only 3% of 31
   broods had young that were likely the result of extra-pair paternity.
   These findings do not support the acoustic mate-guarding hypothesis, and
   suggest that the low rate of extra-pair paternity in buff-breasted wrens
   was maintained without the use of acoustic or traditional
   paternity,guards.

AB We tested the hypothesis that social anxiety is associated with both
   interpersonal avoidance and interpersonal dependency. Specifically, we
   predicted that dependence would be evident in developmentally salient
   close relationships upon which socially anxious people may rely. One
   hundred sixty-eight young people undergoing the transition to adulthood
   completed self-report measures of anxiety and interpersonal patterns.
   Results indicated that both dependent and avoidant interpersonal styles
   in romantic relationships, but not other relationships, were uniquely
   associated with social anxiety. These results remained when controlling
   for depressive symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, and trait anxiety. Our
   findings illustrate that social anxiety is not characterized solely by
   interpersonal avoidance as current conceptualizations suggest.
   Implications for models and treatment of social anxiety are discussed.

AB This paper focuses on the ways in which speakers make reference to
   themselves, to one another, and to objects in the everyday settings of
   talk. Drawing on research in linguistic anthropology, sociology, and
   linguistics, it proposes an approach to language based on the concepts
   of communicative practice, deictic field, and socially constituted
   objects of reference. Found in all human languages, deictics are
   expressions like English "this," " that," " here," and " there" whose
   meanings depend strictly on the occasions of their use. This paper
   critically examines current approaches to deixis, proposes an
   alternative framework based on the sociological concept of field, and
   applies this framework to deictic practice in Yucatec Maya. Drawing on
   the work of Buhler, Goffman, and Bourdieu, it adapts the field concept
   to the semiotic structure of deixis. The result is an analysis of
   deictic practice as an emergent construal of socially embedded deictic
   fields involving practical equivalences, counterpart relations among
   objects, and rules of thumb.

AB The selection of social and economic metrics to document baseline
   conditions and analyze the dynamic relationships between ecosystems and
   human communities are important decisions for scientists, managers, and
   watershed citizens. A large variety of social and economic data is
   available but these have limited use without theoretical frameworks. In
   this paper, several frameworks for reviewing social-ecosystem relations
   are offered, namely social sanctions, sense of place, civic structure,
   and cultural differences. Underlying all of these frameworks are
   attitudes, beliefs, values, and norms that affect which questions are
   asked and which indicators are chosen. Much work and significant
   challenges remain in developing a standard set of spatially based

AB This paper highlights the not-so-obvious but compelling reasons why the
   same supportive audiences that can help performers attain their highest
   potential also may increase performers' risk of choking under pressure.
   Drawing primarily from social psychology research and theory, we
   conclude that audience support magnifies performance pressure and
   induces performers to avoid failure rather than seek success during the
   most critical moments of performance contests. Although supportive
   audiences can inspire performers to excel when motivation would
   otherwise be lacking, audiences may also lead performers towards
   maladaptive self-monitoring and overcautiousness when the stakes are
   highest. The increased self-focus that supportive audiences induce can
   disrupt the automatic execution of the skills performers possess.
   Dispositional and situational moderators of the relationship between
   audience support and performance are reviewed.

AB The island of Lauru (Choiseul) in the western Solomon Islands is a high
   (up to 1,060 in) mixed volcanic and limestone uplifted island, located
   between 6.5 degrees and 7.5 degrees S latitude and 156.5 degrees and
   157.5 degrees E longitude. The central part of the island is suggested
   for inclusion in the Pacific-Asia Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA)
   system. The proposed area consists of the north-central coast, Mount
   Barokasa (850 m), Mount Maetabe (1,060 m), and the primary watershed
   systems that drain these mountains and the central plateau between them.
   Some of the concerns and expectations of traditional land owners and the
   Solomon Islands government are considered. These play important roles in
   any research activity and will be central to the success or failure of
   the project. The Solomon Islands, Lauru, and the specific study area are
   briefly described with synopses of previous research and current,
   preliminary research activities. Preliminary species checklists are
   given for plants and vertebrates in the area. Initially we propose to
   establish two transects, each passing through two biomes suitable for
   comparisons with similar biomes in other PABITRA sites: the tropical
   montane cloud forest of Mount Maetabe (the highest point in the Island),
   and the lowland rain forests, between 200 and 500 in in elevation to the
   southwest of Susuka at the base of Mount Barokasa. The two proposed
   transects will stretch through two different watersheds, one of which
   has had traditional agriculture practiced in the coastal strand area and
   the other of which has bad traditional agriculture practiced in the
   lowland forest of midelevations. A research agenda is proposed that will
   help achieve key objectives of developing local research capacity and
   internal biodiversity management systems while conserving traditional
   knowledge.

AB Objective. Despite studies indicating that a significant proportion of
   adolescents are having oral sex, the focus of most empirical studies and
   intervention efforts concerning adolescent sexuality have focused on
   vaginal intercourse. This narrow focus has created a void in our
   understanding of adolescents' perceptions of oral sex. This study is the
   first to investigate adolescents' perceptions of the health, social, and
   emotional consequences associated with having oral sex as compared with
   vaginal sex, as well as whether adolescents view oral sex as more
   acceptable and more prevalent than vaginal sex.
   Methods. Participants were 580 ethnically diverse ninth-grade
   adolescents ( mean age: 14.54; 58% female) who participated in a
   longitudinal study on the relationship between risk and benefit
   perceptions and sexual activity. Participants completed a
   self-administered questionnaire that inquired about their sexual
   experiences and percent chance of experiencing outcomes from, attitudes
   toward, and perceived prevalence of oral versus vaginal sex among
   adolescents.
   Results. More study participants reported having had oral sex (19.6%)
   than vaginal sex (13.5%), and more participants intended to have oral
   sex in the next 6 months (31.5%) than vaginal sex (26.3%). Adolescents
   evaluated oral sex as significantly less risky than vaginal sex on
   health, social, and emotional consequences. Adolescents also believed
   that oral sex is more acceptable than vaginal sex for adolescents their
   own age in both dating and nondating situations, oral sex is less of a
   threat to their values and beliefs, and more of their peers will have
   oral sex than vaginal sex in the near future.
   Conclusions. Given that adolescents perceive oral sex as less risky,
   more prevalent, and more acceptable than vaginal sex, it stands to
   reason that adolescents are more likely to engage in oral sex. It is
   important that health care providers and others who work with youths
   recognize adolescents' views about oral sex and broaden their clinical
   preventive services to include screening, counseling, and education
   about oral sex.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine racial bias in

   Methods: Obstetrical patients referred for genetic counseling at a
   community hospital were included. Self-reported patient race/ethnicity
   were compared with obstetrician's race/ethnicity.
   Results: The patient population (n = 1,519) was 27.8% white, 25%
   Hispanic, 22.5% black, 20.5% Asian, and 4.3% other. Physician
   race/ethnicity was 47.8% white, 28.8% Asian, 14.4% Hispanic, and 9%
   black. Patient race/ethnicity and physician race/ethnicity were
   correlated (contingency coefficient = 0.54, P < 0.001). White and Asian
   patients were more likely to select obstetricians of their own racial
   background (72.7% and 66.6%) than were Hispanic or black patients (36%
   and 24.6%, P < 0.001). Patients of all races were more likely to be
   under the care of a physician of their own race than of a different
   race.
   Conclusions: In an urban community with a racially diverse population,
   there is a strong racial bias in patient selection of an obstetrician.

AB Objectives. We examined availability and food options at restaurants in
   less affluent (target area) and more affluent (comparison area) areas of
   Los Angeles County to compare residents' access to healthy meals
   prepared and purchased away from home. We also considered environmental
   prompts that encourage the purchase of various foods.Methods. We
   designed an instrument to assess the availability, quality, and
   preparation of food in restaurants. We also assessed advertisements and
   promotions, cleanliness, and service for each restaurant. We assessed
   659 restaurants: 348 in the target area and 311 in the comparison
   area.Results. The nutritional resource environment in our target area
   makes it challenging for residents to eat healthy away from home. Poorer
   neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African American residents
   have fewer healthy options available, both in food selections and in
   food preparation; restaurants in these neighborhoods heavily promote
   unhealthy food options to residents.Conclusions. Environment is
   important in understanding health status: support for the healthy
   lifestyle associated with lower risks for disease is difficult in poorer
   communities with a higher proportion of African American residents.

AB Objective: Few emergency department (ED) studies have described the
   relationship between family violence and subsequent intimate partner
   violence (IPV) or accounted for partner alcohol use in IPV
   victimization. This study sought to identify family history and
   substance-use factors associated with IPV among women presenting to an
   urban emergency department.
   Methods: Case-control study in which cases (women identified as having
   IPV concerns and an IPV history) and controls (women without IPV) were
   frequency-matched by age group and race/ethnicity. Logistic regression
   was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ADR) for any IPV,
   physical IPV, and sexual IPV.
   Results: The sample included 182 cases and 147 controls. Living with a
   partner (not married) and witnessing parental violence were independent
   risk factors for any IPV (AOR 2.55 and AOR 2.21, respectively).
   Partner's alcohol use (AOR 1.22 for every five drinks consumed per week)
   and heavier drinking (AOR 5.07) were also significant risk factors, but
   not subject's substance-use. The pattern of risk factors varied only
   slightly for physical IPV and sexual IPV.
   Conclusion: This study suggests a substantial relationship between
   partner alcohol use and IPV among women beyond the woman's substance use
   and confirms previous reports regarding the cycle of violence in women's
   lives. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   substance abusers sought to clarify the relationship between lifetime
   physical and/or sexual abuse and addiction treatment outcome to help
   address the specific needs of this population. To achieve this goal,
   baseline characteristics, no-show for treatment status, post-treatment
   clinical outcomes, and treatment history were studied for subjects with
   lifetime history of abuse (47.3%) versus without. Abused subjects,
   predominantly women, were significantly more impaired at baseline on
   clinical dimensions including family/social severity and psychiatric
   severity as measured by the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), and general
   level of functioning. The two groups endorsed different drugs as
   primary, with the abused group less frequently endorsing heroin and
   cocaine in favor of alcohol and polydrug use. Abused subjects reported
   more prior medical and psychiatric treatments. Abuse history was not a
   predictor of no-show for treatment. Over the 1-year follow-up, lifetime
   physical and/or sexual abuse was significantly associated with worse
   psychiatric status and more psychiatric hospitalizations and outpatient
   treatment despite receiving similar intensive addiction treatment. (c)

   have examined the role of impulsivity in these events. The present
   investigation sought to establish a link between negative life
   experiences and a trait measure of impulsivity and demonstrate that this
   association remains even accounting for potential confounds.
   Participants were 330 heroin and cocaine users recruited from the
   community for a health service research study. Participants completed a
   structured interview that assessed topics including drug and alcohol
   use, impulsivity, and negative life events. This group of drug users
   reported high rates of adverse life events in the 6 months prior to the
   assessment. No specific substance abuse/dependence diagnosis or
   combination of diagnoses was associated with adversity. Number of
   substance-related diagnoses was associated with adverse life events, but
   not when adjusting for impulsivity. Experience of these events was
   significantly associated with impulsivity (p <.00 1), above and beyond
   the shared relation with demographic variables, substance abuse and
   dependence, and number of substance-related diagnoses. These findings
   document the high frequencies of recent adverse life events among
   illicit drug users and indicate that trait impulsivity is associated

   status is a risk factor for poor nutritional status and growth
   performance among a cohort of young Tanzanian children. Using data
   collected from both wet and dry season periods, we tested for an
   association from both cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives.
   Despite relatively high nutritional status compared to other
   agropastoralists and horticultural populations, as well as the presence
   of various socioecological factors that were expected to mitigate any
   "costs" to polygynous marriage, we found that among our target
   population, polygynous marital status is a risk factor for poor growth
   performance. This association is most pronounced in the wet season, and
   maintains even after allowing for the potential influences of child age
   and sex, and household characteristics. These results counter our
   original expectation, and suggest that polygyny is costly to children in
   this population; this does not appear to be the result of difference in
   early child environment or household wealth.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the spatial accessibility of large "chain"
   supermarkets in relation to neighborhood racial composition and poverty.
   Methods. We used a geographic information system to measure Manhattan
   block distance to the nearest supermarket for 869 neighborhoods (census
   tracts) in metropolitan Detroit. We constructed moving average spatial
   regression models to adjust for spatial autocorrelation and to test for
   the effect of modification of percentage African American and percentage
   poor on distance to the nearest supermarket.
   Results. Distance to the nearest supermarket was similar among the least
   impoverished neighborhoods, regardless of racial composition. Among the
   most impoverished neighborhoods, however, neighborhoods in which African
   Americans resided were, on average, 1.1 miles further from the nearest
   supermarket than were White neighborhoods.
   Conclusions. Racial residential segregation disproportionately places
   African Americans in more-impoverished neighborhoods in Detroit and
   consequently reduces access to supermarkets. However, supermarkets have
   opened or remained open close to middle-income neighborhoods that have
   transitioned from White to African American. Development of economically
   disadvantaged African American neighborhoods is critical to effectively
   prevent diet-related diseases among this population.

AB Study objective: To examine associations between social capital and
   individual risk for alcohol abuse and harms and identify protective
   effect mechanisms.
   Design: Multilevel multivariate analysis with individual level data from
   a national panel survey of drinking and a contextual measure of social
   capital reflecting college mean aggregate reports of student
   volunteerism. Outcomes include heavy episodic (binge) drinking, frequent
   drinking, frequent drunkenness, diagnosable alcohol abuse, intentional
   drunkenness, acquisition of binge drinking, harms, secondhand effects
   from others' drinking.
   Setting: United States, 119 four year colleges.
   Participants: Representative samples of youth ages 18 - 24 surveyed in
   1997 and 1999 using an anonymous mailed questionnaire ( total n = 27
   687).
   Main results: Students from colleges with higher levels of social
   capital reported reduced risks for binge drinking ( adjusted OR 0.38,
   95% CI 0.20 to 0.69, p = 0.002), frequent drunkenness ( adjusted OR
   0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.98, p = 0.04), acquisition of binge drinking in
   college ( adjusted OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.95, p = 0.03), and alcohol
   abuse ( adjusted OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.91, p = 0.02) in multilevel
   multivariate analyses that controlled for individual volunteering, the
   measure on which social capital was based. Higher levels of social
   capital protected against multiple drinking related harms ( adjusted OR
   0.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.90, p = 0.02) and secondhand drinking effects (
   adjusted OR, 0.30, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.58, p = 0.0003). Significant cross
   level interactions exist between fraternity/sorority membership and
   social capital for measures of risky drinking. Harm reduction primarily
   reflects consumption modification.
   Conclusions: Social capital exerts strong protective effects on alcohol
   abuse and harm in college including among high risk students.

AB Study objective: To investigate the relation between neighbourhood
   socioeconomic and ethnic characteristics with depressive symptoms in a
   population based sample.
   Design: Cross sectional data from the CARDIA study, including the Center
   for Epidemiological Studies depression scale score (CES-D).
   Neighbourhoods were 1990 US census blocks of 1000 people; six census
   variables reflecting wealth/income, education, and occupation
   investigated separately and as a summary score; neighbourhood racial
   composition (percentage white and black) and individual level income and
   education were also examined.
   Setting: Participants recruited in 1985/86 from community lists in
   Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis MN; from a health plan in
   Oakland, CA.
   Participants: 3437 adults aged 28 - 40 years in 1995/96: 24% white men,
   27% white women, 20% black men, 29% black women.
   Main results: For each race-sex group, CES-D was inversely related to
   neighbourhood score and individual income and education. Associations of
   neighbourhood score with CES-D became weak and inconsistent after
   adjusting for individual level factors; personal income remained
   strongly and inversely associated with CES-D. Age adjusted mean
   differences (standard errors) in CES-D between the lowest and highest
   income categories were 3.41 (0.62) for white men, 4.57 (0.64) for white
   women, 5.80 (0.87) for black men, and 5.74 (0.83) for black women. For
   both black and white participants, CES-D was associated negatively with
   percentage of white people and positively with percentage of black
   people in their census block, before, but not after, adjustment for
   individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic variables.
   Conclusions: Neither neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics nor
   ethnic density were consistently related to depressive symptoms once
   individual socioeconomic characteristics were taken into account.

AB Aims To examine how membership in fraternities and sororities relates to
   the prevalence and patterns of substance use in a national sample of
   full-time US college students.
   Design Nationally representative probability samples of US high school
   seniors (modal age 18 years) were followed longitudinally across two
   follow-up waves during college (modal ages 19/20 and 21/22).
   Setting Data were collected via self-administered questionnaires from US
   high school seniors and college students.
   Participants The longitudinal sample consisted of 10 cohorts (senior
   years of 1988-97) made up of 5883 full-time undergraduate students, of
   whom 58% were women and 17% were active members of fraternities or
   sororities.
   Findings Active members of fraternities and sororities had higher levels
   of heavy episodic drinking, annual marijuana use and current cigarette
   smoking than non-members at all three waves. Although members of
   fraternities reported higher levels than non-members of annual illicit
   drug use other than marijuana, no such differences existed between
   sorority members and non-members. Heavy episodic drinking and annual
   marijuana use increased significantly with age among members of
   fraternities or sororities relative to non-members, but there were no
   such differential changes for current cigarette use or annual illicit
   drug use other than marijuana.
   Conclusions The present study provides strong evidence that higher rates
   of substance use among US college students who join fraternities and
   sororities predate their college attendance, and that membership in a
   fraternity or sorority is associated with considerably greater than
   average increases in heavy episodic drinking and annual marijuana use
   during college. These findings have important implications for
   prevention and intervention efforts aimed toward college students,
   especially members of fraternities and sororities.

AB Objectives. We examined availability and food options at restaurants in
   less affluent (target area) and more affluent (comparison area) areas of
   Los Angeles County to compare residents' access to healthy meals
   prepared and purchased away from home. We also considered environmental
   prompts that encourage the purchase of various foods.
   Methods. We designed an instrument to assess the availability, quality,
   and preparation of food in restaurants. We also assessed advertisements
   and promotions, cleanliness, and service for each restaurant. We
   assessed 659 restaurants: 348 in the target area and 311 in the
   comparison area.
   Results. The nutritional resource environment in our target area makes
   it challenging for residents to eat healthy away from home. Poorer
   neighborhoods with a higher proportion of African American residents
   have fewer healthy options available, both in food selections and in
   food preparation; restaurants in these neighborhoods heavily promote
   unhealthy food options to residents.
   Conclusions. Environment is important in understanding health status:
   support for the healthy lifestyle associated with lower risks for
   disease is difficult in poorer communities with a higher proportion of
   African American residents.

AB Ever since Maurice Halbwachs's pioneering work, most scholars have been
   content to explore collective memory through texts and commemorative
   symbolism. Assuming that a study of collective memory has fuller meaning
   when it takes into account what ordinary people think about the past, we
   compare historians' and commemorative agents' representations of Abraham
   Lincoln to what four national samples of Americans believe about him.
   Five primary images-Savior of the Union, Great Emancipator, Man of the
   People, First (Frontier) American, and Self-Made Man-are prominent in
   the cumulative body of Lincoln representations, but recent surveys show
   that only one of these images, the Great Emancipator, is dominant within
   the public. Lincoln one-dimensional Emancipator image, which differs
   from the multi-dimensional one evident in a 1945 sample, reflects new
   perceptions of the Civil War shaped by late twentieth-century minority
   rights movements. Thus, "bringing men [and women] back in" involves
   survey evidence being added to historiographic and commemoration
   analysis to clarify one of sociology most ambiguous concepts, collective
   memory, and to explore its social and generational roots.

PD APR 2005
PY 2005
AB Since Durkheim pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been
   suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of
   researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a
   minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased.
   Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question
   the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From
   the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide
   accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators.
   Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to
   underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires
   positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not
   challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives.
   Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging
   of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and
   close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same
   professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in
   suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by
   determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma
   of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting
   have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article
   contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how
   a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism
   from outside parties.

AB When and how will third parties intervene in the conflicts of others?
   When will third parties further violence, and when will they foster
   peace? These are questions addressed by Black theory of the third party.
   The authors conducted the first systematic test of the theory, drawing
   on quantitative and qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 100
   men imprisoned for assault or homicide. Specifically, they tested
   Cooney's elaboration of Black theory, which argues (1) that the social
   location of a third party, based on ties to the principals, predicts
   whether he or she will act as a partisan or settlement agent or remain
   uninvolved, and (2) that the third-party structure of a conflict, based
   on the general configuration of all the third parties present, predicts
   whether the conflict will escalate to violence. The study results
   confirm most of the theoretical predictions regarding both third-party
   behavior and violence. The discussion also extends the theoretical
   model, offering new concepts and suggesting how the theory can be
   applied to a range of subjects, such as international war and the
   long-term historical decline of interpersonal violence.

AB The Sociosexual Orientation Inventory (SOI; Simpson & Gangestad 1991) is
   a self-report measure of individual differences in human mating
   strategies. Low SOI scores signify that a person is sociosexually
   restricted, or follows a more monogamous mating strategy. High SOI
   scores indicate that an individual is unrestricted, or has a more
   promiscuous mating strategy. As part of the International Sexuality
   Description Project (ISDP), the SOI was translated from English into 25
   additional languages and administered to a total sample of 14,059 people
   across 48 nations. Responses to the SOI were used to address four main
   issues. First, the psychometric properties of the SOI were examined in
   cross-cultural perspective. The SOI possessed adequate reliability and
   validity both within and across a diverse range of modern cultures.
   Second, theories concerning the systematic distribution of
   sociosexuality across cultures were evaluated. Both operational sex
   ratios and reproductively demanding environments related in
   evolutionary-predicted ways to national levels of sociosexuality. Third,
   sex differences in sociosexuality were generally large and demonstrated
   cross-cultural universality across the 48 nations of the ISDP,
   confirming several evolutionary theories of human mating. Fourth, sex
   differences in sociosexuality were significantly larger when
   reproductive environments were demanding but were reduced to more
   moderate levels in cultures with more political and economic gender
   equality. Implications for evolutionary and social role theories of
   human sexuality are discussed.

AB Signaling theory provides an opportunity to integrate an interactive
   theory of symbolic communication and social benefit with materialist
   theories of individual strategic action and adaptation. This article
   examines the potential explanatory value of signaling theory for a
   variety of anthropological topics, focusing on three social arenas in
   which signaling might plausibly be important: unconditional generosity,
   "wasteful" subsistence behavior, and artistic or craft traditions. In
   each case, it outlines the ways in which the phenomena correspond with
   the expectations of signaling theory by showing how a given pattern of
   action might signal particular hidden attributes, provide benefits to
   both signaler and observers, and meet the conditions for honest
   communication. The ethnographic evidence suggests that the fundamental
   conditions for reliable signaling of condition-dependent qualities may
   exist in many social domains. It appears that signaling theory has
   considerable promise for generating novel and powerful insights into the
   ethnographic realm.

   transition from around 6 children per woman in the early 1960s to around
   1.7 children per woman in the year of 2001. This transition has resulted
   in a remarkable occurrence regarding the differential numbers of boys
   and girls born. In every year beginning in 19 78 to the year of 2001,
   more Chinese boys have been born than Chinese girls. This has important
   implications for China's marriage markets starting in the first, decade
   of this new century. We estimate that there will be more than 23 million
   boys already born in China who will not be able to find Chinese brides.
   Our paper considers the cause of this demographic shift, namely, China's
   dramatic fertility transition. We then describe the gender imbalances
   and discuss their implications for China's marriage market.

AB An aging American population may be less willing than a younger
   population to install and remove a live, fresh-cut evergreen tree in
   their home for Christmas celebrations. An alternative to using
   traditional, large, fresh-cut or potted Christmas trees could be forcing
   these evergreen species in a small (approximate to1-L) container that
   could be displayed on a tabletop. We initiated this study to determine
   consumer preferences and marketability for six evergreen tree species
   produced for tabletop display and used three decoration themes and three
   price points. We constructed a web-based survey in which 331
   participants were compensated with a $5 e-coupon for viewing 27
   photographs of tabletop trees and providing preference and use
   information. The conjoint model accounted for 91.2% of the variance and
   showed that consumers valued tree species as the most important
   attribute (61% of the tree value), with decoration color/theme the
   second most important feature (27%) and, last, price (12%). Black Hills
   spruce (Picea glauca var. densata (Moench) Voss) was the most preferred
   species overall, and red was the most preferred decoration theme.
   Logically, the lowest price point was the most preferred. However, price
   was the most important attribute for participants younger than 25 years.
   The importance of price decreased as participant age increased until age
   60, when price became a more important component. With a cost of
   production of $5.45 and decoration and shipping estimated at an
   additional $4.00, the product could be a profit generator priced at any
   of the tested price points ($14.95 and above).

   no systematic study of the relationship between broader forms of
   subjective citizenship such as those of interest to institutional
   theorists, and the patterns of cultural taste and consumption of concern
   to sociologists of culture. In order to fill this gap, I analyze the
   relationship between three different forms of subjective citizenship,
   national (Spain), international (European community) and postnational
   (world community), and the propensity to display omnivorous patterns of
   cultural choice and to draw symbolic boundaries through the expression
   of cultural dislikes. If both world citizenship and the turn toward
   inclusive forms of cultural taste and consumption emanate from the same
   global cultural logic, there should be a positive relationship between
   patterns of geographic identification most closely connected to the
   world polity and cultural omnivorousness, and a negative association
   between world polity identification and taste exclusiveness. Regression
   results support this view: in relation to subnational forms of
   subjective citizenship, only postnational identification is positively
   related to both broad consumption and less exclusive taste. (c) 2005

AB While there have been many studies of knowledge production in the
   natural sciences, there have been relatively few of the social sciences
   and almost none of the humanities. In this study I examine
   stratification in knowledge production in a largely American
   interdisciplinary humanities debate called bioethics, focusing on the
   issue of the ethics of human genetic engineering. Using a type of
   content analysis data from 1604 texts, and controlling for the "quality"
   of these texts, I find that prestigious authors have more influence on
   the content of the debate because the participants in the debate must
   build upon the texts of the prestigious authors to legitimate their own
   work. This legitimation mechanism creates a path of influence for the
   prestigious authors independent of the quality or amount of their work.
   I conclude with a discussion of the features of this particular debate,
   which may create this form of stratification. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

AB In the late 20th century, sociology's interest in social phenomena
   related to human life was extended to "the body"-meaning the human body.
   Scholars in the sociology of science have suggested that new
   technologies are drawing its to theorize "bodies" in ways other than
   simply the human. This piece of experimental writing explores an
   expanded treatment of social bodies, beyond the level of the human
   organism, through the movement and transformation of bodies at the
   cellular/muscular level. Influenced by the writing of Patricia Clough
   and based on a reading of the treatment of affects in Deleuzian
   philosophy, this writing is about the crossing of bodymind/mindbody in
   the process of physical training. It takes up the work done with a
   personal trainer over time, exploring the affects and sensations of
   movement in a way that complicates the relations of agency, power, and
   culture as they come to mingle in a human body-becoming-runner.

AB Large wildfires that burn through the " forest - residential intermix''
   are complex events with a variety of social impacts. This study looks at
   three northern Arizona community clusters directly affected by the 2002
   Rodeo - Chediski fire. Our analysis suggests that the fire event led to
   both the emergence of cohesion and conflict in the study area. Community
   cohesion was evident as residents " pulled together'' to rebuild their
   communities. Examples of cohesion included managers of local businesses
   staying during evacuation to provide for the needs of firefighters,
   providing shelter and cleanup help for burned- out neighbors, and the
   emergence of locally based assistance groups. Several types of conflict
   rooted in blaming and distribution of firefighting and disaster
   assistance resources were found: cultural, local versus federal,
   community versus community, intracommunity, and environmental. We
   suggest that these responses are most usefully understood using the
   lenses of social psychology ( attribution theory) together with
   sociology ( structuration theory). Issues and dynamics that resulted in
   controversy or were seen as locally constraining and those that resulted
   in cohesion tended to relate to specific local impacts and how outsider
   actions were either consonant or dissonant with the application of local
   knowledge, local autonomy, and locally desirable outcomes.

AB Based upon analyses of interview data collected from twenty-six
   clinician respondents, this study explores two facets of clinician
   uncertainty related to the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit
   hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. First, this study explores
   clinician reservations about the diagnostic validity of ADHD as it is
   described by the American Psychiatric Association (1994) in DSM IV.
   Second, this study explores clinician ambivalence regarding the physical
   and social-psychological side-effects of stimulant medications, such as
   Ritalin. In applying the sociological discussions that address
   uncertainty in clinical settings and through reviewing a sizable
   cross-section of the popular and research-oriented literature
   demonstrating the contentious nature of the ADHD phenomenon, this study
   illustrates that clinicians do not practice within a vacuum, but are
   instead largely affected by the marked scepticism that surrounds ADHD.
   In being affected by this scepticism, it is concluded that clinicians
   who assess and treat ADHD are autonomous in how they interpret the
   diagnostic and treatment protocols for this mental disorder.

AB Over the past several years, scholars of teaching and learning have
   demonstrated the potential of collaborative learning strategies for
   improving student learning. This paper examines the use of
   computer-mediated communication to promote collaborative student
   learning in large introductory sociology courses. Specifically, we
   summarize a project we conducted during the 20002001 academic year in
   which we added online collaborative learning activities to the
   curriculum of two large sections of introductory sociology. Drawing on
   Novak et al.'s (1999) Just-In-Time Teaching methods, we developed online
   activities to help prepare students for subsequent in-class work and to
   cultivate a sense of group solidarity among smaller teams within the
   larger class. The results suggest that student engagement in the online
   group learning activities was strongly predictive of better student
   academic achievement on the biweekly quizzes, cumulative final exam, and
   course paper. These findings highlight the potential value of online
   group work for fostering collaborative learning environments in large
   lecture courses as well as for enhancing student learning.

   On average, the texts cite four works by influential environmental
   sociologists. The texts, however, omitted some of the most central,
   unique concepts in the field, The texts typically treated environmental
   issues as social problems rather than as the by-products of

AB The importance of preparing students for citizenship in a global society
   is well recognized in teaching sociology. Although options have emerged
   to facilitate such pedagogical experiences, few concentrate on
   maximizing students' experiences in non-English-speaking nations. How
   can we help sociology students get the most out of an experience in a
   foreign language society if they do not speak the language? I propose a
   critical pedagogical approach to travel-study abroad by presenting a
   case study of a unique three-week intensive class taught in Cusco, Peru.
   Following Kaufman's (2002) four-point model of critical pedagogy, I
   recommend that understanding, reflecting, analyzing, and engaging in
   social action can help structure the application of critical pedagogy to
   travel-study abroad in sociology. My research suggests benefits of such
   an approach, including working with a native educational institution,
   pairing sociology and Spanish students, and using home-stay families as
   informal teachers. I conclude by offering suggestions for faculty
   interested in creating a travel-study abroad course, to a developing
   nation in particular.

AB BACKGROUND. Employment and work-related disability were investigated in
   a cohort of adult cancer survivors who were working when they were
   diagnosed from 1997 to 1999 with a variety of cancers. Employment from
   the time of diagnosis through the early years of survivorship was
   studied, self-reported effects of cancer survival on disability and
   employment were quantified, and risk factors associated with
   cancer-related disability and withdrawal from employment were
   identified. METHODS. One thousand four hundred thirty-three cancer
   survivors were interviewed by telephone from I year to nearly 5 years
   after diagnosis. They were asked retrospectively about employment from
   the time of diagnosis to follow-up and about work-related disability at
   follow-up. They also were asked whether disabilities or reasons for
   quitting work were cancer-related. Return to work and quitting work were
   projected over time in a life-table analysis. Risk factors were
   identified from logit analyses. RESULTS. One of five survivors reported
   cancer-related disabilities at follow-up. Half of those with
   disabilities were working. A projected 13% of all survivors had quit
   working for cancer-related reasons within 4 years of diagnosis. More
   than half of survivors quit working after the first year, when
   three-quarters of those who stopped for treatment returned to work.
   Survivors of central nervous system, head and neck, and Stage IV blood
   and lymph malignancies had the highest adjusted risk of disability or
   quitting work. CONCLUSIONS. Cancer survival sometimes has long-term
   effects on employment and the ability to work. Employment outcomes can
   be improved with innovations in treatment and with clinical and
   supportive services aimed at better management of symptoms,
   rehabilitation, and accommodation of disabilities. Cancer 2005;103:

AB Study Design. This is a cross-national comparison of workers'
   compensation claims for back pain in Japan and the United States ( US).
   Objectives. The main objective is to juxtapose rates of back pain claims
   in Japan and Washington state. Because the Washington state rate closely
   matches rates for other US states as well as the rate for the US as a
   whole, it is used to represent the US rate. A puzzle is to be framed:
   Why are back pain claim rates in Japan and the United States so
   disparate?
   Summary of Background Data. Occupational back pain is common among
   workers in both Japan and the United States. Wage compensation for time
   off work is also substantial in both countries and potentially induces
   time off work at least as much in Japan as in the United States.
   Accordingly, back pain claim rates in Japan seemingly would be on the
   same order of magnitude as rates in the United States.
   Methods. Washington state rates are based on data from its state fund.
   Both Japan and Washington state rates are composed of the number of
   workers eligible to file worker compensation claims in a given year (
   denominator) and the number of back pain claims accepted during that
   year ( numerator). Because rates may fluctuate from year-to-year, 5
   years of data on rates are presented, 1995 - 1999. Central to the
   comparison are Japanese and Washington state rates of workers'
   compensation claims for back pain with more than 3 days compensated time
   loss from work.
   Results. The back pain claim rate in 1999 was 60 times higher in
   Washington state than in Japan. The disparity in rates for the other
   years in the study ( 1995 - 1998) was similar.
   Conclusion. Back pain is common among workers both in Japan and the
   United States, but there is no simple or necessary relationship between
   that symptom and how it manifests itself in one country or another.
   Rather, the symptom is protean in its social manifestations. As for what
   shapes those manifestations - or, more specifically, what causes the
   startling disparity in back pain claim rates between Japan and the
   United States - that is a puzzle. Various solutions to the puzzle are
   discussed, but it remains essentially unsolved.

AB Background: The authors describe and compare drinking patterns among
   malt liquor beer (MLB), regular beer (RB), and hard liquor (HL) drinkers
   in a low-income, racial/ethnic minority community.
   Methods: Drinkers were recruited from randomly selected alcohol outlets
   in South Los Angeles. Respondents were assessed on sociodemographic
   characteristics, alcohol use history, drinking patterns, and drinking
   context among other items in a face-to-face interview with research
   staff.
   Results: Three hundred twenty-nine drinkers were interviewed, of whom
   297 reported drinking MLB, RB, or HL brands of alcohol most often in the
   past 90 days. This subsample was 88% African-American, 72% male, and 35%
   unemployed. As compared with RB and HL drinkers, MLB drinkers were more
   likely to be homeless, to receive public assistance for housing, and to
   be unemployed. MLB drinkers also reported significantly higher rates of
   daily or near-daily drinking (74%, as compared with 48% for RB and 29%
   for HL) of drinks per day on drinking days (5.2, as compared with 4.2
   for RB and 3.1 for HL), and daily average ethanol consumption (6.97 oz,
   as compared with 2.13 oz for RB drinkers and 6.13 oz for HL drinkers).
   In multinomial regression analysis that controlled for potential
   confounders, the odds of preferring RB as compared with MLB were
   significantly increased among persons with blue-collar occupations and
   those who reported drinking in public settings and were reduced among
   persons who drank outdoors, those who combined drinking with tobacco
   smoking, and those who drank alcohol with members of the same sex.
   Average daily ethanol consumption odds were reduced for RB drinkers as
   compared with MLB drinkers. The odds of preferring HL as compared with
   MLB were significantly increased for persons with white-collar
   occupations and those who drank in public settings and were reduced for
   persons who drank outdoors and those who combined drinking and smoking.
   Conclusion: The authors observed substantial differences in
   sociodemographic characteristics, drinking patterns, and ethanol
   consumption by beverage type in this community sample. MLB drinkers seem
   to have distinctive drinking patterns that require additional study to
   determine whether this pattern is associated with increased individual
   or community risk.

AB Objectives. In early 2000, the American Legacy Foundation launched the
   national "truth" campaign, the first national antismoking campaign to
   discourage tobacco use among youths. We studied the impact of the
   campaign on national smoking rates among US youths (students in grades
   8, 10, and 12).
   Methods. We used data from the Monitoring the Future survey in a
   pre/post quasi-experimental design to relate trends in youth smoking
   prevalence to varied doses of the "truth" campaign in a national sample
   of approximately 50000 students in grades 8, 10, and 12, surveyed each
   spring from 1997 through 2002.
   Results. Findings indicate that the campaign accounted for a significant
   portion of the recent decline in youth smoking prevalence. We found that
   smoking prevalence among all students declined from 25.3% to 18.0%
   between 1999 and 2002 and that the campaign accounted for approximately
   22% of this decline.
   Conclusions. This study showed that the campaign was associated with
   substantial declines in youth smoking and has accelerated recent
   declines in youth smoking prevalence.

   Methods. We analyzed binge drinking rates from 2 national surveys, the
   Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study and the Centers

   System. Binge drinking data were linked to a summary measure of 7
   salient alcohol control policies and a rating of resources devoted to

   Results. State-level college and adult binge drinking rates were
   strongly correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.43; P <.01).
   Attending college in states. with the lowest binge drinking rates
   (adjusted odds ratio [OR]=0.63; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.41, 0.97)
   and presence of more stringent alcohol control policies (adjusted
   OR=0.57; 95% CI=0.33, 0.97) were independent predictors of student binge
   drinking, after adjusting for state law enforcement and individual-,
   college-, and state-level covariates.
   Conclusions. State of residence is a predictor of binge drinking by
   college students. State-level alcohol control policies may help reduce
   binge drinking among college students and in the general population.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the context of iron deficiency
   and feeding patterns of iron-rich foods among northern Kenyan
   school-aged children. A nutrition survey was conducted among 300
   subjects in two Rendille communities, Korr and Karare. The objectives
   were to determine the prevalence of iron deficiency as it relates to
   parasitic infection, dietary intake, and sociodemographic factors, as
   well as cultural food proscriptions influencing child feeding.
   Sociodemographic and qualitative data on food beliefs and child-feeding
   practices were obtained from the primary caretaker of each subject. From
   pediatric subjects, 24-hour dietary recall data were obtained with the
   help of the primary caretaker, and capillary blood from a fingerstick
   was used to detect iron deficiency based on measures of hemoglobin, the
   zinc protoporphyrin-to-heme ratio, C-reactive protein, and transferrin
   receptor. With an overall prevalence of 31.2%, iron deficiency was found
   to be associated with dietary iron intakes constrained by diverse
   economic, cultural, and environmental factors among Rendille children.
   In Karare, where children's iron intake approached recommended levels,
   iron deficiency was found to be attributable to low bioavailability of
   iron (only 4.3% of total iron intake), rather than low dietary intake
   per se. By contrast, in Korr the average daily iron intake was estimated
   at only 65% of recommended allowances, indicating that iron deficiency
   was the outcome not merely Of low bioavailability, but rather of overall
   inadequate iron intake. Sociodemographic analysis showed a significant
   interaction between sex and economic status, revealing that girls in
   economically sufficient households were 2.4 times as likely to have iron
   deficiency as boys. This difference in risk parallels culturally defined
   gender-based proscriptions for child feeding. girls are believed to
   benefit from "soft foods," including rice, maize porridge, and tea,
   whereas boys benefit from "hard foods," including meat, blood, and
   beans. Consequently, in households economically able to purchase
   iron-rich foods, these foods are being preferentially fed to boys.
   Economic development may result in improved iron status for boys, but it
   will be unlikely to benefit girls in the absence of a dietary
   modification intervention. A modification of culturally acceptable "soft
   foods" to include iron-rich foods may provide a sustainable approach to
   controlling and preventing iron deficiency in this population.

   at the second time period. Conversely, parents showed more tolerance for
   boys' mild physical aggression at Time 2, suggesting that this
   socialisation message may play a role in boys' greater use of physical
   aggression both at home and with peers.

AB Little prior research has examined children's interpersonal perceptions
   of peers from a social relations model framework. This study examines
   the degree of actor and partner variances, as well as generalised and
   dyadic reciprocities, in a sample of 351 sixth graders' peer nominations
   of different forms and functions of aggression and aspects of social
   status. Gender differences in these nominations are also explored.
   Results indicate significant actor and partner variances for all
   measures, and generalised reciprocity in social status perceptions.
   Clear gender differences were noted in rates of nominations, such that
   more same-sex than cross-sex nominations were generally given for both
   positive and negative aspects; however, we found mixed evidence of
   gender differences in the variance partitioning and reciprocity
   correlation estimates.

AB This study of 282 dyads examines early- and mid-adolescents' perceptions
   of friendship quality and their association with daily disagreements,
   self- and mother reports of behaviour problems, and school grades. Actor
   and partner analyses identify unique associations between perceptions of
   friendship quality and perceptions of daily conflict. Actor effects
   reveal links between friendship negativity and self- perceptions of
   conflict affective intensity, relationship impact, post-conflict
   interaction, and post-conflict separation, and between friendship
   positivity and self- perceptions of relationship impact. Partner effects
   reveal links between friendship negativity and partner perceptions of
   conflict outcomes. Perceptions of relationship quality were also
   associated with self- and mother reports of behaviour problems and with
   school grades, such that individual and dyadic views of friendship
   negativity were linked to detrimental outcomes. The worst outcomes
   tended to be reserved for dyads in which one or both friends reported
   high levels of relationship negativity.

   Days of moderate and vigorous physical activity were assessed using a
   previously validated one-day recall instrument administered on seven
   consecutive days. The SCT variables tested were: self-regulation, social
   situation, social outcome expectations, physical appearance outcome
   expectations, general health outcome expectations, negative outcome
   expectations, self-efficacy for ability, and self-efficacy for barriers.
   The SCT variables studied are potentially modifiable via educational
   interventions. Results revealed that 15% of the subjects reported 3 or
   more days of physical activity. Four of the SCT were retained in the
   regression model accounting for 31% of the variance in days or
   moderate-vigorous physical activity. SCT is useful for understanding

AB Respiratory illness continues to be a leading cause of paediatric
   morbidity and mortality in Indonesia. The Indonesian government is
   moving towards a more managed care-based approach as it reforms its
   health care system following the 1997 financial crisis. In order to
   better design contractual relationships between the payor and different
   providers, there needs to be a better understanding of the patterns and
   predictors of health services utilization for respiratory illness. This
   study uses the Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey to study the
   determinants of private, public and non-formal provider utilization for
   respiratory illness. Multinomial logistic regression models for
   predicting use were constructed using the Andersen Behavioural Model as
   the conceptual framework. The findings indicate that age, household
   size, maternal education, religion, the asset index, location and
   illness severity play a role in determining use of private, public or
   non-formal providers. The results indicate that from a policy
   perspective, the Indonesian government needs be inclusive rather than
   exclusive in the choice of providers that are contracted by the managed
   care plans, in order to safeguard the health of the under-five
   population.

   motherhood in Nepal using data from the 2000 Nepal Adolescent and Young
   Adult Survey (NAYA). Both unmarried and married male and female youths
   (age 14-22) were included in the survey. The analysis is based on 2800
   urban youths and 5075 rural youths with complete information on the
   variables examined. Proportional hazard models are used to estimate
   covariates of early marriage and early motherhood, and logistic
   regression models are used to estimate covariates of delayed
   consummation of marriage. The results show that early marriage and early
   motherhood are quite common among Nepalese women, especially in rural
   areas. Early marriage is much less common among men. Delayed
   consummation of marriage is common among very young brides, especially
   in rural areas. The main covariates associated with early marriage and
   early motherhood are respondent's education, region of residence and
   ethnicity. The main covariates of delayed consummation of marriage are
   age at first marriage, region of residence and ethnicity. The study
   highlights the need to focus on less educated female youths in the Terai
   region in order to reduce the reproductive and child health risks
   associated with early marriage and early childbearing.

AB Data provided by 24 adult men, 20 heterosexual and four homosexual,
   concerning parental, religious, geographic and explicit sexual
   innuendos, comments and childhood experiences are presented and
   discussed in an attempt to consider some of the multiple factors
   impacting the development of sexual orientation. All of the study
   subjects were normally developed males and were presumed to have been
   exposed to normal male levels of androgens prenatally. Since the
   experiences and perceptions reported are conditioned by a unique social
   environment that has been superimposed on a normal male typical prenatal
   CNS differentiation, the experiences of these men suggest that
   affirmation of masculinity, and openness in the realm of social and
   sexual interaction, may enhance the formation of a heterosexual
   orientation. Conversely, sexually explicit feedback with critical
   implications occurred commonly among the homosexual men, which they
   interpreted as implying an insufficient masculinity. Both innate factors
   and social influences impact sexual orientation; in some instances males
   appear to have been homosexual from early childhood onward, while in
   other cases there appears to have been some degree of conditioning and
   choice in sexual orientation. Regarding the intersexed male, this
   suggests that social interactions, particularly those provided by
   parents, have a major influence on the development of sexual orientation
   in the child, while all persons involved in these children's lives and
   particularly those who nurture must be prepared for any sexual
   orientation that develops.

PD MAR 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship
   between partner violence (male-to-female and female-to-male) and heavy
   drinking (consuming five or more drinks per occasion) and the effect of
   this relationship on marital separation. Method: Married and cohabiting
   couples were selected through multistage random probability sampling
   from U.S. households. In 1995, 1,635 couples were interviewed; 1,392 of
   these couples were re-interviewed in 2000. The final analysis included
   couples who were still married or living with the same partner (intact n
   = 1,136) from the baseline, and couples who had broken up (nonintact n =
   191) sometime during the 5-year fullow-up period. Results: The findings
   indicate that couples who reported female-perpetrated violence, female
   alcohol-related problems and male heavy-drinking episodes (one to three
   times a month) were 2.5-3 times more at risk for separation. On the
   other hand, female heavy drinking (one to three times a month) is less
   likely to predict separation. Cohabiting couples are also more at risk
   for separation than married couples. Couples with longer relationships
   are less at risk for separation. Conclusions: Marital counseling,
   therapy or intervention programs must address issues pertaining to
   partner violence and alcohol use among couples while concurrently
   providing information about healthy relationships and helping couples
   develop skills to attain them. The importance of preventing partner
   violence is increasingly recognized in the field of public health.

VL 66
IS 2
BP 275
EP 283
PD MAR 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: Friends' substance use, sensation seeking and low perceived
   harm are well-established risk factors for substance use, but they are
   often treated as stable factors that affect adolescents' likelihood of
   substance use. This study instead explores the effects of changes in
   risk factors for individual adolescents. Method: Participants in this
   study were 1,065 male and female students. The students were in sixth or
   seventh grade at the initial survey and provided survey data on three
   additional occasions over a period of 2 years. Randoill-coefficient
   models were used to assess the intraindividual variability of friends'
   alcohol use, perceived harm, and risk taking and their effect on alcohol
   use. Results: As expected, the overall number of alcohol-using friends
   is correlated with a student's own alcohol use. In addition, there is a
   dynamic relationship within student; as friends' alcohol use changes
   over time, it is accompanied by parallel changes in alcohol use by the
   individual. Two moderating variables of the effect of friends' use of
   alcohol were validated: perceived harm of alcohol use and risk taking.
   The effect of increased exposure to alcohol-using friends is more robust
   during times when an adolescent also has become less likely to perceive
   the harmful effects of alcohol use or when an adolescent indicates
   increased interest in risk-taking behavior. Conclusions: Although
   friends' use of alcohol is a salient predictor of an adolescent's own
   use of alcohol, some types of students are more likely than others to be
   influenced by friends' behavior. In particular, students' perception of
   harm and predisposition to risk taking are important moderators of the
   effect of friends' influence.

AB Perhaps no species elicits more polarized opinions in the United States
   than the gray wolf (Canis lupus). Both proponents and opponents of wolf
   recovery use symbolic language in an attempt to persuade others to
   change their attitudes and values. We used structured phone interviews
   with 1,300 registered voters to examine the attitudes of people living
   in Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico toward a proposed restoration of
   the gray wolf to the southern Rocky Mountains, and to examine the
   ability of persuasive arguments to change these attitudes. We found a
   high level of support for wolf restoration by residents of all 3 states;
   64% of respondents favored reestablishing wolves in the southern
   Rockies, whereas 33% expressed opposition. Support was general across
   almost all demographic and other groups sampled, the exception being
   ranchers (44% in favor, 53% opposed). Persuasive arguments had little
   impact on respondents' attitudes toward wolves and their proposed
   restoration. Overall support for wolf reestablishment remained high and
   increased slightly after respondents heard persuasive arguments for and
   against wolf restoration. Yet most respondents (63.3%) did not change
   their level of support or opposition to the idea of reestablishing
   wolves after hearing persuasive arguments. Most people who did change
   their opinion increased the extremity of their responses, supporting
   attitudinal theory that predicts that people with strongly held
   attitudes will increase the extremity of their opinions after receiving
   more information. The attitudes people hold are critically important to
   the success of wolf restoration efforts. Although most of the public
   supports wolf restoration, polarization of the issue remains strong.
   This polarization poses a significant challenge to wildlife managers. If
   management agencies decide to pursue wolf restoration in the southern
   Rockies, efforts to mitigate strongly polarized positions should be
   given a high priority. Alternatively, if those agencies choose not to
   restore wolves, they likely will face significant controversy as
   unsatisfied wolf proponents make their feelings known.

AB Objective: The current study compared the perceptions of family
   functioning between daughters with eating disorders (EDs) and their
   parents. This investigation was an expansion of the Fornari et al (Compr
   Psychiatry 1999;40:434-441) study, which investigated the relationship
   between the perceived family functioning and depressive symptoms in
   individuals with ED patients receiving outpatient services.
   Method: One hundred twenty-six female subjects, ranging in age from 13
   to 34 years (mean 18.3 years) completed the Beck Depression Inventory
   (BDI) (Arch Gen Psychiary 196 1;4:561-571) and the Family Assessment
   Device (FAD) (J Marital Fam Ther 1983;9:171-180) on admission to an
   outpatient ED program. The patient's parent(s) (118 mothers and 96
   fathers) also completed the FAD. Eating disorder subgroup diagnosis and
   major depressive disorder diagnosis were established according to the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition,
   criteria, using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and
   Schizophrenia-Lifetime (Arch Gen Psychiatry 1987;35:837-844). Repeated
   measures analysis of covariance was performed comparing family members
   on each of the 7 subscales of the FAD with BDI entered as the covariate.
   Results: Statistically significant differences were found between
   patient and parental perceptions of overall family functioning. Mothers
   rated family functioning as significantly healthier and less chaotic
   than their daughters did. There were fewer significant differences
   between maternal and paternal perceptions of family functioning, and no
   significant differences between fathers' and daughters' perceptions of
   the family. Eating disorder diagnosis did not contribute to these
   differences in perception of family functioning. In addition, high
   self-reported depressive symptoms of the daughters were related to the
   perception of high family dysfunction for all 3 informants; depressive
   symptoms did not, however, alter the differences in perception between
   family members.
   Discussion: Differences in viewpoints between parents and daughters
   regarding the family environment may contribute to the continuation of a
   dysfunctional family pattern and maintenance of the ED and/or impact
   negatively on the course of treatment. Possible implications for
   treatment are discussed, particularly because of the differences of the
   mothers' views. The results of this study strongly support the
   importance of including the patient's family in the initial evaluation,
   regardless of the patient's age. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minority groups have lower levels of
   leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) than whites, but it is unclear how
   much of this is explained by differences in socioeconomic status and
   health.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in LTPA, work-related physical
   activity (WRPA; heavy household chores and strenuous job activities),
   and total physical activity (TPA) by race, ethnicity, and education.
   DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses of data from
   the 1992 Health and Retirement Study for a nationally representative
   cohort of 9,621 community-dwelling adults aged 51-61 years.
   MEASUREMENTS: Physical activity scores for LTPA, WRPA, and TPA based
   upon self-reported frequency of light or vigorous recreational
   activities, heavy household chores, and strenuous job-related physical
   activities.
   MAIN RESULTS: LTPA was lower for blacks and Hispanics compared to
   whites, and LTPA steadily declined with lower levels of education. WRPA
   showed the reverse pattern, being lowest for whites and persons with
   greater education. Education was far more important than race/ethnicity
   as a determinant of LTPA and WRPA in multivariate analyses. After
   adjusting for differences in overall health and physical functioning,
   mean TPA scores were similar across racial/ethnic and education
   categories; blacks (beta=1.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 1.5)
   and Spanish-speaking Hispanics (beta=1.1; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.9) had
   slightly higher levels of TPA than whites (P <.01 and P=.01,
   respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Differences in educational attainment and health status
   accounted for virtually all of the racial and ethnic differences in
   LTPA. After accounting for WRPA, TPA was similar across race, ethnicity,
   and education subgroups.

   Design Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods A sample of 397 current or former drug users in Baltimore, MD,
   USA who reported having ever witnessed an overdose.
   Findings Participants reported calling an ambulance in 23% of the
   overdose cases. Results from multivariate logistic regression indicate
   that having ever overdosed and having four or more bystanders present
   independently decreased the likelihood of calling 911. Having ever
   witnessed a fatal overdose and having any female bystanders present
   increased the likelihood of calling 911. There was a significant
   interaction between fear of arrest and prior exposure to the police.
   Setting of the overdose (public versus private) was not associated with
   calling 911 after controlling for other factors.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that in addition to personal
   characteristics of witnesses, social factors influence calling 911.
   Intervention at the social level may be a viable means to increase

AB Much research in sociology and labor economics studies proxies for

   between personal contacts and worker performance. This study addresses,
   for the first time, the role of referral contacts on workers'
   performance. Using employees' hiring and performance data in a call
   center, the author examines the performance implications over time of
   hiring new workers via employee referrals. When assessing whether
   referrals are more productive than nonreferrals, the author also
   considers the relationship between employee productivity and turnover.
   This study finds that referrals are initially more productive than
   nonreferrals, but longitudinal analyses emphasize posthire social

AB Objectives: To determine factors motivating residents' career choices
   and to examine changes in these priorities over the last 12 years.
   During the last decade, surveys of pediatric training programs have
   shown trends toward residents choosing careers in general pediatrics
   rather than in subspecialties. Most recently, there is evidence of a
   shift back toward subspecialty careers.
   Design: We surveyed past and present residents at The Children's
   Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pa, (training completion dates,
   1991-2002) via an anonymous written questionnaire.
   Results: The sample comprised 238 residents (mean +/-SD age, 30 +/-3
   years; 59% female, 41% male; 47% subspecialists, 53% generalists). Among
   the group as a whole, subject matter, role models, lifestyle issues, and
   teaching were the most important determinants for career choices. Less
   important were national trends, job openings, and research. When
   subspecialists and generalists were compared, both groups found subject
   matter to be their highest priority. Among residents interested in
   subspecialties, teaching, research, and technical skills were
   significant (P<.001), compared with generalists, who considered
   lifestyle and personal/financial issues more important (P<.001).
   Lifestyle issues were also more important to female residents, those 30
   years of age or younger, and those completing training recently (P<.05).
   Conclusions: Career decisions for pediatric residents today are
   motivated by complex factors. For those choosing generalist careers,
   lifestyle and personal/financial considerations predominate, while
   teaching, research, and technical skills are key factors for
   subspecialists. Over the last decade, lifestyle issues have become a
   more dominant factor, particularly for women entering the pediatric
   workforce.

TI Acculturation as a predictor of the onset of sexual intercourse among

AB Objective: To investigate ethnic differences in onset of sexual
   intercourse among Hispanic/Mexican American and white adolescents based
   on acculturation.
   Design/Methods: Preprogram survey data from 7270 Hispanic or white teens
   in 7th to 12th grade involved in the Arizona Abstinence-Only Education
   Program were used to predict the probability of onset of sexual
   intercourse based on age, sex, family structure, program location,
   religiosity, free school lunch, grades, rural residence, acculturation,
   and ethnicity. Specific attention was given to the influence of
   acculturation among Hispanic teens. The primary language spoken by the
   respondents (English, Spanish, or both) was used as a proxy measure for
   acculturation.
   Results: Hispanic youth were at a greater risk for experiencing onset of
   intercourse than white youth, while controlling for all other predictors
   (odds ratio [OR], 1.40 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.21-1.63]). This
   risk was amplified for highly acculturated Hispanic teens (OR, 1.69 [95%
   Cl, 1.43-1.99]). However, less acculturated Hispanic youth were actually
   less likely to have experienced first intercourse than white youth (OR,
   0.59 [95% Cl, 0.42-0.82]), English-speaking Hispanic youth (OR, 0.35
   [95% Cl, 0.25-0.49]), or bilingual Hispanic youth (OR, 0.45 [95% Cl,
   0.31-0.64]).
   Conclusions: Low acculturation emerges as a significant protective
   factor while controlling for other social and cultural factors, in spite
   of the increased risk of initiating sexual intercourse for Hispanic
   teens overall. Hispanic Spanish speakers were least likely to have
   initiated intercourse, while Hispanic English speakers were the most
   likely.

AB Sarah Hrdy argues that women (1) possess a reproductive behavioral
   strategy including infanticide, (2) that this strategy is an adaptation
   and (3) arose as a response to stresses mothers faced with the agrarian
   revolution. I argue that while psychopathological and cultural
   evolutionary accounts for Hrdy's data fail, her suggested psychological
   architecture for the strategy suggests that the behavior she describes
   is really only the consequence of the operation of practical reasoning
   mechanism(s) - and consequently there is no reproductive strategy
   including infanticide as such, nor could the alleged strategy be
   sufficiently mosaic to count as an adaptation. What might count as an
   adaptation is a 'window' before bonding that permits practical reasoning
   about the reproductive value of infants and hence variable maternal
   investment, and which, contra (3) arose early in hominid history due to
   a combination of increases in infant dependency and increased human
   abilities for conditional practical reasoning.

AB BACKGROUND.The current study investigated the individual and community
   determinants of breast carcinoma stage at diagnosis (BCSAD) using
   multiple data sources merged with cancer registry data. The literature
   review yielded 5 studies that analyzed cancer registry data merged with
   community-level variables (1995-2004).
   METHODS. Community variables constructed for the current study reflected
   social and economic risk factors, physician Supply, and health
   maintenance organization penetration. Multivariate logistic regression
   was used to identify the significant search. University of California at
   Los Angeles, Los predictors of increasingly progressive BCSAD.
   RESULTS. Disparities remained for black and Hispanic females in
   California, who were least likely to be diagnosed early compared with
   their white counterparts. Younger (< 40 years) and middle-aged (40-64
   years) females were less likely to be diagnosed with early BCSAD,
   compared with older females (greater than or equal to 65 years).
   Utilizing services at hospitals serving a lower volume of patients with
   breast carcinoma was associated with later BCSAD). After controlling for
   individual-level factors, community-level variables constructed at the
   census block group and county level were tested. If a woman resided in a
   neighborhood with greater percentages of female-headed households,
   persons living below the poverty level, less educated people, and more
   recent immigrants, then her chances of being diagnosed at an earlier
   stage were diminished. If, conversely, she resided in a neighborhood
   with greater percentages of females greater than or equal to 65 years (a
   proxy for Medicare coverage), her access to medical care and the
   probability of earlier BCSAD increased. County-level insurance rates and
   residing in counties where greater percentages of women ever had a
   mammogram were associated with in Situ and early-stage diagnosis.
   Similarly, the supply of primary care physicians and radiologists was
   associated positively with earlier BCSAD.
   CONCLUSIONS. Results confirmed corn In Unity-level predictors of
   socioeconomic and delivery system context matter, although the in
   (individual-level predictors showed a stronger effect. Nevertheless,
   analysis of community variables is prom ising for guiding and evaluating
   the effects of health policy and developing com munity and delivery
   system interventions for earlier detection and treatment of breast
   carcinoma. (C) 2005 American Cancer Society.

AB Pediatricians have been criticized for failing to identify psychosocial
   problems in their pediatric patients. Maternal disclosure is important
   for identification; however, many mothers fail to discuss their concerns
   with the pediatrician. The present study explored the hypothesis that
   mothers are seeking and receiving help from sources other than the
   pediatrician. Participants were 50 mothers who brought their
   4-13-year-old child for a routine health supervision visit at a
   county-funded hospital serving primarily low-income families. Results
   indicated that mothers actively seek help from multiple sources and find
   the help they receive useful. Clinical implications of these findings
   are discussed.

   initiative and positivity; and dyadic responsiveness. There were no
   cocaine exposure group differences on any of the measures, with or

AB Five dimensions of friendship quality (conflict, closeness,
   companionship, helping, and security) were predicted from self-reports
   and peer reports of physical aggression, relational aggression, and
   prosocial behaviour, using the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model
   (Kenny & Acitelli, 2001). Participants were 224 adolescents aged 15-17
   years (142 girls, 82 boys) who formed 112 unique same-sex best friend
   dyads. Significant actor and partner effects were found for both
   self-ratings and peer nominations of social behaviour and the five
   friendship qualities. Aggression was associated with self and partner
   perceptions of friendship conflict and low positive friendship
   qualities. Prosocial behaviour was associated with self and partner
   perceptions of positive friendship qualities and low conflict. The
   findings of this study were mostly consistent between male and female
   dyads. The importance of examining dependence due to dyads in peer

AB American sociology has long documented and theorized persistent
   inequalities between religious communities in the United States; in
   addition, socioeconomic inequalities between religious groups have
   played an important role in many sociological theories about religion
   and society. Since the publication of numerous important works published
   in the mid-20th century, however, the social stratification of American
   religion has been a curiously understudied topic. This research note is
   an attempt to update our descriptive knowledge about socioeconomic
   inequalities between American religious groups. Using General Social
   Survey data to track educational, income, and job status inequality over
   a 16-year period, from the early 1980s to the late 1990s, we find that
   socioeconomic inequality in the American religious system has been quite
   persistent and stable, suggesting that significant mobility within this
   system in the mid-20th century may be declining, thus producing a more
   stable system of stratification.

AB The introduction of Japan's long-term care insurance (LTCI) system in
   April 2000 has made long-term care an explicit and universal entitlement
   for every Japanese person aged 65 and older based strictly on physical
   and mental status. At the start of the program, more than two million
   seniors were expected to apply for services to approximately 3,000
   municipal governments, which are the LTCI insurers. The LTCI
   implementation required a nationally standardized needs-certification
   system to determine service eligibility objectively, fairly, and
   efficiently. The current computer-aided initial needs-assessment
   instrument was developed based on data collected in a large-scale time
   study of professional caregivers in long-term care institutions. The
   instrument was subsequently tested and validated by assessing data of
   175,129 seniors involved in the national model programs before the start
   of LTCI. The computer-aided initial assessment (an 85-item
   questionnaire) is used to assign each applicant to one of seven need
   levels. The Care Needs Certification Board, a committee of medical and
   other professionals, reviews the results. Three years after
   implementation, the LTCI system and its needs-assessment/certification
   system have been well accepted in Japan. Despite the overall successes,
   there remain challenges, including area variations, growing demands for
   services, and the difficulty of keeping the needs certification free of
   politics. The LTCI computer network that links municipalities and the
   central government is instrumental in continuously improving the
   needs-certification system. Future challenges include promoting
   evidence-based system improvements and building incentives into the
   system for various constituencies to promote seniors' functional
   independence.

AB Objective: To examine recent trends in racial and ethnic disparities in
   cardiac catheterization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to
   determine whether disparities documented from the 1980s through
   mid-1990s persist, and evaluate whether patient and hospital
   characteristics are associated with any observed disparities.
   Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of 585,710 white, 51,369 black and
   31,923 Hispanic discharges from hospitals in the Nationwide Inpatient
   Sample (which includes data on all discharges from 951 representative
   hospitals in 23 states) that had performed cardiac catheterization from
   1995-2001 with a primary diagnosis of AMI. Adjusted procedure rates and
   prevalence ratios (PR) were computed to compare catheterization rates by
   race and ethnicity.
   Measurements and Main Results: Catheterization rates were higher for
   whites than blacks for all years examined; rates among Hispanics
   increased during this period and approached the rate among whites. After
   adjustment for age, demographics, comorbidity, year and hospital
   characteristics, rates (per 100 discharges) were 58.4 for whites, 50.1
   for blacks (PR 0.87; 95% CI 0.84-0.91) and 55.2 for Hispanics (PR 0.95;
   95% CI 0.90-0.99).
   Conclusions: These nationwide data suggest blacks remain less likely
   than whites and Hispanics to undergo catheterization during a
   hospitalization for AMI. Whether this disparity stems from patient or
   provider factors remains to be determined.

   (BMD) in elderly females.
   Design: Secondary data analysis of the Third National Health and

   Results: CRP was associated with BMD in the bivariate analysis (p<0.001)
   but not in the multivariate analysis (p=0.23), Age, ethnicity, body mass
   index (BMI), hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and immobility were
   independently associated with BMD.
   Conclusions: CRP may be useful in screening for osteoporosis among

   surrogate for other factors directly associated with osteoparosis.
   Further studies are needed to validate these findings.

   individual experiences and values that contribute to supportive
   attitudes toward organ and tissue donation.
   Procedures: Focus group participants were 26 African-American clergymen
   and 42 African-American parishioners recruited from seven Christian
   churches in the metro Atlanta area.
   Findings: Although a large number of participants had previous exposure
   to organ and tissue donation and transplantation, the majority of these
   experiences were negative, and participants felt a general fear and lack
   of knowledge about the process of donation and transplantation. Despite
   these negative experiences, respondents reported personal values (e.g.,
   the desire to help others and acceptance of group responsibility) and
   religious values (e.g., the desire to carry out God's will and to have
   faith in God) that contribute to supportive attitudes toward organ and
   tissue donation.
   Conclusion: An understanding of supportive attitudes toward donation may
   help improve the development of effective culturally sensitive
   intervention messages targeting the African-American religious community
   with the ultimate goal of increasing the pool of organs available for
   transplantation.

AB Background. Despite a minimum legal drinking age, many young people use
   alcohol. Environmental strategies to control youth drinking focus on
   restricting access and the enforcement of possession laws. This study
   examines the relationship between use of these strategies and the
   frequency of youth alcohol use and related problems.
   Methods. Participants were 16,694 students, ages 16-17 in 92 communities
   in Oregon. A multi-level analysis of a repeated cross-sectional
   statewide student survey was conducted. The outcome measures examined
   include 30-day frequency of alcohol use, binge drinking, use of alcohol
   at school, and drinking and driving.
   Results. The rate of illegal merchant sales in the communities directly
   related to all four alcohol-use outcomes. There was also evidence that
   communities with higher minor in possession law enforcement had lower
   rates of alcohol use and binge drinking. The use of various sources in a
   community expanded and contracted somewhat depending on levels of access
   and enforcement.
   Conclusions. This evidence provides empirical support for the potential
   utility of local efforts to maintain or increase alcohol access control
   and possession enforcement. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention

AB Objective: The Purpose of this study was to examine the association
   between depressive symptoms and salivary cortisol responses to stress in
   a high-risk population of very poor Mexican women. Methods: Adult women
   (N = 1109) between the ages of IS and 44 years (mean age, 29) were
   identified in a house-to-house survey in low-income areas (income < 20th
   percentile nationally) of urban Mexico. An interview containing the
   Spanish version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale
   (CES-D) was administered to all women. The naturalistic stressor was
   defined as the unexpected arrival of a team of researchers at the
   participants' homes followed by all in-depth interview and physical
   assessment, with saliva samples taken at time of arrival (baseline), 25
   minutes, and 50 minutes after arrival. Results: The mean CES-D score was
   19.42 (range, 0-53). Results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses
   revealed no effect of depressive symptoms on baseline salivary cortisol
   levels. However, a significant depressive symptom by time interaction
   revealed that women with elevations in depressive symptoms (CES-D scores
   = 35) failed to exhibit a cortisol response to the stressor. In
   contrast, in women with lower CES-D scores, cortisol levels
   significantly increased in response to the stressor. Conclusion:
   Consistent with research on individuals with major depressive disorder,
   results of this Study demonstrate that women with very high levels of
   depressive symptoms exhibit blunted cortisol responses to a naturalistic
   psychological stressor. Results also contribute to previous research by
   generalizing findings to a high risk, underserved population of women.

AB Rural areas continue to face a series of challenges; many are likely to
   have profound impacts on the vitality of these places over the long
   term. Of central concern is whether the rural sociological enterprise, a
   potentially vital source of information and guidance on such diverse
   issues, will be able to effectively respond to such challenges. The
   author argues that in order to strengthen its relevance and viability in
   coming years, the rural sociological profession must embrace three
   important shifts. First, it must modify the manner in which it engages
   in the production of new knowledge by pursuing a more balanced portfolio
   of investments in disciplinary and transdisciplinary research. Second,
   it must take a bold step to build bridges to new entities whose
   missions, goals, and values closely align with those of the Rural
   Sociological Society. And third, it must take a more proactive role in
   generating quality, scientifically sound information that is aligned
   with the needs of federal and state policy communities, particularly
   information that can better articulate how policies are likely to impact
   rural people and places.

   Social SciSearch, and were subjected to cluster analysis,

   along the horizontal axis depicting four clusters of journals
   differentiated into mainstream urban studies, regional science and urban
   economics, transportation, and real estate finance. The cluster of the
   mainstream urban studies journals revealed a higher degree of
   interdisciplinarity than other clusters. The four-factor solution,
   though not a perfect match for the cluster solution, demonstrated the
   interrelationships among the overlapping journals loaded high on
   different factors. The results also showed a strong negative correlation
   between the coordinates of the horizontal axis and the mean journal
   correlation coefficients reflecting the subject variation, and a less
   revealing positive correlation between the coordinates of the vertical

AB Population-level birth rates in the United States were largely stable
   between 1970 and 1999. This stability contrasts with rapid change in
   marriage rates and fertility timing during the same period. In this
   article, I use decomposition techniques to analyze this seeming paradox.
   I decompose the general fertility rate into four components: age
   distribution, marital status, age-specific nonmarital fertility, and
   age-specific marital fertility. Absent other changes, declining time
   spent married would have led to substantial decline in fertility.
   Several factors combined to counterbalance these changes in marital
   behavior. Among white women in the 1970s and 1980s, marital fertility
   rates increased at older ages, consistent with a scenario in which women
   postponed both marriage and childbearing; increased nonmarital birth
   rates during this period were not a driving factor in overall fertility
   trends. Increased nonmarital fertility was more important in
   compensating for declining time spent married among African American
   women and among white women in the 1990s.

   1998 national household survey microdata (PNAD) for Brazil, we rind it
   advantageous to use a three-category scheme that separates a mixed
   black-white (pardo) status from black or white when examining the
   functional ability of elders. We also rind the tantalizing possibility
   of a crossover in which browns actually have more functional ability
   than white counterparts after controlling for many demographic,

   in conjunction with the overarching transcendency of the community aid
   in understanding the development of self and the subsequent behaviors
   that emanate from and within trash talking in college athletics. Here a
   Meadian perspective is used to explain the act of trash talking at both
   macro- and micro-levels. Three areas were identified where Meadian
   philosophy applies: (1) the game and the role of the generalized other;
   (2) play and significant communication; and (3) self-development.

   Simmel, this article investigates his equally important ideas about time

   explores the nature of knowledge of the past, mechanistic and organic
   conceptions of temporality, and the experience and social construction
   of time-consciousness. The modern money economy encourages a dynamic
   acceleration and compression of time, while cultural modernity ushers in
   an 'eternal present'. Simmel's interpretation of time and temporality
   are central to his thought and contribute to his significance as a

AB Black men in the United States have the highest incidence and mortality
   from prostate cancer in the world. Even after adjusting for stage It
   diagnosis, black men have higher mortality rates than white men.
   Multiple reasons have been postulated to explain these findings
   including access to care, attitudes about care, socioeconomic and
   education differences, differences in type and aggressiveness of
   treatment, dietary, and genetic differences. While each reason may
   contribute to the higher incidence or higher mortality, likely
   combinations of reasons will best explain all the findings. Racial
   differences in socioeconomic status have been well established and we
   review the significance of these findings in relationship to prostate
   cancer. Also, with recent advances in the understanding of genetic
   variation in the human genome, in general, and in the genes involved in
   pathways relevant to prostate cancer biology in particular, a number of
   genes with alleles which differ in frequency between black and white men
   have been proposed as a genetic cause or contributor to the increased
   prostate cancer risk in black men. However, the clinical significance of
   these genetic differences is not fully known. Finally, we conclude with
   some thoughts as to how to integrate the findings from sociological as
   well as biological studies and touch upon methods to reduce the
   disparate burden of prostate cancer among blacks in the United States.

AB Research and action to address social disparities in cancer requires
   clarity about what constitutes and causes these persistent and onerous
   inequities in health. Currently, both scientific literature and
   government documents exhibit important disagreements, confused
   terminology, and considerable, if not deliberate, vagueness about the
   meaning of the phrase 'cancer disparities' and the related term 'social
   disparities in health.' This article accordingly reviews critical issues
   relevant to cohering understanding of what is meant by 'cancer
   disparities;' offers a de. nition premised on the causal contention that
   social disparities in health, by de. nition, arise from social inequity;
   and considers its implications for developing a multidisciplinary
   research agenda on social inequalities in cancer. Tackling this issue
   will require rigorous and critical frameworks, questions, and methods
   derived from multiple disciplines, and will necessarily involve
   epidemiologic, clinical, and intervention research, both quantitative
   and qualitative. At issue is making conscious research choices: about
   which types of disparities we study, in relation to which aspect of
   cancer, so as to improve the likelihood our research will help inform a
   society- wide discourse about the extent, origins of, and remedies for
   social injustices in cancer, thereby aiding efforts to eliminate social
   inequalities in health.

   availability and ready use of public health surveillance data at the

   research agenda in cancer disparities, we present descriptive statistics
   from major public health surveillance data systems in Massachusetts.
   Disparities highlighted include higher breast cancer mortality rates
   among African-American women than women of other racial groups, lower
   rates of colorectal and cervical cancer screening among Asian- American
   residents, and striking gradients in cancer risk factor prevalence and
   screening by income and education. Challenges in utilizing public health
   surveillance data include lack of information in many domains of social
   inequity beyond race/ ethnicity, uneven quality, and lack of stable,
   reportable data for smaller populations. Opportunities to maximize the
   usefulness of cancer registry data include application of geographic
   information systems and linkage with other data systems tracking
   information on health services outcomes and clinical trial
   participation. Analyses of surveillance data can spark advances not only
   in community- based participatory research but also in programs and

   diagnosed with breast cancer through a National Breast and Cervical
   Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) for low income and uninsured
   women in Massachusetts, the Women's Health Network (WHN), to other
   breast cancer patients in the state.
   Methods: We linked data from the WHN and the Massachusetts Cancer
   Registry (MCR). We compared 331 WHN women and 13,372 other breast cancer
   patients in Massachusetts diagnosed from 1995 to 1999. We used logistic
   regression, controlling for age, race/ ethnicity, marital status, region
   of residence, and stage, where appropriate.
   Results: Compared to other breast cancer patients reported to the MCR,
   WHN women were just as likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage ( III
   or IV), treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy, and
   treated with complete mastectomy versus partial mastectomy. WHN women
   were less likely to receive radiation therapy ( odds ratio= 0.7; 95%
   confidence interval= 0.6 - 0.9), particularly after partial mastectomy,
   and had a slightly longer time from diagnosis to treatment than other
   breast cancer patients ( p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Women diagnosed with breast cancer through a NBCCEDP in
   Massachusetts had similar stage and treatment patterns as other breast
   cancer patients in the state, except for the use of radiation therapy.

   each other, the richer pool was overutilized. In conjunction with prior
   experiments that correlated the visibility of agents and resources
   (Goldstone & Ashpole, 2004), these results indicate that participants'
   foraging decisions are influenced by both forager and resource
   information. The results suggest that the presence of a crowd at a
   resource is a deterring, rather than an attractive, factor. Both fast
   and slow oscillations in the harvesting rates of the pools across time
   were revealed by Fourier analyses. The slow waves of crowd migration
   were most prevalent when the resources were invisible, whereas the fast
   cycles were most prevalent when the resources were visible and the
   participants were invisible.

AB This article summarizes the proceedings of a symposium at the 2004
   Research Society on Alcoholism Meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia,
   Canada, organized and chaired by Scott T. Walters. The purpose of the
   symposium was to describe several brief motivational interventions
   offered via the Internet, including the evidence for web-based
   interventions, applications and contexts in which such approaches are
   being used, and directions for future research. Walters provided an
   overview and introduction to the topic and discussed the e-CHUG
   (www.e-chug.com) and e-TOKE (www.e-toke.com) feedback interventions for
   college alcohol and marijuana prevention, including the contexts in
   which they are being used and ways they are being integrated with other
   campus prevention efforts. Dr. Hester presented 12-month results from a
   controlled trial of the Drinker's Check-up (www.drinkerscheckup.com), an
   intervention for adult problem drinkers that is available both as a
   Windows and as an Internet application. Dr. Chiauzzi described the
   development and testing of My Student Body (www.mystudentbody.com), a
   tailored drinking prevention web site for college students. Finally, Dr.
   Miller addressed the use of online assessment and feedback to reduce
   drinking, including the history of web-based interventions and their
   likely future and the potential limitations of such approaches.

AB We analyzed key individual, family, and neighborhood factors to assess

   violence. From 1995 to 2002, we collected 3 waves of data on 2974
   participants aged 18 to 25 years living in 180 Chicago neighborhoods,
   augmented by a separate community survey of 8782 Chicago residents.
   The odds of perpetrating violence were 85% higher for Blacks compared
   with Whites, whereas Latino-perpetrated violence was 10% lower. Yet the
   majority of the Black-White gap (over 60%) and the entire Latino-White
   gap were explained primarily by the marital status of parents, immigrant
   generation, and dimensions of neighborhood social context. The results
   imply that generic interventions to improve neighborhood conditions and
   support families may reduce racial gaps in violence.

AB Objectives. We analyzed neighborhood heterogeneity in associations among
   mortality, race/ethnicity, and area poverty.
   Methods. We performed a multilevel statistical analysis of Massachusetts
   all-cause mortality data for the period 1989 through 1991 (n = 142836
   deaths), modeled as 79813 cells (deaths and denominators cross-tabulated
   by age, gender, and race/ethnicity) at level 1 nested within 5532 block
   groups at level 2 within 1307 census tracts (CTs) at level 3. We also
   characterized CTs by percentage of the population living below poverty
   level.
   Results. Neighborhood variation in mortality across CTs and block groups
   was not accounted for by these areas' age, gender, and racial/ethnic
   composition. Neighborhood variation in mortality was much greater for
   the Black population than for the White population, largely because of
   CT-level variation in poverty rates.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood heterogeneity in the relationship between
   mortality and race/ethnicity in Massachusetts is statistically
   significant and is closely related to CT-level variation in poverty.

AB Objectives. We assessed the relation between the work promotion, welfare

   health insurance of parents in transition from welfare to work.
   Methods. We analyzed a panel survey (1999-2002) of a stratified random
   sample of Illinois families receiving welfare in 1998 (n = 1363).
   Results. Medicaid remains the foremost source of health insurance
   despite a significant decline in the proportion of parents with
   Medicaid. Regardless of work/welfare status in year 1, transitioning to
   work only or no work/no welfare increased the likelihood of having
   unstable health insurance in years 2 and 3 compared with those who
   remained on welfare only.
   Conclusions. Parents who meet the welfare reform goals of work promotion
   and reduction of welfare dependence experience significant loss and
   instability of health insurance.

AB PURPOSE: To identify the significant factors associated with attempted
   suicide among men and women, and determine whether socioeconomic status
   (SES) and social support indictors, health risk factors, and lifetime
   history of medical and psychiatric illnesses can explain gender
   differences in attempted suicide.
   METHODS: We used data from 3357 men and 4004 women aged 17 to 39 years,
   who completed a mental disorder diagnostic interview as a part of the
   Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994.
   Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for the association between
   risk factors and attempted suicide.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of lifetime attempted suicides was 7.58% (SE,
   0.66) in women and 3.69% (SE, 0.49) in men. In men, low income and
   smoking were associated with attempted suicide, while attempted suicide
   in women was associated with poor self-evaluated health, low educational
   attainment, and drug Use. A history of medical and psychiatric illnesses
   was associated with attempted Suicide in both genders, for
   cancer/pulmonary disease, OR = 2.89 (95% CI, 1.25-6.67) in men and 1.94
   (1.09-3.45) in women; for major depressive disorder, OR = 9.86
   (5.08-19.14) in men and 5.00 (3.19-7.83) in women. The significant
   gender difference of attempted suicide prevalence remained after being
   adjusted for risk factors selected.
   CONCLUSION: There were significant gender differences in the risk
   factors for attempted suicide among young adults, and the gender
   difference in the prevalence of lifetime attempted suicides could not be
   explained by differential exposure to risk factors selected. (C) 2004

   distributed to women aged 18-44 years in the Boston neighborhood of
   Jamaica Plain. Of the 188 participants, 82% have heard of EC. Knowledge
   disparities by race/ethnicity groups were seen, with only 51% of Latina
   women and 75% of Black women having heard of EC compared with 99% of
   White women (p<.0001 and p=.002, respectively). Of the entire cohort,
   39% knew that EC works by preventing pregnancy, 48% knew that it should
   be taken within 72-120 h of unprotected intercourse and 44% knew that it
   is only available by prescription in Massachusetts. Only 25% of women
   have ever discussed EC with a health care provider, and only 12% have
   ever received an advance prescription. A community education campaign
   aimed at reproductive-age women, health care providers and pharmacists
   has been tailored to address these knowledge deficits. (C) 2005 Elsevier

AB This study examined the relative reinforcing potency of vouchers and

   ($10, $50, and $ 100) by use of a series of choices to understand how
   exchange-delay features of voucher reinforcers influence their
   reinforcing potency compared with cash. The study also examined a no
   delay vs. 2-day delay of the cash alternative. Generally, cash was
   selected at 80%-90% of voucher face values. Vouchers were also
   discounted less when a 2-day delay was imposed on the cash option
   compared to the immediately available cash. These results suggest that
   voucher discounting does occur among patients in drug treatment.
   However, vouchers retain 80%-90% of their cash value and thus remain
   relatively potent reinforcers.

   social disorder (e.g., delinquency, drug use) predicted the onset of
   major depression when controlling for individual-level demographic
   characteristics. Neighborhood-level disadvantage/disorder interacted
   with negative life events, such that women who experienced recent
   negative life events and lived in high disadvantage/disorder
   neighborhoods were more likely to become depressed than were those who
   lived in more benign settings, both concurrently and over a 2-year

AB Collaboration between sociology and psychiatry. is traced to the 1920s
   when, stimulated by Harry Stack Sullivan and Adolph Meyer, the
   relationship was activated by common theoretical and research interests.
   Immediately after World War II, this became a true partnership,
   stimulated by the National Institute of Mental Health, the Group for the
   Advancement of Psychiatry, and the growing influence of psychoanalytic
   theory. The effects of a sociology that focused on issues of health and
   illness proceeded to grow in medical education, research, and the
   treatment of mental illness until 1980, when a distinct shift of
   emphasis in psychiatry occurred. In its role as educator of future
   physicians, postwar psychiatry developed a paradigm of biopsychosocial
   behavior but, after 3 decades, changed to a biopharmacological model.
   The definition of mental illness as a deviant extreme in developmental
   and interpersonal characteristics lost favor to nosological diagnoses of
   discrete or dichotomous models. Under a variety of intellectual,
   socioeconomic, and political pressures, psychiatry reduced its interest
   in and relationship with sociology, replacing it in part with bioethics
   and economics. In this article, the detailed underpinnings of these
   changes are described and interpreted.

AB Objectives: To provide a chronologic review of growing knowledge in
   occupational medicine relating work and work hazards to health, and to
   provide a perspective on the lessions learned from the frequent
   inattention or misrepresentation of hazards. Methods: Many books on the
   social and medical history of work including epidemiology and toxicology
   were reviewed as well as published papers and interviews. Results:
   Throughout history workplace hazards and occupational medicine have been
   shaped by the forces that shape work itself, social evolution, changing
   modes of production, shifting economic powers, and demographic changes
   in the workforce. Lest we think these changes are unique to the present
   time, this paper emphasizes the long-term and inevitable relationship
   between social structure and worker health Hippocrates emphasized the
   relation between environment (air and water) and health, although he has
   less to say about the non-military work environment, perhaps because of
   the denigration of manual labor in Greece. The impact of work on health
   can be traced to the Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus, written approximately
   1700 BC The earliest occupational physicians served military forces, and
   Galen was physician to Roman gladiators. Finger and wrist guards worn by
   Bronze Age archers represent early personal protective equipment.
   Writers of the classic period mention diseases and hazards of miners,
   and Pliny (1st century AD) mentions veils to cover the face. In the
   Middle East Rhazes included occupation in his case studies (9th
   century). Paracelsus, and Agricola were prominent, figures in the 15th
   century, with an emphasis on mining and health Ramazzini's (c1700) work
   was widely translated in ensuing decades and is now well-known to all,
   but its influence between about 1800 and 1940 is inapparent The
   emergence of a public health movement in the mid-1800s focused attention
   on the abominable conditions of many factories and on the living
   conditions, poor nutrition, high stress, poverty and ill health of the
   new factory working class, while paying scant attention to specific
   workplace hazards. Conclusions: The recognition of occupational diseases
   in the United States has often lagged by a generation behind the
   recognition of the same diseases in Europe We are now into a second
   industrial revolution Led by multinational corporations and information
   technology, shifting production facilities, and jobs moving around the
   world in search of cheap labor in the countries with the fastest growing
   population and the greatest poverty. Occupational medicine must be alert
   to the new challenges imposed by this revolution.

AB Objectives: Occupational medicine lies at the interface between work and
   health. Not only do workplace hazards impact health, but our state of
   health influences our ability to get to work, to Perform work, to
   tolerate work, and to gain a measure of satisfaction from the work we
   do. Comprehensive occupational medicine requires familiarity with the
   work that patients do; knowledge of the workplace itself and its
   hazards, appreciation of the social forces that shape work; and
   understanding of how chemical, physical, biologic, mechanical, and
   psychosocial agents influence health. Many practitioners who treat
   injured workers or provide disability assessments have no more formal
   training in occupational medicine than primary care physicians in
   general, which limits the quality, or at least the scope, of the care
   they give to workers. Methods: This history has been compiled from
   books, journals, letters and recollections. A subset of journal issues
   from each decade after 1910 has been systematically reviewed, making no
   attempt to read through every issue. Results: Industrial medicine as we
   recognize it began in the late-1800s, grew rapidly in the early and
   mid-1900s, and peaked toward the end of the 20th century, when American
   corporations began to outsource medical services, supporting the rise of
   free-standing industrial medicine facilities, chains of which now
   operate profitably throughout the country. Many of these facilities
   emphasize injury treatment, work hardening, and physical therapy rather
   than disease recognition and prevention. Occupational medicine is one of
   the very few medical specialties to be underserved. Board-certified
   specialists are relatively Jew, and when supply falls short of demand,
   the demand has tended to lower its sights. Conclusions: Occupational
   medicine has always been influenced by economics, politics, and changing
   Patterns of employment, and today these forces include managed care,
   weakened unions, outsourcing and contract labor, and a generally growing
   political and social conservatism, not to mention multinational
   corporations. The globalization of manufacture and economics facilitated
   by rapid population growth in poor nations assures an unending supply of
   cheap labor, allowing limited attention to hazard control, thereby
   impeding progress in occupational health and safety. Some corporations
   are meeting the challenge of protecting their international workforce.
   Many, probably most, have not yet achieved this.

   often are undermined by forces and interests outside the field. Failure
   to acknowledge the profoundly social nature of ethical codes impedes our
   ability to anticipate consequences, to legitimate decisions based on
   utility and benefit, and to find social structures that support, rather
   than invalidate, our view of ethical behavior. We examine three sets Of
   social philosophies. Methods: Jane Jacobs, the visionary urban planner,
   has written Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of
   Commerce and Politics, which is a restatement in modern terms of a
   critical passage in Plato's most important dialogue, the Republic. She
   (and Plato) postulate two major ethical systems, renamed here the
   "guardian system," which is characterized by loyalty, cohesiveness, and
   confidentiality, and the "marketplace system, " which is characterized
   by trade, decentralization, and shared information. Occupational health,
   in this formulation, often runs afoul of the guardian mentality and also
   may be subject to inappropriate negotiation and compromise in the
   marketplace system. George Lakoff, a semiotician, has written Moral
   Politics: What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't, which argues that
   there are two fundamental social paradigms based on concepts of the
   family. One, which he calls the Strict Father, emphasizes discipline,
   the positive aspects of taking risks, and the need to individuals to be
   self-sufficient. The other, which he calls the Nurturing Parent,
   emphasizes empowerment, the positive aspects of security, and the need
   for community and relationships. Occupational health practice violates
   aspects of both and therefore is supported by neither. Classical Chinese
   thought involved many schools of thought, including Confucianism and
   Legalism. It has been suggested that Confucianism provides little
   support for government regulation or occupational health, however this
   is questioned. Conclusions: Occupational health may improve its standing
   as a social priority by recognizing and maneuvering within social
   frameworks that accomodate it, rejecting social frameworks that
   invalidate it, and reinforcing positive cultural trends within society
   that support it.

TI Body image and attitude toward obesity in an historically black

PY 2005
AB Introduction: The obesity epidemic is a major problem in the United
   States, particularly among black women. Body image and attitudes toward
   obesity are important areas to understand and address in any
   comprehensive approach to this epidemic.
   Methods: From an initial evaluation of 200 college students (25 male and
   25 female freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors each) attending an
   historically black university, we selected those students who identified
   themselves as black for data analysis (n=191). All students underwent
   height and weight measurement from which body mass index (BMI) was
   calculated. Each student answered two questions related to nine
   silhouettes for each sex that progressively moved from extreme thinness
   to extreme obesity. Also, each student answered 20 questions describing
   attitudes about obesity.
   Results: Black college students placed between the 62nd and 72nd
   percentiles of national BMI data for adolescents. Block female students
   were more likely than their black male counterparts to be obese. BMI did
   not vary by sex or grade level. Students of both sexes generally
   preferred "trim" silhouettes with the caveat that students with BMIs <25
   kg/m(2) preferred smaller silhouettes than did students with BMIs &GE;25
   kg/m(2). BMI and sex did not favor any particular set of attitudes
   toward obesity.
   Conclusion: Black male and female college students from an historically
   black university were largely in the "normal" range of BMI percentiles
   for sex and age. Our black female students were more likely to be obese
   than our black male students. Our findings suggest that young black
   women are tolerant of a variety of body sizes. Based on findings from
   our Attitudes Toward Obese Persons scale, body size sense of self and
   sex do not influence attitudes toward obese persons. Further studies are
   needed.

AB Recent years have seen a burgeoning of research and writing on the
   connections between religion and health. The very best of this work
   comes from epidemiologic studies of African Americans. This paper
   summarizes results of these investigations, including findings
   identifying effects of religious participation on both physical and
   mental health outcomes. Evidence mostly supports a protective religious
   effect on morbidity and mortality and on depressive symptoms and overall
   psychological distress among African Americans. This paper also
   carefully discusses what the results of these studies mean and do not
   mean, an important consideration due to frequent misinterpretations of
   findings on this topic. Because important distinctions between
   epidemiologic and clinical studies tend to get glossed over, reports of
   religion-health associations oftentimes draw erroneous conclusions that
   foster unrealistic expectations about the role of faith and spirituality
   in health and healing. Finally, implications are discussed for clinical
   practice, medical education and public health.

AB In primary care and physical therapy settings, we evaluated an
   intervention for chronic back pain patients which incorporated fear
   reducing and activating techniques. Primary care patients seen for back
   pain in primary care were screened to identify persons with significant
   activity limitations 8-10 weeks after their visit. Eligible and willing
   patients were randomized (N = 240). A brief, individualized program to
   reduce fear and increase activity levels was delivered by a psychologist
   and physical therapists. Over a 2 year follow-up period, intervention
   patients reported greater reductions in pain-related fear (P < 0.01),
   average pain (P < 0.01) and activity limitations due to back pain (P <
   0.01) relative to control patients. The percent with greater than a
   one-third reduction in Roland Disability Questionnaire scores at 6
   months was 42% among Intervention patients and 24% among control
   patients (P < 0.01). Over the 2 year follow-up, fewer intervention
   patients reported 30 or more days unable to carry out usual activities
   in the prior 3 months (P < 0.01). The adjusted mean difference in
   activity limitation days was 4.5 days at 6 months, 2.8 days at 12
   months, and 6.9 days at 24 months. No differences were observed in the
   percent unemployed or the percent receiving worker's compensation or
   disability benefits, but these outcomes were relatively uncommon. We
   conclude that an intervention integrating fear reducing and activating
   interventions into care for chronic back pain patients produced
   sustained reductions in patient fears, common activity limitations
   related to back pain, and days missed from usual activities due to back
   pain. (C) 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB Objective. Being a victim or a perpetrator of school bullying, the most
   common type of school violence, has been frequently associated with a
   broad spectrum of behavioral, emotional, and social problems. In a
   Korean middle school community sample, this study specifically
   investigated the prevalence of suicidal ideations and behaviors in
   victims, perpetrators, and victim-perpetrators of school bullying and
   compared them with a group of students who were in the same schools and
   were not involved with bullying.
   Methods. In a cross-sectional study, 1718 seventh- and eighth-grade
   students in 2 middle schools participated in the study in October 2000.
   Students completed demographic information, Korean Peer Nomination
   Inventory, and Korean Youth Self-Report.
   Results. Compared with the students who were not involved with school
   bullying, victim-perpetrators reported more suicidal/self-injurious
   behaviors and suicidal ideation in the previous 6 months (odds ratio
   [OR]: 1.9 and 1.9, respectively). In female students, all 3 school
   bullying groups had increased suicidal ideation for the previous 2 weeks
   (OR: 2.8, 2.0, and 2.8, respectively) but not in male students (OR: 0.9,
   1.1, and 1.3, respectively).
   Conclusions. Students who were involved in school bullying, especially
   victim-perpetrators and female students, had significantly higher risks
   for suicide ideation and suicidal behavior when compared with
   individuals who were not involved in school bullying. In addition to
   attempting to decrease bullying in a community, students who are
   involved in school bullying should be the targets for suicide monitoring
   and prevention programs.

AB This article examines two questions. First, what difference does it make
   when approaches developed in cultural sociology are applied more
   broadly? We suggest here that such applications subject theoretical
   assumptions in other sub-fields to investigation, challenge, and
   development by providing the conceptual resources for empirically
   linking micro- and macro-analysis: cultural processes, shaping the
   possibilities and limits of meaning-making, are understood as the
   practical intersection of structure and agency, the switchpoint between
   them. Conversely, what do such applications then imply for the further
   development of cultural sociology? Four issues are highlighted.
   Empirically, they suggest that cultural sociologists should remedy their
   under-emphasis of transnational processes, and also that the influence
   of specialized cultural institutions like art on broader culture
   processes should be reconsidered. Theoretically, they encourage a
   renewed emphasis on understanding the causal significance of culture.
   Finally, the articles here suggest that the proliferation of theoretical
   concepts in cultural sociology creates a productive ambiguity
   encouraging the development and diffusion of the field, but also calls
   for better articulation of the pertinence of divergent analytic tools to
   particular research problems. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB After decades of cross-fertilization between organizational analysis and
   studies of social change, the proliferation of such new themes as
   gender, sexuality, race and ethnicity have invigorated the studies of
   politics, culture and identities in historical sociology. Yet, bringing
   culture into the structural analysis of social change still requires a
   fundamental epistemological reformulation. After examining some
   revisionist efforts, this paper proposes 'a public-centered view' that
   takes the sites of social interactions as a focal point of analysis
   considering meanings and representations as 'emergent properties'
   arising through actions in these sites. The case of the formation of
   Japanese aesthetic culture demonstrates how this public-centered
   approach provides an epistemological linkage to connect meanings with
   the historical structural analysis without reducing the one to the
   other. (c) 2005 published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This article illustrates how more intensive exchanges between migration
   scholars and cultural sociologists would yield greater analytical
   purchase in both fields. It uses tools from cultural sociology to
   illuminate aspects of the transnational migration experience and, in
   turn, brings to light additional dimensions and levels of cultural
   production that cultural sociologists could profitably take into
   account. Cultural sociology asks migration scholars to take culture
   seriously and to pay more explicit attention to the dynamics of
   meaning-making and boundary construction. It asks researchers to look
   not only at the process of adaptation from one culture to another but at
   what is inside the "black box" and how it changes over time. On the
   other hand, transnational migration studies complicate cultural
   sociology by encouraging researchers to move beyond the expectation that
   the nation is the natural container for social life. Instead,
   transnational migration scholarship foregrounds how boundary creation
   and meaning-making can involve multiple cultural repertoires that
   transcend national contexts and are available at multiple levels. (c)

AB This article considers one way to construct "analytic" narratives in
   historical sociology. The author grounds his approach in ongoing
   methodological debates over temporality and sequence in historical
   processes and the assumed trade-off between historical particularity and
   causal generality He promotes narratives that exploit both the
   sequential/ eventful and contextual properties of analytic time, with an
   approach that combines and builds on two emerging developments in
   narrative methodology: the use of rational choice theory and the idea of
   "increasing returns" in path-dependent historical processes. While doing
   narrative in this way will not be appropriate for analyzing all
   historical processes, it can be a useful methodological strategy for
   many of the questions, events, and outcomes that interest historical
   sociologists. The author draws oil his own research program on early
   equal employment law in the mid- to late 1960s to illustrate how this
   method can work in practice.

AB Background: Patients at times disagree with medical recommendations for
   religious reasons. Despite a lively debate about how physicians should
   respond to patients' religious concerns, little is known about how
   physicians actually respond. We explored the ways in which physicians
   interpret and respond to conflict between medical recommendations and
   patients' religious commitments.
   Methods: One-to-one, in-depth, semistructured interviews with 21
   physicians from a range of religious affiliations, specialties, and
   practice settings. Interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed for
   emergent themes through an iterative process of textual analysis
   informed by the principle of constant comparison.
   Results: Conflict introduced by religion is common and occurs in 3 types
   of settings: (1) those in which religious doctrines directly conflict
   with medical recommendations, (2) those that involve an area in which
   there is extensive controversy within the broader society, and (3)
   settings of relative medical uncertainty in which patients "choose faith
   over medicine." In response to such conflict, physicians first seek to
   accommodate patients' ideas by remaining open-minded and flexible in
   their approach. However, if they believe patients' religiously informed
   decisions will cause them to suffer harm, physicians make efforts to
   persuade patients to follow medical recommendations.
   Conclusions: When religiously related conflict arises, physicians appear
   to intuitively navigate a tension between respecting patients'autonomy
   by remaining open-minded and flexible and seeking patients'good by
   persuading them to follow medical recommendations. In such contexts,
   religion and medicine are intertwined, and moral counsel inheres in
   physicians' medical recommendations.

AB Background: Performance of procedures on the recently dead for physician
   training is controversial. It has been suggested that permission be
   obtained. We investigated whether patients and family members would
   grant such permission or if even this request might anger the recently
   bereaved.
   Methods: Physicians administered identical surveys to adult emergency
   department patients and family members in Brooklyn and Oslo to determine
   their willingness to consent for teaching of specific invasive
   techniques in the event of their own death or that of a family member.
   Demographic factors and location (culture) were assessed for effects.
   Results: Willingness to consent was directly related to age of decedent
   and inversely related to perceived invasiveness of the procedure at both
   sites. In every scenario, respondents in Brooklyn were much less willing
   to grant permission (2- to 2.5-fold) than were those in Oslo. In Oslo,
   respondents were more willing to consent for their own bodies to be used
   as training tools than that of a relative. In Brooklyn, 48.5% would be
   angry if approached for permission compared with only 8.4% in Oslo
   (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Asking for permission to perform procedures on the recently
   deceased for physician training purposes may often anger the bereaved.
   The emotional response to the consent request may be culturally
   determined. Increased willingness of individuals to permit the use of
   their bodies in the immediate postmortem period suggests that a
   preauthorization program similar to organ donor cards might be
   acceptable, successful, and ethical.

   Delivery of patient care can be improved by increasing patient/athlete
   satisfaction.
   Objective: To evaluate the satisfaction collegiate student-athletes had
   with their athletic trainer(s) and the athletic training services
   provided at their institutions.
   Design: A survey format was solicited to 40 randomly selected National
   Collegiate Athletic Association Division I and II athletic training
   programs in 4 regions across the United States.
   Setting: Collegiate athletic training environment.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 325 student-athletes from 20
   of the programs solicited agreed to participate. Main Outcome
   Measure(s): The questionnaire was a variation on a previously used
   instrument developed for assessing athletes' perceptions of care.
   Validity and reliability analyses supported use of the instrument. A
   linear regression model was calculated to determine predictors of
   satisfaction score.
   Results: Significant differences in satisfaction scores were observed
   between athletes in high- and low-profile sports and between male and
   female athletes. When sex and sport profile were combined, differences
   in scores were noted between female athletes in high-profile sports and
   males in low-profile sports. Both sex and sport profile were predictors
   of satisfaction among the student-athletes who participated in the
   study.
   Conclusions: Female athletes and athletes in high-profile sports
   demonstrated greater satisfaction with their athletic trainer(s).
   Competitive level did not have a significant influence on satisfaction.

AB This is a critical, systematic review of the relationship between
   socioeconomic status (SES) and HIV infection in women in Southern,
   Central and Eastern Africa. In light of the interest in micro-credit
   programmes and other HIV prevention interventions structured to empower
   women through increasing women's access to funds and education, this
   review examines the epidemiological and public health literature, which
   ascertains the association between low SES using different measurements
   of SES and risk of HIV infection in women. Also, given the focus on
   structural violence and poverty as factors driving the HIV epidemic at.
   a structural/ecological level, as advocated by Paul Farmer and others,
   this study examines the extent to which differences in SES between
   individuals in areas with generalized poverty affect risk for SES. Out
   of 71 studies retrieved, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria including
   30 cross-sectional, one case-control and five prospective cohort or
   nested case-control studies. Thirty-five studies used at least one
   measurement of female's SES and fourteen also included a measurement of
   partner's SES. Studies used variables measuring educational level,
   household. income and occupation or employment status at the individual
   and neighbourhood level to ascertain SES. Of the 36 studies, fifteen
   found no association between SES and HIV infection, twelve found an
   association between high SES and HIV infection, eight found an
   association between low SES and HIV infection and one was mixed. In
   interpreting these results, this review examines the role of potential
   confounders and effect modifiers such as history of STDs, number of
   partners, living in urban or rural areas and time and location of study
   in sub-Saharan Africa. It is argued that STDs and number of partners are
   on the causal pathway under investigation between HIV and SES and should
   not be adjusted as confounders in any analysis. In conclusion, it is
   argued that in low-income sub-Saharan Africans countries, where poverty
   is widespread, increasing access to resources for women may initially
   increase risk of HIV or have no effect on risk-taking behaviours. In
   some parts of Southern Africa where per capita income is higher and
   within-country inequalities in wealth are greater, studies suggest that
   increasing SES may decrease risk. This review concludes that increased
   SES may have differential effects on married and unmarried women and
   further studies should use multiple measures of SES. Lastly, it is
   suggested that the partner's SES (measured by education or
   income/employment) may be a stronger predictor of female HIV serostatus
   than measures of female SES.

   In the case of previous games analyzed in the literature, these

AB This essay provides an overview of recent anthropological work on the
   relationship between racial thought and the visual technologies of
   photography and film. I argue that anthropologists have moved away from
   a concern with representation per se in favor of the more complex
   discursive and political landscapes opened up by the concepts of media
   and the archive. My review of this work focuses on the affective
   register of suspicion that has surrounded both visual methods and the
   idea of race in anthropology. Whereas this suspicion has led some to
   dismiss visual technologies as inherently racializing or objectifying, I
   argue that it is possible to reclaim suspicion as a productive site for
   rethinking the particular forms of presence, uncertainty and contingency
   that characterize both ethnographic and visual accounts of the world. I
   begin by discussing recent work on the photographic archive, early
   fieldwork photography, and the subsequent move in the 1960s and 1970s
   from still photography to film and video within the emergent subfield of
   visual anthropology. Finally, I consider how more recent work on the
   problem of race in favor of descriptive accounts of mediascapes.

   transformed social, political, and intellectual conditions for
   ethnographic research among indigenous peoples in North America, what
   forms has such research come to take at the turn of the twenty-first
   century? The review considers significant trends and innovations in
   research sites and topics, research methodologies, theoretical
   orientations, and forms of representation. It also assesses the
   distinctive strengths and limitations posed by ethnographic research for
   scholars engaging with significant dimensions of contemporary indigenous
   life, including struggles for rights, resources, recognition, and
   language vitality in both the national and international arenas; the
   repatriation and sovereignty movements; the development of tribal
   casinos, tourist complexes, cultural centers, and media outlets;
   continued social and economic marginalization of many indigenous
   peoples; and challenges posed by neoliberalism and globalization to
   tribal governments and economies.

   categorized into shifting racial landscapes in the new Europe. Tracing
   the racial genealogy of the immigrant through European and Europeanist
   migration studies, the successive construction of overlapping tropes of
   the nomad, the laborer, the uprooted victim, the hybrid cosmopolite, and
   the (Muslim) translematization of the immigrant as the object of
   national integration. If migration studies have effectively tended to
   racialize migrants into a new savage slot, recent ethnographies of the
   immigrant experience in Europe point to ways in which immigrant and
   diasporic groups cross racial frontiers and enact solidarity across
   class and cultural lines.

AB This paper examines the relationship between traffic fatality risk and
   per capita income and uses it to forecast traffic fatalities by
   geographic region. Equations for the road death rate
   (fatalities/population) and its components-the rate of motorization
   (vehicles/population) and fatalities per vehicle (F/V) - are estimated
   using panel data from 1963 to 1999 for 88 countries. The natural
   logarithm of F/P, V/P, and F/V are expressed as spline (piecewise
   linear) functions of the logarithm of real per capita GDP (measured in
   1985 international prices). Region-specific time trends during the
   period 1963-1999 are modeled in linear and log-linear form. These models
   are used to project traffic fatalities and the stock of motor vehicles
   to 2020.
   The per capita income at which traffic fatality
   risk(fatalities/population) begins to decline is $8600 (1985
   international dollars) when separate time trends are used for each
   geographic region. This turning point is driven by the rate of decline
   in fatalities/vehicles as income rises since vehicles/population, while
   increasing with income at a decreasing rate, never declines with
   economic growth.
   Projections of future traffic fatalities suggest that the global road
   death toll will grow by approximately 66% over the next twenty years.
   This number, however, reflects divergent rates of change in different
   parts of the world: a decline in fatalities in high-income countries of
   approximately 28% versus an increase in fatalities of almost 92% in
   China and 147% in India. The road death rate is projected to rise to
   approximately 2 per 10,000 persons in developing countries by 2020,
   while it will fall to less than 1 per 10,000 in high-income countries.

   reciprocal links between substance use and engagement in substance-free
   activities. The current study used an experimental manipulation to
   further investigate the relationship between substance use and
   substance-free behaviors in a nonclinical sample of 133 young adults.
   Participants completed surveys on substance use and engagement in
   specific substance-free behaviors (exercise and creative behaviors) on
   two occasions separated by a 28-day interval. During the 4 weeks
   separating assessments, the 105 participants who reported recent
   substance use were randomly assigned to one of three experimental
   conditions with corresponding behavioral instructions: substance use
   reduction (SR), activity increase (AI), and a no-change control.
   Participants assigned to both the SR and AI conditions reported a
   significant decrease in their substance use behavior. These results are
   consistent with previous studies in demonstrating that decreases in
   substance use can be achieved by increasing engagement in substance-free
   behaviors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   presents the findings associated with the initial measurement
   development phase of such an assessment tool. The initial results are
   promising, suggesting that the Significant Other Checklist (a) has

AB College problem drinking and social anxiety are significant public
   health concerns with highly negative consequences. College students are
   faced with a variety of novel social situations and situations
   encouraging alcohol consumption. The current study involved developing a
   path model of college problem drinking, including social anxiety, in 316
   college students referred to an alcohol intervention due to a campus
   alcohol violation. Contrary to hypotheses, social anxiety generally had
   an inverse relationship with problem drinking. As expected, perceived
   drinking norms had important positive, direct effects on drinking
   variables. However, the results generally did not support the hypotheses
   regarding the mediating or moderating function of the valuations of
   expected effects and provided little support for the mediating function
   of alcohol expectancies in the relations among social anxiety and
   alcohol variables. Therefore, it seems that the influence of peers may
   be more important for college students than alcohol expectancies and
   valuations of alcohol's effects are. College students appear to be a
   unique population in respect to social anxiety and problem drinking. The
   implications of these results for college prevention and intervention
   programs were discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   (FS), current smokers (CS), and never smokers (NS) in a sample of 2029
   seventh to twelfth grade girls living in a rural area of Virginia. We
   were particularly interesting in examining variables related to FS.
   Compared to CS, FS reported lower levels of delinquency, less coping by
   taking drugs, less availability of cigarettes, and less alcohol and
   marijuana use. They also reported less depression, fewer suicidal
   thoughts, and fewer suicide attempts than CS. FS reported spending more
   time in community clubs, had higher self-esteem, obtained higher grades,
   had more parental monitoring, more parent attachment, and more school
   attachment than CS. Logistical regression analysis predicting current or
   former smoking status revealed significant effects on coping by taking
   drugs, alcohol use, depression, grades, parental monitoring, and
   perceived availability of cigarettes. The findings have implications for
   smoking intervention programs with adolescent girls in rural areas. (C)

   young offender facilities. Overall, 37% of participants identified
   themselves as bully-victims, 32% as pure bullies, 23% as not involved,
   and 8% as pure victims. In comparison to males, females were more likely
   to report being involved with bullying in some capacity, particularly as
   pure victims, and being bullied by sexual touching and comments. Pure
   victims reported higher rates of psychological distress and suicidal
   behaviors than those youth not involved in bullying, and pure bullies
   were more likely to have been previously incarcerated and affiliated
   with a gang. Bully-victims reported the highest rates of previous abuse,
   peer victimization in the community, drug use, and suicide attempts
   while in custody. All groups, including pure victims, reported high
   rates of bullying others in the community. Treatment providers should
   recognize that offenders who are victims are often bullies as well, and
   be alert to broad mental health needs among victims and bully-victims.
   Given the prevalence and potential serious consequences of bullying, the
   development of anti-bullying policies appears to be an important step in

   including highly active antiretroviral therapy) and notions of viral
   load on sexual risk practices. This was an exploratory cross-sectional
   study of a nonrandom sample of 395 homosexually active Latino men in New
   York City. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was used
   focusing on perceptions about HIV/AIDS, HIV treatment medications and
   viral load, risk perceptions, HIV status, and sexual partners and
   practices in the past 6 months. HIV-positive participants taking HIV
   medications, those who knew their viral loads, and those who had
   undetectable viral loads did not report significantly different
   frequencies of high-risk ( receptive or insertive) unprotected anal
   intercourse (UAI) in comparison to other HIV-positive individuals in the
   sample. Perceptions about HIV status ( assuming same status) and viral
   load ( penetrating partner or letting partner penetrate one) were
   related to significantly higher high-risk UAI in the past 6 months. HIV
   prevention strategies for homosexually active Latino men should not only
   address the basic issue of assuming similar HIV status but also need to
   examine misconstructions of the transmissibility of HIV as a result of
   undetectable viral load.

   enrolled in the world's first phase III HIV vaccine efficacy trial at
   five US sites, regarding their risk reduction counselling experiences
   and their perceptions of its impact on risk behaviour. Respondents
   ranged in age from 20 to 58 years and were predominately white (71.4%)
   in racial/ethnic origin. Systematic qualitative analysis revealed that a
   positive counselling experience meant having good rapport with clinic
   staff. Differences in attitudes toward counselling were related to
   either a personal approach of balancing an enjoyable sex life with safe
   sex behaviours ( balancing risks) or accepting the consequences of risky
   sexual behaviour rather than making changes ( risk homeostasis).
   Respondents seeking to balance risks indicated that they saw themselves
   engaging in safer sexual behaviour almost twice as often as in riskier
   behaviours. They perceived counselling and behavioural risk assessments
   to help increase their awareness of personal risk-taking behaviours.
   Conversely, those with a risk homeostasis approach reported that they
   had established sexual boundaries prior to trial participation that had
   thus far proven to be effective in avoiding HIV infection, and that they
   were comfortable with the level of risk taken. Thus, risk reduction
   counselling had little to no influence on their sexual practices. Some
   of these men also indicated that while they had not found the risk
   reduction information imparted to them by clinic staff to be novel,
   counselling was beneficial in reinforcing their HIV/AIDS and safe sex
   knowledge base.

AB Population segments at highest risk for HIV are often hidden,
   marginalized, and hard to reach by conventional prevention programmes.
   This pattern is especially true in Central and Eastern Europe, where
   major HIV epidemics have recently appeared, where population members do
   not perceive themselves as belonging to a community, and where there is
   little precedence for strong community-based organization service
   programmes. In these circumstances, naturally existing intact social
   networks still can be targeted by prevention programmes. HIV prevention
   interventions undertaken with at-risk social networks can establish new
   group norms, reduce the risk behaviour of network members, and can reach
   'hidden' members of a population known personally to leaders of the
   social networks. This article illustrates a methodology and a practical
   description for: ( 1) accessing high-risk social networks in a community
   population; ( 2) identifying and enumerating the membership of the
   social networks; ( 3) identifying the social leadership of the networks;
   and ( 4) establishing the HIV risk behaviour levels of the recruited
   networks. To illustrate how social network methods can be applied in the
   field, the article provides case study reports of HIV prevention
   fieldwork practice targeting high-risk networks of young men who have
   sex with men and young heterosexual adults in St Petersburg, Russia.
   Although there is an extensive conceptual literature on the influence of
   social networks on risk behaviour, this article describes specific and
   practical techniques that can be in the development of approaches for
   social network-based interventions.

AB To be effective and sustainable, HIV-prevention interventions need to be
   sufficiently powerful to counteract prevailing social norms and diffuse
   through the targeted community to provide social reinforcement for
   behaviour change. Social structural and environmental factors are major
   influences on HIV-related behaviours yet the dearth of conceptualization
   and operationalization of these factors impede progress in intervention
   development. In this paper we propose a social ecological perspective to
   intervention and highlight relevant theories from social psychology and
   organizational behaviour literatures. We examine social networks and
   social settings as micro-structural and environmental influences on HIV
   risk behaviours, social identities and norms, and as important targets
   for HIV-prevention intervention. Intervention approaches are proposed
   that target networks and behavioural settings and provide participants
   with socially meaningful and rewarding behavioural options that are
   consistent with valued prosocial identities or roles. Examples are
   presented on how such an approach has been utilized in prior HIV
   prevention interventions, including our social network-oriented
   intervention that trained disadvantaged former and current illicit drug
   users to conduct peer outreach. We describe how behavioural
   interventions may enhance or introduce new prosocial identities and
   social roles, and that network members may confer social approval to
   reinforce these identities and roles, leading to sustained behavioural
   risk reduction and changes in risk behaviour norms.

AB Brazil has the second largest number of reported AIDS cases in the
   world. Porto Alegre, like most other large urban centres in Brazil, has
   been greatly impacted by an AIDS epidemic driven by high rates of drug
   use and risky sexual behaviours. While epidemiologic surveillance of
   HIV/AIDS and treatment initiatives for HIV-infected individuals are well
   developed in Brazil, comparatively little attention has focused on
   developing interventions directed toward high-risk populations.
   Intervention programmes, particularly those tailored for chronic drug
   users, are lacking. This pilot project successfully adapted and tailored
   a cognitive behavioural HIV intervention developed in the US to the
   cultural setting in Porto Alegre. The project established feasibility
   and acceptability of the approach for targeting risky drug and sexual
   behaviours among a group of male Brazilian drug users. A sample of 120
   male cocaine users was recruited from a public health clinic serving the
   target population in the city of Porto Alegre. The average age of the
   participants was 29; they averaged less than 8 years of formal
   education, and less than half (41%) were married. Lifetime self-reported
   drug use was high with 93% reporting cocaine use, 87% reporting crack
   use, and 100% reporting marijuana use. 43% of the sample reported ever
   injecting drugs. Reports of risky sexual behaviours were similarly
   elevated. Almost half (45%) tested positive for HIV Preliminary evidence
   suggests that intervention acceptability was high among participants.
   Given the reported high risk sexual and drug use behaviours among these
   men, HIV interventions must be evaluated and expanded to include this
   population as well as their sexual partners.

AB The highest incidence rates of HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean are recorded in
   heterosexual and youth populations. With sparse prevention and
   intervention programmes in place, there is a pressing need to address
   the HIV/AIDS risk of youth. The objective of this analysis was to
   describe the extent of youth risk behaviour in St. Maarten and explore
   the relationship between quality of parental-child relationship and
   adolescent HIV risk behaviours. The sample consisted of 1,078 students
   (age range 14-18, mean 15.6 (s.d. 1.7). The data were collected by
   self-report survey in the Spring of 2001 in the classrooms of all seven
   secondary schools in St. Maarten. The survey instrument included
   demographic information, and used questions derived from the Center for
   Disease Control's (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) to assess
   health risk behaviour prevalence, including tobacco, alcohol, and drug
   use, and sexual activity. The survey also asked youth to rate their
   relationship with their parents. Analysis showed a relatively high rate
   of risk behaviour in this school population. Multivariate analysis
   showed that a 'great' relationship with both parents, as perceived by
   the student, was significantly associated with lower rates of tobacco
   and alcohol use as well as lower rates of sexual activity.

AB HIV risk through needle sharing is now an emerging phenomenon in Africa.
   This article describes the practices that heroin users are producing as
   they establish the rules and organization surrounding their drug use.
   Their practices and interactions reveal the ways that they become
   initiated into its use, how they progress to injecting, and the
   important role of local neighbourhood hangouts in facilitating this
   process. Their practices, interactions and narratives also provide
   insights into what may be the most appropriate HIV-prevention
   interventions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted during the
   months of February and July 2003 with 51 male and female injectors
   residing in 8 neighbourhoods in the Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Interviews
   were content coded and codes were collapsed into emergent themes around
   hangout places, initiation of heroin use, and progression to injecting.
   Interviews reveal that Dar es Salaam injectors begin smoking heroin in
   hangout areas with their friends, either because of peer pressure,
   desire, or trickery. One hangout place in particular, referred to as the
   'geto' (ghetto) is the main place where the organization and rules
   governing heroin use are produced. Three main types of heroin 'ghettoes'
   are operating in Dar es Salaam. As users build a tolerance for the drug
   they move along a continuum of practices until they begin to inject.
   Injecting heroin is a comparatively recent practice in Africa and
   coincides with: (1) Tanzania transitioning to becoming a heroin
   consuming community; (2) the growing importance of youth culture, (3)
   the technical innovation of injecting practices and the introduction and
   ease of use of white heroin; and (4) heroin smokers, sniffers, and
   inhalers perceived need to escalate their use through a more effective
   and satisfying form of heroin ingestion.

AB In the US Virgin Islands 575 cases of AIDS had been reported to the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through mid-2003. Although
   males continue to be most affected by HIV/AIDS, the feminization of the
   epidemic is evidenced by recent data showing rates of infection
   increasing rapidly among women. This paper focuses on the role of
   substance abuse and the socially and culturally based gender issues that
   influence risk and vulnerability to HIV in this setting. 254 chronically
   drug- or alcohol-involved men and women were recruited and interviewed
   using targeted sampling strategies. Crack use was overwhelmingly
   reported by females when compared to males (84.7% vs. 48.8%). Women also
   reported a significantly higher number of sexual partners in the past
   month (5.6 vs. 2.3) and significantly more occasions of unprotected
   vaginal sexual contact (11.2 vs. 6.5). Rates of self-reported HIV
   infection were elevated among women as well (8.8% vs. 1.4%). Women's
   precarious economic position and lack of access to legitimate
   income-generating activities tended to drive them into 'survival sex' to
   support their subsistence and drug needs. As such, it would appear that
   substance abuse has an emerging role in the spread of the epidemic in
   St. Croix, particularly among women.

AB The Republic of South Africa has become an epicentre of heterosexual HIV
   transmission among Black women, and the interface between violence
   against women, substance abuse, and HIV risk is becoming evident. This
   paper describes the characteristics of Black South African women who
   engage in sex work in Pretoria and examines their intersecting
   experiences of high-risk sexual behaviour, substance abuse, and
   victimization. Ninety-three women were recruited into the study. Field
   staff collected biological measures of drug use and administered a
   structured, self-report interview. Findings indicate that young South
   African women who engage in sex work and use drugs rely on this activity
   as their main source of income and are supporting other family members.
   The majority of sample women reported experiencing some victimization at
   the hand of men, either clients or boyfriends, with many reporting
   childhood abuse histories, young women also report great fear of future
   victimization. Findings also suggest that as a result of their decreased
   likelihood of using protection, women who reported any sexual or
   physical victimization are at increased risk for HIV and other STIs.
   Results support the critical need for targeted, comprehensive
   interventions that address substance abuse, sexual risk, and violence as
   interrelated phenomena.

AB This survey of individuals seeking methadone maintenance treatment was
   pursued to document the parenting status of drug-dependent men and
   clarify ways their status as parents differs from that of drug-dependent
   women. Data concerning demographic characteristics, drug abuse history,
   and parenting status were systematically coded from the medical records
   of 362 men and 162 women seeking methadone maintenance treatment during
   a 12-month period. Analysis of parenting status by gender indicated
   that, although a greater proportion of women were the parent of at least
   one biological child, there were actually more fathers than mothers
   within the cohort. Among the parents, fathers were more likely to have
   been abusing opioids when they first became a parent, and they were more
   likely to be living away from their children. There were no significant
   gender differences in the number of children or the average age of
   children. The results suggested that fathering may be an important, but
   largely neglected, treatment issue for drug-abusing men.

AB Increased interest in longitudinal social networks and the recognition
   that visualization fosters theoretical insight create a need for dynamic
   network visualizations, or network "movies." This article confronts
   theoretical questions surrounding the temporal representations of social
   networks and technical questions about how best to link network change
   to changes in the graphical representation. The authors divide network
   movies into ( 1) static flip books, where node position remains constant
   but edges cumulate over time, and ( 2) dynamic movies, where nodes move
   as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly
   useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected
   networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples
   demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software
   program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.

AB Scholarly interest in body size has increased in concert with recent
   efforts to shape and assess bodies in particular ways within
   industrialized social contexts. Attending to both overt and covert
   references to Eurocentric body projects, this chapter reviews literature
   in anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies that addresses the
   cultural politics of body size in various parts of the world. It begins
   with a discussion of biocultural paradigms, which accept certain
   biomedical categories even when challenging or reconfiguring their
   hegemonic power. Next is a survey of works analyzing body size within
   "non-Western" groups as well as European and North American subgroups.
   These studies often employ culturally powerful "Western" constructs as
   foils, an approach that risks cultural othering. The analysis then turns
   to the extensive literature that unpacks dominant Euro-American body
   practices and discourses. Here, diverse perspectives on several key
   concerns in sociocultural anthropology are considered; concepts of
   culture and power, theories of the body and embodiment, and
   understandings of human agency vary in instructive ways. The chapter
   concludes with a review of scholarship on postcolonial processes and
   representations that incorporates a critical perspective on Eurocentric
   preoccupations with body size.

AB This review proposes a model for analyzing the power of ideologies of
   communication in producing subjectivities, organizing them
   hierarchically, and recruiting people to occupy them. By way of
   illustration, it compares this productive capacity, which is herein
   termed communicability, with schemes of racialization and
   medicalization. The argument draws on critical discourse analysis,
   conversational analysis, post-Habermasian research on publics, Bakhtin,
   Bourdieu, Foucault, and work on language ideologies to synthesize a
   framework for studying spheres of communicability. The concept is then
   used in exploring how constructions of race and health intersect in some
   of the most powerful spheres of communicability-those associated with
   colonial medicine, HIV/AIDS, severe accute respiratory syndrome (SARS),
   Alzheimer's, genetics, clinical trials, "race-based medicine," organ
   transplant, and biostatistics. The review attempts to connect linguistic
   anthropology and discourse analysis more productively to medical
   anthropology, the history of medicine and public health, medical
   sociology, public health, genetics, and science studies.

AB The technological ability to alter biology, along with the social
   conditions and cultural expectations that enable such transformations,
   is spawning a variety of techniques that augment bodily forms and
   functions. These techniques, collectively known as enhancement
   technologies, aim to improve human characteristics, including appearance
   and mental or physical functioning, often beyond what is 'normal' or
   necessary for life and well-being. Humans have always modified their
   bodies. What distinguishes these techniques is that bodies and selves
   become the objects of improvement work, unlike previous efforts in
   modernity to achieve progress through social and political institutions.
   There are profound effects on sociality and subjectivity. This chapter
   reviews analytical approaches through which researchers have attempted
   to illuminate the practices, moral and economic reasoning, cultural
   assumptions and institutional contexts constituting enhancements,
   framing the discussion by examining the concept of the normal body.
   Examples from cosmetic, neurological and genetic enhancements will

AB In the wake of critiques that have rendered problematic such familiar
   objects of study as culture and social structure, anthropologists
   seeking ways to engage ethnographically with the complexities of the

   generally continue, however, to be framed as just that-as objects.
   Rather than pursue the "anthropology of" any particular object that
   preexists ethnography, anthropologists should find ways of bringing the
   openness and creativity of ethnographic work more boldly into the
   theoretical framing of what it is that they study. I propose here the
   notion of surfacing the body interior as one framing device that may
   help facilitate such ethnographic explorations into bodies, their
   interiors, and their surfaces as contingent configurations made and
   unmade through practices that are at once social, material, and

AB Law and society, though not a field in itself, is the object of a
   growing movement that studies legal systems using tools of social
   science. Founded by sociologists, the movement now includes
   representatives of all the social sciences. It has developed strong
   organizations in the United States and in a number of other countries.
   Its adherents share a number of basic assumptions; they reject extreme
   ideas of legal autonomy and stress instead the dependence of law on its
   social context. Key components of the legal order, and thus key objects
   of study, are substance, procedures, structures, and legal culture.
   Scholars focus on the actual forces that produce law and on the impact
   of legal interventions. Sanctions, the peer group, and the internal
   moral sense are among the factors that determine actual impact. Much has
   been accomplished in the field, although much remains to be done, and
   translating findings into policy is often quite problematic.

AB In an agency relationship, one party acts on behalf of another. It is
   curious that a concept that could not be more profoundly sociological
   does not have a niche in the sociological literature. This essay begins
   with the economics paradigm of agency theory, which casts a very long
   shadow over the social sciences, and then traces how these ideas diffuse
   to and are transformed (if at all) in the scholarship produced in
   business schools, political science, law, and sociology. I cut a swathe
   through the social fabric where agency relationships are especially
   prevalent and examine some of the institutions, roles, forms of social
   organization, deviance, and strategies of social control that deliver
   agency and respond to its vulnerabilities, and I consider their impact.
   Finally, I suggest how sociology might make better use of and contribute
   to agency theory.

   information on the extent to which out-of-pocket expenses are
   financially burdensome for families of children with special health care
   needs (CSHCN). To also compare utilization and expenditure patterns for
   children with and without special health care needs.
   Design: We used data from the 2000 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
   (MEPS). We present univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistics on
   utilization and expenditures adjusted for the complex sample design.
   Participants: The 2000 MEPS data set contains 6965 children younger than
   18 years. Using the CSHCN definition adopted by the federal Maternal and
   Child Health Bureau and operationalized using the CSHCN Screener, 949
   children (15.6%) were identified as children with special health care
   needs.
   Main Outcome Measures: Compared with other children, CSHCN had 3 times
   higher health care expenditures ($2099 vs $628; P<.01). The 15.6% of
   CSHCN accounted for 42.1% of total medical care costs (excluding dental
   costs) and 33.6% of total health care costs (including dental costs)
   attributed to children in 2000. Families of CSHCN were best protected
   against inpatient hospital care expenses and most exposed to dental care
   expenses. Families of CSHCN experiencing high out-of-pocket expenses
   (exceeding 5% of family income) were approximately 11 times more likely
   to be from households with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty
   level (odds ratio, 10.9; 95% confidence interval, 3.55-33.76) than to be
   from families with incomes at or above 400% of the federal poverty

AB Objective: To examine the long-term effects of the Seattle Social
   Development Project intervention in promoting positive adult functioning
   and preventing mental health problems, crime, and substance use
   (including tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs) at 21 years of age.
   Design: This nonrandomized controlled trial followed up participants to
   21 years of age, 9 years after the intervention ended. We compared the
   following 3 intervention conditions: a full 6-year intervention (grades
   1 through 6); a late 2-year intervention (grades 5 and 6 only); and a
   no-treatment control condition.
   Setting: Eighteen public elementary schools serving diverse
   neighborhoods, including high-crime neighborhoods, of Seattle, Wash.
   Participants: A sex-balanced, multiethnic sample of 605 participants
   across the 3 conditions who completed interviews at 21 years of age (94%
   of the original sample in these conditions).
   Interventions: Teacher training in classroom instruction and management,
   child social and emotional skill development, and parent training.
   Main Outcome Measures: Self-reports of functioning in school and work,
   emotional and mental health, and crime and substance use at 21 years of
   age and official court records.
   Results: Broad significant effects on functioning in school and work and
   on emotional and mental health were found. Fewer significant effects on
   crime and substance use were found at 21 years of age. Most outcomes had
   a consistent dose effect, with the strongest effects in subjects in the
   full-intervention group and effects in the late-intervention group
   between those in the full-intervention and control groups.
   Conclusions: A theory-guided preventive intervention that strengthened
   teaching and parenting practices and taught children interpersonal
   skills during the elementary grades had wide-ranging beneficial effects
   on functioning in early adulthood.

AB For thousands of years, various cultures have practiced the art of
   "human body modification". This modification may be subtle, as seen in
   common tattooing and piercing, or dramatic as in the binding of feet in
   China and the lip plates of Ethiopia Of all the forms of human
   modification, probably one of the best documented is that of intentional
   cranial deformation. However, the reason for altering cranial shape was
   often for more than just aesthetic "beautification", but rather often
   played a significant cultural or symbolic role. In this article, we will
   briefly explore the cultural practice of artificial cranial deformation
   and discuss how similar methods are now used in contemporary medicine to
   treat infants with cranial deformities (deformational plagiocephaly).

AB Objective: To evaluate answers to the following questions among American
   Samoans: What is cancer? What causes cancer? And what can you do to
   prevent cancer?
   Design: Focus groups (four with women and four with men),
   Settings: Pago Pago and the Manu'a islands, American Samoa; Honolulu,
   Hawaii; Los Angeles, California.
   Participants: 80 self-reported Samoan men and women over the age of 18
   years, selected through non-probability purposive sampling with help
   from Samoan community-based organizations.
   Measurement: Qualitative content analysis of focus findings to identify
   themes.
   Results: The concepts that cancer was not a Samoan illness, that failure
   to follow fa'aSamoa (the traditional Samoan way of life) could lead to
   cancer, and that a return to fa'aSamoa could prevent cancer were the
   prevalent themes in the focus groups.
   Conclusion: The value that Samoans place on fa'aSamoa, a traditional
   healthy lifestyle, provides insights into the design of future
   intervention programs aimed at improving cancer control in this
   population. (c) 2004 International Society for Preventive Oncology.

AB Individual variation in the phase and amplitude of human circadian
   rhythms is well known, but the impact of heritable factors on such
   variation is less clear. We estimated the narrow-sense heritability for
   selected circadian and sleep timing, quality, and duration measures
   among related members of the Hutterites, an endogamous, religious
   community ( n =521 participants). "Morningness-eveningness (M/E), a
   stable trait reflecting circadian phase, was evaluated using the
   Composite Scale (CS). Subjective sleep measures were assessed using the
   Sleep Timing Questionnaire. Initial analyses reconfirmed the impact of
   age on M/E. Previously reported correlations between M/E scores and the
   sleep measures were also noted, demonstrating the construct validity of
   the questionnaires among the participants. Following corrections for
   age, gender, and colony of residence, significant narrow-sense
   heritability was noted for M/E (23%). The heritability for subjective
   sleep measures (related to timing, duration, and quality) were
   statistically significant for all but one variable, and varied between
   12.4% and 29.4%. Thus, significant heritable influences on human
   circadian phase and subjective sleep indices can be detected through
   family-based studies. In view of the impact of circadian malfunction on
   human health, it may be worthwhile to map genetic factors impacting
   circadian and sleep variation.

AB Given that social anxiety disorder is a common, chronic, debilitating
   disorder and socially anxious women appear to have different experiences
   related to social development and social support than men, it is
   essential that the gender differences in social anxiety and social
   support be understood. The present study examined perceived social
   support quantity and satisfaction in 23 women and 28 men seeking
   treatment for social anxiety disorder. Contrary to expectations, men and
   women did not differ on measures of social support. However, younger,
   unmarried women reported having smaller social support networks and less
   satisfaction with their social support networks than older, married
   women. Analyses of socially anxious men did not reveal such a pattern.
   The current study provides preliminary evidence that younger, single
   women have social support networks that are less satisfying than the
   social support networks of older, married women. Inclusion of social
   support modules within a cognitive behavioral treatment approach for
   social anxiety disorder may be warranted, particularly for young,
   unmarried women.

AB In the last 50 years, changes in cultural and scientific realities and
   customs have resulted in a worldwide epidemic of sexually transmitted
   diseases (STD). This is a multi-factorial problem resulting in part
   from:
   1) an increased permissiveness in sexual attitudes in the Western world
   that results in earlier onset of intercourse and increased numbers of
   partners and types of sex acts;
   2) a global transportation network that facilitates contacts and
   interactions between urban and rural areas as well as between countries
   resulting in migration and spread of infections;
   3) an emergence of new and mutated forms of pathogens with increased
   capabilities to cause infections and for which there are no available
   vaccines or therapies; and,
   4) at risk populations in developing countries who are susceptible to
   these pathogens while having societal infrastructures that lack basic
   health education and proper access to healthcare.
   Overwhelming examples of increasing and emerging STD pathogens exist in
   the early twenty-first century. These include human immunodeficiency
   virus type 1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency
   syndrome (AIDS), with over 42 million current cases of infection, 20
   million deaths to date, and an estimated 500,000 deaths per year; human
   papillomavirus (HPV) infections, the causative agents of genital warts
   and cervical cancer, with approximately 1 in 4 women harboring virus DNA
   in genital epithelium, 1-3 percent of women showing symptoms of
   infection and 250,000 deaths per year in women worldwide from cervical
   cancer; and numerous others.
   Topical microbicides have been proposed as agents to break the chain of
   transmission in these infections by providing chemical, biological,
   and/or physical barriers to infection by blocking and/or inactivating
   pathogens at the mucosal surface where infection can occur. For many
   sexually transmitted infections, vaccines do not exist, and therapeutic
   agents are only partially effective, expensive, and difficult to
   distribute. In addition, female partners in many relationships do not
   control pregnancy or STD risk and may benefit from discrete methods,
   other than condoms, that would provide protection. Thus, microbicides
   should be valuable additions to preventing these diseases if they can be
   shown effective.
   Currently, 62 microbicides are in development with 6 entering Phase III
   clinical trials, 11 entering Phase I clinical trials, and 44 in
   pre-clinical development. In this review, we will describe many of the
   principles of microbicide mechanisms and give examples of major types of
   microbicides and their actions. Space precludes a complete description
   of all of the agents and their mechanisms of action. We will also put
   forth the argument for alkyl sulfate microbicides, including sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS), agents that are in active development in our
   laboratories.

AB The HIV-1 epidemic continues to spread at a rate of over 15, 000 new
   cases daily. HIV-1 transmission through heterosexual contact became the
   dominant risk for women globally. About half of the over 40 million
   HIV-1 infected individuals worldwide are now women. The lack of
   empowerment of women is the fundamental cause for the rampant spread of
   HIV-1 in women. Topical microbicides applied intravaginally offer an
   option for female-initiated HIV-1 prevention. There is an urgent need to
   develop microbicides with and without contraceptive qualities to also
   address sociocultural settings where the woman's status is linked to
   fertility.
   A safe and efficacious anti-HIV-1 vaginal formulation is not yet
   available though a large number of candidates are in preclinical or
   clinical studies. Presently marketed topical microbicides are by and
   large toxic and damage the vaginal mucosa with frequent use.
   The microbicidal system of alkylureas evaluated here lends itself to
   contraceptive and non-contraceptive anti- HIV-1 formulations.
   Alkylureas are agents that irreversibly disrupt free and intracellular
   HIV-1, have a wide margin of safety and are spermicidal above their
   virucidal concentration without any mucosal toxicity. Butylurea, the
   lead compound is also effective against other sexually transmitted
   diseases (STDs) while sparing the normal vaginal flora. Alkylureas with
   longer alkyl chains still have to be explored and may have a greater
   selective microbicidality.

AB The classical attachment theory holds to the notion of a monotropic
   model. Such a model leads to a view of the mother as first and most
   important figure in an infant's life. A polytropic view of attachment
   moves us toward a model of simultaneous and multiple attachment figures.
   In particular, it is argued that peer attachment is a separate but
   related system. A review of children's peer relationships, including
   siblings, leads to the consideration of a social network model in which
   a variety of different people satisfy a variety of different needs of
   the child. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Research on the development of social relations has been largely
   fragmented along role-specific lines and dominated conceptually by
   attachment theory. The Convoy Model is presented as an alternative to
   traditional approaches that fail to capture the complexity of social
   relationships across time and context. Research based on the model
   converges with that of other investigators to indicate that children
   benefit from the presence of multiple relations that play diverse roles
   in their lives, although the importance of specific relations may vary
   across individuals. A broader conceptualization of social relations is
   needed to address the place of attachment figures within a larger
   network of developmentally significant relations. Copyright (C) 2005 S.

AB Framed within recent developments in genre theory, this paper examines
   personal storytelling as practiced by working-class children and their
   families. Although both working-class and middle-class children
   encounter versions of oral storytelling that embody a personal
   perspective, these versions privilege different slants on experience.
   Drawing on a program of research that spans several decades and two
   European American working-class communities, we attempt to characterize
   the working-class slant on its own terms, not simply as a departure from
   a middle-class standard. We conclude that the working-class slant
   encourages children to see that they have the right and resources to
   narrate their own experiences in self-dramatizing ways, but that the
   right to be heard and to have one's point of view accepted cannot be
   taken for granted. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Human systems, including institutional systems and informal social
   networks, are a major arena of modern life. We argue that distinct forms
   of pragmatic reasoning or 'strategic thinking' are required to exercise
   agency within such systems. This article explores the development of
   strategic thinking in a youth activism program in which young people
   worked for social change. These youth came to understand different human
   systems, the school board, teachers, and students, and they learned to
   employ three strategic modes of reasoning: seeking strategic
   information, framing communications to the audience, and sequential
   contingency thinking. Although youth described themselves as agents of
   their development, adults played important roles in supporting their
   experience of a cycle of experiential learning. These findings suggest
   how the new cognitive potentials of adolescence allow youth to develop
   modes of reasoning that expand their capacity to exercise agency over a
   longer arc of time and across a wider interpersonal space.

   unclear who incurred the costs of enforcement in our evolutionary past.
   Theoretical work suggests that human cooperation may be promoted if
   people believe in supernatural punishment for moral transgressions. This
   theory is supported by new work in cognitive psychology and by anecdotal
   ethnographic evidence, but formal quantitative tests remain to be done.
   Using data from 186 societies around the globe, I test whether the
   likelihood of supernatural punishment-indexed by the importance of
   moralizing "high gods' is associated with cooperation.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to document the prevalence of
   households with underweight and overweight persons (henceforth referred
   to as dual burden households) and their association with income and
   urban residence. The explorations by urban residence and income will
   test whether dual burden households differ from 'underweight only' and
   'overweight only' households, respectively. These comparisons are
   relevant to differentiating or adapting nutrition-related interventions
   wherever obesity and undernutrition cluster at the household level.
   Population: Data analysis is based on national surveys conducted in
   Brazil, China, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, Russia, Vietnam and the
   United States.
   Methods: All persons were first classified into categories for
   underweight and overweight, using body mass index (BMI) cutoffs, and
   then all households were categorized into four types: dual burden,
   overweight, underweight and normal. Income and urban residence were
   explored as key risk factors for being a dual burden household, with the
   effects modeled separately for each country. Multiple logistic
   regression was used to explore income and urban risk factors,
   controlling for household size, region of residence and either urban
   residence or income, as appropriate.
   Results: In six of the countries studied, 22-66% of households with an
   underweight person also had an overweight person. Countries with the
   highest prevalence of dual burden households were those in the middle
   range of gross national product (GNP). The dual burden household is
   easily distinguished from the 'underweight only' households in Brazil,
   China, Indonesia, the United States and Vietnam. In these five countries
   dual burden households were more likely to be urban and more likely to
   be among the highest income tertile. There were no significant
   differences between dual burden and 'underweight only' households in
   Russia and the Kyrgyz Republic. In contrast, dual burden households were
   not easily distinguished from the 'overweight only' households in China,
   Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, the United States and Vietnam. In Brazil
   and Russia dual burden households were more likely to be lower income
   and urban than 'overweight only' households.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of dual burden households presents a
   significant public health concern, particularly for those countries in
   the middle range of GNP. In some countries (China, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz
   Republic, the United States and Vietnam), dual burden households share
   sociodemographic profiles with overweight households, raising concerns
   for underweight individuals who may inadvertently become the focus of
   obesity prevention initiatives. For this reason, obesity prevention
   efforts should focus on messages that are beneficial to the good health
   of all, such as increasing fruit and vegetable intake, improving overall
   diet quality and increasing physical activity.

AB Background: National data from the mid-1990s demonstrated that many
   eligible patients did not receive highly active antiretroviral therapy
   (HAART) and that racial and gender disparities existed in HAART receipt.
   We examined whether demographic disparities in the use of HAART persist
   in 2001 and if outpatient care is associated with HAART utilization.
   Methods: Demographic, clinical, and pharmacy utilization data were
   collected from 10 US HIV primary care sites in the HIV Research Network
   (HIVRN). Using multivariate logistic regression, we examined demographic
   and clinical differences associated with receipt of HAART and the
   association of outpatient utilization with HAART.
   Results: In our cohort in 2001, 84% of patients received HAART and 66%
   had 4 or more outpatient visits during calendar year (CY) 2001. Of those
   with 2 or more CD4 counts below 350 cells/mm(3) in 2001, 91% received
   HAART; 82% of those with I CD4 test result below 350 cells/mm(3)
   received HAART; and 77% of those with no CD4 counts below 350
   cells/mm(3) received HAART. Adjusting for care site in multivariate
   analyses, age >40 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.13), male gender
   (AOR = 1.23), Medicaid coverage (AOR = 1. 16), Medicare coverage (AOR =
   1. 73), having I or more CD4 counts less than 350 cells/mm(3) (AOR =
   1.33), and having 4 or more outpatient visits in a year (OR = 1.34) were
   significantly associated with an increased likelihood of HAART. African
   Americans (odds ratio [OR] = 0.84) and those with an injection drug use
   risk factor (OR = 0.86) were less likely to receive HAART.
   Conclusions: Although the overall prevalence of HAART has increased
   since the mid-1990s, demographic disparities in HAART receipt persist.
   Our results support attempts to increase access to care and frequency of
   outpatient visits for underutilizing groups as well as increased efforts
   to reduce persistent disparities in women, African Americans, and
   injection drug users (IDUs).

AB The present study evaluated treatment outcome differences in
   anxiety-disordered youth who differed in their disclosure of internal
   distress as measured in a structured diagnostic interview. One hundred
   and seventy-one clinic-referred, anxiety-disordered children served as
   participants. Participants' primary diagnoses were one of three anxiety
   disorders: separation anxiety, generalized anxiety/overanxious, or
   social phobia/avoidance. At a pretreatment assessment, children and
   their parents were interviewed separately using the Anxiety Disorders
   Interview Schedule (ADIS) to determine the child's diagnosis. The
   child's status as a discloser of high distress or discloser of low
   distress was determined by the parents' endorsement of an anxiety
   disorder and the child's endorsement or lack of endorsement of an
   anxiety disorder, respectively. Parents, teachers, and children also
   completed measures assessing the child's psychopathology (e.g., Revised
   Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale, Child Behavior Checklist). In
   general, findings indicated that the level of distress reported by the
   children moderated treatment outcome. Although both groups benefited
   from treatment, the children disclosing high distress experienced
   greater treatment gains than the children disclosing low distress. (c)

   abuse, intimate partner violence, and violence perpetrated by
   non-intimates (n = 202). Controlling for age, place of birth, and timing
   and severity of victimization, emotional numbing symptom counts were
   associated more strongly with arousal than avoidance symptoms,

AB Data were collected during the summer of 2000 from 146 residents living
   in a rural area located in central Ohio that had been identified as a
   possible site for a national wildlife refuge. The purpose of the study
   was to assess anticipated socio-economic and environmental impacts of
   the proposed refuge on local people and natural ecosystems. A 'vested
   interests' theoretical model was developed to guide the investigation.
   The theoretical model posits that attitudes of local people toward
   externally induced projects are a function of costs and benefits
   individuals expect to receive as a result of the development action. The
   theory posits that individuals who expect to receive greater benefits
   from the refuge will exhibit more favorable attitudes toward the
   proposed project. Anticipated impacts of the proposed refuge were
   assessed with a Likert-type attitude scale that was shown to be highly
   reliable. Variables measuring specific costs and benefits associated
   with the proposed project were used as predictive variables. Descriptive
   statistics demonstrated that respondents believed the proposed wildlife
   refuge would generate more costs than benefits for local residents.
   Multiple linear regression findings demonstrated that six variables were
   significant in explaining 65.1% of the variance in the attitudes toward
   the proposed project. The significant variables were as follows:
   perceived costs and benefits associated with the proposed project,
   perceived water quality within the Little Darby Creek at the time of the
   data collection, age of primary income earner, expected future water
   quality within the Little Darby Creek, expected impact of farmland
   transition on the household, and attitude toward private property

   need economical sources for kosher meals as well as financial support to

AB Objective: To develop and pilot test the Home and Community Environment
   instrument (HACE), a self-report measure designed to characterize
   factors in a person's home and community environment that may influence
   level of participation.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey.
   Subjects: Sixty-two adults recruited from community organizations and an
   outpatient rehabilitation center.
   Methods: Six environmental domains were assessed: (i) home mobility;
   (ii) community mobility; (iii) basic mobility devices; (iv)
   communication devices, (v) transportation factors; and (vi) attitudes.
   Descriptive statistics, Kappa statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests were
   used to ascertain whether persons were capable of assessing
   characteristics of their environment, could do so reliably and whether
   the distribution of environmental factors differed by type of living
   situation.
   Results: Participants were capable of characterizing their home
   environment and most aspects of their community with acceptable
   reliability. The median percent agreement of the 6 environmental domains
   ranged from 75% to 100% (median Kappa values ranged from 0.47 to 1.0).
   Percent agreement for individual RACE items ranged front 58% to 100%.
   The lowest reliability values were observed in the community mobility
   domain. As hypothesized, individuals who lived in private homes
   characterized home and community mobility factors differently front
   those who lived in multi-unit complexes; evidence of HACE's validity.
   Conclusion: HACE is a promising self-report instrument for assessing
   characteristics of an individual's home and community environments.
   Additional research is needed to assess its utility, for rehabilitation
   research.

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether treatment provided for ectopic
   pregnancies was different for patients with identified barriers to
   health care, including ethnicity, lack of insurance, distance from the
   treating facility that provides services and undocumented residency, at
   an institution that utilizes a protocol-based algorithm for treatment of
   ectopic pregnancies.
   STUDY DESIGN: Charts of 401 patients who were diagnosed with ectopic
   pregnancy from January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998, were reviewed
   to compare the use of medical treatment using methotrexate versus
   surgical treatment. Data were analyzed with respect to patient
   ethnicity, socioeconomic status (including insurance status and
   possession of a social security card [a proxy for legal residency
   status]), residence inside or outside the county of the treating
   facility, patient presentation and treatment outcomes.
   RESULTS: There was no difference in treatment modality or success of
   primary treatment for ectopic pregnancies between groups regardless of
   ethnicity, health care insurance, residence outside the county the
   treating facility was located in or possession of a social security
   number.
   CONCLUSION: The treatment Of ectopic pregnancies at the University of
   New Mexico Health Sciences Center is consistent across ethnic and
   socioeconomic populations. A well-designed treatment protocol may help
   provide evidenced-based, consistent treatment for patients requiring
   care who also have identified barriers to medical and surgical
   treatment.

AB Objective: This study examines the relationship between parental alcohol
   use disorders (AUDs) and child violent and nonviolent delinquency. It
   also explores the mediating effects of executive functioning and chronic
   family stress on the parental AUD/child delinquency relationship.
   Method: Participants were 816 families with children (414 boys and 402
   girls) born between 1981 and 1984 at Mater Misericordiae Mother's
   Hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Parents and children completed
   semistructured inter-views, questionnaires and neuropsychological tests
   that assessed parental alcohol use, family psychiatric history, chronic
   family stress, child delinquency and child executive functioning.
   Results: Paternal (but not maternal) AUDs predicted child violent and
   nonviolent delinquency. Executive functioning mediated the relationship
   between paternal AUDs and violent delinquency, whereas family stress
   mediated the relationship between paternal AUDs and both violent and
   nonviolent delinquency. Conclusions: Results support a biosocial
   conceptualization of the paternal AUD/delinquency relationship. They
   suggest that paternal AUDs may be associated with child executive
   functioning and family stress, which may in turn lead to child
   delinquency.

AB Objective: The present study used structural equation modeling to test
   whether prospective relations between prematriculation social influences
   and alcohol involvement in college were most consistent with peer
   selection, peer socialization or reciprocal determinism explanations and
   to determine if observed relations varied according to measurement
   interval. We tested the hypotheses that "active" (alcohol offers) and
   "passive" (social modeling, perceived norms) social influences would be
   uniquely and reciprocally associated with alcohol use and
   alcohol-related consequences across two and three waves of assessment.
   Method: Prospective undergraduates (N = 388) completed self-report
   assessments in the summer before matriculation (Wave 1), in the spring
   of their freshman year (Wave 2) and in the spring of their sophomore
   year (Wave 3). Results: Reciprocal effects were observed between social
   influences and alcohol use in both two- and three-wave models. Some
   evidence was observed for reciprocal associations for social modeling
   with alcohol use and alcohol problems. Overall, however, only modest
   support was found for a reciprocal influence conceptualization of social
   influences in alcohol problems. For alcohol problems, the results were
   more consistent with selection effects. No significant reciprocal
   associations were observed for perceived norms. Conclusions: Findings
   generally support the Social Learning Theory concept of reciprocal
   determinism but suggest the relationship between individual drinking
   behaviors and the social environment varies when distinguishing between
   alcohol use and alcohol problems. These findings also point to the
   importance of distinguishing among different types of social influences
   when delineating processes that result from and lead to heavy drinking
   in college.

TI Predicting patterns of adolescent alcohol use: A longitudinal study

PD JAN 2005

AB Objective: Because most studies of adolescent alcohol use have focused
   primarily on the frequency and quantity of consumption, we know little
   about how adolescent drinking patterns change during the high school
   years. The purpose of this article is to provide such data, as well as
   to identify some of the individual, family, social life and community
   predictors of changes in drinking patterns over time. Method: A sample
   of 1,253 students in grades 9 through 12 (57% female) in a large
   metropolitan school district participated. Three ethnicities were
   represented: African American, European American and Mexican American.
   Students completed questionnaires every 6 months for a 2-year period (n
   = 743 at Time 4). Results: Cluster analyses of the drinking variables
   yielded one problem-drinking group (heavy, multiple-context drinking),
   two high-risk groups (i.e., date and outdoor drinking) and three
   normative groups (light, family/parent, moderate/party drinking). The
   most predictable patterns of longitudinal changes in adolescent drinking
   were consistent with the following progression (or the reverse):
   abstainer -> normative drinker -> high-risk drinker -> problem drinker.
   Paternal attitudes toward adolescent drinking and peer involvement in
   antisocial behavior predicted movement into normative drinking; social
   activity with peers predicted movement into high-risk drinking; and
   emotional distress predicted the transition into problem drinking.
   Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the multistage social
   learning model, demonstrating that the predictors of adolescent alcohol
   use vary across different levels of adolescent alcohol involvement.

AB Objective: Past alcohol administration research has produced mixed
   findings regarding the role of acute alcohol consumption on sexual
   decision making. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a more
   complex theoretical model that places alcohol's acute effects in
   context, through the inclusion of background measures as well as
   affective and cognitive responses to the specific situation. Method:
   College students (90 men, 90 women) completed a survey that included
   measures of individual difference characteristics and past experiences;
   approximately 1 month later, they participated in an alcohol
   administration study. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
   three drink conditions (sober, placebo, alcohol), after which they read
   a story about a couple that wanted to have sex, but had no condoms
   available. Results: In hierarchical multiple regression analyses, acute
   alcohol consumption significantly predicted participants' perceived
   likelihood that they would have sex without a condom in such a
   situation; an earlier step included gender, impulsivity, self-reported
   alcohol expectancies, frequency of heavy drinking, lifetime number of
   sexual partners and frequency of condom use. There was no significant
   effect associated with the expectancy that one had consumed alcohol.
   Neither was there a significant interaction between drink condition and
   self-reported alcohol expectancies. Conclusions: Through the inclusion
   of measures of individual differences and responses to the specific
   situation, this study provides a more nuanced understanding of the
   factors that affect college students' sexual decision making, compared
   with laboratory studies that examine the effects of acute alcohol
   consumption in isolation. Alcohol consumption explained a significant
   yet relatively small amount of variance. Researchers need to consider
   the broader context to understand how intoxication influences sexual
   decision making.

AB Despite recent gains in establishing academic sections, divisions, and
   departments of geriatrics in medical schools, much remains to be done to
   meet the medical needs of an aging population. To better understand how
   medical schools are educating students in geriatric-related topics, all
   U.S. allopathic and osteopathic medical schools were surveyed in two
   waves, in 1999 and 2000, using a questionnaire based on recommendations
   from the Education Committee of the American Geriatrics Society.
   Responding schools were more likely to address diseases and conditions
   of aging, psychosocial issues, and ethical issues and less likely to
   cover anatomic changes, nutrition, knowledge of healthcare financing,
   outcome measurement, and cultural aspects of aging. Although limited,
   the results indicate that medical schools have increased coverage of
   aging-related material, although further expansion of geriatric content
   will be necessary to meet the needs of an aging society.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate informal (unpaid) care and
   its broad determinants for Latinos in a nationally representative
   sample. A cross-sectional analysis of the 1993 Asset and Health Dynamics
   Study, a national probability sample of 7,443 older adults aged 70 and
   older, was performed to determine the independent effect of Latino
   ethnicity on the receipt of informal care by disabled older individuals.
   Self-reported race/ethnicity was used to predict the mean daily hours of
   informal care received for activity of daily living (ADL) or
   instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) assistance after adjustment
   for predisposing, need, and enabling variables. There was a significant
   association between informal home care and ethnic group, with 44.3% of
   Latinos receiving informal care, compared with 33.9% of African
   Americans and 24.6% of non-Hispanic whites (P<.001). After adjustment,
   Latinos received 11.0 weekly hours of informal care, compared with 7.5
   hours for non-Hispanic whites and 6.3 hours for African Americans
   (P<.001). The results from this nationally representative sample
   indicate that Latinos receive significantly more hours of informal care
   on average than African Americans or non-Hispanic whites for ADL and
   IADL disability. Clinicians should be alert to the significant amount of
   informal care and possible associated strain in caregivers of older
   Latinos.

AB In this chapter, I want to take some stock of the subdiscipline of
   environmental sociology. I believe that a productive approach to
   restoring some of the coherence of environmental sociology is to
   conceive of mainstream environmental sociology as reflecting several
   paradoxes. The bulk of this chapter will be devoted to a brief
   explication of environmental sociology's theoretical and empirical
   paradoxes. I will begin with three paradoxes that have played a major
   role in environmental sociology since the 1970s. However, many of the
   theoretical and empirical paradoxes of the subfield are relatively new
   ones - and some have not even been thought of as paradoxes. The thrust
   of the present chapter consists of something of a research agenda for
   environmental sociology for the next decade or so.

AB The works of Stephen Bunker represent early, sometimes unacknowledged,
   contributions to a sociological imagination regarding the role of nature
   and raw material extraction in processes of social change. By engaging
   debates defined within a world-systems frame of national state power and
   cycles of capital accumulation, Bunker's work maintains the hierarchy of
   core, semi-peripheral, and peripheral states. While bridging the local
   and the global in unusual ways, his emphasis is predominantly on the
   external limits posed by nature and global markets on peripheries and
   the converse advantages offered to cores, thus allowing less room in the
   analysis for questioning which particular totality(ies) of social
   structure and relations are open to sociological inquiry. Gleaning the
   contributions from a socionatural approach and relating them back to
   Bunker's commodity-based approach may expand the purview for analyses of
   the intersection of the natural and the social. In this chapter, I argue
   that attention to 'nature' in its multiple socionatural occurrences
   contributes to an understanding of the structuring of power in time and
   place. I rely on geographer Eric Swyngedouw's deployment of the concept
   of 'socionature' and the framework of actor-network theory to explore
   the benefits as well as challenges of a more relational, nondualistic
   sociological analysis of society and nature.

   incident Alzheimer's disease (AD), level of cognition and rate of
   cognitive decline in old age. For up to 10 years, 859 older Catholic
   clergy members without dementia at baseline completed annual clinical
   evaluations as part of the Religious Orders Study. The evaluations
   included clinical classification of AD and detailed cognitive testing.
   At baseline, indicators of early life household socioeconomic level
   (e.g., parental education) and the county of birth were ascertained.
   Socioeconomic features of the birth county (e.g., literacy rate) were
   estimated with data from the 1920 US Census. Composite measures of early
   life household and community socioeconomic level were developed. In
   analyses that controlled for age, sex and education, higher household
   and community socioeconomic levels in early life were associated with
   higher level of cognition in late life but not with risk of AD or rate
   of cognitive decline. The results suggest that early life socioeconomic
   level is related to level of cognition in late life but not to rate of
   cognitive decline or risk of AD. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

   aspects of children's sleep behavior in industrialized and complex

   mechanisms of cultural differences. We submit that it is the interaction
   between culture and biology that establishes behavioral and
   developmental norms and expectations regarding normal and problematic
   children's sleep. Pediatricians need to recognize the cultural
   environment in which children live and be knowledgeable about how

AB Objectives. Sleep patterns and sleep problems in children are not only
   influenced by a large number of biological and psychologic factors but
   also by cultural and social factors. Little is known about similarities
   and differences in sleep patterns and sleep problems among children
   across countries. We attempted to compare sleep patterns and sleep
   problems among schoolchildren from 2 countries with distinctive cultural
   contexts: the United States and China.
   Methods. The data come from 2 cross-sectional surveys in 3 elementary
   schools of Jinan City, People's Republic of China, and 3 elementary
   schools from a suburban school district in southeastern New England,
   United States. The Chinese sample consisted of 517 elementary school
   children ( grades 1 to 5), and the US sample consisted of 494 elementary
   school children ( grades kindergarten through 4). We used the Children's
   Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ) to assess children's sleep patterns
   and sleep problems as reported by parents. Parents of the Chinese sample
   completed a Chinese version of the CSHQ.
   Results. For children in both the US and Chinese samples, reported
   bedtime was delayed and sleep duration decreased with increasing age.
   Compared with the US children ( grades 1-4), Chinese children went to
   bed approximately half an hour later ( 9: 02 vs 8: 27 PM) and woke up
   half an hour earlier ( 6: 28 vs 6: 55 AM), resulting in an average sleep
   duration that was 1 hour less (9.25 vs 10.15 hours). Chinese children
   were rated significantly higher than the US children on almost all CSHQ
   scales, indicating more sleep problems in Chinese children. Common sleep
   problems observed for all children were difficulty falling asleep,
   having a fear of sleeping in the dark, sleep talking, restless sleep,
   teeth grinding during sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Shorter daily sleep
   duration was associated with difficulty falling asleep, struggling at
   bedtime, and trouble sleeping away for the US children, and with going
   to bed at different times and having a fear of sleeping alone for
   Chinese children. Short sleep duration was a main predictor of daytime
   sleepiness for Chinese children, whereas restless sleep and snoring
   predicted daytime sleepiness for the US children.
   Conclusions. As reported by parents, children in China went to bed later
   and woke up earlier and their sleep duration was 1 hour shorter than the
   US children. Chinese children were reported to have more sleep problems
   than their US counterparts. Daytime sleepiness was determined by sleep
   duration only for those who slept insufficiently. Unique school
   schedules and sleep practices may contribute to the differences in the
   sleep patterns and sleep problems of children from the United States and
   China.

AB Background. Individuals of lower socioeconomic position smoke at higher
   rates than those of higher socioeconomic position. Because of this
   disparity, the National Cancer Institute has called for studies of
   targeted tobacco marketing to clarify mechanisms contributing to higher
   tobacco use among low-income Americans and other high-risk populations.
   Methods. We observed tobacco industry marketing in six Boston area
   communities (two of high socioeconomic position and four of low
   position; total of 41 observations) and in selected print publications
   that circulated in those communities during a 22-month period in
   2000-2002.
   Results. On average, there were fewer tobacco advertisements in the
   higher socioeconomic communities, compared to the lower socioeconomic
   communities (P < 0.001). In the low socioeconomic communities, there
   were more than three times as many brand advertisements as youth access
   signs (P = 0.0012). Although brand advertisements outnumbered smoke-free
   signs, on average, there was no difference in the ratio of brand
   advertisements to smoke-free signs in low and high socioeconomic
   communities (P = 0.06).
   Conclusions. The tobacco industry is actively present in community
   settings, particularly in communities with a low socioeconomic profile
   (SEP). Tobacco control researchers and advocates need to continue to
   monitor the tobacco industry's behavior at the community level and
   develop strategies to counter this behavior. (C) 2004 The Institute For

AB Background. Although patterns of utilization of complementary and
   alternative medicine (CAM) in the community have begun to be described,
   few studies have addressed the relationships between dispositional
   psychological factors and the use of CAM. The aim of this study was to
   examine the associations between CAM use and personality, coping
   strategies, and perceived social support in a representative sample of
   adults in the United States.
   Methods. Data were drawn from the Midlife Development in the United
   States Survey (MIDUS), a representative sample of 3,032 adults aged
   25-74 in the US population. We analyzed use of acupuncture, biofeedback,
   chiropractic, energy healing, exercise/movement therapy, herbal
   medicine, high-dose megavitamins, homeopathy, hypnosis, imagery
   techniques, massage, prayer/spiritual practice, relaxation/mediation,
   and special diet within the last year. Multiple logistic regression
   analyses were used to evaluate the association of personality,
   dispositional coping strategies (primary and secondary control), and
   perceived social support and strain with CAM use, controlling for
   sociodemographic factors, medical care access, and physical and mental
   disorders.
   Results. Openness was positively associated with the use of all types of
   CAM except manipulative body-based methods. Extroversion was inversely
   correlated with the use of mind-body therapies. Primary control was
   inversely and secondary control directly correlated with the use of CAM.
   Perceived friend support was positively associated with the use of
   mind-body therapies, manipulative body-based methods, and alternative
   medical systems. Perceived partner strain was positively associated with
   the use of biologically based therapies, and family strain increased the
   odds of manipulative body-based methods.
   Conclusions. This study is the first to document a significant
   association between specific domains of personality, coping strategies,
   and social support, and the use of CAM among adults in the general
   population. Understanding the relationships between psychological
   factors and CAM use may help researchers and health care providers to
   address patients' needs more effectively and to achieve better adherence
   to treatment recommendations. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer

   to debate social science's normative directions and to strengthen its
   connections to civil society is relevant today. Because Gouldner's
   approach has gaps and is somewhat fragmented I will reconstruct his
   argument about social theory per se. Although I point to problems that
   derive from his incomplete pragmatic turn, his approach offers an
   excellent departure point for discussing the meaning of social theory.

AB Zygmunt Bauman's work is a case study in the possibilities of
   postmodernism for sociology. Characterized on the one hand by a gloomy
   epistemology about knowledge and morality in a postmodern world and on
   the other, by provocative new concepts to empirically describe a
   postmodern world, Bauman's work evidences a key tension within
   postmodern thought. Is it possible to reconcile Bauman's pessimistic
   epistemology with his optimistic sociology? My argument is that if we
   recast Bauman as a critical theorist and his method as dialectical
   immanent critique, we can see how his positive empirical concepts are
   based on his negative epistemology. In this way we can make sense of the
   complexity of Bauman's work and appreciate his prophetic abilities. The
   complexities and possibilities of postmodern thought in general become
   clearer as well.

AB This paper focuses on theory in sociology. I suggest that,
   notwithstanding the benefits that accrue from the development of
   theoretical ideas and research in a competitive environment, competition
   can also have undesirable consequences. I argue that such tendencies
   should be countered by cooperation in our theoretical and research
   efforts (e.g., multimethod research). I also advocate the development of
   abstract formulations that are precise and systematic because such
   theories are more clearly understood and capable of being investigated,
   can lead to the development of more clearly defined questions, and can
   help us achieve the goal of greater cooperation. To provide an
   illustration of these points I discuss a recently developed line of
   theory and research related to "structural ritualization theory." This
   work focuses on "deritualization, "that is, the breakdown of previously
   engaged in ritualized practices due to disruptive events. Four studies
   are discussed: an experimental investigation of positive, negative, and
   neutral disruptions of ritualized practices in task groups; a study of
   personal accounts of individuals interned in concentration camps; a
   qualitative analysis of pioneering reports on disasters which shows how
   such events result in the breakdown of ritualized behaviors; and,
   historical research that focuses on "dark ages" as macrolevel
   disruptions leading to large-scale deritualization. I conclude by
   reemphasizing the value of theory and the need for cooperation,
   summarizing analytical concerns generated by deritualization research,
   and suggesting the need for applied efforts based on these principles
   and research.

   linkage has been made and how it can be strengthened in each category of
   use. Concerning the use of mathematics for theory construction, the
   article compares the integrated division of labor between theory
   construction and empirical research to traditional divisions of labor,
   emphasizing the relative importance of the former. Concerning the use of
   mathematics for data analysis, the paper identifies (1) indexing and
   measurement, (2) mathematical methods for heuristic analysis of
   qualitative data, (3) substantively motivated statistical models, and
   (4) hybrids of mathematical and statistical models, as four forms of
   linkage between mathematical sociology and empirical research,

   occurs when events created by or in organizations do not conform to an
   organization's goals or expectations and produce unanticipated and
   harmful outcomes. Drawing on data from qualitative case studies of two
   schools that experienced shootings, the authors show how the
   organizational structure, environment, and culture of these schools led
   to the loss of information about socially or emotionally troubled
   students, information that might otherwise have led to some form of
   intervention or help for these students. Implications for educational
   policy and practice are discussed.

AB Gay men in the New York City metropolitan area were interviewed from
   1990 to 1991, during the period of the AIDS epidemic. Using an interview
   schedule, they were asked questions about "coming out of the closet" and
   other identity issues: their experiences of "difference," beliefs about
   monogamous or "open" relationships, and their views about sex and
   commitment. The study's focus was on the men's "moral discourse" or
   their relationship to the "good," including ideas of the self, other(s),
   friendship, love, sex, and commitment. The study yielded a consistency
   in the men's responses: they did not wish to impose on other gay men
   their own convictions about being gay, sex, and intimate relationships.
   Their talk was tentative, localized, highly personal, and
   "nonjudgmental" on a range of identity and moral issues. These findings
   are discussed by relating the men's life experiences to the gamy culture
   they shared: their unwillingness to judge others reflects their own
   formative experiences of "coming out" in a society that judged gay men
   harshly and who, in later years, lived at the time of the AIDS crisis.

AB A simulation called Star Power provides an invaluable means to help

   how Star Power achieves this goal and provides suggestions on how to
   inculcate the following points that are both central to sociology and
   difficult to adequately convey to students: 1) Students see how those in
   power maintain their position by structuring the system to their
   advantage, 2) they learn how the structure of this system makes
   advancement for others difficult; 3) privileged students begin to
   recognize the impact of their own family's social position that they
   tend to overlook in favor of their personal effort and merit. By
   becoming more aware of structural inequalities, students realize that
   for the lower classes to join the most powerful in society, they must
   triumph over a system in which those in power make rules that protect
   their own interests, usually at someone else's expense.

AB Eight hundred million of the current 1.1 billion people who earn less

   more than 550 million of them earn their living from agriculture,
   poverty eradication depends on increasing their income from farming. The
   millennium goals for hunger and poverty in the semi-arid tropics will
   not be met without four simultaneous revolutions. A revolution in water
   is needed to develop and mass disseminate a whole range of new
   affordable small plot irrigation technology. A revolution in agriculture
   is required to enable smallholders to produce a variety of high value
   marketable labor intensive cash crops. A revolution in markets is needed
   to open access to inputs and to profitable V markets for their high
   value crops, incorporating effective strategies for aggregation, quality
   control, and decentralized added value processing. Finally, a revolution
   in design based on the ruthless pursuit of affordability is needed to
   support the other three revolutions. This paper describes the rapidly
   growing micro-irrigation revolution exemplified by the $250 million in
   new net annual income now being earned by Treadle Pump farmers, and
   outlines the key features of the other three revolutions required to
   meet millennium poverty goals.

AB This paper focuses on the embodied experience of gender. It draws upon
   Bourdieu's sociology of practice, cognitive sciences, and feminist
   phenomenology to highlight instances of non-discursive, cultural
   conditioning of embodied experience. Specifically, the paper focuses on
   the internalization by both men and women of the masculine perspective.
   It does so by discussing regular patterns of word ordering in English,
   comportment and motility, and orientation to the body. These patterns
   are cultural in that they are acquired through social interaction. They
   are non-discursive, though, in that they are not encoded in any system
   of representations and are not generally transmitted through discourse.
   Rather, they are infra-discursive, in that they exist below discourse.
   It emerges that, in general, the prototypical perspective adopted by
   male and female European social agents is distinctly more masculine than
   feminine. However, in restricted contexts, such as parenthood, this
   prototypicality is inverted. In this, we see how internalized structures
   match the broad overarching social structures. In the course of the
   discussion, we seek to further develop and contextualize some further
   analyses, such as Iris Young's phenomenology of corporeal experience and
   Cooper and Ross's analysis of word ordering. We ultimately hope to
   demonstrate the critical analytical importance of the embodied reality
   which is clearly culturally variable, yet not, strictly speaking,
   discursively constituted. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   African-Americans (N = 562) and Whites (N = 421) because preliminary
   analyses indicated that there were significant racial differences in
   onset, levels and patterns of cigarette use. Three trajectory groups
   emerged for both races: nonsmokers, light/occasional smokers and
   heavy/regular smokers. Significantly more Whites were in the
   heavy/regular smoker group and more African-Americans were in the
   nonsmoker group. White compared to African-American heavy/regular
   smokers began smoking earlier and reached higher mean quantities of
   cigarettes per day. In addition, there were racial differences in the
   timing and rapidity of the development of regular smoking over time.
   Race remained a significant predictor of cigarette use even after
   controls for socioeconomic status. Overall, the results indicate that
   developmental trends in smoking differ by race and that cigarette
   smoking remains more prevalent and more frequent for White than
   African-American males, at least through young adulthood. (C) 2004

   30 days was reported by 18% of participants. Associations were found
   between alcohol intoxication and both injection and sexual risk
   behaviors. In the bivariate analysis, subjects reporting alcohol
   intoxication were more likely to inject three or more times per day,
   pool money to buy drugs, share needles, and share cotton. They were also
   significantly more likely to have a casual or paying sex partner and to
   have unprotected sex with these partners. After adjustment, sharing
   needles and cotton, having sex with a paying partner or casual partner,
   and exchanging sex for money or drugs were significantly related to

AB Introduction: Information about individuals' drug expenses can indicate
   much about the size of drug markets, the financial burden of use,
   drug-related crime, and potential challenges for treatment. Most often,
   expenses have been estimated holistically by asking respondents to
   report how much they spent. In 2000, the Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring
   (ADAM) program introduced an advanced questionnaire using a series of
   highly specific questions like, "how much cash did you pay for crack
   that last time you bought it?" Methods: This paper describes a procedure
   for estimating arrestees' drug expenses with the new ADAM questionnaire,
   discusses pitfalls in interpretation, presents findings for 2979
   ADAM-Manhattan respondents interviewed 2000-2002, examines covariates of
   drug expense, and compares the 2000-2002 findings with those obtained
   from 2256 respondents interviewed 1998-1999 with the previous
   questionnaire. Results: Among 2000-2002 arrestees, median drug expense
   in the past 30 days varied widely with frequency of use and drug-user
   type. Infrequent marijuana-only users spent as little as $5, daily
   marijuana-only users spent about $600. Arrestees that used both heroin
   and cocaine spent over $1000. Estimates with the 1998-1999 data were
   about half as large. Discussion: ADAM's new drug market questions may
   greatly advance the quality of estimates of drug expenses. However,
   further research is needed to better establish the estimator's accuracy.

   occurrence when one drinks to excess, drank heavily if they expected
   alcohol to make them more assertive socially. Students with similar
   beliefs about the effects of alcohol on social interaction who were high
   in CAE consumed substantially less alcohol than the latter individuals.
   Their overall levels of drinking were more comparable to those of the
   low-expectancy participants, suggesting that the disdain for
   conspicuousness characteristic of people with a susceptibility to CAE
   may counteract the desire for social disinhibition that often motivates
   alcohol consumption. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB \Background: Public health surveillance was established for nonfatal
   child maltreatment in Missouri using two data sources. This paper
   describes the epidemiology of nonfatal child maltreatment using this
   surveillance system, and assesses the usefulness of combining medical
   data with child protective services (CPS) reports for child maltreatment
   surveillance.
   Methods: Child abuse and neglect reports for children aged <10 years for
   2000 were obtained from the Missouri Division of Family Services (DFS)
   and linked to hospital discharge and emergency department (ED) data for
   2000. Children were classified as maltreated if they had an
   International Classification of Disease (ICD) maltreatment code for a
   hospital or ED visit, or a substantiated report to DFS. Validity of the
   ICD maltreatment codes was assessed in a 10% random sample of the
   hospital/ED visits. Medical records were reviewed to determine the
   accuracy of the maltreatment code assigned. The data analyses reported
   here were conducted in 2002 and 2003.
   Results: In the linked data, 5657 children met the case definition of
   maltreatment, providing a nonfatal maltreatment rate of 7.4/1000
   children. Rates were higher among children aged <1 year (8.4/1000),
   females (7.7/1000), African Americans (11.8/1000), and children residing
   in rural counties (8.7/1000). The hospital/ED data identified
   proportionately more children who were African American, urban,
   physically abused, or infants, and uniquely identified only 10% of the
   total cases. In the validation sample, maltreatment was documented in
   110 (87%) of the 127 records reviewed.
   Conclusions: CPS and medical data can be linked for surveillance.
   However, the medical data add few unique cases and identify only a
   subset of maltreated children. (C) 2004 American journal of Preventive

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between parents' experiences of
   racism and children's well-being and the influence of the residential
   neighborhood characteristics on this relationship.
   Methods. African American families were recruited from Baltimore
   neighborhoods. Parental measures included racism experiences and coping.
   Neighborhood measures included demographic characteristics, social
   cohesion, and social climate. Children's mental health was assessed with
   the Child Behavior Checklist. Analysis was performed with multilevel
   modeling.
   Results. Parents who denied experiences of racism also reported higher
   rates of behavior problems among their preschool-aged children. For
   families living in neighborhoods characterized by fear of victimization,
   parents who actively coped with racism experiences by confronting the
   person involved or taking some sort of action in response to racism
   reported lower rates of anxiety and depression for their preschool-aged
   children.
   Conclusions. Experiences of and responses to racism among African
   American parents have important effects on the well-being of their young
   children.

AB Objectives. We examined the effects of self-reported experiences of
   racial discrimination on Black-White differences in preterm (less than
   37 weeks gestation) and low-birthweight (less than 2500 g) deliveries.
   Methods. Using logistic regression models, we analyzed data on 352
   births among women enrolled in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in
   Young Adults Study.
   Results. Among Black women, 50% of those with preterm deliveries and 61%
   of those with low-birthweight infants reported having experienced racial
   discrimination in at least 3 situations; among White women, the
   corresponding percentages were 5% and 0%. The unadjusted odds ratio for
   preterm delivery among Black versus White women was 2.54 (95% confidence
   interval [Cl] = 1.33, 4.85), but this value decreased to 1.88 (95% Cl =
   0.85, 4.12) after adjustment for experiences of racial discrimination
   and to 1.11 (95% Cl = 0.51, 2.41) after additional adjustment for
   alcohol and tobacco use, depression, education, and income. The
   corresponding odds ratios for low birthweight were 4.24 (95% Cl = 1.31,
   13.67), 2.11 (95% Cl = 0.75, 5.93), and 2.43 (95% Cl = 0.79, 7.42).
   Conclusions. Self-reported experiences of racial discrimination were
   associated with preterm and low-birthweight deliveries, and such
   experiences may contribute to Black-White disparities in perinatal
   outcomes.

AB Objectives. We determined whether African American women's lifetime
   exposure to interpersonal racial discrimination is associated with
   pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods. We performed a case-control study among 104 African American
   women who delivered very low birthweight (<1500 g) preterm (<37 weeks)
   infants and 208 African American women who delivered non-low-birthweight
   (>2500 g) term infants in Chicago, Ill.
   Results. The unadjusted and adjusted odds ratio of very low birthweight
   infants for maternal lifetime exposure to interpersonal racism in 3 or
   more domains equaled 3.2 (95% confidence intervals = 1.5, 6.6) and 2.6
   (1.2, 5.3), respectively. This association tended to persist across
   maternal sociodemographic, biomedical, and behavioral characteristics.
   Conclusions. The lifelong accumulated experiences of racial
   discrimination by African American women constitute an independent risk
   factor for preterm delivery.

AB Objective. We explored methods and potential applications of a
   systematic approach to studying and monitoring social disparities in
   health and health care.
   Methods. Using delayed or no prenatal care as an example indicator, we
   (1) categorized women into groups with different levels of underlying
   social advantage; (2) described and graphically displayed rates of the
   indicator and relative group size for each social group; (3) identified
   and measured disparities, calculating relative risks and rate
   differences to compare each group with its a priori most-advantaged
   counterpart; (4) examined changes in rates and disparities over time;
   and (5) conducted multivariate analyses for the overall sample and
   "at-risk" groups to identify particular factors warranting attention.
   Results. We identified at-risk groups and relevant factors and suggest
   ways to direct efforts for reducing prenatal care disparities.
   Conclusions. This systematic approach should be useful for studying and
   monitoring disparities in other indicators of health and health care.

AB Over three decades ago, D'Zurilla and Goldfried (1971) published a
   seminal article delineating a model of problem-solving training geared
   to enhance social competence and decrease psychological distress. Since
   that time, a substantial amount of research has been conducted to test
   various hypotheses that this model has engendered. Much of this research
   can be categorized into three lines of inquiry: (a) whether a
   relationship between problem solving and distress exists; (b) whether
   effective problem solving serves to attenuate the deleterious effects of
   stressful life events that in general increase the likelihood of
   experiencing psychological distress; and (c) whether training
   individuals experiencing a variety of psychological problems and
   disorders is an effective means by which to decrease their pathology and
   enhance their overall quality of life. This article provides an overview
   of this literature and especially highlights the flexible nature of
   problem-solving therapy with regard to targeted problems and
   populations, clinical treatment goals, and modes of implementation.
   Recommendations regarding future research directions are offered.

AB This article conceptualizes goals and strategies of personality
   assessment, and the relevance of personality assessment to the behavior
   therapist, in light of recent advances in personality science. Two
   assessment principles are presented: that personality assessment
   procedures should include in their purview those psychological systems
   that are unique to persons, and that assessments should tap
   psychological systems that are possessed by the individuals being
   assessed and that causally contribute to their overt experiences and
   actions. The limitations of traditional assessment strategies based on
   between-person factor-analytic constructs are discussed in light of
   these principles. The article then outlines an alternative strategy in
   which social-cognitive personality systems are tapped in a manner that
   is sensitive to the potentially idiosyncratic qualities of the
   individual. Illustrative research is summarized and implications for the
   practice of behavior therapy are considered.

AB Trail-based theories of personality explain behavior across situations
   based on a set of broad personality attributes or dimensions. In
   contrast, recent social-cognitive theories of personality emphasize the
   importance of context and take a combined nomothetic/idiographic
   approach to personality. The social-cognitive perspective on personality
   resembles cognitive-behavioral therapies, which explain behavior in
   particular situations based on interactions of specific cognitions, mood
   states, and stimulus conditions. This article considers how contemporary
   personality theory and research might be integrated into the study of
   the outcomes and processes associated with cognitive-behavioral
   therapies. We propose that applying the social-cognitive perspective on
   personality to the study of how cognitive-behavioral therapies work
   provides both validation of current theories and promising directions
   for additional research. We review the research literatures on cognitive
   theories of psychopathology and cognitive-behavioral treatments to
   examine how the topic of personality has been addressed in those
   literatures to date. We then explore some commonalities between
   cognitive theories of psychopathology and psychotherapy and recent
   social-cognitive approaches to personality, suggesting that an
   integration of the two areas is overdue.

AB This article outlines a conceptualization of personality as a
   cognitive-affective processing system (CAPS) and explores its
   implications for understanding disorders and pursuing therapeutic
   change. The CAPS conception of personality was proposed in 1995 in order
   to resolve a long-standing paradox in personality and social psychology,
   namely, the apparent contradiction of, on the one hand, a core
   assumption about personality as stable and invariant across situations
   and, on the other hand, the empirical findings of behavioral
   variability. It was prompted by the demonstration that stable and
   characteristic patterns can be discerned in behavior variation, or
   "behavioral signatures," and by a common theme from cognitive sciences
   that views the human mind as consisting of a stable and distinctive
   network of specific cognitions and affects. CAPS characterizes
   personality not simply by a set of thoughts and feelings highly
   accessible to an individual, but by the dynamic network of functional
   relations among the cognitions and affects, which guide and constrain
   their activation. After outlining the CAPS view of personality, this
   article will discuss how it relates to diverse existing models of
   anxiety and depression, approaches for measurement and case
   conceptualization as well as treatment methods, with the goal of
   clarifying the relationships among them by translating them into a
   common language provided by the CAPS framework.

AB This article applies a dynamic model of self-structure to self-change
   during psychological treatment. At the outset of treatment, many
   individuals may have a negative compartmentalized self-structure. That
   is, a wide range of perceived negative attributes may be closely linked
   to each other within their important self-aspect categories. During
   treatment, these individuals may develop an evaluatively integrative
   structure for self-beliefs in which negative beliefs are more closely
   associated with positive ones to mitigate their impact. When individuals
   leave treatment, they may either retain their integrative
   self-structures (and, possibly, a more realistic view of self) or they
   may revert to positive compartmentalization (an easy and efficient
   self-structure that minimizes access to any negative self-beliefs). This
   model illustrates the inherent flexibility in strategies of
   self-organization and their implications for clinical research.

   implications for how psychologists conceptualize, assess, and treat
   people. I comment on these developments and the contributions to this
   special series, focusing on how they speak to new directions and
   challenges for the future of CBT. Discoveries about mind, brain, and
   behavior that have vitalized psychological science in the last few
   decades are providing insights into such directly CBT-relevant processes
   as memory and the construction of personal narratives, attention
   control, and executive functions, including planning and
   conflict-monitoring, emotion and self-regulation, meta-cognition, and
   unconscious, automatic processing, as well as the nature, organization,
   and expressions of important individual differences. As the
   understanding of the subsystems and part-processes that collectively
   constitute the person's cognitive and emotional architecture escalates,
   it is an opportune moment to consider the implications for clinical
   psychology and the behavior therapies, especially CBT. I do so, drawing
   on work at the vanguard of the science and pointing to some of the
   implications for therapies committed to growing as the cognitive and
   behavioral sciences on which they are based evolve.

   groups with persons with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their families
   living in South Carolina. The objective was to learn what participants
   perceive their service needs to be and where they experience service
   gaps in the existing system of TBI services.
   Methods and procedures: Four focus groups were conducted. In each group,
   a convenience sample of persons <5 years post-injury and family members
   responded to 10 semi-structured questions.
   Main outcomes: Qualitative content analysis revealed overwhelming
   consensus regarding the need for (1) early, continuous, comprehensive
   service delivery; (2) information/education; (3) formal/informal
   advocacy; (4) empowerment of persons with TBI/families; and (5) human
   connectedness/social belonging.
   Conclusions: Persons with TBI and families in South Carolina experience
   the service system as unorganized, uneducated, unresponsive and
   uncaring. Effective strategies are needed that link services into an
   ongoing continuum of TBI care, increase TBI-specific education and
   awareness and foster social re-integration.

AB Our understanding of longitudinal patterns of adolescent smoking
   development and the determinants of these patterns is limited. The
   present study evaluated adolescent smoking trajectories and
   characterized these trajectories with social, psychological, and
   behavioral factors in a cohort of adolescents assessed annually from
   grades 9 to 12. Complete data (smoking practices, novelty seeking,
   academic performance, substance use, peer smoking, physical activity and
   sports participation, and tobacco ad receptivity) were available on 968
   participants; data were analyzed using latent class growth modeling.
   Four adolescent smoking trajectories emerged: never smokers,
   experimenters, earlier/faster smoking adopters, and later/slower smoking
   adopters. Early adopters were characterized by their high novelty
   seeking personality, depressive symptoms, poorer academic performance,
   and receptivity to tobacco advertising, as well as their exposure to
   other smokers, and use of other substances. Later adopters were
   characterized quite similarly to the early adopters, although they
   tended to perform better in school and to be more involved in sports.
   Experimenters also shared many of these same risk characteristics but to
   a lesser degree. Overall, never smokers were the most conventional in
   their profile. These data suggest that there is significant
   heterogeneity in the timing, rate, and intensity of smoking progression.
   Adolescent smoking prevention and intervention programs will need to
   consider this heterogeneity and tailor or enhance attention to risk and
   protective factors depending on the subpopulation.

AB The recent literature on African modernities, with its emphasis on
   witchcraft and the occult, has provided an important but arguably
   one-sided perspective on popular responses to globalization and
   postcolonial politics. This article argues that the dystopian visions
   implicit in the efflorescence of occultism need to be balanced by closer
   attention to more optimistic orientations and the sources upon which
   they draw. Building upon ethnographic and historical research on Buganda
   ( in Uganda), it focuses on moral community and its modes of social
   reproduction as the dynamic obverse of witchcraft. Empirically, it
   explores the widespread sense of moral crisis generated by Uganda's
   postcolonial collapse, the recourse to kingship and rituals of social
   reproduction as primary loci of moral rehabilitation in the 1990s, and
   an earlier period of moral crisis in the 1920s that established the
   enduring patterns of cultural self-conception upon which the recent
   moral revivalism has been founded. The emphasis throughout is on the way
   in which forms and practices of moral community have enabled Baganda to
   sustain an aspirational engagement with their changing world against
   considerable odds. A general case is made for greater analytical
   attention to the motive force of morality and moral community in human
   social life.

AB Events of language use mediate human sociality. Such semiotic occasions
   develop, sustain, or transform at least part-some have argued the
   greater part-of people's conceptualizations of their universe. Reserving
   the term cultural concepts for such sociocentric aspects of human
   cognition, this article sketches linguistic anthropology's methods for
   discovering truly cultural conceptualizations, illustrated at the polar
   extremes of ritual efficacy ( Christianity's Eucharistic liturgy) and of
   everyday conversational language games. Knowledge schemata structuring
   cultural concepts, here termed -onomic knowledge, turn out to be "in
   play" in interaction, made relevant to it as interactants use verbal and
   perilinguistic signs in the work of aligning as relationally
   identifiable kinds of persons. In interactional experience, -onomic
   knowledge anchoring cultural concepts is always implicit and is even
   sometimes part of largely abstract cultural patterns only indirectly
   experienceable by people such as the cultural "edibility" of fauna in
   Thai villagers' cultural concept invoked by use of terms denoting
   animals. Furthermore, beyond unique micro-contextual occasions of
   interaction, one discerns a macro-sociology of -onomic knowledge.
   Privileged ritual sites of usage anchor such a multiplex social
   formation; their emanations constitute power - frequently
   politicoeconomic - to warrant or license usage of particular verbal
   forms ( e. g., American English "winetalk" register) with particular
   meanings germane to certain interested ends of self- and
   other-alignment, closing the circle of analysis.

AB Recently, the geographic origin of plant species comprising indigenous
   Amazonian pharmacopoeias has been addressed. However, the origins of
   plant species in Andean pharmacopoeias have not. To fill this gap, we
   reviewed the pharmacopoeia of the Kallawaya herbalists of Bolivia for
   exotic plant species. The Kallawaya are the most renowned herbalists of
   South America and travel extensively throughout the Andes to collect
   medicinal plant species. Approximately 30% of the Kallawaya
   pharmacopoeia is comprised of exotic plant species. Many of these
   species are used in a variety of contexts (e.g., food, hygiene,
   beverages, ornamentals, timber, dyes, aromatics, hallucinogens) in
   addition to medicinal. This case study demonstrates the evolution of
   indigenous pharmacopoeias as a result of cross-cultural plant transfer.

   study lists the recently introduced plants, the date they were first
   recorded as part of the ethnopharmacopoeia, and their place of origin.

AB Tropical landscapes represent storehouses of medicinal drug plants. It
   is widely held that these medicinal resources-real and potential-are
   threatened by a host of destructive forces. This paper examines these
   threats, especially the process of culture change and ethnobotanical
   erosion, in a rural Brazilian community. Employing a quantitative
   analysis of a sample plant pharmacopoeia, we investigate the
   relationship between medicinal plant knowledge and age, gender, and
   socio-economic standing. The results indicate that female gender,
   increasing age, illiteracy, and decreasing formal education are all
   positively correlated with level of medicinal plant knowledge. The
   process of modernization, particularly increasing access to, formal
   education, appears to be incompatible with the retention of traditional
   domains of medical knowledge. Increasingly perceived as an irrelevant
   province of past generations, knowledge of the healing powers of
   tropical forests and fields is rapidly declining in this community.

AB More than 18 000 archaeological sites have been identified, and a dozen
   rock shelter sites investigated in the Zeekoe Valley, Upper Karoo, South
   Africa, but no work has been performed to date regarding edible plant
   remains. A baseline for understanding potential contribution of plants
   to the Zeekoe Valley diet is crucial for developing models of land use
   and mobility patterns for Late Stone Age (LSA) inhabitants, particularly
   since ethnographically known foragers in Botswana, some 800 km to the
   north, are as much as 80% dependent on plant foods for their survival.
   Since native foraging groups are long extinct in this semi-arid region
   with abundant natural springs, a rigorous investigation of botanical and
   ethnohistoric literature forms the groundwork for field investigations
   where direct ethnographic observation is no longer an option. First,
   edible species in the study area are identified in the literature. They
   are then sought on the ground with the aid of local informants whose
   families have resided in the valley for generations. It appears as
   though some knowledge of local plants gained from native foragers 150
   years ago or more has remained in Afrikaans families passed down from
   landowning parent to child. On the ground, collection and middle range
   experimentation was followed by basic nutritional analysis. These
   measures were then used to compare foraging efficiency to measures from
   extant foraging groups. While dozens of edible species were identified,
   five plant species formed the focus of this study: Slymstock Uintjie
   (Albuca canadensis); Boesman Uintjie (Cyperus usitatus, Cyperus
   fulgens); Jakkalsbosberry (Diospyros austro-africana); Rooi wortel
   (Pelargorium sidoides); and Osbossie (Talinum caffrum). Results suggest
   native foraging groups, now extinct in the vicinity, may have been 60%
   or more dependent on plant food resources, despite abundance of game in
   the area and in the archaeological record.

AB Although it is often acknowledged that social and environmental factors
   interact to produce racial and ethnic environmental health disparities,
   it is still unclear how this occurs. Despite continued controversy, the
   environmental justice movement has provided some insight by suggesting
   that disadvantaged communities face greater likelihood of exposure to
   ambient hazards. The exposure-disease paradigm has long suggested that
   differential "vulnerability" may modify the effects of toxicants on
   biological systems. However, relatively little work has been done to
   specify whether racial and ethnic minorities may have greater
   vulnerability than do majority populations and, further, what these
   vulnerabilities may be. We suggest that psychosocial stress may be the
   vulnerability factor that links social conditions with environmental
   hazards. Psychosocial stress can lead to acute and chronic changes in
   the functioning of body systems (e.g., immune) and also lead directly to
   illness. In this article we present a multidisciplinary framework
   integrating these ideas. We also argue that residential segregation
   leads to differential experiences of community stress, exposure to
   pollutants, and access to community resources. When not counterbalanced
   by resources, stressors may lead to heightened vulnerability to
   environmental hazards.

AB Data on acculturation and ethnic-minority health indicate that
   acculturation has opposite effects on the same health behavior among
   different ethnic groups, opposite effects on different health behaviors
   within an ethnic group; opposite effects on the same health behavior for
   the women vs. the men of most ethnic groups, and no effect whatsoever on
   some health behaviors for some ethnic groups. This evidence is so
   incoherent that it is unintelligible, and hence it continues to be
   largely useless to health psychology and behavioral medicine. This paper
   presents a new theory of acculturation that renders these confusing data
   coherent by predicting such changes in minority health behavior a
   priori. By so doing, the operant model of acculturation has the
   potential to improve health promotion and disease prevention and thereby
   reduce ethnic health disparities.

AB OBJECTIVE: To define screening behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs
   regarding cancer and its treatment among women with cervical cancer.
   METHODS: Between August 2000 and July 2002,148 consecutive women with
   invasive cervical cancer were queried about barriers to screening. Women
   presented to outpatient clinics, emergency departments, or inpatient
   units of 3 urban hospitals. Two groups of women were identified: those
   who denied having had a Papanicolaou (Pap) test and those who had
   recalled having Pap test in the past. Responses were compared using t
   tests, chi(2) tests, and binary logistic regression.
   RESULTS: The 146 (99%) respondents were predominantly African Americans
   (50%) or Hispanic (27%). Thirty-six (25%) women reported no prior
   screening. Women never screened were significantly more likely to be
   Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] 3.0,95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4-6.7),
   recent immigrants (OR 5.7, 95% CI 2.0 -16), less educated (OR 3.6, 95%
   CI 1.6 - 8.0), and uninsured (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.6-9.7). They Were more
   likely to lack family support (adjusted OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.1-11) and lack
   knowledge about their risk for cervical cancer (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI
   1.1-6.4). Unscreened women displayed fatalistic attitudes, believing
   cancer is bad luck (adjusted OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.0-6.9) and not wanting to
   know they had cancer (adjusted OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.0 -9.4).
   CONCLUSION: We have identified factors and beliefs that are barriers to
   Pap test screening in urban cervical cancer patients. Further studies
   should evaluate effects of addressing cultural, cognitive, and financial
   barriers on Pap test compliance. (C) 2004 by The American College of

AB Objective. A primary objective of the Healthy People 2010 initiatives is
   to increase on-time immunization rates during the first 2 years of life
   and to decrease racial disparities in coverage. The objective of this
   study was to determine on-time immunization coverage rates among infants
   and toddlers stratified by race/ethnicity in a large metropolitan
   center.
   Methods. A retrospective cohort study that was based on immunization
   records in the Chicago Public Schools computerized database was
   conducted using all 67376 children who completed kindergarten in 2001
   and 2002.
   Results. On-time immunization rates in Chicago public school children
   are low (31% at 7 months, 32% at 19 months, 59% at 36 months). At 19
   months of age and thereafter, Hispanic children had the highest rate of
   on-time immunization coverage. Among children <48 months old, black
   children had the lowest rates of up-to-date immunization status. At 48
   months of age, the up-to-date rate for black children improved to a rate
   similar to white children (58%) and by school entry surpassed the
   up-to-date rate for white children (71%). Compared with the recommended
   2, 4, 6, and 15 to 18 months schedule, black children received 4 doses
   of diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis at a mean age of 10.0, 14.6,
   20.4, and 34.5 months of age. In contrast, Hispanic children received
   the same doses at a mean of 4.5, 7.4, 11.0, and 25.1 month of age. In
   addition, &SIM;25% of black children received the majority of their
   vaccinations >12 months later than the recommended time intervals.
   Conclusions. Striking immunization delay still exists during the infant
   and toddler years. Targeted efforts are needed to increase on-time
   immunization rates and to decrease racial disparity in immunization
   coverage.

   2001 and still in process, has taken place within a matrix of social and

   that have accompanied previous clinical trials of other vital artificial
   organs and transplantation in the United States-include "experiment
   perilous," and courage, heroism, and pioneering themes; "right stuff"
   motifs; "Americana" symbols; allusions to the meaning of the human
   heart; connections with a for-profit corporation; and the occurrence of
   moratoriums. New patterns-those more particular and distinctive to the
   AbioCor trial-involve the restrictions imposed on releasing information
   about the post-operative clinical status of the implant recipients; the
   quasi-institutionalization of a patient advocacy system to represent
   patient-subjects and their families; and the "crises of success" that
   were encountered when several of the AbioCor recipients survived longer
   than expected. In certain instances, old and new patterns have been
   combined-for example, in some of the idiosyncratic features of the
   AbioCor-associated lawsuit that has resulted in part from the problem of
   the "therapeutic misconception:" the belief that an experimental
   intervention is actually intended to be a treatment.

AB Background. Sociocultural factors that predict noncompliance with
   lipid-lowering medications are not well understood.
   Methods. Interviews and medical record review were conducted for 510
   patients treated with lipid-lowering medications. Compliance with
   lipid-lowering medications was measured by patients' self-assessment of
   medication-taking practices.
   Results. Adjusted for age and sex, there was a higher frequency of
   noncompliance among Black and Hispanic subjects. Adjusted for age, sex,
   and race/ethnicity, noncompliance was associated with medication side
   effects, feelings of sadness or depression, fair or poor health status,
   primary use of a language other than English, single or divorced status,
   fewer and less frequent contact with friends, children in the household,
   and lower education. Independent predictors of noncompliance in
   multivariate models were side effects (OR = 3.9, P < 0.01), sadness or
   depression (OR = 1.9, P = 0.05), Black (OR = 3.7, P < 0.01, vs. White),
   Hispanic (OR = 6.3, P < 0.01, vs. White), single or divorced (OR = 2.1,
   P < 0.01), children in the household (OR = 1.5 per child, P < 0.01), and
   lack of health insurance (OR = 2.4, P = 0.05).
   Conclusions. Unmarried status, feelings of sadness or depression, lack
   of insurance, and children in the household were independently
   associated with poorer compliance with lipid-lowering medications in
   this urban population. Nonetheless, higher noncompliance among minority
   patients persisted independently of these and other specific social,
   cultural, and economic factors. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer

AB The reciprocal connection between religion and family life makes the
   topic of religious intermarriage of particular importance in the
   sociology of religion. Spousal influences are key for motivating
   religious switching and other religious commitments. Religious
   intermarriage has also been shown to influence a host of other outcomes,
   including spousal conflict, domestic violence, divorce, and fertility.
   Using data from the 1973-1994 GSS, I estimate log-multiplicative models
   examining patterns of association between spouses' religious
   affiliations across two broad cohorts. Two-step and FIML Heckman's
   selection models are used to determine how education, migration, cohort,
   and denominational origins influence the probability of intermarriage
   and the distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Religious intermarriage
   increases across cohorts, but declines in homogamy are limited to
   liberal religious groups. Catholics and members of conservative sects
   are less likely to intermarry compared to others. The relative ordering
   of distances between religious groups was unchanged across cohorts.
   Educational attainment increases the likelihood of intermarriage, and
   marriages in which the woman has more education are more likely to be
   heterogamous. However, educational factors have no impact on the
   distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Geographically stable rural
   Southerners are least likely to intermarry and if they do, choose a more
   similar spouse. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article examines the challenge of the culture turn for the
   sociology of religion from several points of view. Looking at the
   congruence between certain feminist theories and the cultural turn, it
   begins by problematizing the Enlightenment idea of the autonomous
   individual seen in rebellion against an oppressive society. The article
   suggests congruence between the cultural turn and certain feminist
   theories in that they both posit the idea of the self as relational. A
   second point of congruence between the cultural turn and feminist theory
   is a new understanding of how selves are constituted through narrative.
   One implication of this for sociologists of religion is that we should
   pay greater attention to practices. This, in turn, leads to a
   reformulation of the relation between structure and culture. It also
   opens the door to seeing how practices are embodied and gendered, and at
   the core of religious identification.

   Methods: Literature from medicine, epidemiology, and the social sciences

   denominations. The evidence is weakest for private religious activity.
   The mechanisms by which religious involvement appear to influence

   psychological resources.
   Conclusions: The religion-mortality literature has developed in both
   size and quality over the past decade. Fruitful avenues for continued
   research include the analysis of (1) more dimensions of religious
   involvement, including religious life histories; (2) population
   subgroups, including specific race/ethnic and socioeconomic populations;
   and (3) a richer set of social, psychologic, and behavioral mechanisms
   by which religion may be related to mortality.

AB This article explores the intersection of recovery and bodily practices
   among stroke survivors. Drawing on the extensive literature on the
   socially constructed body in general, on chronic illness, and on
   interactionist thought, we explore bodily experience as a mechanism that
   informs stroke survivors' understanding and practices of everyday life
   in recovery. We ask a central question: what practical mechanisms does
   the survivor employ to provide meaning to her or his newly disrupted
   body? Data gathered from in-depth interviews with fifty-one discharged
   stroke survivors show that they use three specific technologies of
   bodily management and meaning-making. These are managing the body within
   a mind-body dualism, testing the body in its everyday practices, and
   orienting to the body as a biographically informed phenomenon.

AB Workers at the General Motors (GM) auto assembly factory in Lordstown,
   Ohio, USA, fabled in the industrial sociology literature because of
   their militancy during a 1972 labor dispute, have over the past decade
   approved a succession of contracts whittling down the labor force from
   12,000 to around 3000 today. These reductions were accomplished by
   'attritionary outsourcing'. To explain why labor has accepted such job
   loss, this interview project with Lordstown workers extends accepted
   accounts of deindustrialization by considering the political, material
   and ideological conditions underlying concessionary bargaining. As the
   tactic known as 'whipsawing' became less credible and consequential, GM
   turned to tactics that actively secure worker consent to job loss. Here
   one can see the replacement of Burawoy's hegemonic despotism by a
   despotic hegemony.

   possess representations of problems and algorithms that they use to
   locate solutions. We use this framework to establish a result relevant
   to group composition. We find that when selecting a problem-solving team
   from a diverse population of intelligent agents, a team of randomly
   selected agents outperforms a team comprised of the best-performing
   agents. This result relies on the intuition that, as the initial pool of
   problem solvers becomes large, the best-performing agents necessarily
   become similar in the space of problem solvers. Their relatively greater
   ability is more than offset by their lack of problem-solving diversity.

   terms of background characteristics, drug use patterns, health and
   social problems, sexual risk behavior, and psychosocial factors. The
   sample consisted of 194 HIV+ Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) who were
   enrolled in a sexual risk reduction intervention for meth users. Men who
   injected meth were significantly more likely to be Caucasian, bisexual,
   homeless, divorced/separated, with lower educational attainment as
   compared to non-injectors. Injectors also reported more years of meth
   use, greater frequency and amount of meth use, more social and health
   problems, including higher prevalence of STDs and Hepatitis C, and more
   sexual risk behaviors. In terms of psychosocial factors, injection users
   of meth scored significantly higher on measures of impulsivity and
   experiences of rejection, and lower on a measure of emotional support. A
   multivariate logistic regression revealed that educational attainment
   and experiences of rejection were the factors that best discriminated
   between injection and non-injection users of meth. The unique
   characteristics of injection meth users are discussed in relation to the
   development of effective HIV prevention programs for the target

AB PURPOSE: To determine how sociodemographic characteristics influence
   both access to transplantation and organ donation.
   METHODS: For all transplants in the United States from 1996 to 2001,
   donor-recipient pairs were categorized as white-wbite, white-black,
   black-white, or black-black. The difference in the percentage of
   white-black versus black-white pairs was calculated as a measure of the
   net transfer of organs from one racial group to another. A similar
   approach was used to examine the net transfer of organs across other
   sociodemographic categories.
   RESULTS: Among cadaveric renal transplants, 66% of donor-recipient pairs
   were white-white, 23% were white-black, 5% were black-white, and 6% were
   black-black. Thus, there was an 18% net transfer of organs from white
   donors to black recipients (23% minus 5%). Among living donor
   transplants involving spouses, there was a 36% net transfer from wives
   to husbands. Among all cadaveric transplants, there was a 36% to 68% net
   transfer from younger donors to older recipients. Among cadaveric
   nonrenal transplants, there was a 7% to 18% net transfer from
   lower-income donors to higher-income recipients.
   CONCLUSION: The sociodemographic characteristics of persons who donate
   organs and those who benefit from organ transplantation differ markedly.
   Efforts to improve access and increase donation should address these
   differences. (C) 2004 by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: The purpose of this paper is to examine trends in middle and
   high school students' perceived ease, methods, and locations of access
   to cigarettes, and to assess differences related to their
   sociodemographic characteristics and smoking status.
   Methods: Annual data from nationally representative samples of 8th-,
   10th-, and 12th-grade students were analyzed for the 1997-2002 period.
   Analyses were conducted in 2003.
   Results: Perceived ease of access decreased significantly among never
   and past smokers. Decreased individual purchasing in retail outlets, as
   well as decreased purchasing from vending machines, were reported by
   8th- and 10th-grade students. All grades reported decreased purchasing
   from self-service placements of cigarettes. Decreases in access were not
   reported across all retailer types, and no significant increases were
   seen in the percent of underage purchasers who reported being asked to
   show identification. Both gender and ethnicity were significantly
   related to where and how underage youth reported obtaining cigarettes.
   Conclusions: Cigarette access for minors has been declining, but remains
   high. Findings show that (1) perceived access to cigarettes clearly
   increases with level of smoking, and (2) policies to reduce such access
   may be having an impact as evidenced by decreased retail and vending
   machine purchases and self-service purchases. However, states should
   continue to strengthen efforts to reduce youth cigarette access,
   especially in the areas of confirming buyer age via identification
   checks, and should make efforts to decrease access across all retailer
   types. Federal regulations like those previously implemented by the Food
   and Drug Administration might strongly assist in reducing youth access
   to cigarettes. (C) 2004 American journal of Preventive Medicine.

   of physical activity and sedentary behavior in ethnically diverse teens

   Methods: Longitudinal questionnaire data from U.S. adolescents enrolled
   in Wave I (1994-1995) and Wave III (2001) of the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health (n = 13,030) were analized in January 2004.
   Incidence, reversal, and maintenance of achieving five or more weekly
   bouts of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and less than or
   equal to14 hours of weekly TV and video viewing, computer/video game use
   (screen time) were assessed. Multinomial logistic regression models
   examined the likelihood of achieving five or more weekly sessions of
   NATA week and less than or equal to14 hours screen time per week as an
   adolescent and/or young adult, controlling for household income,
   parental education, age of adolescent, and seasonality.
   Results: Of those achieving five or more weekly sessions of MVPA and
   less than or equal to14 hours of weekly screen time as adolescents, few
   continued to achieve these favorable amounts of activity (4.4%) and
   screen time (37.0%) as adults. More failed to maintain these favorable
   amounts of activity (31.1%) and screen time (17.3%) into adulthood.
   Black versus white females were more likely to maintain favorable
   amounts of activity from adolescence to adulthood (odds ratio [OR]=3.09;
   95% confidence interval [CI] =1.49-6.42), while black males (OR=1.50;
   CI=1.05-2.14) and females (OR=2.00; CI=1.40-2.87*) were more likely than
   whites to maintain less (versus more) favorable screen time hours.
   Conclusions: The vast majority of adolescents do not achieve five or
   more bouts of moderate physical activity per week, and continue to fail
   to achieve this amount of activity into adulthood. (Arn J Prev Med

AB Objectives. We hypothesized that chronic stressors associated with an
   everyday social role (work) would interact with a traumatic macrosocial
   stressor (the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001) in predicting
   mental health status (during the fall of 2001).
   Methods. We used mail surveys returned as part of wave 3 of a workplace
   cohort study, both before and after September 11, 2001, to assess
   decision latitude, sexual harassment, generalized workplace abuse,
   psychological distress, and alcohol use. We also used regression
   analyses to assess the main effect of September 11 and interactions
   between September 11 and stressors, after control for baseline mental
   health.
   Results. The main effect of September 11 on elevated alcohol use was
   significant for women but not for men. For women, work stressors
   significantly interacted with experiencing the events of September 11 to
   affect alcohol use and anxiety outcomes.
   Conclusions. Women experiencing chronic work stressors were most
   vulnerable to elevated psychological distress and alcohol use after
   September 11, 2001.

AB This article analyzes the anomalous case of early Title VII enforcement
   to challenge the standard political-institutional (PI) account of state
   capacity. Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal
   Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement
   resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title
   VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the
   literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence
   of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies
   can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory
   construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social
   movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a
   "moving target," with state and societal actors building on legal as
   well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By
   reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced
   explanations of state policy that are both "political" and
   "institutional" and that highlight the centrality of legal
   interpretation and judicial review to political sociology.

AB Background: Social anxiety disorder is a debilitating, highly prevalent
   disorder in children and adolescents. If left untreated, it can
   interfere with emotional, social, and school functioning.
   Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine in
   children and adolescents with social anxiety disorder.
   Design and Setting: Multicenter, 16-week, randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled, flexible-dose, parallel-group, outpatient study.
   Patients: A total of 322 children (8-11 years of age) and adolescents
   (12-17 years of age) with social anxiety disorder as their predominant
   psychiatric illness.
   Intervention: Eligible patients were randomized (1: 1) to receive
   paroxetine (10-50 mg/d) or placebo.
   Results: Four hundred twenty-five patients were screened, and 322 were
   randomized to treatment. Of these, 319 were included in the
   intention-to-treat population (paroxetine, n = 163; placebo, n = 15 6).
   At the week 16 last observation carried forward end point, the odds of
   responding (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score of 1 or 2) were
   statistically significantly greater for paroxetine (77.6% response
   [125/161]) than for placebo (38.3% response [59/154]) (adjusted odds
   ratio, 7.02; 95% confidence interval, 4.07 to 12.11; P<.001). The
   proportion of patients who were "very much" improved (Clinical Global
   Impression-Improvement score of 1) was 47.8% (77/161) for paroxetine
   compared with 14.9% (23/ 154) for placebo. Adverse events occurring at
   an incidence of 5% or greater for paroxetine and twice that for placebo
   were insomnia (14.1% vs 5.8%), decreased appetite (8.0% vs 3.2%), and
   vomiting (6.7% vs 1.9%). Withdrawals due to adverse events were
   infrequent (5.5% [9/163] for paroxetine and 1.3% [2/156] for placebo).
   Conclusion: Paroxetine is an effective, generally well-tolerated
   treatment for pediatric social anxiety disorder.

AB While white ethnics and immigrants of colour have been studied in terms
   of their attempts to assimilate into the American mainstream,
   sociologists assume that ongoing racial discrimination obviates the need
   for an extensive examination of the actual assimilation trajectories of
   middle-class blacks. Many middle-class blacks travel from the black to
   the white world rather than existing exclusively in one racially
   distinct environment. Yet, we do not fully understand how middle-class
   blacks conceptualize their own integration into American society.
   Drawing on data collected through in-depth interviews with middle-class
   blacks and ethnographic research in a white and a black suburb, I
   establish the link between an affinity for black spaces and the
   alternative assimilation trajectories of middle-class blacks. I find
   that middle-class blacks engage in a variant of segmented assimilation,
   privileging the black world as a site for socializing even if they live
   in a white suburb. This selective pattern of assimilation, what I term
   strategic assimilation , suggests that this population of middle-class
   blacks does not perceive itself as permanently constrained to the bottom
   rung of a racial hierarchy.

AB Examinations of gender differences in alcohol expectancies among college
   drinkers typically have used self-report measures to assess single
   expectancy dimensions and often have been confounded by drinking level.
   This study examined gender differences in alcohol expectancies using 2
   assessment methods. College students (N = 88) completed self-report
   questionnaires, including expectancy likelihood and subjective
   evaluation endorsements of expectancies, and a computerized expectancy
   accessibility task. Expectancy accessibility and endorsement were
   modestly correlated, with higher alcohol consumption and female gender
   linked to greater accessibility and endorsement of social enhancement
   expectancies. Gender moderated the relation between consumption and
   sociability expectancy accessibility; among men, heavier drinking was
   associated with more rapid activation of expectancies. Findings suggest
   complexity in associations among these variables and underscore the need
   to capture the multidimensionality of the expectancy construct and its
   relationship to alcohol use.

AB Compared to traditional, non-Western cultures, emerging adulthood (18-25
   years of age) may look considerably different in cultures that place
   emphasis on the group (i.e., collectivistic) over the individual (i.e.,
   individualistic). However, within minority cultures, individual members
   vary on the extent to which they identify with their heritage culture.
   Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the role that culture,
   particularly acculturation to Canadian aboriginal heritage culture, may
   play in emerging adulthood. Specifically, aboriginal emerging adults who
   scored above or below the mean of their peers on acculturation to their
   heritage (aboriginal) culture were compared to their majority European
   Canadian counterparts in several aspects of emerging adulthood including
   (a) perceived adult status, (b) perceived criteria for adulthood, (c)
   achieved criteria for adulthood, (d) personal beliefs about the future,
   and (e) risk behaviours. Results revealed the significance of examining
   acculturation in understanding the role of culture in the process of
   emerging adulthood, particularly among ethnic minority youth. In
   particular, findings revealed that young aboriginal adults' level of
   identification with aboriginal traditions such as the significance of
   interdependence and maintenance of harmony, the role of children and
   family, and historical sociocultural events appeared to play a role in
   many aspects of emerging adulthood.

AB Using a puppet procedure depicting hypothetical conflict involving the
   participant and a peer, 96 preschoolers' (48 boys and 48 girls; M = 5.14
   years, SD = 0.78 years) expectations about peer conflict were assessed
   as a function of their role in the conflict (i.e., initiator of or
   responder to initial provocation) and the intensity level of the
   conflict. Initiators of conflict expected less conflict escalation and
   subsequent problems with the same peer from the conflict than did
   responders, particularly following low-intensity conflict. Findings also
   indicated that, for low-intensity but not high-intensity conflict, girls
   expected the same peer to provoke them during a subsequent interaction
   more often than did boys. Results provide further support for assessing
   preschoolers' understanding of conflict and are consistent with previous
   work demonstrating a self-serving bias in young children's perceptions
   and reports of their conflicts with other children. Moreover, findings
   are discussed in terms of their implications for the development of peer

AB This study examined relationships between social support, stressful life
   events and antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity. Participants were 72
   women with documented metastatic breast carcinoma, who completed
   self-report measures of social support and life stress. Immune response
   was assessed using the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test.
   Number of positive antigens was significantly related to the interaction
   of social network size and stressful life events (p < 0.05). Number of
   positive antigens was greater for women who had experienced a high
   frequency of stressful life events but who reported a larger network of
   support. However, social network size was inversely related to DTH
   response among women who had experienced fewer stressful life events.
   Average induration size was not significantly related to the quality of
   social support, life stress per se, or their interactions. The
   relationship between social network size and immune response in women
   with metastatic breast cancer depends on prior stressful life
   experience. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Communities need to identify cost-effective interventions for
   HIV prevention to optimize limited resources.
   Methods: The authors developed a spreadsheet tool using Bernoulli and
   proportionate change models to estimate the relative cost-effectiveness
   for 26 HIV prevention interventions including biomedical interventions,
   structural interventions, and interventions designed to change risk
   behaviors of individuals. They also conducted sensitivity analyses to
   assess patterns of the cost-effectiveness across different populations
   using various assumptions.
   Results: The 2 factors most strongly determining the cost-effectiveness
   of the different interventions were the HIV prevalence of the population
   at risk and the cost per person reached. In low-prevalence populations
   (eg, heterosexuals) the most cost-effective interventions were
   structural interventions (eg, mass media, condom distribution), whereas
   in high-prevalence populations (eg, men who have sex with men)
   individually focused interventions to change risk behavior were also
   relatively cost-effective. Among the most cost-effective interventions
   overall were showing videos in STD clinics and raising alcohol taxes.
   School-based HIV prevention programs appeared to be the least
   cost-effective. Needle exchange and needle deregulation programs were
   relatively cost-effective only when injection drug users have a high HIV
   prevalence.
   Conclusions: Comparing estimates of the cost-effectiveness of HIV
   interventions provides insight that can help local communities maximize
   the impact of their HIV prevention resources.

AB Background: The relationship between negative life events and depression
   is inconsistent. The purpose of the current study is to investigate the
   hypothesis that depression in the community may be related more to major
   life events than is depression in psychiatric settings.
   Methods: This hypothesis was tested using depressed primary medical care
   (PC; n=70) and psychiatric patients (n=62). Nondistressed (n=109) and
   distressed/nondepressed PC patients (n=43) served as comparison-control
   groups. Life events were rated using the contextual method of Brown and
   Harris (Brown, G.W., Harris, T.O., 1978. Social origins of depression.
   Tavistock, London).
   Results: Depressed PC patients, but not depressed psychiatric patients,
   were significantly more likely to have recent severe events than the
   comparison-control groups. Self-reported distress in the absence of
   depression was not associated with severe life events.
   Limitations: History of depression was assessed using a simple count of
   number of previous episodes, and the assessment of depression history
   may require more sophisticated assessment. The measure of endogenous
   depression used in this study was created post-hoc and needs
   replication.
   Conclusions: Diathesis-stress models need to accommodate a lack of
   universality for severe stress prior to the onset of depression.
   Clinical strategies may need to reflect patient treatment preferences
   associated with differences across settings with respect to the
   perceived role of stress in their depression. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

   findings also indicated that factors of age, gender, and sampling
   context interacted in a variety of ways to influence these children's
   production of the number of different types of AAE tokens, and the rate
   of dialect.
   Learning outcomes: Readers should have (1) an increased-awareness about

   the proportion of children who have televisions in their bedrooms and
   who eat breakfast or dinner in front of the television; and (3)
   predictors of parental concern about the amount of television their
   child watches.
   Study design Telephone survey administered to 1454 parents of children
   <11 years old derived from a diverse clinic population.
   Results The mean age of the index child was 5.05 years. Mean daily
   reported child media use was as follows: television (1.45 hours; SD,
   1.5); videos (1.1 hours; SD, 1.30); and computer games (0.54 hours; SD,
   0.96). Thirty percent of parents reported that their child ate breakfast
   or dinner in front of the television in the past week, and 22% were
   concerned about the amount of television that their child watched. In
   multivariate linear regression, eating breakfast or dinner in front of
   the television in the past week was associated with increased hours of
   television viewing (0.38 hours [0.21, 0.54]) and video (0.19 hours
   [0.04, 0.34]). Having a television in a child's bedroom was associated
   with increased hours of television (0.25 hours [0.07, 0.43]), video
   viewing (0.31 hours [0.16, 0.47]), and computer games (0.21 hours [0.10,
   0.32]). In general, higher parental education was associated with
   decreased hours of television and video but not computer games. Older
   children were 2 to 3 times more likely than younger children to have a
   television in their bedroom and to have eaten a meal in front of it in
   the past week. More educated parents were less likely to report that
   their child had a television in their bedroom and more likely to be
   concerned about the amount of television their child viewed.
   Conclusions Combined video and computer game usage exceeded television
   usage. Both children of low- and high-income parents are at risk for
   certain behaviors associated with television usage. Parents whose
   children watched more television were more likely to be concerned about
   the amount of television their child viewed.

   pain, stress, social support, and sleep disturbance. CD4 T-cell count
   was obtained from medical records. Results: Greater pain and stress were
   associated with greater sleep disturbance. Greater assistance from
   friends was associated with greater sleep disturbance, whereas greater
   understanding from friends regarding participants' HIV-related stress
   was associated with less sleep disturbance. Conclusion: As expected,
   pain was significantly associated with sleep disturbance. Additionally,
   psychosocial variables were strongly associated with sleep. The type of
   support from friends differentiated whether the support was positively
   or negatively associated with sleep problems. Social support, depending

AB The aim of this study was to characterize ambulatory healthcare
   utilization of older Korean Americans and its association with length of

   who were recent immigrants would use outpatient physician visits less
   often than early immigrants. The data are from the 2000 Korean-American
   Health Survey, which assessed the health status and medical needs of
   Korean Americans living in Los Angeles County. The dependent variable
   was the number of visits to a physician for check-up or consultation.
   Multivariate regression modeling was used to assess the influence of
   length of time since immigration on the dependent variable controlling
   for predisposing, enabling, and need variables for a sample of 208
   Koreans Americans aged 65 and older. Results indicated that high school
   education in Korea and health insurance status were significant
   predictors of number of visits to a physician during the previous year
   (P<.05). The main variable of interest, the number of years living in
   the United States, approached significance at P=.09. It was concluded
   that enabling variables such as education and health insurance
   significantly influenced use of healthcare services in the older
   Korean-American population. The lack of studies regarding older minority
   populations and their access to healthcare further highlight theneed not
   only to characterize the access of these often-vulnerable populations,

   Data are presented for the 138 children (57% boys, 45% black) that were
   dialyzed 3 times/wk, representing 2282 patient-months of follow-up. Pre-
   and postdialysis BUN levels were reported in all children. Kt/V values
   were reported in 76 children; however, sufficient data were obtained to
   calculate Kt/V in 129 children. On average, 14.9 Kt/V and 15.2 urea
   reduction ratio (URR) values were calculated per child. Aggregate
   dialysis dose was defined as adequate if Kt/V was >1.2 in at least 75%
   of calculated Kt/V measures within a subject. Mean +/- SD age was 11.3
   +/- 3.7 yr (median, 12.0 yr). Hemodialysis dose was variable within
   subjects (median CV%: URR 8.2, Kt/V 16.9). Aggregate dialysis dose was
   adequate in 70% of subjects. Multivariate logistic regression showed
   male gender (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.98), black race (OR, 0.28; 95%
   CI, 0.11 to 0.67), larger body surface area (fourth versus first

   at the treating center (OR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10 to 0.62) were significant
   predictors of inadequate dialysis dose. Age, renal diagnosis, and center
   size were not associated with adequacy. Racial and gender disparities in
   hemodialysis dose existed among children at specialized academic
   pediatric centers and a substantial proportion received inadequate

AB Adult immunizations have dramatically improved the health of many
   Americans. In the United States, researchers have documented disparities
   in the utilization of adult vaccinations between whites and racial and
   ethnic minority populations. This article examines racial and ethnic
   attitudes regarding recommended adult vaccinations.
   Methods: Four adult focus groups (N=22) were conducted in community
   churches in San Francisco, CA. Participants were either age-appropriate
   or had clinical indications to receive a strong recommendation for
   influenza and pneumococcal immunizations but had not been routinely
   immunized against influenza and had never been vaccinated against
   pneumococcal disease. Content analysis was used to analyze narrative
   data and identify emerging themes.
   Results: Participants reported that they lacked information about the
   benefits or potential side effects of influenza and pneumococcal
   vaccinations and that their physicians were not routinely informing them
   of, or recommending, these vaccinations. Meanwhile, most participants
   expressed a willingness to be vaccinated against pneumococcal infection
   and influenza. All focus group participants felt that community churches
   were a potential venue for delivery of adult vaccines.
   Conclusions: Many adult racial and ethnic minorities have basic
   information regarding the influenza vaccine but lack sufficient
   information regarding the benefits of pneumococcal vaccinations.
   Physicians should provide information regarding adult vaccinations to
   all patients. On-site vaccination and vaccine education programs in
   community churches may be successful in increasing the utilization of
   adult vaccinations in unvaccinated church populations.

AB Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in mortality have been
   demonstrated in several diseases. African Americans are hospitalized at
   a significantly higher rate than whites for aspiration pneumonia;
   however, no studies have investigated racial and ethnic disparities in
   mortality in this population.
   Objective: To assess the independent effect of race and ethnicity on
   in-hospital mortality among aspiration pneumonia discharges while
   comprehensively controlling for comorbid diseases, and to assess whether
   the prevalence and effects of comorbid illness differed across racial
   and ethnic categories.
   Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective cohort study of 41,581
   patients admitted to California hospitals for aspiration pneumonia from
   1996 through 1998, using principal and secondary diagnoses present on
   admission.
   Measurement: The primary outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.
   Results: The adjusted odds of in-hospital death for African-American
   Compared with white discharges [odds ratio (OR)=1.01; 95% confidence
   interval (CI), 0.91-1.11] was not significantly different. The odds of
   death for Asian compared with white discharges was significantly lower
   (OR=0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91). Hispanics had a significantly lower odds
   of death (OR=0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.988) compared to non-Hispanics.
   Comorbid diseases were more prevalent among African Americans and Asians
   than whites, and among Hispanics compared to non-Hispanics. Differences
   in effects of comorbid disease on mortality risk by race and ethnicity
   were not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Asians have a lower risk of death, and the risk of death for
   African Americans is not significantly different from whites in this
   analysis of aspiration pneumonia discharges. Hispanics have a lower risk
   of death than non-Hispanics. While there are differences in prevalence
   of comorbid disease by racial and ethnic category, the effects of
   comorbid disease on mortality risk do not differ meaningfully by race or
   ethnicity.

AB Objectives. Exposure to violence, particularly domestic violence ( DV),
   negatively affects children's physical, emotional, and cognitive
   well-being. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends routine DV
   screening of female caretakers of pediatric patients. Few reports of
   screening in pediatric practices exist, and none have reported outcomes
   from a resident-run urban academic center. We set out to determine
   whether the use of the Partner Violence Screen (PVS) increases detection
   of DV and to test the mechanics of implementing large-scale DV screening
   in a busy, pediatric residency training clinic.
   Methods. Using the PVS, we screened a sample of consecutive female
   caretakers/ guardians of children seen for pediatric care in the general
   pediatric clinic of Children's Hospital of Michigan from March 1, 2002,
   through February 28, 2003. Positive screens obtained during the study
   period were compared with the number of DV referrals received by the
   clinic social workers from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2001,
   before PVS screening began. To test the mechanics of screening, we also
   analyzed the number of forms returned blank or marked "no opportunity to
   screen" in the last 8 months of the study period.
   Results. In the 12 months before use of the PVS, our social work
   department received 9 referrals because of DV from the general pediatric
   clinic, among a total of 5446 caretakers/ guardians bringing 6380
   children for a total of 13 576 patient care visits. In contrast, the
   social work department received 164 referrals because of positive
   screening results among 5445 caretakers/ guardians bringing 7429
   children for 17 346 patient care visits in the 12-month study period
   after introduction of the PVS. Fourteen of 164 positive PVSs were found
   to involve nondomestic violence perpetrated by nonpartners or violence
   with the patient as the victim, not the mother or female caretaker. A
   total of 150 PVSs involved true DV. The difference in identification of
   DV with the PVS, compared with the rate before its introduction, was
   highly significant. The positive predictive value for the PVS was 91.5%,
   and the identified prevalence rate was 3.7%. In the last 8 months of the
   study period, 6301 of 8055 PVS forms (78%) were completed; 1754 of 8055
   PVS forms (22%) were left blank, but it was not possible to determine
   whether these represented duplicate screening forms for instances in
   which the mother or female caretaker had brought >1 child for care.
   Conclusions. Formal screening for DV with the PVS in this study setting
   of a busy, urban, academic, general pediatric clinic appeared to be very
   successful, in terms of increasing referrals and documentation of
   previously unrecognized DV situations. This increase signals the need
   for resources ( time and/or social work services) to provide appropriate
   referral services. The PVS identifies nonpartner violence occasionally.

AB Background. Nearly half of recent immigrants to the United States lack
   health insurance. Access to cancer screening services for this group is
   problematic. We examine the role of health insurance and having a usual
   source of care (USC) on Pap smear and mammography utilization by
   immigrant women using a nationally representative sample.
   Methods. We used a telephone survey that oversampled racial and ethnic
   minorities. We analyzed data on 3,622 women age 18-70. We classified the
   822 foreign-bom women as recent immigrants if they had resided in the
   United States for under 10 years; LT immigrants were those with a longer
   tenure.
   Results. Among recent immigrants, 73% and 78% (SE 4%) reported a Pap
   smear or mammogram, respectively, in the previous 2 years versus 89% and
   89% of U.S.-bom women (P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Among those with
   insurance or a USC, differences in screening between recent immigrants
   and U.S.-bom women were four percentage points or less and not
   statistically significant. However, uninsured recent immigrants were
   less likely than uninsured U.S.-born women to have Pap smears [60% (SE
   7%) versus 71%, P < 0.051. Adjusting for differences in
   sociodemographics, health attitudes or beliefs, patient or provider
   communication, and the medical care environment, insurance remained the
   strongest predictor of screening.
   Conclusion. Disparities in screening were greatly attenuated among the
   insured population. Increasing awareness of available safety net sources
   of care may also improve cancer screening among uninsured recent
   immigrants. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier

AB Background: The rates and determinants of acceptance of herpes simplex
   virus type 2 (HSV-2) testing have not been adequately studied.
   Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify factors
   associated with acceptance of HSV-2 antibody testing in individuals with
   no history of genital herpes.
   Study: We conducted a cross-sectional survey study followed by the offer
   of free HSV-2 serologic testing at an urban sexually transmitted disease
   (STD) clinic, 2 general adult medical clinics, an urban university
   campus, and an urban adolescent medicine clinic. A total of 1199
   individuals aged 14 to 30 years completed the survey and were offered
   testing.
   Results: A total of 68.4% accepted HSV-2 testing. Factors independently
   associated with acceptance were female sex, older age, having an STD
   history, having 1 or more sexual partners in the last 6 months,
   perceived vulnerability to HSV-2 infection, and perceived benefits of
   HSV-2 testing. Fear of needles predicted rejection of testing, as did
   attending a general medical clinic versus an STD clinic and nonwhite
   race.
   Conclusion: There is a substantial interest in HSV-2 antibody testing
   across a variety of settings. Those at greatest behavioral and historic
   risk for HSV-2 infection, women, and persons whose health beliefs are
   consistent with testing are more likely to accept serologic testing when
   it is offered.

AB This paper adds to the integration of sociology of religion and social
   stratification by bringing together work in social justice from
   sociology of religion and economic issues from social stratification.
   The research focuses on the narrower topic of attitudes toward economic
   justice. Specifically, it focuses on the contributions of both
   religiosity and religious affiliation to such attitudes. The
   contributions of the religious components are assessed independent of
   other factors identified to be important in the two areas. Using data
   from the 1987 panel of the General Social Survey, multiple analyses of
   variance reveals relatively strong structural effects but no
   relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward economic justice.
   Religious affiliation is statistically significant, but of sufficiently
   limited "captured variance that substantive interpretation must wait
   future research.

AB Though landscape vegetation in cities is human-mediated and often more
   diverse than that in surrounding environments, little work has been done
   to quantify ways that humans shape its composition. Our study identified
   important sources of variation in perennial vegetation composition
   within residential neighborhoods of Phoenix, AZ, USA. We hypothesized
   that neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) should offer some capacity
   for predicting landscape vegetation richness and abundance in both
   residential neighborhoods and embedded small city parks. As predicted,
   neighborhood vegetation richness increased across a gradient of low to
   high SES (R-2 = 0.89) with the most variation explained by median family
   income (R-2 = 0.86). In contrast, neighborhood vegetation abundance
   decreased across a gradient of increased time since disturbance (R-2 =
   0.62) with the most variation explained by median year of neighborhood
   development (R-2 = 0.56). Median year of neighborhood development was
   also the dominant factor (R2 = 0.47) in explaining decreased park
   vegetation abundance across a gradient of increased time since
   disturbance. We were least able to predict park vegetation richness and
   could account for only 29% of variation using a SES gradient model with
   percent of population having a graduate education as the most dominant
   factor. In residential neighborhoods, we identified more than 3 times
   the number of landscape vegetation taxa than an earlier report and also
   found a higher percentage of native vegetation in parks than in
   surrounding neighborhoods. We discuss these different compositional
   patterns of perennial vegetation in neighborhoods and embedded parks in
   terms of their relationship to socioeconomic and disturbance gradients,
   and a conceptual framework of "top-down" and "bottom-up" human
   management influences. Our study intimates that residential vegetation
   composition in rapidly expanding, and cities like Phoenix is largely
   driven by "luxury" and legacy effects and should be most rich in
   neighborhoods with the highest socioeconomic standing and most abundant
   in newest neighborhoods. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban designers, ecologists, and social scientists have called for
   closer links among their disciplines. We examine a promising new tool
   for promoting this linkage-the metaphor of "cities of resilience." To
   put this tool to best use, we indicate how metaphor fits with other
   conceptual tools in science. We then present the two opposing
   definitions of resilience from ecology, and give reasons why one is more
   appropriate for linking with design. Additional specific tools and
   insights that are emerging from, or being increasingly used in, ecology
   can further support the linkage with urban design. These include
   recognizing the role of spatial heterogeneity in both ecological and
   social functioning of urban areas, the integrating power of watersheds,
   social and ecological patch dynamics of cities, the utility of spatial
   mosaic models to capture function, the use of an integrated "human
   ecosystem" modeling framework, and the consequent perspective of
   metropolitan areas as integrated ecological-social systems. Three
   additional tools are related to the adaptability of people and human
   institutions. First is the recognition of a "learning loop" in
   metropolitan ecosystems in which people respond to and affect ecological
   change, the use of urban design as experiments whose ecological and
   social outcomes can be measured, and finally the potency of a dialog
   between professionals and citizens, communities, and institutions, to
   support both research and design. The metaphor of resilience, and its
   technical specifications, draw these diverse strands for linking ecology
   and planning together. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Cocaine craving has been implicated as a major factor underlying
   addiction and drug relapse. From a cognitive viewpoint, craving may
   reflect, in part, attentional processing biased in favor of drug-related
   cues and stimuli. Schizophrenic individuals (SZ), however, abuse cocaine
   in high numbers but typically manifest baseline cognitive deficits that
   impair their ability to selectively allocate their attentional
   resources. In this study, we examined the relationship between
   attentional bias and craving in patients with cocaine dependence (COC;
   n=20), schizophrenic patients comorbid for cocaine dependence (COC+SZ;
   n=23), and two other comparison groups using a modified version of the
   Stroop test to include cocaine-relevant words. Results revealed that
   only the COC patients demonstrated Stroop interference on the
   cocaine-related words. Moreover, COC patients' attentional processing
   biases were significantly associated with their cocaine craving severity
   ratings. COC+SZ patients, in contrast, did not demonstrate Stroop
   interference and manifested significantly fewer craving symptoms than
   their COC counterparts. These results suggest that COC+SZ patients'
   inability to selectively encode their drug-use experience may limit and
   shape their subjective experience. of craving cocaine and motivation for
   cocaine use. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND. The disclosure of sexual orientation to physicians is
   uncertain and the reasons are poorly understood. The current study was
   undertaken to describe the disclosure of sexual orientation among sexual
   minority women with breast carcinoma.
   METHODS. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with a
   sample of 39 sexual minority women with a diagnosis of breast carcinoma
   who lived in New England. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using
   qualitative data analysis software. Through constant comparison methods,
   themes related to disclosure were identified from the narrative data.
   RESULTS. Sexual minority patient-provider relationships were marked by
   apprehension, and providers did not inquire about sexual orientation.
   The majority of women actively disclosed their sexual orientation,
   whereas 11 women passively refused disclosure.
   CONCLUSIONS. Providers should create opportunities for the disclosure of
   sexual orientation to provide more comprehensive care.

AB The 1970 Controlled Substances Act was part of an omnibus reform package
   designed to rationalize, and in some respects to liberalize, American
   drug policy. While the legislation provided additional resources for law
   enforcement and a systematic means for regulating the use of most
   psychoactive drugs, it also did away with mandatory minimum sentences
   and provided more support for treatment and research. Over the next
   three decades, and in response to public alarm about drug abuse, the US
   Congress continuously amended the law to produce a more punitive system
   of drug control. The amendments, which gave the Drug Enforcement
   Administration greater control over scheduling and maintenance and which
   substantially increased penalties for illicit trafficking, transformed
   the law into the legal foundation of America's "drug war," as the
   stricter criminal approach came to be known. By the 1980s, the
   flexibility and innovative spirit of the original Controlled Substances
   Act (and that of Nixon-era drug strategy generally) had largely
   disappeared from American drug policy. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB In the United States, the basis of modem drug regulation is the
   Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970. The CSA laid out the authority
   of the federal government and provided a framework within which all
   existing and new substances could be regulated on their abuse potential,
   safety, and medical utility. The debates over the CSA centered on
   several critical issues: where to place the authority to make scheduling
   designations, the impact of scheduling on drug research, and defining
   what constituted drug "abuse" for purposes of scheduling. Passage of the
   CSA was aided by broad language that provided a kind of "big tent" which
   could accommodate diverse points of view. A retrospective assessment of
   the CSA shows it to have greatly expanded federal administrative
   authority over the nation's drug supply, much as its authors intended.
   Other impacts of the CSA, however, are much less certain. This article
   concludes by highlighting the issues and questions that should guide
   future retrospective research on the efficacy of drug control regimes.

   were examined simultaneously in community and clinical-based samples of
   5268 Costa Rican adolescents, ages 12-20, through a series of
   descriptive, ANCOVA and logistic regression analyses. Groups surveyed
   included high school students, street youth, and youth in treatment for
   substance abuse problems. Results revealed significant group differences
   in substance use and significant correlations between depressive
   symptoms and problems with alcohol and drugs. The association between
   depressive symptoms and overall substance use involvement was
   significant for all youth, but strongest for female street youth.
   Logistic regression analyses revealed that depressive symptoms were
   associated with increased odds of specific substance use for all three
   groups, though in the case of street youth and youth in treatment, these
   associations only were observed in males. Analyses of covariance
   indicated that problems with drugs and alcohol differed across group and
   sex. Youth in treatment had more problems with drugs and alcohol than
   other groups. Among street youth, males had more problems with drugs
   than females. This study provides a unique cross-cultural perspective on

   for comparative analyses between community and clinical-based

AB The highest rates of obesity in the United States occur among population
   groups with the highest poverty rates and the least education. The
   impact of socioeconomic variables on obesity may be mediated, in part,
   by the low cost of energy-dense foods. The observed inverse relationship
   between energy density of foods, defined as available energy per unit
   weight (kilocalories per gram or megajoules per kilogram), and energy
   cost (dollars per kilocalorie or dollars per megajoule) means that diets
   based on refined grains, added sugars, and added fats are more
   affordable than the recommended diets based on lean meats, fish, fresh
   vegetables, and fruit. Taste and convenience of added sugars and added
   fats can also skew food choices in the direction of prepared and
   prepackaged foods. Paradoxically, attempting to reduce diet costs may
   lead to the selection of energy-dense foods, increased energy intakes,
   and overweight. The present energy-cost framework provides an economic
   explanation for the observed links between obesity and the food
   environment, with diet cost as the principal intervening variable. If
   higher food costs represent both a real and perceived barrier to dietary
   change, especially for lower-income families, then the ability to adopt
   healthier diets may have less to do with psychosocial factors,
   self-efficacy, or readiness to change than with household economic
   resources and the food environment. Continuing to recommend costly diets
   to low-income families as a public health measure can only generate
   frustration and culpability among the poor and less-well educated.

AB In this commentary, I place the maturing field of rural health research
   and policy in the context of the rural health disparities documented in
   Health United States, 2001, Urban and Rural Health Chartbook. Because of
   recent advances in our understanding of the determinants of health, the
   field must branch out from its traditional focus on access to health
   care services toward initiatives that are based on models of population
   health.
   In addition to presenting distinct regional differences, the chartbook
   shows a pattern of risky health behaviors among rural populations that
   suggest a "rural culture" health determinant. This pattern suggests that
   there may be environmental and cultural factors unique to towns,
   regions, or United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) economic
   types that affect health behavior and health.

   Whereas differences between rural and urban residents were observed for

   to be disadvantaged compared with suburban areas.
   If health disparities are to be successfully addressed, the relationship

AB Objectives. We evaluated self-perceived access to health care in a
   cohort of Medicare beneficiaries.
   Methods. We identified patterns of use and barriers to health care from
   self-administered questionnaires collected during the 1993-1994 annual
   examination of the Cardiovascular Health Study.
   Results. The questionnaires were completed by 4889 (91.1%) participants,
   with a mean age of 76.0 years. The most common barriers to seeing a
   physician were the doctor's lack of responsiveness to patient concerns,
   medical bills, transportation, and street safety. Low income, no
   supplemental insurance, older age, and female gender were independently
   related to perceptions of barriers. Race was not significant after
   adjustment for other factors.
   Conclusions. Psychological and physical barriers affect access to care
   among the elderly; these may be influenced by poverty more than by race.

AB Objectives. We used 1997 Medicare data to replicate an earlier study
   that used data from 1986 to examine racial differences in usage of
   specific medical procedures or tests among elderly persons.
   Methods. We used 1997 physician claims data to obtain a random sample of
   5% of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years and older. We used this
   sample to study 30 procedures and tests that were analyzed in the 1986
   study, as well as several new procedures that became more widely used in
   the early 1990s.
   Results. Racial differences remain in the rates of use of these
   procedures; in general, Blacks have lower rates of use than do Whites.
   Between 1986 and 1997, the ratio of White to Black use moved in favor of
   Blacks for all but 4 of the established procedures studied.
   Conclusions. The White-Black gap in health care use under Medicare is
   narrowing.

   Methods. At baseline and 3-year follow-up, we interviewed 4245 community
   residents (61.4% Black, 38.4% White, 0.20% other) aged 65 years or
   older. We used logistic regression to test predictors of beginning
   caregiving among baseline noncaregivers and of continuing caregiving
   among baseline caregivers.
   Results. After control for demographic variables, physically healthier
   individuals were significantly more likely to become caregivers and to
   continue caregiving. Mental health had little influence on beginning
   caregiving, but declining mental heath was associated with continuing
   caregiving.
   Conclusions. Maintenance of physical health and function is essential to
   the ability of older adults to begin and to continue caregiving. Studies
   that compare the health of current caregivers with that of noncaregivers
   may substantially underestimate the impact of caregiving on health.

AB Several researchers have suggested that ovulation may not be concealed
   in humans living under natural conditions with minimal hygiene. Because
   measuring coital frequency in such a population is problematic, I tested
   this proposition indirectly by asking Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania
   when a woman can get pregnant. If people ( 1) know that pregnancy is
   caused by sex, and people ( 2) say that women conceive in the middle of
   the menstrual cycle, we might infer that people think women conceive in
   the middle of the cycle because most copulations occur then. If
   copulation peaks strongly around ovulation, it is not concealed. The
   Hadza know that pregnancy is caused by sex but most say conception
   occurs right after menstruation ends. Hadza conception beliefs therefore
   do not suggest that ovulation is more detectable in humans under more
   natural conditions.

AB Introduction: Population-based health surveys seldom assess sexual
   orientation, which results in the absence of a reliable measure of
   smoking among lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGB), a population
   perceived to have higher risks of tobacco-related diseases. This is the
   first study to compare the cigarette smoking rate of LGB with that of
   heterosexual individuals using a population-based sample with both male
   and female adults, and to identify which sub segments of LGB population
   are particularly burdened by tobacco use.
   Methods: California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a population-based
   telephone survey was used to assess smoking prevalence and its
   correlates among respondents. Of 44,606 respondents, 343 self-identified
   as lesbian; 593 self-identified as gay; and 793 identified themselves as
   bisexual ( 511 female and 282 male). Statistical analysis was performed
   using SAS and SUDAAN.
   Results: Lesbians' smoking rate (25.3%), was about 70% higher than that
   of heterosexual women (14.9%). Gay men had a smoking prevalence of
   33.2%, comparing to heterosexual men (21.3%). After controlling for
   demographic variables, logistic regression analysis showed that lesbians
   and bisexual women were significantly more likely to smoke compared with
   heterosexual women ( OR = 1.95 and OR = 2.08, respectively). Gay men
   were also significantly more likely to smoke than heterosexual men ( OR
   = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.66 - 2.73). Being 35 - 44-years-old, non-Hispanic
   White, and having low-education attainment and low-household income were
   common demographic predictors of cigarette smoking among LGB.
   Conclusion: Our study provides the strongest evidence to date that
   lesbians, bisexual females, and gay men had significantly higher
   cigarette smoking prevalence rates than their heterosexual counterparts.

AB To determine relationships among social predictors and sarcoidosis
   severity at presentation, demographic characteristics, socioeconomic
   status, and barriers to care, A Case-Control Etiologic Study of
   Sarcoidosis (ACCESS) was set up.
   Patients self-reported themselves to be Black or White and were
   tissue-confirmed incident cases aged greater than or equal to18-yrs-old
   (n=696) who had received uniform assessment procedures within one of 10
   medical centres; and were studied using standardised questionnaires and
   physical, radiographical, and pulmonary function tests. Severity was
   measured by objective disease indicators, subjective measures of
   dyspnoea and short form-36 subindices.
   The results of the study showed that lower income, the absence of
   private or Medicare health insurance, and other barriers to care were
   associated with sarcoidosis severity at presentation, as were race, sex,
   and age. Blacks were more likely to have severe disease by objective
   measures, while women were more likely than males to report subjective
   measures of severity. Older individuals were more likely to have severe
   disease by both measures.
   In conclusion, it was found that low income and other financial barriers
   to care are significantly associated with sarcoidosis severity at
   presentation even after adjusting for demographic characteristics of
   race, sex, and age.

AB Urbanization is occurring at an explosive rate, and many cities,
   especially in low-income countries, are struggling to control growth and
   stop the development of unplanned communities. This research
   investigates the in-home environmental health risks associated with
   planned and unplanned growth in peri-urban communities (neighborhoods)
   of a rapidly growing city in Northern Mexico. Surveys were conducted
   during home visits to 98 households in a planned community and 202
   households in unplanned communities of comparable, though slightly
   higher, socio-economic status. To assess the differences for the two
   types of communities, multiple risk factors were measured and compared.
   Results showed that households in both planned and unplanned communities
   were vulnerable to poor environmental health conditions, but more risk
   factors and negative health outcomes were associated with unplanned
   communities. Some of the obvious benefits of living in a planned
   community included better-constructed homes and water and sewer
   connections. Other study results indicated that households in the
   planned community reported fewer cases of respiratory problems (P =
   0.039) and dizziness (P = 0.009). They were also less likely to store
   insecticides and other chemicals inappropriately in their home (P <
   0.001). Providing adequate housing infrastructure appears to provide a
   number of important benefits to health and behavior beyond the simple
   provision of additional amenities in the home.

AB Background: Limited research has examined the impact of social support
   on the course of bipolar disorder, although results suggest a probable
   link. This study examines prospectively the effects of stressful events
   and social support on episode recurrence in bipolar I disorder. Methods:
   Fifty-two outpatients with bipolar I disorder recruited from an urban
   community were followed every 3 months for up to 1 year. At the initial
   interview, individuals reported separately on perceived social support
   from a best friend, parent, and romantic partner, combined to form a
   total network support score. Ongoing prospective assessments of
   stressful life events, symptomatology, and medication compliance were
   completed over I year. Logistic regressions were utilized to predict
   episode recurrence. Results: As predicted, both higher levels of stress
   and lower levels of social support from the total network independently
   predicted depressive recurrence over a 1-year follow-up, after
   controlling for clinical history and compliance. Social support did not
   moderate the impact of stress. Limitations: Only a 1-year follow-up was
   obtained, and sample sizes may have been insufficient to detect
   prediction of manic episodes. Direction of causality between support and
   recurrence is hypothesized but cannot be definitively determined.
   Conclusions: Higher levels of stress and perceptions of less available
   and poorer quality close relationships are associated with recurrence.
   Interventions that target these psychosocial vulnerabilities may help
   alter the course of bipolar 1 disorder. Research with larger samples
   should further examine the possible polarity-specific effects of social
   risk factors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article examines the effects of status differentiation on the
   cohesion of a social structure. Using a formal model, we simulate the
   fates of a hypothetical cohort of newly hired employees, who are equals
   in the eyes of their boss and in the nascent stages of sorting into a
   status hierarchy. We cast these employees in a process in which they
   exert effort, receive public approval from the boss in exchange, and
   thus come to fill different places in a status order. We then consider
   the circumstances under which these workers cohere as a group and when,
   by contrast, differentiation makes cohesion among them unlikely. Our
   results show that the extent of the boss's autonomy in relationship to
   employees accounts for this difference in outcomes. Under an autonomous
   boss, as differentiation transpires, status-based social forces break
   the group of workers apart. Conversely, when the boss occupies a
   compromised position, group-level cohesion coexists with
   differentiation. Our main contribution is the intuition that the
   cohesion-related consequences of status differentiation can
   substantially depend on the tie between contestants and their external
   audience. We conclude by developing conjectures for empirical research
   consistent with our main findings.

AB Simple indicators reflecting diet quality for young children are needed
   both for programs and in some research contexts. Measures of dietary
   diversity are relatively simple and were shown to be associated with
   nutrient adequacy and nutritional status. However, dietary diversity
   also tends to increase with income and wealth; thus, the association
   between dietary diversity and child nutrition may be confounded by
   socioeconomic factors. We used data from 11 recent Demographic and
   Health Surveys (DHS) to examine the association between dietary
   diversity and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ) for children 6-23 mo old,
   while controlling for household wealth/ welfare and several other
   potentially confounding factors. Bivariate associations between dietary
   diversity and HAZ were observed in 9 of the 11 countries. Dietary
   diversity remained significant as a main effect in 7 countries in
   multivariate models, and interacted significantly with other factors
   (e.g., child age, breast-feeding status, urban/ rural location) in 3 of
   the 4 remaining countries. Thus, dietary diversity was significantly
   associated with HAZ, either as a main effect or in an interaction, in
   all but one of the countries analyzed. These findings suggest that there
   is an association between child dietary diversity and nutritional status
   that is independent of socioeconomic factors, and that dietary diversity
   may indeed reflect diet quality. Before dietary diversity can be
   recommended for widespread use as an indicator of diet quality,
   additional research is required to confirm and clarify relations between
   various dietary diversity indicators and nutrient intake, adequacy, and
   density, for children with differing dietary patterns.

   company completed a confidential Health Risk Appraisal (HPLA) that
   included an eight-item version of the Work Limitations Questionnaire and
   a self-report of time missed from work during the previous 2 weeks to
   care for an ill dependent. A total of 10.6% of the respondents reported
   an average of 7.7 hours absent from work during the previous 2-week
   period to provide care for an ill dependent. Caregiving also was
   associated with a significant increase in the number of health risks for
   the employee. As the demand for caregiving time increased, caregivers
   reported a significant increase in work limitations. Caregiving for an
   ill dependent is associated with increased absenteeism and significant
   work limitations while on the job. Programs and work organization that
   helps employees balance their caregiving responsibilities for ill
   dependents may have a positive effect on health and productivity.

AB The Drug Abuse Treatment Cost Analysis Program (DATCAP) was designed in
   the early 1990s as a research guide to collect and analyze financial
   data from addiction treatment programs. The addiction research community
   could clearly benefit from a version of the DATCAP that reduced the time
   and effort required for its administration without compromising the
   integrity of its cost estimates. This paper introduces the Brief DATCAP
   and presents some preliminary findings. Initial feedback from
   respondents suggests that the Brief DATCAP is understandable, and easier
   and quicker to complete than the DATCAP. More importantly, preliminary
   results indicate that cost estimates from the Brief DATCAP differ from
   those of the longer DATCAP by less than 2%. These results have important
   research and policy implications because a shorter yet reasonably
   accurate cost instrument will enhance the feasibility and precision of

AB This article presents the main outcome findings from two inter-related
   randomized trials conducted at four sites to evaluate the effectiveness
   and cost-effectiveness of five short-term outpatient interventions for
   adolescents with cannabis use disorders. Trial I compared five sessions
   of Motivational Enhancement Therapy plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
   (MET/CBT) with a 12-session regimen of MET and CBT (MET/CBT 12) and
   another that included family education and therapy components (Family
   Support Network [FSN]). Trial II compared the five-session MET/CBT with
   the Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach (ACRA) and
   Multidimensional Family Therapy (MDFT). The 600 cannabis users were
   predominately white males, aged 15-16. All five CYT interventions
   demonstrated significant pre-post treatment improvements during the 12
   months after random assignment to a treatment intervention in the two
   main outcomes: days of abstinence and the percent of adolescents in
   recovery (no use or abuse/dependence problems and living in the
   community). Overall, the clinical outcomes were very similar across
   sites and conditions; however, after controlling for initial severity,
   the most cost-effective interventions were MET/CBT5 and MET/CBT12 in
   Trial 1 and ACRA and MET/CBT5 in Trial 2. It is possible that the
   similar results occurred because outcomes were driven more by general
   factors beyond the treatment approaches tested in this study; or because
   of shared, general helping factors across therapies that helped these
   teens attend to and decrease their connection to cannabis and alcohol.

AB The purpose of this study was to assess parenting knowledge and beliefs
   among drug abusing pregnant and recently postpartum women engaged in a
   comprehensive substance abuse treatment program. The effects of a
   parenting skills training program for this population were evaluated. A
   Parenting Skills Questionnaire was developed and administered to a
   sample of 73 pregnant and drug-dependent women during their first week
   of substance abuse treatment and again approximately 7 weeks later,
   following parenting skills training. The questionnaire was designed to
   assess whether group and individual parenting sessions changed the
   subjects' knowledge and beliefs in four parenting domains: newborn care,
   feeding practices, child development and drug abuse during pregnancy.
   Pre-intervention scores for all parenting domains were low. Post- vs.
   pre-intervention comparisons showed significant increases in all domain
   scores after individual and group parenting skills training. Preliminary
   results obtained from this clinic-based sample suggest that these
   substance abusing mothers lacked important parenting knowledge and that
   this knowledge improved after comprehensive substance abuse treatment
   that included parenting training. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB We evaluated mobile street-based outreach as a modality for linking
   street-walking female sex workers with substance abuse treatment in New
   York City. Sex workers (N = 179) approaching an existing outreach
   facility were randomly assigned to receive usually provided services, or
   to receive an enhanced version of these services. Among the 144 women
   successfully followed for 6 months, 35.0% were detoxified; 43.1% of the
   78 current heroin users received methadone maintenance; and 35.4% of the
   followed-up clients received some other type of treatment. Intervention
   group differences in these outcomes were not significant. Detoxification
   during followup was associated with heroin dependence and lifetime
   detoxification. Methadone maintenance (among heroin users) was
   associated with Hispanic ethnicity and legally mandated treatment. Other
   types of treatments were negatively associated with the degree of
   involvement in the sex trade. We conclude that a variety of factors
   affect motivation for substance abuse treatment among female sex
   workers, and that street-based outreach is a highly effective modality
   for linking this population with much needed treatment. (C) 2004

AB There are limited data about minority physicians' professional
   satisfaction and job stress. In this study, we describe by race and
   ethnicity, satisfaction, and job stress among a national sample of
   physicians. We analyzed data from 2,217 respondents to the Physicians'
   Worklife Survey (PWS), a career satisfaction survey of physicians drawn
   from the AMA Physician Masterfile. Scales measuring overall job and
   career satisfaction and work-related stress were constructed from
   Likert-response items. We examined the association between physician
   ethnicity and each of these scales. Respondents included 57 black, 134
   Hispanic, 400 Asian or Pacific Islander, and 1,626 white physicians. In
   general, minority physicians appeared to serve a more demanding patient
   base than did white physicians. Hispanic physicians reported
   significantly higher job (p = 0.05) and career (p = 0.03) satisfaction
   compared to white physicians but no significant difference in stress.
   Asian or Pacific Islander physicians averaged lower job satisfaction (p
   = 0.01) and higher stress (p < 0.01) compared to white physicians. Black
   physicians did not differ significantly from white physicians on any of
   the three measures. Significant racial and ethnic variations were found
   with respect to several specific satisfaction domains: autonomy, patient
   care issues, relations with staff, relations with the community, pay,
   and resources.

AB Purpose: Prostate cancer provides the most dramatic evidence of cancer
   disparities based on race and ethnicity among U.S. men. African-American
   men still hold a commanding lead in both prostate cancer incidence and
   mortality, particularly among those of low socioeconomic status (SES)
   and the medically underserved. Therefore, the need for early
   intervention persists. The purpose of this exploratory pilot study was
   to: a) assess the knowledge of a cohort of low-SES African-American men
   regarding prostate health/prostate cancer, and b) uncover
   myths/misinformation as barriers to prostate health decisions and
   behaviors.
   Procedures: Asymptomatic African-American men participated in focus
   groups to candidly discuss: a) health concerns, b) prostate health, c)
   prostate cancer screening, diagnosis and treatment, and d) factors
   influencing prostate health decisions/behaviors.
   Findings: Participants revealed sociocultural and psychological
   barriers: myths and lack of accurate/adequate knowledge about prostate
   health and cancer, fear, denial and apathy.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest factors that may explain the
   reluctance and limited participation in prostate health and prostate
   cancer services among medically underserved, socioeconomically
   disadvantaged, African-American men. Lack of knowledge, which affects
   all barriers to care, is amenable to change. Therefore, improvements in
   prostate cancer outcomes are achievable through culturally and
   linguistically appropriate health education tailored to their specific
   needs.

AB Objective. Although many major health care organizations have made
   recommendations regarding physicians' roles in preventing youth
   violence, the efficacy of violence prevention strategies in primary care
   settings remains to be empirically tested. Methods. We conducted a
   randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effects of an office-based
   intervention on children's violent behaviors and violence-related
   injuries. Children 7 to 15 years of age who presented at 8 pediatric
   practices and scored positive on a brief psychosocial screening test (n
   = 224) were randomly assigned to an intervention group ( clinicians saw
   the screening test results during the visit and a telephone-based
   parenting education program was made available to clinicians as a
   referral resource for parents) or a control group ( clinicians did not
   see the screening test results). Results. Compared with control
   subjects, at 9 months after study enrollment, children in the
   intervention group exhibited decreases in aggressive behavior ( adjusted
   mean difference: - 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI): - 2.89 to -
   0.53), delinquent behavior ( adjusted mean difference: - 0.71; 95% CI: -
   1.28 to - 0.13), and attention problems ( adjusted mean difference: -
   1.02; 95% CI, - 1.77 to - 0.26) on the Child Behavior Checklist.
   Children in the intervention group had lower rates of parent-reported
   bullying ( adjusted odds ratio: 4.43; 95% CI: 1.87-10.52), physical
   fighting ( adjusted odds ratio: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.11-2.87), and
   fight-related injuries requiring medical care ( adjusted odds ratio:
   4.70; 95% CI: 1.33-16.59) and of child-reported victimization by
   bullying ( adjusted odds ratio: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.96-5.31). Conclusions. A
   primary care-based intervention that includes psychosocial screening and
   the availability of a parenting education resource can decrease violent
   behavior and injury among youths.

AB Background. Relatives of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients are at
   increased risk of developing CRC themselves. Although this
   increased-risk group could benefit from screening, many do not undergo
   screening. Little is known about the reasons why this group chooses not
   to be screened, and understanding these reasons has implications for the
   development of tailored interventions.
   Methods. Telephone interviews were conducted with 132 nonscreening
   relatives of CRC patients. Variables collected included reasons for not
   screening, intent to be screened in the future, potential prompts to
   future screening, and perceived benefits and barriers to screening as
   well as perceived CRC risk.
   Results. We were able to categorize the majority of nonscreeners into
   four discrete types: a group who cite feeling healthy as their reason
   for not screening (n = 40), a group whose physicians have not endorsed
   screening (n = 18), a younger group who were told to wait to be screened
   (n = 21), and a group who anticipate discomfort and pain with screening
   (n = 20).
   Conclusions. It is possible to identify distinct groups of nonscreeners
   according to their particular barriers and reasons for not screening.
   Tailored interventions can be designed to address the specific issues in
   each of these groups. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and

AB Previous research has shown lower testosterone (T) levels associated
   with involvement in committed, romantic relationships ("paired" men) and
   paternal care in eight studies of North American men. An unanswered
   question is whether differences in mate T levels associated with
   relationship status better reflect state (e.g., a man has lower T levels
   because he is involved in a relationship) or trait (e.g., low T men are
   more inclined toward such relationships) effects. Toward addressing this
   question, this paper presents data on mate salivary T levels among a
   sample of 65 men varying in marital and parental status. Subjects
   collected saliva samples (at approximately waking, 17:00 and 21:00 h)
   and filled out questionnaires concerning their activities on four days.
   Each subject collected samples in two settings that varied in social
   interactions: for unmarried men, two working and two non-working days;
   for married non-fathers, two days spent mostly with their wives and two
   days spent mostly away from their wives; and for married fathers, two
   days spent mostly with their young children and two days spent mostly
   away from their children. Analyses revealed no significant
   within-subject T differences between these different conditions.
   However, between-group analyses revealed that married men had lower
   evening T levels than unmarried men, corroborating existing North
   American studies of mate T and relationship status. These results
   suggest that day-to-day differences in social interactions may not be
   associated with differences in T levels, and tend further support to the
   growing body of evidence that hormone-behavior effect sizes may be
   greater in the afternoon and evening than in the morning. (C) 2004

AB While hopelessness has been widely observed in schizophrenia and its
   clinical significance accepted, research has been equivocal regarding
   its relationship to symptoms and neurocognition. One possible reason for
   this is that different domains of hope have differential relationships
   to outcome. To explore this possibility, two aspects of hope,
   expectations of the future and motivation to persist were assessed along
   with neurocognition, personality, symptoms and social function among 52
   persons in a post acute phase of schizophrenia. Multiple regressions
   revealed that neuroticism, verbal memory and income were each uniquely
   related to expectations of the future, accounting for almost one half of
   the variance (F = 14.3, p < 0.0001). By contrast, neuroticism and social
   isolation were uniquely related to motivational hope (F = 13.6, p <
   0.0001), accounting for 35% of the variance. Positive and negative
   symptoms were unrelated to either form of hopelessness. Implications for
   research, and the development of interventions are discussed. (C) 2004

AB This study aims to identify how institutional forces, such as regulatory

   behavior by hotel facilities participating in Certification for
   Sustainable Tourism, a voluntary environmental program established by
   the Costa Rican government. This program is among the first third-party
   performance-based environmental certification initiatives implemented in
   the developing world. Findings suggest that voluntary environmental
   programs that include performance-based standards and third-party
   monitoring may be effective in promoting beyond-compliance environmental
   behavior when they are complemented by isomorphic institutional
   pressures exerted by government environmental monitoring and trade
   association membership. These results are consistent with
   neo-institutional theory from the organizational sociology literature.
   Surprisingly, findings also indicate that compared to locally owned
   hotels, foreign-owned and multinational subsidiary facilities do not
   seem to be significantly correlated with higher participation and
   superior environmental performance in Certification for Sustainable

   study of the content of the indexes and the body of texts on sociology
   of the family, examining the way in which the experiences of whites were
   addressed relative to families of color. We found that whites were more
   often presented as a comparison group to families of color rather than
   as groups with histories and experiences of their own. We recommend that
   textbooks avoid separate sections for families of color, examine whites
   with the same scrutiny as families of color, examine white privilege as
   well as minority disadvantage, and focus on the positive experiences of
   families of color.

AB The quest for happiness has expanded from a focus on relieving suffering
   to also considering how to promote happiness. However, both approaches
   have yet to be conducted in an evolutionary framework based on the
   situations that shaped the capacities for happiness and sadness. Because
   of this, the emphasis has almost all been on the disadvantages of
   negative states and the benefits of positive states, to the nearly total
   neglect of 'diagonal psychology', which also considers the dangers of
   unwarranted positive states and the benefits of negative emotions in
   certain situations. The situations that arise in goal pursuit contain
   adaptive challenges that have shaped domain-general positive and
   negative emotions that were partially differentiated by natural
   selection to cope with the more specific situations that arise in the
   pursuit of different kinds of goals. In cultures where large social
   groups give rise to specialized and competitive social roles, depression
   may be common because regulation systems are pushed far beyond the
   bounds for which they were designed. Research on the evolutionary
   origins of the capacities for positive and negative emotions is urgently
   needed to provide a foundation for sensible decisions about the use of
   new mood-manipulating technologies.

AB Two key types of well-being, eudaimonic and hedonic, are reviewed. The
   first addresses ideas of self-development, personal growth and
   purposeful engagement, while the second is concerned with positive
   feelings such as happiness and contentment. How well-being varies by age
   and socio-economic standing is briefly summarized, followed by
   examination of its biological correlates (neuroendocrine, immune,
   cardiovascular, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep). Preliminary findings on
   a sample of ageing women showed that those with higher levels of
   eudaimonic well-being had lower levels of daily salivary cortisol,
   pro-inflammatory cytokines, cardiovascular risk, and longer duration REM
   sleep compared with those showing lower levels of eudaimonic well-being.
   Hedonic well-being, however, showed minimal linkage to biomarker
   assessments. Future research directions building on these initial
   findings are discussed.

   The main message of the paper is that intelligence cannot fully or even
   meaningfully be understood outside its cultural context. Behaviour that
   is considered intelligent in one culture may be considered unintelligent
   in another culture, and vice versa. Moreover, people in different
   cultures have different implicit (folk) theories of intelligence, so may
   not even mean the same thing by the word. The relationships between
   different aspects of intelligence can vary across cultures, with
   correlations that are positive in one setting proving to be negative in
   another. The paper opens with a general discussion of issues regarding
   the relationship between the two concepts. It then describes the theory
   of successful intelligence, which motivates our work on the interface
   between culture and intelligence. Finally, the article draws some
   conclusions.

   designed to explore the social context of subjective evaluations of
   well-being, of happiness, and of health. Social capital, as measured by
   the strength of family, neighbourhood, religious and community ties, is
   found to support both physical health and subjective well-being.
   Our new evidence confirms that social capital is strongly linked to
   subjective well-being through many independent channels and in several
   different forms. Marriage and family, ties to friends and neighbours,
   workplace ties, civic engagement (both individually and collectively),
   trustworthiness and trust: all appear independently and robustly related
   to happiness and life satisfaction, both directly and through their
   impact on health.

AB Background: The rate of diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis and/or
   pulmonary embolism (collectively, venous thromboembolism: VTE) among
   patients discharged from Indian Health Service hospital care from 1980
   through 1996 was considerably lower than rates reported in African
   Americans or whites. Expansion of the national census in 1990 to include
   American Indians and Alaskan Natives permits a more in-depth examination
   of this issue.
   Methods: Combined data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey
   (nonfederal hospitals) and the Indian Health Service (federal hospitals)
   from 1996 through 2001 were used to evaluate the rate of diagnosis of
   VTE in American Indians and Alaskan Natives.
   Results: The diagnosis of VTE in American Indians and Alaskan Natives,
   based on combined data from the National Hospital Discharge Survey and
   the Indian Health Service was 71 per 100000 per year compared with 155
   per 100000 per year in African Americans (P<.001) and 131 per 100000 per
   year in whites (P<.001). The rate ratio comparing the rate of diagnosis
   of VTE in American Indians and Alaskan Natives with African Americans
   was 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.47) and comparing American
   Indians and Alaskan Natives with whites it was 0.54 (95% confidence
   interval, 0.53-0.55).
   Conclusions: The observed relatively low incidence of VTE in American
   Indians and Alaskan Natives would seem to be due to as yet undetermined
   genetic factors. The possibility that American Indians and Alaskan
   Natives have different lifestyles that affect the rate of diagnosis of
   VTE cannot be excluded.

AB The purpose of the study was to investigate whether changing Michigan's
   safety belt law from secondary to primary (standard) enforcement
   resulted in police harassment. The study investigated
   safety-belt-enforcement-related harassment by considering three
   measures: citizen complaints arising from enforcement of the safety belt
   law; citation over-representation, that is, a statistical determination
   of whether certain groups received more citations than would be expected
   based upon their presence in the driving population and their rate of
   violating the safety belt use law: and self-reported harassment among
   the population of people who receive safety belt citations.
   Safety-belt-related harassment complaints were very uncommon both before
   and after primary enforcement. Implementation of primary enforcement did
   not lead to an increase in citation over-representation, and, therefore,
   safety-belt-related harassment by sex, race, or age. The vast majority
   of people receiving safety belt citations reported officer behavior as
   professional and did not feel that they were singled out for their
   citation. However, a sizeable minority of Blacks and young people report
   perceptions of safety-belt-related harassment. Results suggest that
   states with secondary enforcement should continue their efforts to
   change to primary enforcement, but should also make a strong effort to
   educate both law enforcement and the public about the harassment issue.

AB The prevalence of osteoporosis and factors associated with treatment
   initiation after detection of osteoporosis were determined for
   previously unscreened, postmenopausal women. Dual-energy x-ray
   absorptiometry screening was conducted in 1997-2000 as part of an
   ancillary study of the Buffalo, New York, center of the Women's Health
   Initiative Observational Study. A total of 945 women were previously
   unaware of their bone density, although, for 344 (36.4%), osteoporosis
   was newly detected through screening (T-score less than or equal to
   -2.5). Of those women, 250 (72.7%) discussed the results with a health
   care provider, and 140 (56.0%) initiated treatment after doing so. In
   multivariate logistic regression analyses, factors associated with
   treatment initiation were T-score (odds ratio (OR) = 0.39 per unit
   increase, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23, 0.67), routine medical
   care more often than yearly (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.12, 3.86), college
   education (OR = 2.58, 95% CI: 1.25, 5.31), family income of greater than
   or equal to$50,000 (OR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.14), and discussing
   screening results with a gynecologist (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.33, 7.67).
   These findings suggest that many postmenopausal women are unaware of
   their bone density and could benefit from screening. In this study,
   approximately half of the women with osteoporosis initiated treatment
   after screening. Disease severity, medical care frequency, education,
   income, and physician type predicted treatment initiation.

AB Objective: Prior studies have found high rates of alcohol use and
   abuse/dependence, depression, bankruptcy, and incarceration associated
   with recreational gambling. Despite growing rates of recreational
   gambling in older adults, little is known regarding its health
   correlates in this age group. The objective of this study was to
   identify health and well-being correlates of past-year recreational
   gambling in adults age 65 years and older, compared to adults age 18-64
   years.
   Method: The Gambling Impact and Behavior Study surveyed by telephone a
   nationally representative sample of 2,417 adults. Multivariate analyses
   were used to compare past-year recreational gamblers and nongamblers in
   the older and younger age groups on measures of alcohol use and
   abuse/dependence, substance abuse/dependence, depression, mental health
   treatment, subjective general health, incarceration, and bankruptcy.
   Additional analyses compared the gambling patterns in older and younger
   adult past-year recreational gamblers.
   Results: After the effects of sociodemographic factors were controlled,
   older adult past-year recreational gamblers were more likely to report
   past-year alcohol use and better health than were older nongamblers.
   Multivariate analyses investigating interactions of gambling and age
   found that higher rates of good to excellent subjective general health
   in recreational gamblers were mainly attributable to the older age
   group. Older adult gamblers were more likely than younger adult gamblers
   to begin gambling after age 18 years, to gamble more frequently, and to
   report a larger maximum win.
   Conclusions: Recreational gambling patterns of older adults differ from
   those of younger adults. In contrast to findings in younger adults,
   recreational gambling in older adults is not associated with negative
   measures of health and well-being.

   Methods. Between October 15 and December 31, 2001, 1774 Connecticut
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System respondents were asked
   questions directly related to their experiences of September 11.
   Results. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that receipt
   of formal help was predicted by sleep problems, close association with a
   victim, reports of increased smoking or drinking, and receipt of
   informal help. Age, gender, reports of 1 or more problems, and formal
   help seeking predicted receipt of informal help.
   Conclusions. Public health planning and bioterrorism preparedness should
   include programs addressing increased smoking and drinking, sleep
   problems, and bereavement in the wake of disasters.

AB In this paper, I review the evidence associated with two hypotheses,
   both ultimately derived from sexual selection theory, put forth to
   explain social sexual segregation in human juveniles. More proximately,
   I posit that segregation is motivated by sex differences in body size,
   physical activity and competitiveness. The first hypothesis, the
   energetic/behavioural hypothesis, suggests that difference in energetics
   is a way in which males differentiate themselves from females and
   develop muscle and brain systems implicated in reproductive roles. The
   second hypothesis, the social roles hypothesis, suggests that
   segregation is related to learning male and female reproductive roles.
   The reviewed evidence supports the view that there are differences in
   energetics in male and female groups. With development, the vigorous
   behaviours shown by males take the form of specific social roles,
   related to dominance and competitiveness for males and maternal roles
   for females. (C) 2004 The Association for the Study ofAnimal Behaviour.

AB Aims and Methods: A comparative study of abandoned street children and
   formerly abandoned street children was conducted in La Paz, Bolivia,
   representing the first such comparative assessment. Between August and
   December 1997, all abandoned street children in La Paz, Bolivia, who
   were willing to participate (n = 124) were interviewed repeatedly at
   night using standardised questionnaires to collect information on family
   history, demographics, socioeconomics, drug use, and physical/sexual
   abuse. The same questionnaires were administered to all former abandoned
   street children who chose to enter a local orphanage ( n = 35).
   Results: The persistent street children differed greatly from those who
   entered the orphanage, most markedly in their higher risk of police
   abuse (95% versus 38%), absence from school (84% versus 19%), engagement
   in robbery (26% versus 4%), paint thinner use (88% versus 41%), alcohol
   use (58% versus 12%), and a serious medical problem (53% versus 20%).
   The risks for street children increased rapidly with age.
   Conclusions: A cascade of adverse outcomes afflicts the vast majority of
   abandoned street children in La Paz, which cumulate with age and
   diminish the likelihood of successful rehabilitation through lasting
   placement in an orphanage or residential home. Informed by these
   findings, the investigators operate a home for abandoned street children
   in La Paz.

EP 675
PD SEP 2004
PY 2004
AB Objective To quantify the association between household-level and
   provider-level determinants and childhood immunization rates in Cameroon
   while also calculating the cost of childhood immunizations.
   Methods This study uses multilevel regression analysis to calculate
   these relationships. The 1998 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey and
   the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey are the main sources of
   household-level data. These surveys are supplemented by data from a 2002
   survey of health facilities conducted in three provinces. At the
   national level, immunization financing data were collected from the
   Ministry of Health and donors that support the national Expanded
   Programme on Immunization.
   Findings The 1998 survey found that nationally 37% of children were
   fully immunized; the 2000 survey found that nationally 34% were fully
   immunized. These results are strongly correlated with both the mother's
   level of education and the household's economic status. Multilevel
   logistic regression shows that maternal education level is a stronger
   predictor of positive immunization status than is relative economic
   status. Children of mothers with secondary education or higher education
   were 3 times more likely to be fully vaccinated than children whose
   mothers had not completed primary education. At the health-facility
   level, both having an immunization plan and regular supervisory visits
   from someone at the health-district level are strongly positively
   associated with immunization rates. The cost of routine vaccinations for
   each fully immunized child is US$ 12.73 when donors' contributions are
   included but not the costs of immunization campaigns.
   Conclusion Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s found that costs per
   fully immunized child varied from US$ 2.19 to US$ 26.59 (not adjusted
   for inflation) in a range of low-income and middle-income countries. The
   relatively low rates of immunization coverage in Cameroon, and the
   strong influence of the household's socioeconomic status- particularly
   the mother's level of education-on immunization rates suggest that the
   effectiveness of the Cameroon programme could be increased by promoting
   immunization and directing such programmes towards households with
   limited resources.

AB Objective: We investigated the association between lifestyle and
   prostate cancer risk among Caucasian and African-American men,
   separately.
   Methods: This population-based case-control study of prostate cancer
   among men aged 65-79 years was conducted between 2000 and 2002 in South
   Carolina. Telephone interviews were completed with 416 incident prostate
   cancer cases ascertained through the South Carolina Central Cancer
   Registry, and 429 controls identified through the Health Care Financing
   Administration Medicare beneficiary file (with respective response rates
   of 71% and 64%).
   Results: Caucasian men working in production, transportation, and
   material moving had increased prostate cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] =
   2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-3.54), while African-American
   men in the military had reduced prostate cancer risk (OR=0.19, 95% CI
   0.05-0.76). Having five or more prostate specific antigen (PSA) tests
   within the past five years was associated with prostate cancer among
   Caucasian men; however, African-American men with prostate cancer tended
   to have fewer PSA tests. Increasing lycopene consumption was associated
   with a reduced risk of prostate cancer among Caucasian men (p = 0.03),
   but not among African American men.
   Conclusions: In this population-based case-control study conducted in
   South Carolina we did not find marked differences in lifestyle factors
   associated with prostate cancer by race.

   renowned for having hard wood and fragrant, showy flowers. This diverse
   assemblage of approximately 70 species is distributed from Southeast
   Asia, Malesia, to the archipelagos of the Pacific Ocean. Fagraea species
   occupy important niches in forest ecosystems. These fast growing,
   pioneer species are an important component in natural succession after
   forest disturbance and provide food and shelter for many other forest
   species. The plants have played an important role in the lives of humans
   and have made their way into the legends of Polynesia. Fagraea plants
   are utilized by the Asian, Australian, Malesian, Melanesian,
   Micronesian, and Polynesian cultures for timber, weapons, crafts,
   medicine, and adornment. This paper is a comprehensive survey of the
   past and present uses of the species by these cultures and identifies

   Design: The sample included 443 Black and 21,182 White men, and 415
   Black and 24,929 White women, 45 years and older, who died of CVD from
   1992-1998, and who had lived in the Twin Cities 5-county area. Using
   individual and neighborhood level measures of sodoeconomic position, we
   hypothesized that socioeconomic position would moderate the effects of
   race on CVD mortality. Test hypotheses were analyzed using Poisson
   regression analysis.
   Results: Socioeconomic position moderated the effects of race on CVD
   mortality among older men, but not in older women. Older Black men who
   lived in more impoverished neighborhoods had significantly and
   disproportionately higher CVD mortality rates than did older White men
   living in more impoverished neighborhoods; this was not the case among
   older Black and White men living in less impoverished neighborhoods.
   Race was independently related to CVD mortality among younger men and
   women, with younger Black men and women having significantly higher CVD
   mortality rates than younger White men and women. The Black-White rate
   for Black women was twice that of White women.
   Conclusion: Socioeconomic position as measured by neighborhood poverty
   can moderate the effects of race on CVD mortality in older Black and
   White men. This may not have been as apparent had socioeconomic position
   not been treated as a major variable of interest, and measured at
   multiple levels.

   were randomly assigned to either a standard behavioral counseling group
   (N=22), a culturally sensitive counseling group (N=20), or a physician
   advice comparison group (N=10). The key study outcomes measured at
   baseline and after 6 months included cardiorespiratory fitness and
   physical activity. Acculturation was examined as a moderating variable.
   Participants in all 3 groups reported significant increases in walking,
   but significant improvements in fitness were observed only in the 2
   intervention groups. Participants in the culturally sensitive
   intervention reported significantly higher levels of exercise social
   support compared to members of the other 2 groups. These findings show
   that home-based exercise counseling programs are effective for improving
   fitness, yet the addition of culturally tailored components may not be
   sufficient to produce better outcomes than standard behavioral
   counseling.

AB Objective: To examine the relationship between physician-patient
   interaction and depression among African-American women.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Participants: 1,411 African-American women completed a mailed 46-item
   survey on psychological well-being.
   Main Outcome Measures: The independent variables included demographics
   and depressive symptomatology as measured by the CESD. The dependent
   variable was the mean score on an 8-item measure of physician-patient
   interaction, and other factors associated with physician-patient
   interaction.
   Results: Overall, even after accounting for demographic variables, the
   higher scores on the CES-D were associated with lower scores on
   physician-patient interaction (B = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06, 1.16).
   Depression was positively associated with: difficulty in talking to
   physicians, likelihood of discussing problems with physicians, reporting
   that a physician had made offensive comments, and the likelihood of
   changing physicians due to dissatisfaction (all P values < .01).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that depressive symptomatology may be
   an important factor to consider in physicians' interaction with
   African-American women.

AB Objective: To assess the prevalence of, and quality of care for,
   diabetes mellitus among the understudied, yet growing, population of
   older, urban American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs).
   Design: Medical record review.
   Setting: Urban Indian primary care clinic in Seattle, Washington.
   Patients: All (N=550) AI/AN patients greater than or equal to50 years of
   age.
   Main Outcomes Measures: Provider-documented medical diagnoses and
   indicators of quality of care of diabetes.
   Results: Diabetes mellitus was documented in 113 (21%) of the medical
   records. Persons with diabetes were more likely than those without (P
   greater than or equal to .05) to be obese, and to have hypertension,
   coronary artery disease, and depression. Most patients with diabetes
   were treated with either insulin (43%) or oral hypoglycemic medication
   (39%), but 16% received neither. Screening rates within 12 months were
   high for glycosylated hemoglobin (72%), lipid profile (84%), and foot
   examination (72%), but were low for urinalysis (23%), ophthalmology
   referral (23%), and influenza vaccination (46%). Only 46% of patients
   had ever received pneumococcal vaccination, and even fewer (26%) had
   received tuberculin skin testing (24%). Although 65% of patients had
   ever been referred to a dietitian, only 40% had received exercise
   counseling. The total number of health problems was the factor most
   often associated with quality of care indicators.
   Conclusions: The prevalence rate of diabetes among this urban clinic
   population of older Al/ANs was high. Although performance of quality
   indicators was suboptimal, it was comparable to, or better than, that
   found in other older populations for many measures.

AB Purpose: To describe the characteristics of participants who completed a
   mailed survey, compared to those initial non-responders who completed
   the same survey over the telephone.
   Study Design and Patient Populations: We conducted a mailed survey, in
   both Spanish and English, among women with abnormal Pap smears, who were
   members of a large managed care organization. Telephone follow up for
   non-responders was performed by a bilingual interviewer. A 20-minute
   long distance telephone card was offered as an incentive to individuals
   who completed the telephone survey. We used bivariate and multivariate
   analyses to describe the population characteristics of respondents who
   replied by mail, as compared to those who completed the survey by
   telephone.
   Results: Of the 1049 potentially eligible participants, 733 women
   completed the survey, for an overall response rate of 70%. Fifty-six
   percent (N=411) of the surveys were received by mail, and 44% (N=322)
   were completed by telephone. Thirty-four percent of the telephone
   surveys were completed in Spanish, compared to 13% of the mailed surveys
   (P<.001). Telephone respondents were less satisfied with their health
   care than were those who responded by mail.
   Conclusions: Among this insured cohort of women, Latinas who completed
   the survey in Spanish were more likely to participate in a telephone
   survey that offered an incentive, than in a mailed survey. These
   findings should be considered when planning health surveys in this
   population.

AB Human pheromones, a type of social chemosignal, modulate endocrine
   function by regulating the timing of ovulation. In animals, pheromones
   not only regulate ovulation but also female reproductive motivation and
   behavior. There is no extant evidence that humans produce social
   chemosignals that affect human sexual motivation or reproductive
   behavior as occurs in other mammals. Here, we demonstrate that natural
   compounds collected from lactating women and their breastfeeding infants
   increased the sexual motivation of other women, measured as sexual
   desire and fantasies. Moreover, the manifestation of increased sexual
   motivation was different in women with a regular sexual partner. Those
   with a partner experienced enhanced sexual desire, whereas those without
   one had more sexual fantasies. These results are consistent with
   previous pheromonal effects on endocrine function, and warrant further
   study of these social chemosignals as candidates for pheromonal
   processes, including their effects on other aspects of motivation and
   behavior. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This exploratory study investigated Mainland Chinese children's social
   networks and peer group affiliations with a particular emphasis on their
   aggressive behaviour. The participants were 294 elementary school
   students in Tianjin, P. R. China (mean age 11.5 years; 161 boys). Social
   network analysis identified relatively large and gender-specific peer
   groups. Although different measures were used, the pattern of homophily
   characteristic of Western aggressive children was partially supported.
   This finding may be due to the large size of the peer groups. The
   results showed that some aggressive children formed friendships with
   nonaggressive children. Moreover, for the aggressive children who were
   group members, the number of within-group friendships moderated the
   relation between aggression and overall peer preference. In addition,
   despite the moderating effect of within-group friendship, the relation
   between aggression and peer preference remained significantly negative
   even at the highest levels of friendship. Aggressive children who were
   isolated from all peer groups had higher hyperactivity ratings and were
   less liked by peers than were aggressive children who were group
   members. These findings illustrate how culture may be an influence on
   patterns of peer group affiliation.

AB Indigenous populations have lived for many generations in a sustainable
   fashion, developing knowledge about how to live in harmony with the
   environment. However, the sustainability of their life styles, their
   quality of life and the maintenance of intact ecosystems are threatened
   by a series of changes, including incorporation into the general fabric
   of society, conflict with non-indigenous migrants, expansion of
   indigenous populations and the globalization of national economies. This
   paper looks at the potential for policy to deal with these issues. In
   particular, it is shown that the 'polluter pays principle' is not
   appropriate for indigenous societies. The paper recommends a set of
   policies and shows how international cooperation in the areas of
   monitoring and enforcement, augmentation of demand for rain forest
   products and eco-certification can help indigenous groups improve their
   quality of life and maintain ecosystems in their current undisturbed
   state.

AB The proximate causes of the contraceptive effect of lactation are still
   a matter of productive debate. This study sought to disentangle the
   relative impact that intense breast-feeding practices and maternal
   nutrition have on the regulation of ovarian function in nursing women. A
   mixed-longitudinal, direct-observational, prospective study was
   conducted of the return to postpartum fecundity in 113 breast-feeding,
   well-nourished Toba women. A sub-sample of 70 women provided data on
   nursing behaviour, daily activities, diet quality and urinary levels of
   oestrone and progesterone metabolites. Well-nourished, intensively
   breast-feeding Toba women experienced a relatively short period of
   lactational amenorrhoea (10.2 +/- 4.3 months) and a high lifetime
   fertility (TFR = 6.7 live births/woman). Duration of lactational
   amenorrhoea was not correlated with any of the nursing parameters under
   study or with static measures of maternal nutritional status. The
   results indicated that the pattern of resumption of postpartum fertility
   could be explained, at least partly, by differences in individual
   metabolic budgets. Toba women resumed postpartum ovulation after a
   period of sustained positive energy balance. As the relative metabolic
   load hypothesis suggests, the variable effect of lactation on postpartum
   fertility may not depend on the intensity of nursing per se but rather
   on the energetic stress that lactation represents for the individual
   mother.

AB Few studies have examined the impact of unintended pregnancy on women in
   developing countries. This paper examines the impact of unintended
   pregnancy on Indonesian women's psychological well-being. It is
   hypothesized that experiencing unintended pregnancy is associated with
   lower psychological well-being and that use of family planning and small
   family size are associated with higher levels of psychological
   well-being. Data are drawn from a 1996 survey of 796 women aged 15-49
   from two Indonesian provinces, Lampung and South Sumatra. This article
   focuses on the 71% of women (n=562) who answered all 41 survey items
   related to psychological well-being. In cluster analysis, women grouped
   into three clusters, differentiated by their scores on four scales of
   well-being established through factor analysis (general negative
   feelings, satisfaction with relationships, satisfaction with
   economic/family/personal conditions, and negative feelings regarding
   domestic issues). Women in cluster 3 were characterized mainly by their
   high level of psychological well-being. Women in cluster 1 had the
   lowest level of well-being, and women in cluster 2 were in the middle.
   Multinomial logistic regression was used to assess jointly the effect of
   unintended pregnancy, contraceptive use, number of children and other
   factors on a woman's level of psychological well-being. Unintended
   pregnancy was associated with lower levels of psychological well-being
   and contraceptive use was associated with higher levels of psychological
   well-being, while number of children was not associated with level of
   well-being. Women who had experienced an unintended pregnancy were less
   likely to be in the high psychosocial wellbeing cluster versus both the
   medium and low clusters. In addition, women using contraception were
   more likely to be classified in the high than in the low or medium
   well-being clusters.

   He was a student in the Chicago School of Sociology during the tenure of
   many of the school's most prominent faculty. Many of these leading

AB Background: In an earlier series of studies, we documented the effects
   of feeding practices and postnatal maternal mood on the growth and
   development of 226 Barbadian children during the first few months of
   life. In this report, we extend our earlier studies by examining
   predictive relationships between infant size, feeding practices and
   postpartum maternal moods and scores on a national high school
   examination, the Common Entrance Examination (CEE), at 11 to 12 years of
   age. Methods: Feeding practices, anthropometry, and maternal moods,
   using Zung depression and anxiety scales and a morale scale, were
   assessed at 7 weeks (n = 158), 3 months (n = 168), and 6 months (n 209)
   postpartum. Background variables including sociodemographic and home
   environmental factors were also assessed during infancy. CEE scores on
   169 of the children in the original study were obtained from the
   Ministry of Education of Barbados. Results: In our sample of 86 boys and
   83 girls, we found that reduced infant lengths and weights at 3 and 6
   months of age were predictive of lower CEE, especially math scores.
   Children who were smaller at these early ages had significantly lower
   scores on the examination than did larger children. Postpartum maternal
   moods, including reports of despair and anxiety, were also found to be
   significant predictors of lower CEE scores, especially English scores.
   However, breast-feeding and other feeding practices were not directly
   associated with the CEE scores. Background variables, which
   significantly predicted lower CEE scores, included young maternal age at
   the time of her first pregnancy, more children in the home, less
   maternal education, and fewer home conveniences. Significant
   associations between infant anthropometry, maternal moods and CEE scores
   were all significant even when these background variables were
   controlled for. Conclusions: These findings have important implications
   for developing interventions early in life to improve academic test
   scores and future opportunities available to children in this setting.

   participation of black, non-Hispanics (blacks); white, non-Hispanics
   (whites); and Hispanics of any race (Hispanics) in 5 health care
   settings and determine whether disparities between those individuals
   exist among places where they receive care.
   DESIGN: 1996 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data were used to estimate
   the number of black, white, and Hispanic people per 1,000 receiving
   health care in each setting.
   SETTING: Physicians' offices, outpatient clinics, hospital emergency
   departments, hospitals, and people's homes.
   MAIN MEASUREMENT: Number of people per 1,000 per month who had at least
   one contact in a health care setting.
   RESULTS: Fewer blacks and Hispanics than whites received care in
   physicians' offices (154 vs 155 vs 244 per 1,000 per month,
   respectively) and outpatient clinics (15 vs 12 vs 24 per 1,000 per
   month, respectively). There were no significant differences in
   proportions hospitalized or receiving care in emergency departments.
   Fewer Hispanics than blacks or whites received home health care services
   (7 vs 14 vs 14 per 1,000 per month, respectively). After controlling for
   7 variables, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to
   receive care in physicians' offices (odds ratio [OR], 0.65, 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 0.60 to 0.69 for blacks and OR, 0.79, 95% CI,
   0.73 to 0.85 for Hispanics), outpatient clinics (OR, 0.73, 95% CI, 0.60
   to 0.90 for blacks and OR, 0.71, 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.88 for Hispanics),
   and hospital emergency departments (OR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.69 to 0.94 for
   blacks and OR, 0.80, 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.93 for Hispanics) in a typical
   month. The groups did not differ in the likelihood of receiving care in
   the hospital or at home.
   CONCLUSIONS: Fewer blacks and Hispanics than whites received health care
   in physicians' offices, outpatient clinics, and emergency departments in
   contrast to hospitals and home care. Research and programs aimed at
   reducing disparities in receipt of care specifically in the outpatient
   setting may have an important role in the quest to reduce racial and

   DESIGN: Real-time survey of patients during a primary care office visit.
   SETTING: Private medical offices in a generally affluent area of

   RESULTS: The 9-item, composite scale identified no significant

   visit. The 4-item, physician-specific scale indicated that nonwhite
   patients were less satisfied than white patients with their direct
   interaction with the physicians included in the study (P less than or
   equal to .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of patient satisfaction that use multi-item,
   composite indicators should also include focused comparisons of
   satisfaction directly with the care provided by the physician. In
   measurements of patient satisfaction, patient race/ethnicity should be
   included as an explanatory variable. The results also confirm earlier
   findings that factors external to the direct physician-patient
   interaction can have substantial effects on patients' perceptions of
   that interaction.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine efficient ways of promoting advance directives
   among heterogeneous populations of elderly ambulatory patients.
   DESIGN: One-year quasi-experimental trial.
   SETTING: Five suburban and urban health centers in one region of a large
   managed care organization. One additional suburban center served as a
   control site.
   PARTICIPANTS: Individuals ages 65 and older (N= 2,120) who were
   continuously enrolled and had a health maintenance visit with their
   primary care provider during the study year.
   INTERVENTION: Physician education (oral and written) and physician and
   patient prompts to discuss advance directives.
   MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-six (7.8%) of patients at the intervention centers
   completed new advance directives, versus 9 of 1,277 (<1%) at the
   comparison center (P < .001). Patients 75 and older were twice as likely
   (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95% confidence limits [CL], 1.2 to 3.3) as those
   65 to 74 to file a new advance directive, and the odds were twice as
   great (OR, 2.6; 95% CL, 1.4 to 4.6) at centers serving communities with
   median household income over the state median. Gender, recent
   hospitalization, emergency room visits, and number of chronic conditions
   were not related to making new directives nor was predominant ethnicity
   of the center community (African-American versus white). Adjusted for
   these factors, the intervention resulted in a 20-fold increase (95% CL,
   10.4 to 47.8) in the odds of creating a new advance directive. Doctors
   reported barriers of time and unwillingness to press discussions with
   patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: A replicable intervention largely targeting doctors
   achieved a modest increase in advance directives among elderly
   ambulatory patients. Future interventions may need to target
   lower-income patients, "younger" elderly, and more specifically address
   doctors' attitudes and comfort discussing advance directives.

AB This preliminary descriptive study was designed to assess the reasons,
   primary contexts, and consequences (physical, psychological, lifestyle)
   of club drug use in a sample of young adults in a mid-size U.S. city.
   Fifty young adults (18 to 30 years old) reported on their use of club
   drugs (Ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, Rohypnol(R), methamphetamine, LSD) in
   face-to-face interviews that included quantitative and qualitative
   measures. Ecstasy was the most frequently used club drug followed by
   ketamine, LSD and methamphetamine. All of the participants reported
   using club drugs to "experiment" and most reported using these drugs to
   feel good and enhance social activities. Club drugs were frequently used
   at raves, in bars or clubs, and at home with friends. An average of 16
   negative physical, psychological, and lifestyle consequences were
   reported for club drug use. Despite substantial negative consequences,
   participants perceived several positive consequences of regular
   recreational club drug use. These findings corroborate descriptions of
   club drug use in other countries (e.g., Australia, United Kingdom) and
   provide additional information on perceived positive consequences that
   users experience with club drug use. Further exploration of the reasons
   and positive consequences that are associated with use of each of the
   club drugs may provide important information on the growing trend in use
   of these drugs.

AB The impact of crack cocaine use on number of sex partners was examined
   using bivariate analyses and a logistic model on a national treatment
   cohort of 4,939 individuals. Number of sex partners over the last 12
   months was dichotomized as none/one versus multiple partners for the
   logistic analyses. The model included 11 independent variables not
   including prostitution or use of crack cocaine. For both genders, the
   bivariate analyses showed significant positive associations between
   crack use and number of partners regardless of type of sexual activity;
   those who used crack had more partners for all sexual activities
   queried, compared to those who did not. Cocaine, whether in powder or
   crack form, was positively associated with prostitution for both
   genders. For men the odds ratio for crack cocaine use ranged from 1.6
   (heterosexual anal) to 5.5 (homosexual anal) and for women from 2.9
   (heterosexual oral) to 4.1 (homosexual oral). If prostitution is added
   to the model the odds ratios are reduced for homosexual activities for
   men and reduced dramatically for all types of sexual activity for women.

AB Surveillance data suggests that club drug use (Ecstasy, GHB, ketamine,

   White adolescent and young adult phenomenon in the United States. The
   authors investigated the use of club drugs among 323 streetrecruited
   minority substance users in northern New York City (66.3% were Hispanic,
   23.8% were Black, and 9.9% were White/other race; median age = 32 years
   old). While Whites were more likely than others to have used club drugs,
   club drug use among Hispanics and Blacks was not uncommon; 45.3%
   Hispanics and 56.4% of Blacks reported a lifetime history of club drug
   use. PCP was the most commonly reported club drug used among all
   racial/ethnic groups. Further investigation of club drug use in minority
   populations is warranted.

AB Objective. Growth hormone treatment of hormone-sufficient short youths
   is predicated on the belief that short stature is associated with social
   problems with peers. This study assessed peer relations and social
   adjustment as a function of height in a community sample.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted at 1 public school
   district in Western New York of students of both genders who attended
   grades 6 to 12 (N=956). Target groups included participants of short
   stature (height less than or equal to-1.6 standard deviation, ie, less
   than or equal to5th percentile for age- and gender-adjusted population
   norms; n=68) and tall stature (greater than or equal to1.6 standard
   deviation; greater than or equal to95th percentile; n=58) and classmates
   of average height (between the 25th and 75th percentiles; n=123) used
   for within-class comparisons. All remaining unclassified classmates
   (n=704) also provided data. Self- and peer-rated assessment of social
   reputation and social acceptance was measured.
   Results. Minimal effects of height on measures of social functioning
   were detected despite substantial statistical power. We detected no
   significant relationships between height and measures of friendship,
   popularity, or reputation with peers. Findings did not vary by gender of
   participant, by peer- or self-report, or by whether data from the entire
   sample were used or target groups were contrasted with comparison
   participants. Shorter students were perceived by peers to be younger
   than their age. This influence was restricted to lower grades and did
   not have an impact on measures of social acceptance or reputation with
   peers.
   Conclusions. Extremes of stature in the general population-either short
   or tall-have minimal detectable impact on peer perceptions of social
   behavior, friendship, or acceptance. Findings are not supportive of the
   need to intervene a priori because of the potential risk of negative
   stature-related social sequelae. Furthermore, if problems with peer
   relationships are identified among short or tall youths, then factors
   other than stature should be considered as etiologically important.

TI Watching sex on television predicts adolescent initiation of sexual
   Behavior

EP E289
DI 10.1542/peds.2003-1065-L

AB Background. Early sexual initiation is an important social and health
   issue. A recent survey suggested that most sexually experienced teens
   wish they had waited longer to have intercourse; other data indicate
   that unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases are more
   common among those who begin sexual activity earlier. The American
   Academy of Pediatrics has suggested that portrayals of sex on
   entertainment television ( TV) may contribute to precocious adolescent
   sex. Approximately two-thirds of TV programs contain sexual content.
   However, empirical data examining the relationships between exposure to
   sex on TV and adolescent sexual behaviors are rare and inadequate for
   addressing the issue of causal effects.
   Design and Participants. We conducted a national longitudinal survey of
   1792 adolescents, 12 to 17 years of age. In baseline and 1-year
   follow-up interviews, participants reported their TV viewing habits and
   sexual experience and responded to measures of more than a dozen factors
   known to be associated with adolescent sexual initiation. TV viewing
   data were combined with the results of a scientific analysis of TV
   sexual content to derive measures of exposure to sexual content,
   depictions of sexual risks or safety, and depictions of sexual behavior
   ( versus talk about sex but no behavior).
   Outcome Measures. Initiation of intercourse and advancement in noncoital
   sexual activity level, during a 1-year period.
   Results. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that adolescents who
   viewed more sexual content at baseline were more likely to initiate
   intercourse and progress to more advanced noncoital sexual activities
   during the subsequent year, controlling for respondent characteristics
   that might otherwise explain these relationships. The size of the
   adjusted intercourse effect was such that youths in the 90th percentile
   of TV sex viewing had a predicted probability of intercourse initiation
   that was approximately double that of youths in the 10th percentile, for
   all ages studied. Exposure to TV that included only talk about sex was
   associated with the same risks as exposure to TV that depicted sexual
   behavior. African American youths who watched more depictions of sexual
   risks or safety were less likely to initiate intercourse in the
   subsequent year.
   Conclusions. Watching sex on TV predicts and may hasten adolescent
   sexual initiation. Reducing the amount of sexual content in
   entertainment programming, reducing adolescent exposure to this content,
   or increasing references to and depictions of possible negative
   consequences of sexual activity could appreciably delay the initiation
   of coital and noncoital activities. Alternatively, parents may be able
   to reduce the effects of sexual content by watching TV with their
   teenaged children and discussing their own beliefs about sex and the
   behaviors portrayed. Pediatricians should encourage these family
   discussions.

AB Objectives. Despite great needs, many children in foster care do not
   receive adequate medical care. Suboptimal care may be attributable in
   part to placement changes, which disrupt continuity of care by both a
   consistent surrogate parent and potentially a primary care physician.
   These disruptions in turn may lead to increased use of the emergency
   department (ED) for outpatient care. The primary aim of this study was
   to test whether a greater rate of placement changes was associated with
   increasing use of the ED among children in their first year of foster
   care. The secondary aim was to compare ED visit rates with rates of
   visits to other ambulatory care settings among children in foster care
   and other Medicaid-eligible children not in foster care.
   Methods. Using Medicaid claims linked to foster care administrative
   data, we assembled a retrospective cohort of foster children in a large
   urban municipality from 1993 to 1996. Eligible children spent at least 9
   months in a new episode of foster care and were continuously eligible
   for Medicaid during a 1-year follow-up period. A comparison cohort was
   drawn from Medicaid-eligible children not in foster care during fiscal
   year 1995. The dependent variable was the rate of visits to the ED or
   other ambulatory care settings during a 1-year follow-up period. A
   negative binomial model estimated visit rates to the ED and other
   ambulatory care settings as the number of foster care placements
   increased. Potential interactions were considered between age and
   location of service use ( ED or ambulatory care setting), between age
   and foster care placements, and between location of service use and
   number of foster care placements.
   Results. The 2358 children in the sample accounted for 1206 ED visits
   during the follow-up period; 38% experienced greater than or equal to 2
   placement changes. Children of all ages exhibited increasing reliance on
   the ED for ambulatory care services as the number of placements
   increased, with the rates of ED use more than doubling for all age
   groups beyond infancy. However, other ambulatory care service use
   increased by only 41% to 53%; there was much less utilization in these
   nonemergency settings for all children but particularly toddlers and
   infants, compared with their Medicaid-eligible peers. Although the
   absolute rates of all visits for younger foster children (< 6 years of
   age) were low, older foster children had increasingly greater ED use
   than did their Medicaid-eligible peers, with nearly double the rate of
   ED visits in the adolescent age group. A temporal relationship between
   placements and ED visits was also identified; 75% of ED visits occurring
   within 3 weeks of a placement change occurred in the period after a
   placement change.
   Conclusions. Foster children received fewer overall outpatient services
   than did their Medicaid-eligible peers, but with age and increasing
   numbers of placements, had higher visit rates and received a greater
   proportion of their overall outpatient care in the ED. These results
   suggest that poor access to nonemergent ambulatory care settings might
   have contributed to an increasing reliance on ED settings as foster care
   placements increased. The temporal relationship between ED visits and
   placement changes underscores the need for better health care management
   for foster children, particularly in the period after placement changes.

AB Background. We estimate proportions and numbers of elderly (>65 years
   old) not vaccinated for pneumococcus in 1998 and 2001 by ethnic group,
   socioeconomic status, health history, and access and use of health care.
   Methods. Self-reported lifetime pneumococcal vaccination and participant
   characteristics were obtained from 10,624 community dwelling elderly in
   the 1998 and 2001 National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS). Robust
   descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were fit.
   Outcome. Non-receipt of pneumococcal vaccination.
   Results. In 2001, about 13 million (or 45% of all) community dwelling
   elderly were unvaccinated against pneumococcus, including 11.5 million
   who saw a doctor at least once, 4 million who received an influenza
   vaccination and 2.3 million who were hospitalized, during the previous
   year. In 1998 and 2001 non-US born, Hispanic, African-American, and
   Medicaid recipient elderly were disproportionately unvaccinated, with
   about 65% of each group not vaccinated in 2001.
   Conclusions. In 2001, lifetime pneumonia vaccination of community
   dwelling elderly (55%) was below the goal (60%) for Healthy People 2000.
   While there has been important progress in improving overall vaccination
   rates, much more needs to be done to attain national goals and reduce
   large, persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities. Lack of a
   usual source of healthcare and lower frequency of physician visits were
   among the factors associated with non-vaccination. However, most
   unvaccinated individuals had seen a physician in the last year, and many
   had received influenza vaccination or been hospitalized, suggesting the
   need for more consistent implementation and monitoring of guidelines for
   routine pneumococcal vaccination in healthcare settings. (C) 2004 The

AB Background. Tobacco use, underreported among Louisiana youth, was
   examined among 9th grade students in south central Louisiana; profiles
   of tobacco use were developed to inform adolescent tobacco control
   programs.
   Methods. Cross-sectional Health Habits Survey was administered to 4,808
   students who were about 15 years old, predominantly white, with gender
   almost evenly distributed. Saliva samples were collected from 1,966
   students. Analysis of a subsample resulted in good concordance between
   self-reported daily tobacco use and cotinine.
   Results. About 58% of students ever smoked a cigarette, 25% had a
   cigarette within the previous 30 days, 17% smoked within the past 7 days
   and almost 8% reported smokeless tobacco use. Smokeless tobacco use was
   greater for males than females. Caucasians, native Americans, and
   Latinos were more likely to smoke than African-Americans. Social
   relationships associated with adolescent smoking included having a
   friend, parent and/or sibling who smoked, having a friend who consumed
   alcohol, and being around people who used alcohol for "kicks." The
   attitudes of nonsmokers were consistently in the positive direction
   relative to disapproval of tobacco and alcohol use. The profiles
   differed demographically between black and white students..
   Conclusions. These data provide the needed information for guiding
   health promotion and tobacco control efforts, specifically regarding

AB Background. Reducing dietary fat has been identified as a potential
   means of preventing chronic disease. Several studies have identified
   methods of changing dietary fat consumption in small, intensive
   intervention settings. Fewer studies have examined how to improve
   dietary habits of individuals in the general public.
   Methods. The Eating for a Healthy Life (EHL) project was a randomized
   trial [n = 40 religious organizations (ROs) and 2175 individuals, 1099
   in intervention]. The study tested an intervention package of self-help
   books, motivational messages, and social interactions designed to change
   dietary behaviors (lowering fat, increasing fruit and vegetable
   consumption) among members of religious organizations aged 18 and over.
   The primary outcomes are fat- and fruit- or vegetable-related behaviors
   measured using the Fat and Fiber Behavior (FFB) Questionnaire.
   Results. Religious organizations and their members participated fully in

AB Background. Violence against women, substance use and disorder, and HIV
   represent three significant threats to the health of women, yet little
   is known about the extent of these epidemics among indigent women. This
   study investigates and documents differences in the prevalence and
   co-occurrence of physical and sexual violence, substance use and
   disorder, and HIV risk behavior in sizable probability samples of
   sheltered homeless and low-income housed women.
   Methods. Retrospective self-reports were obtained through structured
   interviews with stratified random samples of women residing in shelters
   (N = 460) and low-income housing (N = 438) in Los Angeles County,
   California.
   Results. Sheltered women were more likely than housed women to report
   experiencing physical and sexual violence, substance use and disorder,
   HIV risk behavior, and co-occurrence of these problems in the past year.
   Differences remained when propensity weights were used to equate the
   groups on demographic and background characteristics.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest remarkable need for services among
   communities of indigent women. Higher rates of problems among women in
   shelters highlight the importance of differentiating among subgroups of
   indigent women in community-based prevention and intervention activities
   and tentatively suggest a protective influence of housing. (C) 2004 The

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to assess associations
   between socioeconomic status (SES) and adolescent sexually transmitted
   diseases (STDs) stratified by race and gender.
   Study: In cross-sectional analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health Wave One (1995), unadjusted and adjusted associations
   between 4 family SES indicators and STD reports for black and white 7th
   through 12th graders were examined.
   Results: Lower maternal education and nonprofessional maternal
   occupations were associated with higher STD reports in all groups except
   white females. Generally, STD reports were higher for adolescents not
   living in 2-parent homes, and lower income was only associated for black
   males.
   Conclusion: Overall, SES is only a weak to moderate marker for
   adolescent STD risks. The relationship of SES and STDs varies by the SES
   measure used and differs across race-gender groups.

AB Several studies have shown the influence of ownership on media content
   in routine contexts, but none has quantitatively tested it in the
   context of a crisis. Recently the country musicians the Dixie Chicks
   were blacklisted from the radio for criticizing the president in
   wartime. I use this event to test the role of media ownership in a
   crisis. Through analyzing airplay from a national sample of radio
   stations, this paper finds that contrary to prominent allegations
   grounded in the political economy tradition Of media sociology, this
   backlash did not come from owners of large chains. Rather, I find that
   opposition to the Dixie Chicks represents grassroots conservative
   sentiment, which may be exacerbated by the ideological connotations of
   country music or tempered by tolerance for dissent.

AB Capital punishment is the most severe criminal penalty, yet we know
   little about the factors that produce jurisdictional differences in the
   use of the death sentence, Political explanations emphasize conservative
   values and the strength of more conservative political parties. Threat
   accounts suggest that this sentence will be more likely in jurisdictions
   with larger minority populations. After controlling for many
   explanations using two-equation count models, the results show that
   larger numbers of death sentences are probable in states with greater
   membership in conservative churches and in states with higher violent
   crime rates. The findings suggest that political conservatism, a
   stronger Republican party, and racial threat explain whether a state
   ever used the death sentence, but these hypotheses do not account for
   the number of death sentences beyond one. By highlighting the
   explanatory power of public ideologies, these findings support political
   explanations for the harshest criminal punishment.

AB This study uses a comparative case study to explore the effect of
   service learning on the political socialization of participants and, in
   particular, on participants' patterns of blame attribution. Although
   numerous scholars have acclaimed the benefits of service learning,
   others have suggested that involving students in service learning may
   actually reinforce their tendency to blame victims of social problems
   for their own conditions. Little research has considered the role of
   service learning In the political socialization of America's youth and
   how it might relate to the political Intolerance that characterizes the
   current era. The study suggests that two different approaches to service
   learning have very different impacts on students' attitudes toward the
   poor and how they explain the associated conditions and stresses the
   need for structure in service learning activities. The author discusses
   the possible implications of these findings for contemporary research on
   adolescent political socialization.

   assemble the fundamental questions together with the fundamental tools
   that will be used to address them. This article examines the three sets

   predictions of deductive theories, testing the propositions produced by
   nondeductive theories, and extratheoretical measurement and estimation.

AB Sociologists tend to eschew biological explanations of human social
   behavior. Accordingly, when evolutionary biologists began to apply
   neo-Darwinian theory to the study of human social behavior, the
   reactions of sociologists typically ranged from indifference to overt
   hostility. Since the mid-1960s, however, neo-Darwinian evolutionary
   theory has stimulated a "second Darwinian revolution" in traditional
   social scientific conceptions of human nature and social behavior, even
   while most sociologists remain largely uninformed about neo-Darwinian
   theory and research. This article traces sociology's long-standing
   isolation from the life sciences, especially evolutionary biology, to
   divergence in the metatheoretical assumptions that typify conventional
   sociological thought versus contemporary evolutionary biology. We
   conclude with a discussion of the recent emergence of a nascent
   "evolutionary sociology" that integrates sociobiological reasoning with
   contemporary sociological thought.

AB As health social movements (HSMs) and complementary and alternative
   medicine (CAM) professions increasingly mount challenges to the
   authority of medical knowledge, the tendency for the medical research
   community and medical profession to dismiss such epistemic challenges
   (termed here 'paternalistic progressivism') and the corresponding
   response from challengers that medicine is corrupt (termed here 'medical
   devolution') has given way to a process of incorporation of challenges
   under the rubric of evidence-based research (termed here the epistemic
   dimension of 'medical modernisation'). Under conditions of medical
   modernisation the distinction between lay/alternative knowledge and
   scientific knowledge, upon which the epistemic authority of medicine
   rested, is submerged in a more complex field of competing scientific
   networks and research programmes. Furthermore, the older policy of
   transmitting science to an illiterate public and suppressing dissidents
   is replaced by an emerging system of the 'public shaping of science', in
   which there is both greater agency of social movement/lay advocacy
   organisations and greater recognition of the legitimacy of that agency.
   Indirect and direct forms of the public shaping of science are
   discussed, as are emergent problems of co-optation. Understanding the
   emergent epistemic politics that are characterised here as medical
   modernisation requires an ongoing theoretical integration of medical
   sociology and the sociology of science.

AB Since this society is oriented toward a specific theory, I thought I
   ought to say something about theories in general and our little theory
   in particular. Let me get that off of my chest. I am not overly fond of
   terms like "theory" and "theorist," both of which seem to suggest the
   importance of the person who claims the identity more than anything
   else. They are pompous terms. To the extent that we are thoughtful about
   what we are doing and how we are going about it, all sociologists are
   theorists and methodologists. But if that is all we are, then we are
   literally people of no substance. We have no substantial knowledge of or
   concern for the empirical world. The little theory we share is
   extraordinarily empirical. It is, as one of its most prominent
   practitioners called it, a "grounded theory" (Glaser and Strauss 1967).
   I confess that several years after receiving my degree I had no real
   sense of what symbolic interaction was and how it might differ from
   other theoretical orientations. Arnold Rose enlightened me on this when
   he asked me to submit a paper for a new collection he was editing (Rose
   1962). 1 was pleased and flattered. Rose was a mentor of mine, and I had
   never before been asked to contribute to an edited volume. But I was
   unsure of what would be appropriate for a book about symbolic
   interaction. I screwed up my courage and asked Arnold: "Exactly what is
   symbolic interaction?" He shrugged off my ignorance, turned on his
   heels, and muttered over his shoulder, "It is what they do at Chicago."

AB Karl Mannheim's orientations to time can be plotted between subjectivist
   and objectivist extremes. The latter corresponds to social engineering,
   while the former offers the context in which Mannheim uses Hobbes's
   primaeval war to imagine the chaotic struggle over time that he hopes to
   escape. Mannheim's distinctive achievement is 'dynamic sociology', an
   experimental approach marked by the recognition not only of historicity
   in social phenomena and concepts but also of the opportunities thereby
   provided for clarifying meaning on terms congruent with the experiences
   of contemporary humankind. Mannheim's initial statement of 'dynamic
   sociology' is. refined by his better-known studies of generations,
   ideologies, and utopias, which specify his awareness of co-existent
   multiple time worlds. Coordination is left to ad hoc mediation. This
   does not answer Mannheim's deepest fears and wishes, but he has the
   discipline to settle for less.

AB Objective. To determine if socioeconomic status, as measured by
   education level, is associated with mortality due to systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE), and to determine if these associations differ among
   ethnic groups.
   Methods. Sex- and race-specific mortality rates due to SLE by education
   level were computed for persons age 25-64 years using US Multiple Causes
   of Death data from 1994 to 1997. SLE-specific mortality rates were
   compared with all-cause mortality rates in 1997 to determine if the
   association between education level and mortality in SLE was similar to
   that in other causes of death.
   Results. Among whites, the risk of death due to SLE was significantly
   higher among those with lower levels of education, and the risk gradient
   closely paralleled the 1997 all-cause mortality risks by education
   level. However, in African American women and men and Asian/Pacific
   Islander women, the risk of death due to SLE was lower among those with
   lower education levels, contrary to the associations between education
   level and all-cause mortality in these groups. Comparing the
   distribution of education levels among deaths due to SLE and all deaths
   in 1997, persons with lower education levels were underrepresented among
   deaths due to SLE in African Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders.
   Conclusion. Among whites, higher education levels are associated with
   lower mortality due to SLE. These associations were not present in
   ethnic minorities, likely due to underascertainment of deaths due to SLE
   in less-well educated persons. This underascertainment may be due to
   underreporting of SLE on death certificates, but may also represent
   underdiagnosis of SLE in ethnic minorities with slow education levels.

AB Context More than 2 decades of conflict have led to widespread human
   suffering and population displacement in Afghanistan. In 2002, the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other collaborating
   partners performed a national population-based mental health survey in
   Afghanistan.
   Objective To provide national estimates of mental health status of the
   disabled (any restriction or lack of ability to perform an activity in
   the manner considered normal for a human being) and nondisabled Afghan
   population aged at least 15 years.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A national multistage, cluster,
   population-based mental health survey of 799 adult household members
   (699 nondisabled and 100 disabled respondents) aged 15 years or older
   conducted from July to September 2002. Fifty district-level clusters
   were selected based on probability proportional to size sampling. One
   village was randomly selected in each cluster and 15 households were
   randomly selected in each village, yielding 750 households.
   Main Outcome Measures Demographics, social functioning as measured by
   selected questions from the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form
   Health Survey, depressive symptoms measured by the Hopkins Symptoms
   Checklist-25, trauma events and symptoms of posttraumatic stress
   disorder (PTSD) measured by the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, and
   culture-specific symptoms of mental illness and coping mechanisms.
   Results A total of 407 respondents (62.0%) reported experiencing at
   least 4 trauma events during the previous 10 years. The most common
   trauma events experienced by the respondents were lack of food and water
   (56.1%) for nondisabled persons and lack of shelter (69.7%) for disabled
   persons. The prevalence of respondents with symptoms of depression was
   67.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6%-80.7%) and 71.7% (95% Cl,
   65.0%-78.4%), and symptoms of anxiety 72.2% (95% Cl, 63.8%-80.7%) and
   84.6% (95% Cl, 74.1%-95.0%) for nondisabled and disabled respondents,
   respectively. The prevalence of symptoms of PTSD was similar for both
   groups (nondisabled, 42.1%; 95% Cl, 34.2%-50.1%; and disabled, 42.2% -
   95% Cl, 29.2%-55.2%). Women had significantly poorer mental health
   status than men did. Respondents who were disabled had significantly
   lower social functioning and poorer mental health status than those who
   were nondisabled. Feelings of hatred were high (84% of nondisabled and
   81% of disabled respondents). Coping mechanisms included religious and
   spiritual practices; focusing on basic needs, such as higher income,
   better housing, and more food; and seeking medical assistance.
   Conclusions In this nationally representative survey of Afghans,
   prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD were high.
   These data underscore the need for donors and health care planners to
   address the current lack of mental health care resources, facilities,
   and trained mental health care professionals in Afghanistan.

AB Context Firearms are used in approximately half of all youth suicides.
   Many state and federal laws include age-specific restrictions on the
   purchase, possession, or storage of firearms; however, the association
   between these laws and suicides among youth has not been carefully
   examined.
   Objective To evaluate the association between youth-focused firearm laws
   and suicides among youth.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Quasi-experimental design with annual
   state-level data on suicide rates among US youth aged 14 through 20
   years, for the period 1976-2001. Negative binomial regression models
   were used to estimate the association between state and federal
   youth-focused firearm laws mandating a minimum age for the purchase or
   possession of handguns and state child access prevention (CAP) laws
   requiring safe storage of firearms on suicide rates among youth.
   Main Outcome Measures Association between youth-focused state and
   federal firearm laws and rates of firearm, nonfirearm, and total
   suicides among US youth aged 14 to 17 and 18 through 20 years.
   Results There were 63954 suicides among youth aged 14 through 20 years
   during the 1976-2001 study period, 39655 (62%) of which were committed
   with firearms. Minimum purchase-age and possession-age laws were not
   associated with statistically significant reductions in suicide rates
   among youth aged 14 through 20 years. State CAP laws were associated
   with an 8.3% decrease (rate ratio [RR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval
   [Cl], 0.86-0.98) in suicide rates among 14- to 17-year-olds. The annual
   rate of suicide in this age group in states with CAP laws was 5.97 per
   100000 population rather than the projected 6.51. This association was
   also statistically significant for firearm suicides (RR, 0.89; 95% Cl,
   0.83-0.96) but not for nonfirearm suicides (RR, 1.00; 95% Cl,
   0.91-1.10). CAP laws were also associated with a significant reduction
   in suicides among youth aged 18 through 20 years (RR, 0.89; 95% Cl,
   0.85-0.93); however, the association was similar for firearm suicides
   (RR, 0.87; 95% Cl, 0.82-0.92) and nonfirearm suicides (RR, 0.91; 95% Cl,
   0.85-0.98).
   Conclusions There is evidence that CAP laws are associated with a modest
   reduction in suicide rates among youth aged 14 to 17 years. As currently
   implemented, minimum age restrictions for the purchase and possession of
   firearms do not appear to reduce overall rates of suicide among youth.

AB Context The 1994 genocide in Rwanda led to the loss of at least 10% of
   the country's 7.7 million inhabitants, the destruction of much of the
   country's infrastructure, and the displacement of nearly 4 million
   people. In seeking to rebuild societies such as Rwanda, it is important
   to understand how traumatic experience may shape the ability of
   individuals and groups to respond to judicial and other reconciliation
   initiatives.
   Objectives To assess the level of trauma exposure and the prevalence of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and their predictors among
   Rwandans and to determine how trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms are
   associated with Rwandans' attitudes toward justice and reconciliation.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Multistage, stratified cluster random
   survey of 2091 eligible adults in selected households in 4 communes in
   Rwanda in February 2002.
   Main Outcome Measures Rates of exposure to trauma and symptom criteria
   for PTSD using the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version; attitudes toward
   judicial responses (Rwandan national and gacaca local trials and
   International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda [ICTR]) and reconciliation
   (belief in community, nonviolence, social justice, and interdependence
   with other ethnic groups).
   Results Of 2074 respondents with data on exposure to trauma, 1563
   (75.4%) were forced to flee their homes, 1526 (73.0%) had a close member
   of their family killed, and 1472 (70.9%) had property destroyed or lost.
   Among the 2091 total participants, 518 (24.8%) met symptom criteria for
   PTSD. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of meeting PTSD symptom criteria for
   each additional traumatic event was 1.43 (95% Cl, 1.33-1.55). More
   respondents supported the local judicial responses (90.8% supported
   gacaca trials and 67.8% the Rwanda national trials) than the ICTR (42.1%
   in support). Respondents who met PTSD symptom criteria were less likely
   to have positive attitudes toward the Rwandan national trials (OR, 0.77;
   95% Cl, 0.61-0.98), belief in community (OR, 0.76; 95% Cl, 0.60-0.97),
   and interdependence with other ethnic groups (OR, 0.71; 95% Cl,
   0.56-0.90). Respondents with exposure to multiple trauma events were
   more likely to have positive attitudes toward the ICTR (OR, 1.10; 95%
   Cl, 1.04-1.17) and less likely to support the Rwandan national trials
   (OR, 0.90; 95% Cl, 0.84-0.96), the local gacaca trials (OR, 0.80; 95%
   Cl, 0.72-0.89), and 3 factors of openness to reconciliation: belief in
   nonviolence (OR, 0.92; 95% Cl, 0.87-0.97), belief in community (OR,
   0.92; 95% Cl, 0.87-0.98), and interdependence with other ethnic groups
   (OR, 0.86; 95% Cl, 0.81-0.92). Other variables that were associated with
   attitudes toward judicial processes and openness to reconciliation were
   educational level, ethnicity, perception of change in poverty level and
   access to security compared with 1994, and ethnic distance.
   Conclusions This study demonstrates that traumatic exposure, PTSD
   symptoms, and other factors are associated with attitudes toward justice
   and reconciliation. Societal interventions following mass violence
   should consider the effects of trauma if reconciliation is to be
   realized.

AB Eliminating health disparities is one of two overarching goals of
   Healthy People 2010. Although the causes of health disparities are
   complex, they appear to be related, in part, to disparities in the
   quality of medical care. Two recent reviews of peer-reviewed research
   investigated the evidence on racial/ethnic differences in medical care.
   An Institute of Medicine summary of the literature concluded that in
   most studies, racial and ethnic disparities in health care remained even
   after adjustment for potentially confounding factors. A review focused
   specifically on cardiac care, conducted jointly by the Kaiser Family
   Foundation and the American College of Cardiology Foundation, reached a
   similar conclusion after examining the most rigorous studies
   investigating racial/ethnic differences in angiography, angioplasty,
   coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and thrombolytic therapy.
   For example, African Americans were statistically less likely than
   whites to undergo CABG surgery in 21 of the 23 most rigorous studies
   that calculated odds ratios to compare CABG use. Although there is a
   convincing body of evidence that race continues to matter in the health
   system, a nationally representative survey of physicians revealed that
   the majority of physicians do not view a patient's race/ethnicity as a
   factor in obtaining care, but do believe insurance coverage matters.
   Increasing physicians' awareness of the evidence for the role that
   race/ethnicity plays in health care is important because they are in a
   good position to directly and indirectly affect changes in clinical
   practice or patient behavior that could reduce disparities in care. (C)

AB Environmental variability is an important risk factor in rural
   agricultural communities. Testing models requires empirical sampling
   that generates data that are representative in both economic and
   ecological domains. Detrended correspondence analysis of satellite
   remote sensing data were used to design an effective low-cost sampling
   protocol for a field study to create an integrated socioeconomic and
   ecological database when no prior information on ecology of the survey
   area existed. We stratified the sample for the selection of tambons from
   various preselected provinces in Thailand based on factor analysis of
   spectral land-cover classes derived from satellite data. We conducted
   the survey for the sampled villages in the chosen tambons. The resulting
   data capture interesting variations in soil productivity and in the
   timing of good and bad years, which a purely random sample would likely
   have missed. Thus, this database will allow tests of hypotheses
   concerning the effect of credit on productivity, the sharing of
   idiosyncratic risks, and the economic influence of environmental
   variability.

AB We analyze the malarial health behavior of rural populations by using
   data from the 1999 Demographic and Health Survey for Guinea, West
   Africa. We find that prior formal health care treatment is associated
   with heightened malaria prevention behaviors for the poorest uneducated
   populations in this rural cohort. Individuals from this subgroup that
   report no history of malarial infection and exclude themselves from
   health care treatment further appear to be misdiagnosing the disease at
   a substantial level. We conjecture that the use of formal health care
   options provides informational exposure to the clinical aspects of
   malarial pathogenesis. For individuals steeped in the most severe
   poverty, this exposure appears to have a particularly robust educative
   effect. The health behavioral dynamics we observe here have putative
   extensions for regional health policy as well with other infectious
   diseases, such as HIV/AIDS.

AB Objectives To estimate the fraction of airflow obstruction attributable
   to workplace exposure by U.S. race/ethnic group.
   Methods U.S. population-based third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES III) data on 4,086 Caucasians, 2,774
   African-Americans, and 2,568 Mexican-Americans, aged 30-75, were
   studied. Airflow obstruction was defined as FEV1/FVC<75% and FEV1<80%
   predicted. Weighted prevalence, and prevalence odds ratios (OR) adjusted
   for the effect of age, smoking status, pack-years, body mass index,
   education, and socio-economic status were estimated using SUDAAN
   software.
   Results Industries with the most cases of airflow obstruction
   attributable to workplace exposure include: armed forces; rubber,
   plastics, and leather manufacturing; utilities; textile mill
   manufacturing; health care; food products manufacturing; sales;
   construction; and agriculture. The fraction of cases with airflow
   obstruction associated with work in industry varied by race/ethnic group
   and was estimated as 22.2% (95% CI 9.1-33.4) among Caucasians, 23.4%
   (95% CI 2.2-40.0) among African-Americans, and 49.6% (32.1-62.6) among
   Mexican-Americans.
   Conclusions This study found differences in the fraction of airflow
   obstruction cases associated with employment pattern among major U.S.

AB Background: Because the presence and improper storage of household
   firearms are risk factors for injury, it is important to understand the
   prevalence of ownership and storage practices within households to help
   guide intervention development. This systematic review of published
   articles (1992 to 2002) provides prevalence estimates of firearm
   ownership and storage practices in U.S. households.
   Methods: A search of bibliographic databases (MedLine, CINAHL, PsycInfo,
   Sociological Abstracts) was completed in January 2003.
   Results: Although all were cross-sectional, the 42 articles included in
   this review varied in type; there were seven national and five state
   prevalence studies, as well as studies using clinic-based convenience
   samples (n = 14) and samples of professionals (n = 10). Published
   studies indicate that firearms are present in about one third of U.S.
   households. Handguns in particular are present in more than half of U.S.
   households with firearms, or about 19% of all U.S. households. The
   prevalence of firearms and handguns in households with voting people was
   similar to the prevalence overall. Firearm ownership was highest in the
   South.
   Conclusions: Although the methodologic rigor of published articles
   varies Substantially, the literature clearly establishes that firearms
   are common in U.S. households, even in the homes of medical
   professionals and those with children. (C) 2004 American Journal of

AB Malaria, more than any other disease of major public health importance
   in developing countries, disproportionately affects poor people, with
   58% of malaria cases occurring in the poorest 20% of the world's
   population. If malaria control interventions are to achieve their
   desired impact, they must reach the poorest segments of the populations
   of developing countries. Unfortunately, a growing body of evidence from
   benefit-incidence analyses has demonstrated that many public health
   interventions that were designed to aid the poor are not reaching their
   intended target. For example, the poorest 20% of people in selected
   developing countries were as much as 2.5 times less likely to receive
   basic public health services as the least-poor 20%. In the field of
   malaria control, a small number of studies have begun to shed light on
   differences by wealth status of malaria burden and of access to
   treatment and prevention services. These early studies found no clear
   difference in fever incidence based on wealth status, but did show
   significant disparities in both the consequences of malaria and in the
   use of malaria prevention and treatment services. Further study is
   needed to elucidate the underlying factors that contribute to these
   disparities, and to examine possible inequities related to gender,
   social class, or other factors. To achieve impact and overcome such
   inequities, malaria control efforts must begin to incorporate approaches
   relevant to equity in program design, implementation, and monitoring and
   evaluation.

AB When examining environmental justice and injustice, surprisingly few
   studies have examined the experiences of Native Americans. In filling
   this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political
   sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the US. military
   pursues a pattern of environmental "bads" that cannot be reduced to
   capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial
   distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our
   contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we
   recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope
   conditions under which a "treadmill of production" and a "treadmill of
   destruction" are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a "treadmill of
   destruction" is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be
   reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the
   "treadmill of destruction" by examining the environmental inequality
   endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have
   collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed
   but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence
   that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such
   hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and
   won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The
   geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power
   pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of
   unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the
   dangers of this toxic legacy.

AB Background: Environmental factors may play an important role on
   influencing physical activity (PA) behaviors. Purpose: Perceptions of
   access and safety for PA were compared among residents who were
   stratified as low or high in socioeconomic status (SES). Methods:
   Residents of a U.S. southeastern county (N = 1, 194, 18-96 years of age)
   were contacted using a random-digit-dial method and asked about
   neighborhood and community environmental supports for PA. A Geographic
   Information System (GIS) was used to identify trails, sidewalks, public
   recreation facilities, and violent crime incidents. Results: A cluster
   analysis identified 10 census tracts as low SES and I I census tracts as
   high SES (median household income, owner-occupied houses). More African
   Americans (66.5%) than Whites (33.5%) were classified as living in
   low-SES areas. Respondents from low-SES areas also reported engaging in
   less PA based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American
   College of Sports Medicine recommendations than respondents from
   high-SES areas (p <.05). Respondents from low-SES (vs. high-SES) areas
   reported higher perceptions of neighborhood crime, unattended dogs,
   unpleasantness of neighborhoods, untrustworthy neighbors, and less
   access to public recreation facilities (ps <.05). GIS data for presence
   of sidewalks, recreation facilities, and crime did not support these
   differences in perceptions; however respondents from low-SES (vs.
   high-SES) areas had substantially fewer trails. Having and using trails
   in one's community predicted sufficient PA and walking for 150 min/week
   for low-SES respondents but not for high SES respondents (ps =.05,
   adjusted for covariates). Conclusions: Having access to trails is an
   important environmental feature among low-SES communities and should be
   the focus of future community-based PA interventions.

   social interactions on cardiovascular reactivity, we hypothesized that
   cognitive and behavioral processes (e.g., recalling and discussing
   relationships) may be important factors responsible for the health
   effects of social relationships. Methods: We had men and women recall
   and speak about specific relationships that differed in their underlying
   positive and negative substrates. Results: Results revealed that gender
   moderated the hypothesized pattern of responses, with women showing
   consistently greater cardiovascular reactivity, to the speaking task,
   particularly when speaking about negative relationships, compared to
   men. Conclusions: This study is discussed in light of recent research on

AB Objectives: To determine if there is a relationship between overweight
   and behavior problems among children as young as 5 years old by studying
   the association between overweight and behavioral health at entry into
   kindergarten and to determine whether overweight status is a risk factor
   for the onset of new behavior problems during the first 2 years in
   school.
   Design: We use data from a nationally representative sample of
   kindergartners in the United States-the Early Childhood Longitudinal
   Study-Kindergarten class. Data on height, weight, and parent- and
   teacher-reported behavior problems were collected 3 times during their
   first 2 years in school for 9949 children. We use a multivariate
   regression analysis that controls for sociodemographic characteristics,
   parent-child interaction, birth weight, and mother's mental health.
   Results: Among girls, but not boys, there is a significant association
   between overweight and teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems
   (odds ratio [OR], 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-2.68),
   teacher-reported internalizing behavior problems (OR, 1.54; 95% CI,
   1.09-2.17), and parent-reported internalizing behavior problems (OR,
   1.49; 95% CI, 1.08-2.06) at the beginning of kindergarten. However,
   overweight status was not a risk factor for the onset of new behavior
   problems over time for either girls (teacher-reported externalizing
   behavior problems: OR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.25-1.33]; teacher-reported
   internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.34 [95% CI, 0.88-2.03]; and
   parent-reported internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.29 [95% CI,
   0.82-2.01]) or boys (teacher-reported externalizing behavior problems:
   OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.67-1.57]; teacher-reported internalizing behavior
   problems: OR, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.68-1.52]; and parent-reported
   internalizing behavior problems: OR, 1.42 [95% CI, 0.94-2.15]), whereas
   low family income and maternal depression were strong predictors of such
   problems.
   Conclusions: Childhood overweight is already associated with behavior
   problems when girls start school, but not boys. In contrast to common
   belief, overweight status does not predict the onset of new
   internalizing or externalizing behavior problems during the first 2
   years of school.

AB Previous research has documented high rates of STDs and increased risk
   of HIV infection among female sex workers (FSWs) in Mexico; however,
   little is known about the sexual risk behaviors of this population. The
   purpose of this study was to explore work history, context of sex work,
   sexual risk practices, client characteristics, attitudes toward condoms,
   and potential barriers to condom use in a sample of FSWs in Tijuana,
   Mexico. Analysis of qualitative data from 25 FSWs revealed that most
   women entered the sex trade at a young age ( M D 23 years), primarily as
   a result of financial need. Forty percent were single mothers supporting
   children. Women worked an average of 6 - 7 days per week; work shifts
   ranged from 4 to 13 hr per day. Clients were both Mexican and foreign (
   mostly American and Asian), and ranged in age from 18 to 80 years.
   Positive aspects of the job included flexible work hours and good
   income. Negative aspects of sex work included risks associated with
   physical assault, diseases, and unwanted pregnancies. Most clients did
   not want to use a condom and many offered additional money for
   unprotected sex. FSWs did not like to use condoms because they were
   perceived as uncomfortable. Most FSWs did not negotiate the use of
   condoms, had a low knowledge regarding the proper use of condoms, and
   were reticent to report their own unsafe sex practices. These results
   suggest the need to develop culturally appropriate safer sex
   interventions for FSWs in Mexican border cities.

   sexual partners, or ( 3) not married and has no casual sexual partners.
   Guided by sperm competition theory, we predicted and found that men
   prefer short-term sex partners who are not already involved in
   relationships and hence present a relatively low risk of sperm
   competition. Because women sometimes use short-term sexual relationships
   to acquire long-term partners, we predicted and found that women prefer
   short-term sexual partners who are not already involved in relationships
   and hence present relatively greater promise as a potential long-term
   partner. Finally, across each of the three levels of the imagined
   partner's relationship status, men reported a greater likelihood than
   did women of pursuing a casual sexual relationship. Discussion addressed
   methodological limitations and directions for future work.

AB Introduction: The popular assumption is that extreme environments induce
   a climate of hostility, incompatibility, and tension by intensifying
   differences and disagreements among team members. Team members'
   perceptions of team climate are likely to change over time in an extreme
   environment, and thus team climate should be considered as a dynamic
   outcome variable resulting from multiple factors. In order to explore
   team climate as a dynamic outcome, we explored whether variables at
   multiple levels of analysis contributed to team climate over time for
   teams living and working in Antarctica. Method: Data for this study were
   collected from volunteers involved in Australian National Antarctic
   Research Expeditions conducted from 1996 to 2000. Multilevel analysis
   was used to partition and estimate the variance in team climate and to
   explore factors explaining variance at the group/team, individual, and
   weekly levels. Results: Most of the variance in perceptions of team
   climate was at the individual level (57%). Team climate had less
   variance at the group level (16%) and at the weekly level (26%). Results
   indicated that perceived leadership effectiveness was significantly
   related to team climate. Perceived leadership effectiveness accounted
   for an estimated 77% of the group level variance, which equated to 14%
   of the overall variance in team climate. Discussion: Our results suggest
   that exploring the characteristics and behaviors that constitute
   effective leadership would contribute to a more complete and useful
   picture of team climate, as well as guide selection research.

AB The transfer of food among group members is a ubiquitous feature of
   small-scale forager and forager-agricultural populations. The uniqueness
   of pervasive sharing among humans, especially among unrelated
   individuals, has led researchers to evaluate numerous hypotheses about
   the adaptive functions and patterns of sharing in different ecologies.
   This article attempts to organize available cross-cultural evidence
   pertaining to several contentious evolutionary models: kin selection,
   reciprocal altruism, tolerated scrounging, and costly signaling. Debates
   about the relevance of these models focus primarily on the extent to
   which individuals exert control over the distribution of foods they
   acquire, and the extent to which donors receive food or other
   fitness-enhancing benefits in return for shares given away. Each model
   can explain some of the variance in sharing patterns within groups, and
   so generalizations that ignore or deny the importance of any one model
   may be misleading. Careful multivariate analyses and cross-cultural
   comparisons of food transfer patterns are therefore necessary tools for
   assessing aspects of the sexual division of labor, human life history
   evolution, and the evolution of the family. This article also introduces
   a framework for better understanding variation in sharing behavior
   across small-scale traditional societies. I discuss the importance of
   resource ecology and the degree of coordination in acquisition
   activities as a key feature that influences sharing behavior.

AB It has been hypothesized that social developmental disorders (SDD) like
   autism, Asperger's disorder and the social-emotional processing disorder
   may be associated with prosopagnosic-like deficits in face recognition.
   We studied the ability to recognize famous faces in 24 adults with a
   variety of SDD diagnoses. We also measured their ability to discriminate
   changes in internal facial configuration, a perceptual function that is
   important in face recognition, and their imagery for famous faces, an
   index of their facial memory stores. We contrasted their performance
   with both healthy subjects and prosopagnosic patients. We also performed
   a cluster analysis of the SDD patients. One group of eight SDD subjects
   performed normally on all tests of face perception and recognition. The
   other 16 subjects were impaired in recognition, though most were better
   than prosopagnosic patients. One impaired SDD subgroup had poor
   perception of facial structure but relatively preserved imagery,
   resembling prosopagnosic patients with medial occipitotemporal lesions.
   Another subgroup had better perception than imagery, resembling one
   prosopagnosic with bilateral anterior temporal lesions. Overall, SDD
   subgroup membership by face recognition did not correlate with a
   particular SDD diagnosis or subjective ratings of social impairment. We
   conclude that the social disturbance in SDD does not invariably lead to
   impaired face recognition. Abnormal face recognition in some SDD
   subjects is related to impaired perception of facial structure in a
   manner suggestive of occipitotemporal dysfunction. Heterogeneity in the
   perceptual processing of faces may imply pathogenetic heterogeneity,
   with important implications for genetic and rehabilitative studies of
   SDD.

AB Background: Risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma in young adults has previously
   been associated with higher childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and
   other markers of delayed infection with common childhood pathogens,
   especially the Epstein-Barr virus. This study examines the current role
   of childhood social environment in the development of Hodgkin's
   lymphoma. Methods: A population-based case-control study of 565
   Hodgkin's lymphoma cases and 679 controls was conducted in the Boston,
   MA metropolitan area and the state of Connecticut to investigate the
   viral etiology of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Results: A novel association was
   detected between attendance of nursery school or day care and reduced
   risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma among individuals ages 15 to 54 years. The
   odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for having attended preschool for
   at least 1 year was 0.64 (0.45-0.92). Risk of young-adult Hodgkin's
   lymphoma was also associated with family history of hematopoietic
   cancer, Jewish ethnicity, and cigarette smoking. Other indicators of
   childhood SES were not associated with young-adult Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Among older adults ages 55 to 79 years, Hodgkin's lymphoma was
   associated with lower childhood SES but not with preschool attendance.
   Conclusions: Early exposure to other children at nursery school and day
   care seems to decrease the risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma in young adults,
   most likely by facilitating childhood exposure to common infections and
   promoting maturation of cellular immunity. This finding supports the
   delayed infection model of Hodgkin's lymphoma etiology in young adults
   while introducing a new major determinant of age at infection. Hodgkin's
   lymphoma seems to have a separate pathogenesis among older adults.

AB The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) is a study designed to examine the
   major causes of death and disability in women. This multi-arm,
   randomized, controlled trial of over 160,000 post-menopausal women of
   varying ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds and a goal of 20% of the
   study participants from minority populations is perhaps one of the most
   challenging recruitment efforts ever undertaken. Of the two main study
   arms, the Clinical Trial (CT) and the Observational Study (OS), the CT
   arm recruitment goal was to randomize 64,500 postmenopausal women 50-79
   years of age. Women enrolled in the study will be followed for a period
   of 8-12 years. Ten clinical centers. out of a total of 40 throughout the
   United States, were selected as minority recruitment centers on the
   basis of their history of interaction with and access to large numbers
   of women from certain population subgroups. WHI enrollment began in
   September 1993 and ended in December 1998, resulting in the
   randomization and enrollment of a total of 161,856 (17.5% minority)
   women participants (68,135 (18.5% minority) in the CT and 93,721 (16.7%)
   in the OS). Within the CT arm, WHI achieved 101.7% of the goal of 48,000
   participants in the Dietary Modification (DM) component, and 99.4% of
   the goal of 27,500 in the hormone-replacement component (HRT), with
   11.8% overlap between DM and HRT. Of those who expressed initial
   interest in WHI, African Americans had the highest randomization yields
   in the DM component and Hispanics had the highest in the HRT
   component(15.2% and 10.2%, respectively). Overall, mass mailing was the
   greatest source of randomized participants. In addition, minority
   clinics found community outreach, personal referrals, and culturally
   appropriate recruitment materials particularly effective recruitment
   tools. For minority recruitment, our findings suggest that the key to
   high yield is reaching the target population through appropriate
   recruitment strategies and study information that get their attention.
   Also, once minority subjects are reached, they tend to participate. (C)

AB Despite proposals by Kroeber and others that society and culture
   represent a distinct level of reality, the prevailing opinion has been
   that they are abstractions from the behavior of individuals. Recently
   that position, methodological individualism, has been challenged on
   several fronts. Especially with the incorporation of artificial
   intelligence into many aspects of social life, it is no longer feasible
   to consider the ultimate unit of social action to be the human
   individual. Bolstered with a case study of the consequences of
   automation for the legal profession, the argument here is that agency
   should be redefined in a more expansive and dynamic manner that includes
   but is not limited to the individual.

AB Genetic, ethnographic, and historical evidence suggests that the Hindu
   castes have been highly endogamous for several thousand years and that,
   when movement between castes does occur, it typically consists of
   females joining castes of higher social status. However, little is known
   about migration rates in these populations or the extent to which
   migration occurs between caste groups of low, middle, and high social
   status. To investigate these aspects of migration, we analyzed the
   largest collection of genetic markers collected to date in Hindu caste
   populations. These data included 45 newly typed autosomal short tandem
   repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), 411 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence, and
   43 Y-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were assayed in
   more than 200 individuals of known caste status sampled in Andrah
   Pradesh, in South India. Application of recently developed
   likelihood-based analyses to this dataset enabled us to obtain
   genetically derived estimates of intercaste migration rates. STRPs
   indicated migration rates of 1-2% per generation between high-, middle-,
   and low-status caste groups. We also found support for the hypothesis
   that rates of gene flow differ between maternally and paternally
   inherited genes. Migration rates were substantially higher in maternally
   than in paternally inherited markers. In addition, while prevailing
   patterns of migration involved movement between castes of similar rank,
   paternally inherited markers in the low-status castes were most likely
   to move into high-status castes. Our findings support earlier evidence
   that the caste system has been a significant, long-term source of
   population structuring in South Indian Hindu populations, and that
   patterns of migration differ between males and females.

AB Background Fetal programming of adult disease may be a long-term effect
   of fetal nutrition. Expected short-term effects include changes in body
   size and proportions at birth. The specific responses of fetal growth to
   acute undernutrition at varying points in pregnancy are still unclear.
   Methods We abstracted all birth records of infants born in two midwife
   training schools in the western Netherlands between 1 October 1944 and
   31 March 1946, and compared infants whose mothers were exposed to the
   Dutch famine of 1944-1945 during specific trimesters of pregnancy with
   control infants born in 1943. We considered birthweight (BWT),
   crown-to-heel length (CHL), head circumference (HC), and ratio and
   regression-adjusted measures of these parameters.
   Results BWT, CHL, and HC declined with famine exposure late in
   pregnancy. Changes in WT for CHL paralleled changes in WT alone in size
   and direction. Results for HC were inconsistent, varying by choice of
   body size adjustor (WT or CHL), and by method of adjustment (ratio or
   regression). BWT, CHL, and HC did not change with first trimester famine
   exposure.
   Conclusion Even under famine conditions, birth size and body proportions
   vary only with late pregnancy exposure. HC for body size has the added
   disadvantage that late pregnancy exposure effects vary drastically with
   choice of measure. We do not recommend the use of birth size or body
   proportions as a proxy for fetal nutritional status in the study of
   adult disease.

   marginally predicted relapse. The data also indicated that for Mexican
   Americans, family warmth is a significant protective factor, whereas for
   Anglo Americans, family criticism is a significant risk factor. These
   findings suggest that the sociocultural context shapes the pathways by
   which family processes are related to the course of illness. Moreover,

   violence (IPV), child abuse, and community violence relate to long-term
   mental and physical problems; to examine the overlap between different
   forms of violence and the impact of experiencing multiple forms of
   violence.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
   SETTING: Three general internal medicine practices affiliated with an
   academic medical center.
   PARTICIPANTS: English-speaking women aged 25 to 60.
   MEASUREMENTS: Telephone or in-person interview and chart review.
   RESULTS: One hundred seventy-four women completed interviews. A majority
   of participants experienced more than one form of violence. In separate
   multivariate analyses, each form of violence was associated with
   depressive symptoms or with at least 6 chronic physical symptoms, after
   adjustment for demographic factors and substance abuse. The degree of
   association with health outcomes was similar for each form of violence
   (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 to 3.9; P < .003). The association with chronic
   physical symptoms remained significant for IPV (OR, 3.3; P < .002) and
   community violence (OR, 3.4; P < .003), even after adjustment for
   depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. There were dose-response
   relationships between the number of forms of violence experienced and
   the odds of depressive symptoms and the odds of multiple chronic
   physical symptoms.
   CONCLUSIONS: Multiple types of victimizations may contribute to
   patients' current mental health and physical problems. Research or
   clinical protocols that only focus on one form of violence may
   underestimate the complexity of women's experiences and needs.

AB To produce national prevalence estimates for "food insecurity" and "food
   insecurity with hunger," the USDA uses a battery of 18 survey items
   about symptoms of food-related hardship. Ten items refer to adults in
   the household, while 8 items refer to children in the household and
   hence are not asked of households without children. To equate
   food-security status in households with and without children, the USDA
   uses a statistical model from item response theory, known as the Rasch
   model. This model requires an assumption that adult-referenced items
   have the same severity calibrations for all households, including
   households with and without children. However, empirical estimates from
   the 2000 Current Population Survey showed significantly different
   severity calibrations for households with and without children. These
   differences have implications for observable response patterns. Holding
   constant the number of affirmative responses to adult-referenced items,
   households with children were more likely to respond that they "worried
   food would run out," and households without children were more likely to
   be unable to afford "balanced meals." In light of such differences, the
   Rasch model cannot be used to equate the food-security status of
   households with and without children. One potential solution would be to
   estimate household food security by using the same battery of
   adult-referenced survey items for all households.

AB Until recently, Brazil did not have a national instrument with which to
   assess household food insecurity (R). The objectives of this study were
   as follows: 1) to describe the process of adaptation and validation of
   the 15-item USDA FI module, and 2) to assess its validity in the city of
   Campinas. The USDA scale was translated into Portuguese and subsequently
   tested for content and face validity through content expert and focus
   groups made up of community members. This was followed by a quantitative
   validation based on a convenience (n = 125) and a representative (n =
   847) sample. Key adaptations involved replacing the term "balanced meal"
   with "healthy and varied diet," to construct items as questions rather
   than statements, and to ensure that respondents understood that
   information would not be used to determine program eligibility.
   Chronbach's alpha was 0.91 and the scale item response curves were
   parallel across the 4 household income strata. FI severity level was
   strongly associated in a close-response manner (P < 0.001) with income
   strata and the probability of daily intake of fruits, vegetables,
   meat/fish, and dairy. These findings were replicated in the 2
   independent survey samples. Results indicate that the adapted version of
   the USDA food insecurity module is valid for the population of Campinas.
   This validation methodology has now been replicated in urban and/or
   rural areas of 4 additional states with similar results. Thus, Brazil
   now has a household food insecurity instrument that can be used to set
   national goals, to follow progress, and to evaluate its national hunger
   and poverty eradication programs.

AB Health and social outcomes in children who have cerebral palsy (CP)
   depend on several factors, including the severity of the CP, medical
   interventions, and the child's environment. One of the hallmarks of
   cerebral palsy is its variability. Several formal methods of classifying
   persons with CP, such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System,
   have been developed to standardize that variability. Children and adults
   with CP must contend with increased mortality as well as many secondary
   conditions that can affect activities and participation in society.
   Predicting outcomes for children with CP, establishing realistic goals,
   and determining the best interventions to improve functioning are
   facilitated by applying research results to individual decisions. Many
   more such studies are needed-especially those performed with large
   representative samples. In addition, the childhood factors that affect
   outcomes in adults with CP still need to be elucidated.

AB This field observation compares the behavior and welfare of ultimate
   Frisbee players in three settings. The first setting, Corning College,
   was an informal group at a private university. The second setting,
   Stuart University, was a seasonal, open collegiate team at a public
   university. The third setting, the Mallards, was a seasonal, elite, open
   club team. The players' interactions and behaviors in the three settings
   were influenced by a number of norms, practices, and an ethos known as
   the spirit of the game. Through the presentation of field notes, video
   recordings, and informal conversations, the author argues via rational
   choice theory and game theory that players selectively create,
   negotiate, and manipulate norms and practices to maximize game
   interaction, quality, and/or fluidity depending on the particular
   conditions such as level of competition between players, history between
   teams and players, and the rewards at stake.

AB Objective: This study assessed the relationship between the need for and
   use of mental health services among a nationally representative sample
   of children who were investigated by child welfare agencies after
   reported maltreatment.
   Method: Data were collected at study entry into the National Survey of
   Child and Adolescent Well-Being and were weighted to provide population
   estimates.
   Results: Nearly half (47.9%) of the youths aged 2 to 14 years (N =
   3,803) with completed child welfare investigations had clinically
   significant emotional or behavioral problems. Youths with mental health
   need (defined by a clinical range score on the Child Behavior Checklist)
   were much more likely to receive mental health services than lower
   scoring youth; still, only one fourth of such youths received any
   specialty mental health care during the previous 12 months, Clinical
   need was related to receipt of mental health care across all age groups
   (odds ratio = 2.7-3.5). In addition, for young children (2-5 years),
   sexual abuse (versus neglect) increased access to mental health
   services. For latency-age youths, African-American race and living at
   home significantly reduced the likelihood of care. Adolescents living at
   home were also less likely to receive services, whereas having a parent
   with severe mental illness increased (odds ratio = 2.4) the likelihood
   of service use.
   Conclusions: Routine screening for mental health need and increasing
   access to mental health professionals for further evaluation and
   treatment should be a priority for children early in their contact with
   the child welfare system.

AB Objective. To determine the effects of patterns of drug use during term
   pregnancy on infant growth parameters at birth.
   Methods. Histories of cocaine, opiate, alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana
   use during the 3-month period before pregnancy and the 3 trimesters of
   pregnancy were recorded at the infants' 1-month visit. Patterns of use
   were categorized as consistently high, moderate, or low/none or
   increasing/decreasing, and effects on growth parameters were analyzed in
   multivariate linear regression analyses, with adjustment for clinical
   site, maternal age, prepregnancy weight, multidrug use, and
   socioeconomic status.
   Results. A total of 241 cocaine-exposed women and 410
   non-cocaine-exposed women participated in the study. In the
   cocaine-exposed group, 75% used alcohol, 90% used tobacco, and 53% used
   marijuana; in the non cocaine-exposed group, 57% used alcohol, 34% used
   tobacco, and 19% used marijuana. Birth weight, birth length, and head
   circumference were significantly greater among infants born to women who
   used no drugs, compared with women with any cocaine, opiate, alcohol,
   tobacco, or marijuana use, and were greater among infants born to
   cocaine nonusers, compared with cocaine users. With adjustment for
   confounders, birth weight was significantly affected by cocaine (
   deficit of 250 g with consistently low pattern) and tobacco ( deficits
   of 232 g with consistently high pattern, 173 g with consistently
   moderate pattern, 153 g with decreasing pattern, and 103 g with
   consistently low pattern). Head size was affected by cocaine (deficit of
   0.98 cm with consistently moderate pattern) and tobacco (deficits of
   0.72 cm with consistently high pattern and 0.89 cm with consistently
   moderate pattern). Birth length was affected by tobacco use only
   (deficits of 0.82 cm with consistently high pattern and 0.98 cm with
   decreasing use).
   Conclusion. Patterns of tobacco use during pregnancy affect birth
   weight, length, and head circumference, whereas cocaine affects birth
   weight and head size, when adjustments are made for confounders,
   including multidrug use.

AB Background. Studies of dating violence among Latino men and women have
   found that victims who are less acculturated have lower rates of dating
   violence. None of these studies have focused on adolescents. We assessed
   acculturation, ethnic identity, and dating violence victimization among
   Latino ninth-grade students.
   Methods. Students from 13 high schools representing 24% of ninth-grade
   students in the Texas Lower Rio Grande Valley during 2000-2001 completed
   questionnaires. This analysis is restricted to students age 14 years or
   older who self-identified as Hispanic or Latino (n = 4,525). Logistic
   regression was performed to estimate the risk of dating violence
   associated with measures of acculturation and ethnic identity.
   Results. Latino female adolescents were more likely to report dating
   violence victimization in the past 12 months (8.7%) than were males
   (6.4%). Parental birthplace outside of the United States was
   significantly associated with a reduced likelihood of dating violence
   victimization among females. Reporting a great deal of ethnic
   discrimination was strongly associated with increased dating violence
   victimization among females.
   Conclusions. These findings suggest that greater acculturation may be
   associated with greater prevalence of dating violence victimization
   among females. Understanding those aspects of Latino culture that may
   impact risk of dating violence could have important public health
   implications. (C) 2004 The Institute For Cancer Prevention and Elsevier

AB Recent experimental research has shown that women facing the chronic
   stress of being at familial risk of breast cancer have greater
   neuroendocrine reactivity responses to stressful Laboratory tasks.
   Whether this enhanced stress response also occurs outside the Laboratory
   under daily life conditions is unknown. In the present study, urinary
   epinephrine and norepinephrine excretion rates at work (e.g. 11:00
   AM-3:00 PM), home (e.g. 6:00 PM-10:00 PM) and during steep (e.g. 10:00
   PM-6:00 AM) were compared between 73 employed women with family
   histories of breast cancer in first degree relatives (FH+; age = 36.8
   +/- 8.7) and 81 without such family histories (FH-; age = 38.1 +/- 9.4).
   Differences in sympathetic adrenal medullary responses to an ordinary
   Life stressor (work) were assessed in naturalistic settings. Repeated
   measures MANCOVA with family history group as a fixed factor, body mass
   index as a covariate and daily microenvironment (work, home and steep)
   as a repeating factor were conducted to evaluate whether catecholamine
   excretion rates differed between FH+ and FH- groups. The results
   revealed that women with family histories of breast cancer had a higher
   rate of epinephrine excretion while at work (p < 0.005). In addition,
   women in the FH+ group were also more reactive to the stress of work,
   showing a greater percentage of increase in both epinephrine and
   norepinephrine from steep to work (p < 0.05). The results also indicated
   that the chronic stress effects associated with a family history of
   breast cancer were moderated by BMI, such that their impact was more
   pronounced and apparent when women were not obese. These findings
   support the idea that the heightened neuroendocrine reactivity to
   experimental stressors in women at familial risk of breast cancer also
   occurs when women encounter stressors in ordinary life (work stress).
   Additional research to explore the health consequences of increased
   reactivity in women at familial risk of breast cancer, and perhaps in
   individuals at familial risk of other life-threatening disease, would
   appear warranted. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Goal: To develop a method for assessing compliance in microbicide
   clinical trials.
   Study Design: Single use Microlax applicators containing a placebo
   formulation either were or were not exposed to the vagina. Three assays
   were developed to determine whether the applicators had been used
   vaginally.
   Results: Blinded examiners were able to discern 63% of the time whether
   or not applicator tips had been exposed to the vagina. Optical density
   (to measure lactobacilli), increased in media exposed to used
   applicators but not in media exposed to unused applicators. When tips of
   applicators were stained with trypan blue, used applicators could be
   distinguished easily front unused applicators.
   Conclusion: Staining of applicator is accurate, simple, rapid, and
   inexpensive. This method could be be used in clinical settings in the
   developing world. Dying applicator tips could prove useful in excluding
   non-compliant subjects, analyzing data, or developing social
   intervention strategies to improve compliance.

AB IF 'THINGS are partly understood as belonging to nations', as Tim
   Edensor (2002: 103) writes, then what may be said about the car?
   National populations have identified with specific car companies and car
   models, just as they have claimed unique qualities for indigenous
   'motorscapes' defined by natural scenery, roadways and driving
   practices. A brief perusal of the vast popular culture of the
   automobile, from magazines to websites, suggests that cars and nations
   have created close bonds with one another over the past century. But
   Edensor argues that sociology has done little to explicate such
   connections, and indeed that the discipline has generally relegated
   objects 'to a position of insignificance' (2002: 103). Whereas this
   critique could be extended to the field of history only with
   qualification, it is nonetheless true that the study of how objects
   mediated everyday cultural practices in the past remains underdeveloped
   (Roche, 2000). Although there is a large body of research on American
   and European automotive history, scholarly output in this area is
   surprisingly limited if we consider for a moment that some I billion
   cars traversed the world's roadways in the 20th century (Volti, 1996:
   663). One of the liveliest areas of automotive scholarship, the social
   history of the car in the United States (Berger, 1979; Foster, 2003;
   Gartman, 1994; Kirsch, 2000; Lewis and Goldstein, 1983; McShane, 1994;
   Preston, 1979; Scharff, 1991; Wik, 1972), makes up a rather minor
   wrinkle when compared to the larger historical fabric woven by popular
   experiences with the motorcar over the past hundred years around the
   world. Moreover, as anthropologist Daniel Miller (2001) has argued, much
   recent scholarship on the automobile on both sides of the Atlantic
   rarely interrogates the car as a cultural process, treating it instead
   as a design artifact, a technological entity or a commodity with
   specific, usually negative, 'externalities'. But 'we cannot presume as
   to what a car might be', states Miller, who argues that the automobile
   is 'as much a product of its particular cultural context as a force'
   (2001: 17). This statement is highly relevant to the following
   discussion; for if cars are seen as issuing from specific cultural
   interactions, then how cars 'belong' to nations, still one of the
   central cultural environments in which objects and commodities gain
   significance, becomes a key problem.
   Interwar European car cultures present especially interesting material
   for case studies in this context. The cars of the 1920s and 1930s were
   closely involved with the history of the nations that produced them, as
   Michael Sedgwick (1970: 16) argued, not least because European countries
   took dramatically different routes to automobility in this period. One
   of the starkest contrasts to be made is between the two major European
   industrial powers, Britain and Germany. Between the wars, Britain made
   enormous strides toward motorization, overcoming France's lead in car
   production and making the car a constitutive element of middle-class
   life (Church, 1979, 1994; Foreman-Peck et al., 1995; O'Connell, 1998;
   Richardson, 1977). By contrast, Germany lagged well behind Great Britain
   and France, although the First World War increased popular interest in
   cars, trucks and motorcycles so greatly that one could argue German
   culture was motorized well before many inhabitants of that nation
   actually got around in cars (Boch, 2001; Flik, 2001; Koshar, 2002;
   Merki, 2002; Moser, 1998; Sachs, 1992). Not only did the British and
   Germans experience the car differently up to the Second World War,
   British and German industrial and political competition also added an
   element of global conflict to the indigenous ear cultures. Car magazines
   in Britain observed German car design closely, especially after the
   First World War, and British travellers reported in some detail on the
   conditions of German cars, roads and society as the Second World War
   approached. The building of the Autobahn and National Socialist plans
   for a 'people's car' earned both admiration and suspicion from observers
   across the Channel. Meanwhile, German car manufacturers, trade
   unionists, politicians and car enthusiasts were enthusiastic about the
   prospects of mass automobility, but they were uncertain as to whether
   American 'Fordist' models of production were desirable or practical in
   the German context (Nolan, 1994). Hitler argued that the modern nation
   was by definition a motorized nation, and he appeared to want not only
   to overcome Germany's belated turn to the automobile but also to bring
   Germany into line with the American model of mass motorization. For
   Hitler,]indeed, the car was a political resource, an emanation of the
   German nation's modernizing intentions, and subsequently of its military
   and racist goals. In these contrasting situations, the automobile took
   on highly specific and variable meanings, for manufacturers, consumers
   and opinion makers, indeed for entire nations.
   Edensor's observation contains a strong qualifier, namely that things
   are only 'partly' understood as belonging to nations. In the following
   it will be demonstrated that the national belongingness of cars cannot
   be analysed by Ferdinand Porsche and the German car industry, insisted
   that the Volkswagen should sell for only RM 1000.

AB Background: The impact of religion and spirituality on acute care
   hospitalization (ACH) and long-term care (LTC) in older patients before,
   during, and after ACH is not well known.
   Methods: Patients 50 years or older consecutively admitted to the
   general medical service at Duke University Medical Center were
   interviewed shortly after admission (N = 811). Measures of religiosity
   were organized religious activity (ORA), nonorganizational religious
   activity (NORA), religiosity through religious radio and/or television
   (RTV), intrinsic religiosity, and self-rated religiousness. Measures of
   spirituality included self-rated spirituality and daily spiritual
   experiences (DSE). Primary outcome was number of ACH days during an
   average 21-month observation period. Secondary outcomes were times
   hospitalized and number of days spent in a nursing home or
   rehabilitation setting (collectively, long-term care: LTC). Race and sex
   interactions were examined.
   Results: In the cross-sectional analysis, ORA was the only religious
   variable related to fewer ACH days and fewer hospitalizations, an effect
   that is fully explained by physical health status and that diseappeared
   when examined prospectively. The number of LTC days was inversely
   related to NORA, RTV, and DSE, effects that were partially explained by
   social support but not by severity of medical illness. Interactions with
   race and sex were notable but reached statistical significance only
   among African Americans and women. In those groups, religious and/or
   spiritual characteristics also predicted future LTC use independent of
   physical health and baseline LTC status.
   Conclusions: Relationships with ACH were weak, were confined to ORA
   only, and disappeared in prospective analyses. However, robust and
   persistent effects were documented for religiousness and/or spirituality
   in the use of LTC among African Americans and women.

AB Background Effective interventions are needed to prevent acquisition of
   HIV infection in men who have sex with men. To date, no behavioural
   interventions specifically for this risk group have been tested with HIV
   infection as the primary outcome.
   Methods This multisite two-group randomised controlled phase IIb trial
   tested the efficacy of a behavioural intervention in preventing HIV
   infection among 4295 men who have sex with men. The experimental
   intervention consisted of ten one-on-one counselling sessions followed
   by maintenance sessions every 3 months. The standard condition was
   twice-yearly Project RESPECT individual counselling. Twice-yearly
   follow-up visits included testing for HIV antibody and assessment of
   behavioural outcomes.
   Findings The rate of acquisition of HIV infection was 18.2% (95% Cl -4.7
   to 36.0) lower in the intervention group than the standard group.
   Adjustment for baseline covariates attenuated the intervention effect to
   15.7% (-8.4 to 34.4). The effect was more favourable in the first 12-18
   months of follow-up. The occurrence of unprotected receptive anal
   intercourse with HIV-positive and unknown-status partners was 20.5%
   (10.9 to 29.0) lower in the intervention than in the standard group.
   Interpretation The results from the primary analyses allow us to rule
   out that the experimental intervention is associated with a 35% lower
   rate of HIV acquisition than in the standard group. The overall estimate
   of a difference of 18.2%, more favourable estimates of effect in the
   first 12-18 months, and similar effects on risk behaviours suggest that
   prevention of HIV infection among men who have sex with men by a
   behavioural intervention is feasible. Further work should be done to
   develop more effective interventions.

PD JUL-AUG 2004

AB Aims: To examine the relationship between alcohol outlet density and
   violent crime controlling for neighbourhood sociostructural
   characteristics and the effects of spatially autocorrelated error.
   Design: The sample for this ecologic study comprised 188 census tracts
   from the City of Austin, Texas and 263 tracts from the City of San
   Antonio, Texas. Data pertaining to neighbourhood social structure,
   alcohol density and violent crime were collected from archival sources,
   and analysed using bivariate, multivariate and geospatial analyses.
   Results: Using ordinary least squares analysis, the neighbourhood
   sociostructural covariates explained close to 59% of the variability in
   violent crime rates in Austin and close to 39% in San Antonio. Adding
   alcohol outlet density in the target and adjacent census tracts improved
   the explanatory power of both models. Alcohol outlet density in the
   target census tract remained a significant predictor of violent crime
   rates in both cities when the effects of autocorrelated error were
   controlled for. In Austin, the effects of alcohol outlet density in the
   adjacent census tracts also remained significant. The final model
   explains 71% of the variance in violent crime in Austin and 56% in San
   Antonio. Conclusions: The findings show a clear association between
   alcohol outlet density and violence, and suggest that the issues of
   alcohol availability and access are fundamental to the prevention of
   alcohol-related problems within communities.
