AB Between approximate to 5,800 and 3,600 cal B. P. the biggest
   architectural monuments and largest settlements in the Western
   Hemisphere flourished in the Supe Valley and adjacent desert drainages
   of the arid Peruvian coast. Intensive net fishing, irrigated orchards,
   and fields of cotton with scant comestibles successfully sustained
   centuries of increasingly complex societies that did not use ceramics or
   loom-based weaving. This unique socioeconomic adaptation was abruptly
   abandoned and gradually replaced by societies more reliant on food
   crops, pottery, and weaving. Here, we review evidence and arguments for
   a severe cycle of natural disasters earthquakes, El Nino flooding, beach
   ridge formation, and sand dune incursion-at approximate to 3,800 B. P.
   and hypothesize that ensuing physical changes to marine and terrestrial
   environments contributed to the demise of early Supe settlements.

AB One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members
   to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This
   article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a
   selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective
   action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn
   diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and
   these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In
   Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status,
   exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and
   received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these
   findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies
   show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual
   an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who
   received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more
   and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the
   allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and
   solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.

AB Objective: To assess and compare the attitudes and trust that African
   American and white parents have toward their children participating in
   research.
   Design: Self-administered, cross-sectional survey of a convenience
   sample of parents.
   Setting: Primary Care Center at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from
   August 2004 through April 2005.
   Participants: One hundred ninety parents (140 African American and 50
   white parents).
   Outcome Measure: Parental distrust of medical research as measured by a
   summative score of distrusting responses to 8 questions assessing trust
   in research.
   Results: African American parents had significantly greater distrust
   than white parents (67% vs 50%, P = .04). Education was also associated
   with having significantly greater distrust (74% of those with <high
   school education vs 44% of college graduates, P = .03). However, African
   American race remained a predictor of distrust even when education was
   controlled for (odds ratio, 2.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.01).
   Conclusions: The degree of parental distrust toward medical research was
   significantly greater among African American parents. Parental distrust
   may be a barrier to enrollment of African American children in clinical
   research. Strategies for overcoming the higher level of distrust in
   African American parents are warranted for ensuring adequate
   representation of African American children in clinical research.

AB The countries of the world vary in their position along the
   autocracy-democracy continuum of values. Traditionally, scholars explain
   this variation as based on resource distribution and disparity among
   nations. We provide a different framework for understanding the
   autocracy-democracy dimension and related value dimensions, one that is
   complementary (not alternative) to the research tradition, but more
   encompassing, involving both evolutionary (ultimate) and proximate
   causation of the values. We hypothesize that the variation in values
   pertaining to autocracy-democracy arises fundamentally out of human
   (Homo sapiens) species-typical psychological adaptation that manifests
   contingently, producing values and associated behaviours that functioned
   adaptively in human evolutionary history to cope with local levels of
   infectious diseases. We test this parasite hypothesis of democratization
   using publicly available data measuring democratization,
   collectivism-individualism, gender egalitarianism, property rights,
   sexual restrictiveness, and parasite prevalence across many countries of
   the world. Parasite prevalence across countries is based on a validated
   index of the severity of 22 important human diseases. We show that, as
   the hypothesis predicts, collectivism (hence, conservatism), autocracy,
   women's subordination relative to men's status, and women's sexual
   restrictiveness are values that positively covary, and that correspond
   with high prevalence of infectious disease. Apparently, the psychology
   of xenophobia and ethnocentrism links these values to avoidance and
   management of parasites. Also as predicted, we show that the antipoles
   of each of the above values-individualism (hence, liberalism),
   democracy, and women's rights, freedom and increased participation in
   casual sex-are a positively covarying set of values in countries with
   relatively low parasite stress.
   Beyond the cross-national support for the parasite hypothesis of
   democratization, it is consistent with the geographic location at high
   latitudes (and hence reduced parasite stress) of the early democratic
   transitions in Britain, France and the U.S.A. It, too, is consistent
   with the marked increase in the liberalization of social values in the
   West in the 1950s and 1960s (in part, the sexual revolution), regions
   that, a generation or two earlier, experienced dramatically reduced
   infectious diseases as a result of antibiotics, vaccinations, food- and
   water-safety practices, and increased sanitation.
   Moreover, we hypothesize that the generation and diffusion of
   innovations (in thought, action and technology) within and among
   regions, which is associated positively with democratization, is
   causally related to parasite stress. Finally, we hypothesize that past
   selection in the context of morbidity and mortality resulting from
   parasitic disease crafted many of the aspects of social psychology
   unique to humans.

AB The physical, economic, and sociocultural displacement of local peoples
   from protected areas generates intense discussion among scholars and
   policy makers. To foster greater precision and clarity in these
   discussions, we used a conceptual framework from the political economy
   literature to examine different forms of human displacement from
   protected areas. Using marine protected areas (MPAs) to ground our
   analysis, we characterized the 5 types of property rights that are
   reallocated (lost, secured, and gained) through the establishment of
   protected areas. All forms of MPA "displacement" involve reallocation of
   property rights, but the specific types and bundles of rights lost,
   secured, and gained dramatically shape the magnitude, extent, and equity
   of MPA impacts-positive and negative-on governance, economic well-being,
   health, education, social capital, and culture. The impacts of
   reallocating rights to MPA resources vary within and among social
   groups, inducing changes in society, in patterns of resource use, and in
   the environment. To create more environmentally sustainable and socially
   just conservation practice, a critical next step in conservation social
   science research is to document and explain variation in the social
   impacts of protected areas.

AB In the age of the 'return to the empirical' in which the theoretical
   disputes of an earlier era seem to have fallen silent, we seek to
   excavate the intellectual conditions for reviving theoretical debate,
   for it is upon this recovery that deeper understanding of the nature and
   purpose of empirical social science depends. We argue against the all
   too frequent turn to ontology, whereby critical realists have sought an
   epistemological guarantor of sociological validity. We seek, to the
   contrary, to crystallize a culturally-based, hermeneutic account of a
   rational social science. Derived from disputes within the sociology of
   culture, on the one hand, and the long-standing concerns of interpretive
   philosophy, on the other, we offer a cultural-sociological approach to
   epistemology. We view the production of truth in social science as a
   reading of a meaningful social world, and as a performance of
   truthclaims that is constrained by evidence, but whose success depends
   on other contextual factors. We conclude that the rationality of social
   science can be achieved only by forgoing ontology. Theories are
   abstractions of investigators' meanings that allow the interpretation of
   social meanings in turn, whether those are actions, relations, or
   structures. Successful explanations are those that intertwine these
   meaning structures of investigators and actors in an effective way.

   this as context, sociological methodology is rethought in terms of what
   cultural critics refer to as infra-empiricism that allows for a
   rethinking of bodies, matter and life through new encounters with
   visceral perception and pre-conscious affect. Thinking infra-empiricism
   as a new empiricism at this time means rethinking methodology in

AB Our aim was to identify natural and anthropogenic influences on the
   stress physiology of large African carnivores, using wild spotted hyenas
   (Crocuta crocuta) as model animals. With both longitudinal data from a
   single social group, and cross-sectional data from multiple groups, we
   used fecal glucocorticoids (fGC) to examine potential stressors among
   spotted hyenas. Longitudinal data from adult members of a group living
   on the edge of the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya, revealed that fGC
   concentrations were elevated during two periods of social upheaval among
   adults, especially among younger females; however, prey availability,
   rainfall, and presence of lions did not influence fGC concentrations
   among hyenas. Our results suggested that anthropogenic disturbance in
   the form of pastoralist activity, but not tourism, influenced fGC
   concentrations among adult male hyenas; rising concentrations of fGC
   among males over 12 years were significantly correlated with increasing
   human population density along the edge of the group's home range. As
   hyenas from this social group were frequently exposed to anthropogenic
   disturbance, we compared fGC concentrations among these hyenas with
   those obtained concurrently from hyenas living in three other groups
   undisturbed by pastoralist activity. We found that fGC concentrations
   from the undisturbed groups were significantly lower than those in the
   disturbed group, and we were able to rule out tourism and ecological
   stressors as sources of variation in fGC among the populations. Thus it
   appears that both social instability and anthropogenic disturbance, but
   not the ecological variables examined, elevate fGC concentrations and
   represent stressors for wild spotted hyenas. Further work will be
   necessary to determine whether interpopulation variation in stress
   physiology predicts population decline in groups exposed to intensive
   anthropogenic disturbance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB In two-child families containing at least one boy, the expected
   probability that such a family has two boys is 1/3, provided that the
   boy/girl (B/G) ratio is 1.0 and the population to which they belong has
   a binomial distribution of BB, (BG + GB), and GG families. It is
   commonly known that in most human populations the sex ratio at birth
   (i.e., the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls) is
   greater than 1.0. Teachers and textbook writers seldom discuss the more
   realistic expected distributions in populations where the sex ratio is
   greater than 1.0. We present data from two federal surveys with sex
   ratios greater than 1.0 and find that the observed proportions of two
   boys in families of size 2 with at least one boy range from 0.3335 to
   0.3941. It has been reported in the literature that the probability (p)
   of a male birth is subject to both within-sibship variation (Poisson
   variation), for which our data are suggestive, and possibly also
   between-sibship variation (Lexis variation). These deviations (biases)
   from the assumptions of a simple binomial distribution are involved in
   the calculation of values of p and standard 95% confidence intervals,
   thereby foiling attempts to make reliable statistical inferences from
   the data. Analysis of the data is also complicated by family planning
   that falsifies the assumption of randomness in the binomial gender
   distribution model. Families of size 2 (and their sex composition) are
   often discussed in a wider context. Overpopulation in some parts of the
   world has caused mass starvation and threatens to do the same worldwide
   unless the birth rate drops to agriculturally sustainable levels. Even
   if every woman of fertile age has only two children on average from now
   on, the world's population is predicted to continue growing toward 9
   billion people by 2050. Other sociological problems are bound to follow.
   Although the birth rate in China has recently dropped, the average age
   of the population has risen, so that by 2035 it is projected that for
   each person over age 65 there will be just three working-age people.
   Furthermore, China's one-child policy has already led to a sex imbalance
   where there is a large excess of men for whom marriage and parentage is
   denied.

AB Juvenile hormone (JH) has an important role in the behavior of eusocial
   Hymenoptera. Previous work has shown that JH influences aggression and
   dominance behavior in primitive eusocial insects that lack discrete
   queen and worker castes (e.g. Bombus bees and Polistes wasps). In
   contrast, JH is one of the factors that mediates temporal polyethism
   among workers in advanced eusocial insects that have reproductive castes
   (e.g. Apis bees and Polybiawasps). Therefore, initial observations
   suggest that JH may have different roles in primitive and advanced
   eusocial taxa. Here, we use detailed behavioral observations of marked
   individuals to test whether JH influences temporal polyethism in the
   primitive eusocial wasp Polistes dominulus. First, we show that workers
   in P. dominulus have an age-related division of labor, as workers switch
   from nest work to foraging as they mature. Then, we show that
   application of JH accelerates the onset of foraging behavior.Workers
   treated with JH start foraging at a younger age than control workers.
   Therefore, JH mediates temporal polyethism in the primitively eusocial
   insect Polistes dominulus.

AB Social insects are premier models for studying the evolution of
   self-organization in animal societies. Primitively social species may be
   informative about the early stages of social evolution and transitions
   in self-organization. Previous worker removal studies in Polistes
   instabilis paper wasps suggested that dominant but non-egglaying workers
   play an important role in regulating rates of task performance by
   inducing foraging in subordinates. We extend previous worker removal
   studies by quantifying changes in individuals' behavior following
   removals, and by measuring associations between behavioral change and
   individuals' reproductive capacity (ovary development). Workers changed
   their rates of aggressive behaviors more than queens following the
   dominant worker removals. Increases in worker's rates of aggressive
   behaviors were correlated with decreases in their foraging rates.
   Changes in individual rates of social aggression were associated with
   their reproductive capacity: worker females with well-developed ovaries
   increased their rates of aggression. Further changes in rates of
   aggression after the dominant workers were returned also depended on
   ovary development. These patterns suggest that task performance and
   potential fecundity are linked in workers, and that worker interactions
   play a strong role in regulating task performance. We conclude that
   worker reproductive competition may have influenced the evolution of
   colony organization in social insects.

AB This article examines the diversity of food networks that fit within the
   alternative food system of the United States. While farmers' markets,
   community supported agriculture schemes, and corporate organic food
   markets all fit within the alternative food system, they differ greatly
   in the conventions and beliefs that they represent. The alternative food
   system has divided into two movements: corporate, weak alternative food
   networks; and local, strong alternative food networks. The weak
   corporate version focuses on protecting the environment; however, it
   neglects issues concerning labor standards, animal welfare, rural
   communities, small-scale farmers, and human health. Local, strong
   alternative food networks not only assure environmental protection, but
   they also address the issues that weak alternatives neglect. Using three
   case studies from the Washington, D.C. metro area, the author explains
   that strong alternative food networks are better suited to create social
   and political change because they challenge the foundations of the
   conventional food system: standardized and generic products, price-based
   competition, consolidated power, and global scale. To affect true social
   and political change in the United States, the author recommends
   supporting strong alternative food networks by creating the requisite
   cultural and political space for them to succeed.

   theoretical framework for understanding how racism, poverty, and other
   major stressors relate to health through inter-related psychosocial and
   bio-behavioral pathways. Williams and Mohammed review the evidence
   concerning associations between racism and health, addressing the
   multiple levels at which racism can operate and commenting on important
   methodological issues. Klonoff provides a review and update of the
   literature concerning ethnicity-related disparities in healthcare, and
   addresses factors that may contribute to these disparities. Brondolo and
   colleagues consider racism from a stress and coping perspective, and
   review the literature concerning racial identity, anger coping, and
   social support as potential moderators of the racism-health association.
   Finally, Castro and colleagues describe an ecodevelopmental model that
   can serve as an integrative framework to examine multi-level
   social-cultural influences on health and health behavior. In aggregate,
   the special section papers address theoretical and methodological issues
   central to understanding the determinants of health disparities, with
   the aim of providing direction for future research critical to

   evidence on the role of exposure to ethnicity- and SES-related stressors
   on health. We then offer a reciprocal and recursive lifespan meta-model
   that considers the interaction of ethnicity and SES history as impacting
   exposure to psychosocial adversities, including ethnicity-related
   stresses, and mediating biopsychosocial mechanisms that interact to
   result in hypothesized cumulative biopsychosocial vulnerabilities.
   Ultimately, group differences in the burden of cumulative
   vulnerabilities are hypothesized as contributing to differential health

AB This paper provides a review and critique of empirical research on
   perceived discrimination and health. The patterns of racial disparities
   in health suggest that there are multiple ways by which racism can
   affect health. Perceived discrimination is one such pathway and the
   paper reviews the published research on discrimination and health that
   appeared in PubMed between 2005 and 2007. This recent research continues
   to document an inverse association between discrimination and health.
   This pattern is now evident in a wider range of contexts and for a
   broader array of outcomes. Advancing our understanding of the
   relationship between perceived discrimination and health will require
   more attention to situating discrimination within the context of other
   health-relevant aspects of racism, measuring it comprehensively and
   accurately, assessing its stressful dimensions, and identifying the
   mechanisms that link discrimination to health.

   disparities in the utilization and quality of care and the proposed
   explanations for these differences. First, the literature on
   racial/ethnic disparities in medical treatment is reviewed briefly with
   the goal of providing a sense of the range of procedures and conditions
   on which these disparities occur. Then, the possible role of
   physician/provider, patient, and health care system factors in
   contributing to these disparities is reviewed. Finally, suggestions for
   new or expanded directions for research in each of these three areas are
   given. The goal of the paper is to identify factors that might be
   particularly amenable to the type of research done by health
   psychologists.

AB The purpose of this article is to examine focus groups as a qualitative
   research method. We describe and evaluate the use of focus groups based
   on three separate research projects: a study of teachers, parents, and
   children at two urban daycare centers; a study of the responses of
   second-generation Muslim Americans to the events of September 11; and a
   collaborative project on the experiences of children and youth following
   Hurricane Katrina. By examining three different projects, we are able to
   assess some of the strengths and challenges of the focus group as a
   research method. In addition, we analyze the design and implementation
   of focus groups, including information on participant recruitment, the
   most effective group size, group composition and issues of segmentation,
   how to carry out focus groups, and the ideal number of groups to
   conduct. We pay particular attention to the ways in which focus groups
   may serve a social support or empowerment function, and our research
   points to the strength of using this method with marginalized,
   stigmatized, or vulnerable individuals.

   male-defined sport (rugby) to deal with identity dilemmas. Players
   challenged conventional notions of passive femininity through tough
   play, yet encountered sexist and homophobic stigma from outsiders.
   Rather than resisting and rejecting the power of this stigma, they
   engaged in defensive othering-subordinates distancing themselves from
   other subordinates and reinforcing the legitimacy of a devalued identity
   in the process. Specifically, the women identified with dominants,
   engaged in normative identification, and propped up dominants. Their
   identity work resulted in a "heterosexy-fit" identity that ultimately
   reinforced heterosexism and gender inequality.

AB Sociologists have long recognized that social problems do not derive
   solely from objective conditions but from a process of collective
   definition. At the core of some social issues are framing competitions,
   struggles over the production of ideas and meanings. This article
   examines competing cultural meanings about the fat body. Through frame
   analysis of organizational materials, I map the contested field of
   obesity and document three cultural frames-medical frame, social justice
   frame, and market choice frame-as represented by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association to Advance Fat
   Acceptance (NAAFA), and the food industry group the Center for Consumer
   Freedom (CCF), respectively. Using the "framing matrix," I explore each
   frame's key signature elements and discuss its social and cultural
   significance. Notably, each frame leads to different outcomes for social
   equality and how society thinks about fat bodies, health, and public
   policy.

AB Most pregnant women in the United States today choose a normative
   physician-guided pregnancy followed by a medically managed hospital
   birth. Some, however, choose the care of a midwife during pregnancy and
   birth, whether in the hospital or, more rarely, at home. Despite growing
   research on both these paths, a third option chosen by some women has
   rarely been studied: a planned birth at home with neither a doctor nor a
   midwife assisting. In this article, I examine the stories told by women
   in this under-researched population to consider how they make and
   explain this highly unusual choice. Analysis of online birth stories and
   in-depth interviews with women who planned and had an unassisted
   homebirth reveal ways in which these women rely on competing discourses
   of midwifery and medicine to craft a unique sense of agency in birth.

AB Though Pierre Bourdieu has been criticized for ignoring the moral
   dimensions of social judgments, I suggest that his habitus concept can
   provide a useful theoretical foundation for a sociological analysis of
   morality. If the habitus is revised in a way that recognizes the
   embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for
   moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can
   account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social
   settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of
   emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied
   cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are
   employed in different configurations across cultural settings. I argue
   that a modified habitus concept that can account for these phenomena has
   significant implications for the sociological analysis of lay morality.

AB Recent developments in mobile technologies have produced a new kind of
   device: a programmable mobile phone, the smartphone. In this article,
   the authors argue that the technological and social characteristics of
   this device make it a useful tool in social sciences, particularly
   sociology, social psychology, urban studies, technology assessment, and
   media studies. The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of
   people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for
   automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and
   can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and
   cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on
   everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone
   calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in
   human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone,
   two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their
   experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats
   to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These
   approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since
   research software for smartphones have been published in open source,
   which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their
   utilization in research.

PD JAN 21 2009

AB Background: Implicit racial bias denotes socio-cognitive attitudes
   towards other-race groups that are exempt from conscious awareness. In
   parallel, other-race faces are more difficult to differentiate relative
   to own-race faces - the "OtherRace Effect.'' To examine the relationship
   between these two biases, we trained Caucasian subjects to better
   individuate other-race faces and measured implicit racial bias for those
   faces both before and after training.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Two groups of Caucasian subjects were
   exposed equally to the same African American faces in a training
   protocol run over 5 sessions. In the individuation condition, subjects
   learned to discriminate between African American faces. In the
   categorization condition, subjects learned to categorize faces as
   African American or not. For both conditions, both pre- and
   post-training we measured the Other-Race Effect using old-new
   recognition and implicit racial biases using a novel implicit social
   measure - the "Affective Lexical Priming Score'' (ALPS). Subjects in the
   individuation condition, but not in the categorization condition, showed
   improved discrimination of African American faces with training.
   Concomitantly, subjects in the individuation condition, but not the
   categorization condition, showed a reduction in their ALPS. Critically,
   for the individuation condition only, the degree to which an individual
   subject's ALPS decreased was significantly correlated with the degree of
   improvement that subject showed in their ability to differentiate
   African American faces.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results establish a causal link between
   the Other-Race Effect and implicit racial bias. We demonstrate that
   training that ameliorates the perceptual Other-Race Effect also reduces
   socio-cognitive implicit racial bias. These findings suggest that
   implicit racial biases are multifaceted, and include malleable
   perceptual skills that can be modified with relatively little training.

   change and poverty patterns in Africa, analyses the resultant impact,
   and discusses potential adaptation policies for moderating the
   consequences of climatic changes on poverty in the region. The record
   shows that climate change is happening. What is not discussed or is

AB As global commitment grows to protect and support children affected by
   HIV and AIDS, questions remain about how best to meet the needs of these
   children in low prevalence settings and whether information from high
   prevalence countries can appropriately guide programming in these
   settings. A 2007 search for the evidence in low prevalence settings on
   situational challenges of HIV and AIDS-affected children and
   interventions to address these challenges identified 413 documents. They
   were reviewed and judged for quality of documentation and scientific
   rigor. Information was compiled across eight types of challenges (health
   and health care, nutrition and food security, education, protection,
   placement, psychosocial development, socioeconomic status, and
   stigma/discrimination); and also assessed was strength of evidence for
   situational and intervention findings. Results were compared to three
   programming principles drawn from research in high prevalence countries:
   family-centered preventive efforts, treatment, and care; family-focused
   support to ensure capacity to care for and protect these children; and
   sustaining economic livelihood of HIV and AIDS-affected households.
   Findings show that children affected by HIV and AIDS in low prevalence
   settings face increased vulnerabilities similar to those in high
   prevalence settings. These findings support seeking and testing
   programmatic directions for interventions identified in high prevalence
   settings. However, low prevalence settings/countries are extremely
   diverse, and the strength of the evidence base among them was mixed
   (strong, moderate, and weak in study design and documentation),
   geographically limited, and had insufficient evidence on interventions
   to draw conclusions about how best to reduce additional vulnerabilities
   of affected children. Information on family, economic, sociocultural,
   and political factors within local contexts will be vital in the
   development of appropriate strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities.

   776 HIV-infected persons aged 18-35 years in Limpopo Province, South
   Africa who were included in the study, including 534 consecutive
   patients who presented for care at a hospital-based outpatient HIV
   clinic, and 242 persons living in the community. Persons seen in clinic
   had a higher overall socioeconomic profile compared to the community
   sample. They were more likely to have completed matric or tertiary
   education (P=0.04), less likely to be unemployed (P0.001), and more
   likely to live in households with access to a private tap water supply
   (P0.001). These differences persisted after multivariable adjustment.
   Our findings demonstrate that important socioeconomic differences in
   uptake of hospital-based HIV/AIDS care were identified among
   HIV-infected adults living in a rural region of South Africa. This
   suggests an important limitation in hospital-based HIV/AIDS care and
   underscores the need to monitor the equity implications of highly active
   antiretroviral therapy scale-up in resource-limited settings.

AB Investing in social protection in sub-Saharan Africa has taken on a new
   urgency as HIV and AIDS interact with other drivers of poverty to
   simultaneously destabilise livelihoods systems and family and community
   safety nets. Cash transfer programmes already reach millions of people
   in South Africa, and in other countries in southern and East Africa
   plans are underway to reach tens and eventually hundreds of thousands
   more. Cash transfers worldwide have demonstrated large impacts on the
   education, health and nutrition of children. While the strongest
   evidence is from conditional cash transfer evaluations in Latin America
   and Asia, important results are emerging in the newer African
   programmes. Cash transfers can be implemented in conjunction with other
   services involving education, health, nutrition, social welfare and
   others, including those related to HIV and AIDS. HIV/AIDS-affected
   families are diverse with respect to household structure, ability to
   work and access to assets, arguing for a mix of approaches, including
   food assistance and income-generation programmes. However, cash
   transfers appear to offer the best strategy for scaling up to a national
   system of social protection, by reaching families who are the most
   capacity constrained, in large numbers, relatively quickly. These are
   important considerations for communities hard-hit by HIV and AIDS, given
   the extent and nature of deprivation, the long-term risk to human
   capital and the current political willingness to act.

AB The HIV/AIDS epidemic has many serious consequences for children. These
   consequences are, however, rarely inevitable. Families can provide a
   protective barrier that deflects blows, or minimises their impact and a
   supportive nurturing environment that can help children recover from
   harm. If strong enough, and with sufficient access to quality services
   and support from communities, families can reduce the impacts of
   HIV/AIDS on children to negligible levels in most areas of impact. It is
   apparent that the impacts felt by children are not simply unfortunate,
   inevitable consequences of this epidemic. A strong and supported family
   with good access to quality services can deflect almost all of the
   impact. It is as a result of an interaction of the context of poverty,
   which weakens families, and a failure to adequately respond, that
   impacts are felt by children.

AB Many adults in the USA enter primary care late in the course of HIV
   infection, countering the clinical benefits of timely HIV services and
   missing opportunities for risk reduction. Our objective was to determine
   if perceived social support was associated with delay entering care
   after an HIV diagnosis. Two hundred and sixteen patients receiving
   primary care at a large, university-based HIV outpatient clinic in North
   Carolina were included in the study. Dimensions of functional social
   support (emotional/informational, tangible, affectionate, and positive
   social interaction) were quantified with a modified Medical Outcomes
   Study Social Support Scale and included in proportional hazards models
   to determine their effect on delays seeking care. The median delay
   between diagnosis and entry to primary care was 5.9 months. Levels of
   social support were high but only positive social interaction was
   moderately associated with delayed presentation in adjusted models. The
   effect of low perceived positive social interaction on the time to
   initiation of primary care differed by history of alcoholism (no history
   of alcoholism, hazard ratio (HR): 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI):
   0.88, 2.34; history of alcoholism, HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.28).
   Ensuring timely access to HIV care remains a challenge in the
   southeastern USA. Affectionate, tangible, and emotional/informational
   social support were not associated with the time from diagnosis to care.
   The presence of positive social interaction may be an important factor
   influencing care-seeking behavior after diagnosis.

   function children have in their mother's social support and social
   burden networks. As part of initial face-to-face interviews with 46
   HIV-positive women enrolled in a longitudinal study, participants
   indicated their maternal status, the nature of their social support and
   burden (with a modified Multidimensional Social Support Inventory) and
   their levels of depressive symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory). Using
   Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and non-parametric analyses when
   statistical assumptions were not met, findings indicate that women with
   minor children reported fewer depressive symptoms and more confidence in
   regulating social support than women without children. Maternal status
   was not significantly related to other measures of social support. Women
   with minor children reported greater comfort and confidence in
   regulating social burden and reported experiencing less social burden
   than women with adult children only. Women with adult children only
   reported intermediate levels of depression, but high levels of received
   burden and low levels of comfort and confidence in regulating
   (lessening) this burden. Analyses of women's social networks (Fisher's
   Exact Test) indicated that minor children were less likely to be named
   regarding support than adult or other family members and were
   infrequently turned to for practical, emotional, or HIV-related support.
   Adult children were more often listed as providing various types of
   support than minor children, yet these relationships were also often
   associated with relatively higher levels of social burden.

AB Little is known about the psychosocial impact of antiretroviral therapy
   (ART) among women in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we conducted a
   cross-sectional study in Zimbabwe to assess the impact of ART on
   HIV-positive women's health-related quality of life, using the Medical
   Outcomes Study-HIV Quality of Life (QOL) questionnaire. Additionally, we
   assessed socio-demographics, reproductive and sexual health, HIV-related
   history, disclosure, social stigma, self-esteem, and depression.
   Structured interviews were conducted with 200 HIV-positive women and
   categorized into three groups by treatment: (1) Group 1 (n = 31) did not
   meet clinical or laboratory criteria to begin treatment; (2) Group 2 (n
   = 73) was eligible to begin treatment but awaiting initiation of
   treatment; and (3) Group 3 (n = 96) was on ART for a median of 13
   months. The women had similar sociodemographic characteristics but
   varied significantly in clinical characteristics. Women on ART reported
   fewer AIDS-related symptoms in the last week and year and had higher
   current and lower baseline CD4 counts compared to women not on ART. On
   most QOL domains women on ART reported higher mean scores as compared to
   women not on ART (p < 0.01). Additionally, women on ART reported less
   depression compared to women not on ART (p < 0.001). Between the two
   groups of women not on ART, unexpectedly, there were no significant
   differences in their scores for QOL or depression. Thus, Zimbabwean
   women living with HIV experience better overall QOL and lower depression
   on ART. Altogether, our findings suggest that ART delivery in
   resource-poor communities can enhance overall QOL as well as
   psychosocial functioning, which has wide-ranging public health
   implications.

AB Individual rationality sometimes leads to collectively irrational
   outcomes, a fundamental problem in the social and life sciences that has
   attracted sustained attention from experimentalists in sociology,
   psychology, biology, and economics. But what is it about individual
   rationality that sometimes gets us into trouble? Is the problem the
   egoistic pursuit Of individual self-interest? Or does the problem with
   individual rationality lie elsewhere? To find an answer, this chapter
   closely examines the theoretical and experimental literature on social
   dilemmas, to see how researchers identify the source of the problem. The
   review suggests that the prevailing theory wrongly points to egoism as
   the problem. Failing to do what is best for everyone can also happen
   among rational altruists, and sometimes egoism is needed to prevent it.
   The chapter concludes by pointing to what we believe is the fundamental
   problem - a tension not between individual self-interest and collective
   welfare, but between individual autonomy and collective interdependence.

AB Objectives. We examined associations between racial discrimination and
   actualization, defined as the degree of positive integration between
   self-identity and racial group identity, and self-rated health and
   physical pain and impairment.
   Methods. We used logistic regressions to analyze data from 447 gay,
   lesbian, bisexual, and other sexual-minority American Indians/Alaska
   Natives.
   Results. Greater self-reported discrimination was associated with higher
   odds of physical pain and impairment (odds ratio [OR]=1.42; 95%
   confidence interval [CI]=1.13, 1.78); high levels of actualization were
   associated with lower odds of physical pain and impairment (OR=0.59; 95%
   CI=0.35,0.99) and self-rated fair or poor health (OR=0.54; 95% CI=0.32,
   0.90). Actualization also moderated the influence of discrimination on
   self-rated health (t=-2.33; P=.020). Discrimination was positively
   associated with fair or poor health among participants with low levels
   of actualization, but this association was weak among those with high
   levels of actualization.
   Conclusions. Among two-spirit American Indians/Alaska Natives,
   discrimination may be a risk factor for physical pain and impairment and
   for fair or poor self-rated health among those with low levels of
   actualization. Actualization may protect against physical pain and
   impairment and poor self-rated health and buffer the negative influence
   of discrimination. (Am J Public Health. 2009;99: S144-S151.

AB In the last two decades, culture has emerged in population health as a
   common explanation for health outcomes and disparities. This paper
   systematically reviews such cultural accounts, focusing on a historical
   sample of articles from prominent population health journals (1930-2008,
   n=100) and a contemporary sample of articles in the American Journal of
   Public Health (2008, n=95). The review reveals that references to
   culture rarely (1) specify the precise pathways by which culture
   influences health or (2) assess the plausibility of these pathways.
   Despite these weaknesses, a few studies have begun to clarify, measure,
   and assess how culture can influence health outcomes, and these articles
   reflect promising new avenues for understanding how cultural factors
   influence variation in health and well-being.

AB Background: The causes of ethnic and caste-based disparities in mental
   health are poorly understood. Aim: The study aimed to identify mediators
   underlying caste-based disparities in mental health in Nepal. Subjects
   and methods: A mixed methods ethnographic and epidemiological study of
   307 adults (Dalit/Nepali, n=75; high caste Brahman and Chhetri, n=232)
   was assessed with Nepali versions of Beck Depression (BDI) and Anxiety
   (BAI) Inventories. Results: One-third (33.7%) of participants were
   classified as depressed: Dalit/Nepali 50.0%, high caste 28.4%. One
   quarter (27.7%) of participants were classified as anxious: Dalit/Nepali
   50.7%, high caste 20.3%. Ethnographic research identified four potential
   mediators: Stressful life events, owning few livestock, no household
   income, and lack of social support. The direct effect of caste was 1.08
   (95% CI -1.10-3.27) on depression score and 4.76 (95% CI 2.33-7.19) on
   anxiety score. All four variables had significant indirect (mediation)
   effects on anxiety, and all but social support had significant indirect
   effects on depression. Conclusion: Caste-based disparities in mental
   health in rural Nepal are statistically mediated by poverty, lack of
   social support, and stressful life events. Interventions should target
   these areas to alleviate the excess mental health burden born by
   Dalit/Nepali women and men.

AB Social cognition in humans is distinguished by psychological processes
   that allow us to make inferences about what is going on inside other
   people-their intentions, feelings, and thoughts. Some of these processes
   likely account for aspects of human social behavior that are unique,
   such as our culture and civilization. Most schemes divide social
   information processing into those processes that are relatively
   automatic and driven by the stimuli, versus those that are more
   deliberative and controlled, and sensitive to context and strategy.
   These distinctions are reflected in the neural structures that underlie
   social cognition, where there is a recent wealth of data primarily from
   functional neuroimaging. Here I provide a broad survey of the key
   abilities, processes, and ways in which to relate these to data from
   cognitive neuroscience.

AB The United States ranks in the lower tiers of OECD countries in life
   expectancy, and recent studies indicate that socioeconomic inequalities
   in health have been widening in the past decades. Over this period, many
   rigorous longitudinal studies have identified important social,
   behavioral, and environmental conditions that might reduce health
   disparities if we could design effective interventions and make specific
   policy changes to modify them. Often, however, neither our policy
   changes nor our interventions are as effective as we hoped they would be
   on the basis of findings from observational studies. Reviewed here are
   issues related to causal inference and potential explanations for the
   discrepancy between observational and experimental studies. We conclude
   that more attention needs to be devoted to (a) identifying the correct
   etiologic period within a life-course perspective and (b) understanding
   the dynamic interplay between interventions and the social, economic,
   and environmental contexts in which interventions are delivered.

AB I have written a strictly autobiographical essay about the half dozen
   areas or fields in which I have done sociological research during my
   career. One reason for writing the essay is to encourage students to
   become what I call a "multi," there being too few in sociology, as in
   other disciplines in which most researchers do their work in one field.
   I hope the essay demonstrates that working in many fields can make for a
   satisfying and productive career. Research across areas also encourages
   comparative work, and if enough young people become mufti-field
   researchers, sociologists might then develop more interdisciplinary
   skills, which is even now desirable and may one day be necessary for all
   the social sciences. My essay also describes how and why I became
   interested in my six fields and how I moved between them during my
   career. The rest of the paper describes my major studies and other
   activities in my fields as well as the institutional and other contexts
   that I believe have affected my work.

AB Emotional labor refers to the process by which workers are expected to
   manage their feelings in accordance with organizationally defined rules
   and guidelines. Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart introduced this
   concept and inspired an outpouring of research on this topic. This
   article reviews theory and research on emotional labor with a particular
   focus on its contributions to sociological understandings of workers and
   jobs. The sociological literature on emotional labor can be roughly
   divided into two major streams of research. These include studies of
   interactive work and research directly focused on emotions and their
   management by workers. The first uses emotional labor as a vehicle to
   understand the organization, structure, and social relations of service
   jobs, while the second focuses on individuals' efforts to express and
   regulate emotion and the consequences of those efforts. The concept of
   emotional labor has motivated a tremendous amount of research, but it
   has been much less helpful in providing theoretical guidance for or
   integration of the results generated by these bodies of work.

AB Leading edges of population expansion provide unique opportunities for
   individuals to elevate their social and economic status. However,
   dispersal into unknown areas may have high costs such as violence
   associated with conflicts over resources, unfamiliar and harsh
   ecological conditions, and a loss of social networks. We investigate the
   background of men who dispersed to Gothic, Colorado during the late 19th
   century to prospect for silver ore. We find support for the hypothesis
   that men who chose to disperse to the frontier and endure such costs
   were on average those who lacked access to critical resources in their
   childhood homes. Yet contrary to this hypothesis and previous dispersal
   research, some migrants came from very wealthy and high status families.
   The incentives of long-distance dispersal to ephemeral mining towns with
   potentially high payoffs are different from the incentives of dispersal
   sites examined in previous literature. This project draws attention to
   the need to study heterogeneous incentive structures for dispersal and
   is also a small piece of understanding the larger puzzle of the
   colonization of frontiers and population expansion.

AB In a biological market, individuals seek to maximize their benefits by
   trading social commodities with the partner offering the highest value.
   When demand for a partner or commodity is greater than supply,
   individuals compete for access to the preferred partner by raising the
   price they are willing to pay. In primates, this model has been used to
   explain the pattern of grooming between mothers of new infants and other
   individuals who attempt to handle those infants. Here we describe the
   pattern of interactions with mothers of newborn infants in a group of
   wild olive baboons (Papio anubis) in Laikipia, Kenya. Females in this
   group provide a greater share of grooming within bouts when their
   partners have young infants than when they do not have young infants.
   Females groom mothers longer when they handle her infant than when they
   do not. However, females do not compete for access to infants by raising
   their grooming offers to mothers as the availability of infants
   declines. The change in relative grooming contributions results from
   mothers decreasing their grooming rather than non-mothers increasing
   their contributions. These results suggest that females do trade across
   currencies, but market pricing does not always explain the pattern of
   exchange.

AB The educational gradient in health is one of the most robust

   indicate that, like the pattern observed among other racial and ethnic
   minority groups, the well-established educational gradient in health is
   attenuated among Asian Americans. We also show that the gradient
   association between educational attainment and self-rated health among
   Asian Americans depends on whether they receive the bulk of their
   education in the United States or abroad. Compared to the schooling
   received in the United States, being educated in a foreign country does
   not result in the same health payoffs for increasing educational
   attainment. Analysis of an extensive set of mediators indicates that a
   foreign education restricts economic opportunities, limits positive
   social interaction, and inhibits English language proficiency. We
   discuss the implications for Asian Americans, a group composed largely
   of immigrants who received their education outside the United States.

AB Research evidence points to the existence of racial-ethnic disparities
   in both access to and quality of mental health services for African
   Americans with panic disorder. Current panic disorder evaluation and
   treatment paradigms are not responsive to the needs of many African
   Americans. The primary individual, social, and health-care system
   factors that limit African Americans' access to care and response to
   treatment are not well understood. Low-income African American women
   with panic disorder participated in a series of focus-group sessions
   designed to elicit (1) their perspectives regarding access and treatment
   barriers and (2) their recommendations for designing a culturally
   consistent panic treatment program. Fear of confiding to others about
   panic symptoms, fear of social stigma, and lack of information about
   panic disorder were major individual barriers. Within their social
   networks, stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness and the mentally
   ill, discouragement about the use of psychiatric medication, and
   perceptions that symptoms were the result of personal or spiritual
   weakness had all interfered with the participants' treatment seeking
   efforts and contributed to a common experience of severe social
   isolation. None of the focus-group members had developed fully effective
   therapeutic relationships with either medical or mental health
   providers. They described an unmet need for more interactive and
   culturally authentic relationships with treatment providers. Although
   the focus-group sessions were not intended to be therapeutic, the women
   reported that participation in the meetings had been an emotionally
   powerful and beneficial experience. They expressed a strong preference
   for the utilization of female-only, panic disorder peer-support groups
   as an initial step in the treatment/recovery process. Peer-support
   groups for low-income African American women with panic disorder could
   address many of the identified access and treatment barriers.

   report on a pilot study with the USEQ in a sample of 208 college
   students. The instrument was easily understood by the participants, with
   one quarter reporting at least one lifetime episode of SP. As in
   previous studies, SP was associated with anxiety (in particular, panic
   attacks).

AB Aims: This study evaluated the role of gender as a moderator (effect
   modifier) of stressful life events (SLEs) and social support on the risk
   of anxiety in Nepal. A cross-sectional random sampling design was
   employed to recruit 316 persons in a rural community. The participants
   completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Stressful Life Events Rating
   Scale (SLERS), and a measure of social support.
   Results: The prevalence of anxiety differed by gender: 36.9% of women
   versus 20.4% of men endorsed anxiety symptoms above the validated cutoff
   for intervention (odds ratio [OR] = 2.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] =
   1.4-3.8). The number of SLEs and levels of social support did not differ
   by gender, nor did gender moderate the relationship between SLEs and
   anxiety. Gender did moderate the relationship of social support with
   anxiety. Men who reported low social support had 3.5 times greater odds
   (95% CI = 1.4-10.7) of endorsing anxiety relative to men reporting high
   social support. Women exhibited no association of anxiety with social
   support.
   Conclusion: Women are at a greater risk of anxiety in Nepal. Social
   support moderates the risk of anxiety among men but not among women.
   Ethnography and mixed-methods research are needed to identify other
   forms of support that may be protective for women and such factors
   should be promoted in gender-focused mental health interventions.

AB Based on the results of a randomized controlled trial, we examined a
   model of the mechanisms of efficacy of culturally adapted
   cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for Cambodian refugees with
   pharmacology-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comordid
   orthostatic panic attacks (PAs). Twelve patients were in the initial
   treatment condition, 12 in the delayed treatment condition. The patients
   randomized to CBT had much greater improvement than patients in the
   waitlist condition on all psychometric measures and on one physiological
   measure-the systolic blood pressure response to orthostasis (d =
   1.31)-as evaluated by repeated-measures MANOVA and planned contrasts.
   After receiving CBT, the Delayed Treatment Group improved on all
   measures, including the systolic blood pressure response to orthostasis.
   The CBT treatment's reduction of PTSD severity was significantly
   mediated by improvement in orthostatic panic and emotion regulation
   ability. The current study supports our model of the generation of PTSD
   in the Cambodian population, and suggests a key role of decreased vagal
   tone in the generation of orthostatic panic and PTSD in this population.
   It also suggests that vagal tone is involved in emotion regulation, and
   that both vagal tone and emotion regulation improve across treatment.

   creative and equitable agreements. Members of both fields attended a
   symposium at Virginia Tech in late 2008, where communicative planners
   considered how social-ecological resilience informed new possibilities
   for planning practice beyond disaster mitigation and response. In turn,
   communicative planners offered resilience scholars ideas about how
   collaboration could accomplish more than enhance rational decision
   making of the commons. Through these exchanges, the symposium fostered
   ideas about collaborative governance and the critical role of expertise
   in fostering communicative resilience.

PD 2009
PY 2009
AB Similar to research on social learning among adult participants in
   natural resources management, current research in the field of education
   claims that learning is situated in real-world practice, and occurs
   through recursive interactions between individual learners and their
   social and biophysical environment. In this article, we present an
   overview of the social and situated learning literatures from the fields
   of natural resources and education, and suggest ways in which
   educational programs for secondary and university students might be
   embedded in and contribute to efforts to enhance resilience of
   social-ecological systems at the local scale. We also describe three
   initiatives in which learning is situated in adaptive co-management and
   civic ecology practices: a university graduate experiential learning
   course in Sweden, a pre-college environmental education program in the
   USA, and a university undergraduate service-learning class in the USA.
   Through integrating the social learning and adaptive management
   literature with the literature focusing on youth learning situated in
   authentic practice, we hope to: (1) suggest commonalities among systems
   views of learning and social-ecological systems perspectives on
   resilience, and (2) expand our thinking about educational practice from
   being a means to convey content matter to becoming a critical component
   of social-ecological systems and resilience.

AB Purpose - This introductory essay to an edited volume proposes possible
   contributions from economic sociology to the study of work broadly
   defined. Weber had a vision of economic sociology as a study of not only
   economic phenomena but also economically relevant and economically
   conditioned phenomena. Work, in its market and nonmarket variety, falls
   in all these categories and thus presents a fruitful research arena for
   economic sociologists who have thus far primarily studied markets and
   corporations.
   Methodology/Approach - The essay provides an analytic review of
   literature in economic sociology, uses information from the content
   analysis of recent publications in sociology of work, and provides an
   overview of chapters included in this edited volume.
   Value of paper - Applying economic sociology to work means: (a)
   investigating its embeddedness in social structures, culture, and
   politics; and (b) uncovering the socially constructed nature of what
   constitutes paid market work. This article also proposes that economic
   sociologists can expand the boundaries of work by examining such
   activities as care work, work in the informal economy, and prison work.

AB Purpose - This paper investigates the effects of founding, growth,
   decline, and merger on gender differences in managerial career mobility.
   These common events create and destroy many jobs, and so have big
   impacts on managers' careers. We build on previous research to predict
   gender differences in job mobility after such events, and show that
   these gender differences are moderated by the positions managers occupy:
   level, firm size, and sex composition.
   Methodology - We test our predictions using archival data on all 3,883
   managerial employees in all 333 firms in the California savings and loan
   industry between 1975 and 1988. We conduct logistic-regression and
   event-history analyses.
   Findings - Female managers are less likely than male managers to be
   hired when the set of jobs expands because of founding and growth, and
   more likely to exit when the set of jobs contracts because of decline
   and merger. These gender differences exist because relative to men,
   women occupy lower-level jobs, work in smaller firms, and work in firms
   with more women at all managerial ranks. The effects of all but one
   event ( the growth of one's own employer) are moderated by managers'
   positions.
   Value of the paper - Our paper is the first to offer a large-scale test
   of gender differences in career trajectories in the wake of common
   organizational events. By showing that these market-shaping events
   affect male and female managers' careers differently, and that these
   effects depend on the positions of male and female managers, we
   demonstrate economic sociology's potential for studying inequality.

AB Purpose - University-industry relationships raise concerns about the
   influence of commercial interests on academic science. In this paper, we
   investigate how academic scientists who collaborate with industry
   understand their professional identity in relation to their research
   money and the notion of scientific "independence.''
   Design/Methodology/Approach - We conducted in-depth interviews with 84
   scientists and 65 administrators from 9 U. S. universities. The
   scientists do research in the field of agricultural biotechnology and
   collaborate with industry. The administrators have oversight
   responsibility for academic research, university - industry
   collaborations, and technology transfer.
   Findings - We find that our respondents are wary of industry funding but
   believe that it has an appropriate place in academic research.
   Typically, industry money is treated either as seed money for
   preliminary research or as flexible funding that supplements the core,
   essential competitive grants academic scientists obtain from public
   agencies. We find that academic scientists talk about the mix of public
   and private funds in their research funding portfolios in ways that aim
   to construct an "independent'' investigator professional identity.
   Originality/Value - Our study is a case of how money is inscribed with
   meanings in institutional settings. It contributes to scholarship in
   economic sociology of work by revealing how money is used by academic
   scientists to signal their alignment with institutionally sanctioned
   professional norms and by administrators to evaluate scientists' work.

AB Purpose - This chapter illustrates how an economic sociology of work
   exposes the deeply embedded nature of the informal economy and the
   social and political lives of its growing mass of unprotected workers
   under globalization. In particular, the premises of economic sociology
   offer a comprehensive definition of the informal economy that I term,
   "relational.'' In contrast to definitions based on modernization and
   neoliberal assumptions of isolated economies, relational definitions of
   the informal economy expose the structures, networks, and political
   institutions that intertwine informal workers with the formal economy,
   society, and the state. Operationalizing the relational definition in
   labor surveys ensures the inclusion of previously invisible informal
   workers, especially those who operate at the intersection of the
   informal and formal economy. As well, it ensures the collection of data
   on the precise ways in which informal workers are socially and
   politically embedded, including their collective action efforts, the
   meaning they attach to their labor, and the social networks that
   determine their life chances.
   Methodology - To illustrate this point, I apply a relational definition
   of informal labor to the case of India, using the National Sample Survey
   on Employment and Unemployment, as well as findings from interviews with
   organized informal workers.
   Findings - By doing so, I provide an internationally comparative measure
   of India's informal workforce, illustrate informal workers' social
   conditions relative to those of formal workers, highlight the expansion
   of the informal workforce since the government enacted liberalization
   reforms, and expose the unique political action strategies Indian
   informal workers are launching against the state.
   Implications/Originality - These findings help us understand Indian
   informal workers in an internationally comparative context, yielding
   empirical insights on their social conditions and political
   organizations for the first time. As well, they call for an important
   refinement to existing definitions of the informal economy that to date
   have relied only on Latin American and African experiences.

AB Purpose - To use insights from economic sociology to analyze how U. S.
   employment law understands and regulates the relationship between prison
   labor and conventional employment.
   Methodology - Legal analysis of all published court opinions deciding
   whether federal employment laws such as the minimum wage apply to prison
   labor.
   Findings - Courts decide whether prison labor is an "employment
   relationship'' by deciding whether it is an "economic'' relationship.
   Most interpret prison labor as noneconomic because they locate it in a
   nonmarket sphere of penal relationships. A minority of courts use a
   different conception of the economy, one which interprets prison labor
   as a form of nonmarket work.
   Implications - The economic character of prison labor may be articulated
   using the same theoretical perspectives and analytical techniques
   developed to analyze family labor as economically significant nonmarket
   work. Doing so, however, too readily accepts the market/nonmarket
   distinction. Given the thoroughly social character of market work,
   prison labor's highly structured, institutionally specific character
   does not preclude characterizing it as market work, and some of its
   features support interpreting it as such.
   In this legal context, identifying practices as economic or not, and as
   market or not, has concrete consequences for the actors themselves.
   Rather than using market/nonmarket distinctions as analytical tools,
   scholars might treat actors' designation of an economic practice as part
   of a market or not as a site of conflict, subject to
   institutionalization, and worthy of sociological study.

AB Ben Schneider and David Soskice trace the origins and reproduction of
   Latin America's 'hierarchical' market economies to the perverse synergy
   of: 1) free-market economic reforms that systematically atomize (or
   demobilize) low-income constituencies; 2) majoritarian presidential
   elections that no less systematically ensure middle-class support for an
   upper-class agenda marked by labour market dualism, educational elitism,
   corporate conglomeration, and associational underdevelopment; and 3)
   proportionally-elected legislatures that are particularly susceptible to
   corporate influence. I worry that in their haste to incorporate Latin
   America into the varieties of capitalism framework, however, Schneider
   and Soskice: 1) overlook the Iberian roots of the region's principal
   economic institutions; 2) confuse symptoms like ignorance, informality,
   and corporate conglomeration with causes like inequality and fiscal
   underdevelopment; and 3) ignore not only the possibility but the
   likelihood of left-wing mobilization in the wake of democratization and
   international integration. And I therefore conclude with an alternative

   contemporary contradictions of the region's admittedly benighted
   political economies.

AB While 'gifts' and 'commodities' as theoretically distinct forms of
   circulation are central to economic sociology and anthropology, we argue
   that in practice they are often hybridized. Inspired by Bruno Latour's
   work, we first describe the use in supermarkets and chain stores of one
   hybrid category, the mass-gift, which is neither a commodity nor a gift.
   Through our empirical investigation of sales interactions we critically
   describe the emergence of a vibrant mass-gift economy in which the
   meaning of 'gifts' and 'commodities' as well as their hybrid forms is
   infused with ambiguity which is strategically played out by agentive
   social actors throughout the sales process. We suggest going beyond
   depictions of mass-gifting as merely a calculative strategy for
   promoting sales. Instead, we illustrate how mass-gifting establishes a
   relational space in which actors can negotiate the ambivalence of the
   cultural script of the 'gift': they can re-qualify the seller-buyer
   relationship as a socially binding one; and they can use the ambiguity
   infused into the notion of the mass-gift to express economic might and
   generate symbolic as well as material gains.

AB The term "Hispanic" groups people from Central and South America and the
   Caribbean, combining disparate Cultures, languages, and ancestry, and
   masking biological differences. Historical and Current admixture
   patterns within these populations and with indigenous and European-,
   African-, and/or Asian- derived populations complicate the biological
   picture. Although "Hispanic" has little biological meaning, it is used
   widely in epidemiology, disease management, and forensics as a
   biologically significant group. An interdisciplinary approach combining
   historical, cultural, and biological data can characterize regional and
   temporal differences between Hispanic populations.
   We examined biological distances with a population of central New Mexico
   Hispanics, as a case study of the local specificity of population
   history. We collected dental morphological trait frequencies from
   samples of recent Albuquerque-area Hispanic Americans and several
   ancestral and contemporary groups. To explore regional admixture
   patterns we calculated biological distances using the modified
   Mahalanobis D(2) statistic. Our results indicate that Albuquerque
   Hispanics are more similar to their European and African ancestral
   groups than to Native Americans in New Mexico. Additionally, their
   affinity to Native Americans is greater with prehistoric rather than
   contemporary samples. We argue that these results reflect a local rather
   than pan-Hispanic admixture pattern; they underscore that populations
   are better understood at the local and regional levels. It is
   undesirable to make sweeping biological generalizations for groups known
   to be geographically and genetically disparate. This research is part of
   a growing trend in biological research concerning Hispanics and other
   groups-an emphasis on local samples, informed by historical, cultural,
   and biological factors. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB In many parts of the developed world, families engage with a wide range
   of communication media as a part of their daily lives. Parents often
   express mixed feelings about this engagement on the part of young
   people, however. Employing Baumberg's narrative-in-interaction analysis
   to interviews with 55 parents and 125 young people, this article
   explores both the discursive strategies parents employ when discussing
   their rules and regulations regarding digital technologies, and the
   strategies employed by their teenage young people in response. It
   considers how parents attempt to articulate authority in relation to
   digital media use among their teenage children, and how the ways in
   which teens interpret those parental attempts to express authority
   influence the strategies they themselves embrace regarding digital
   media. The article argues that although economically disadvantaged
   families experience the digital generation gap with particular
   intensity, their strategies reveal that they and their teenage children
   are able to deal with these challenges in creative and effective ways.

AB In this article, I examine free and open source software as a unique
   terrain of struggle over the politics of globalization, focusing on the
   Brazilian government's software strategy under the Lula administration.
   First, I locate this strategy in the historical context of the Brazilian
   government struggles for technological development and autonomy. I
   highlight how the Brazilian government used its power as a hierarchical
   organization to take advantage of the distinctive, networked political
   economy of free and open source software. I employ a post-structural
   political economy perspective to analyze the key role of discourse
   within the Brazilian software strategy. Second, I explore two ways that
   the Lula administration pursued its strategy of digital inclusion
   through an innovative approach to the politics of consumption. It used
   the power of government purchases to shift to free and open source
   systems, as well as pursuing a more ambitious project to democratize
   consumption of computers, free software and the Internet among Brazil's
   poor. I conclude by examining the implications of this software strategy
   for understanding and developing a political economy of digital
   inclusion.

AB This article begins by describing the genesis of the idea of public
   sociology to better assess its meaning and significance. I then move
   from the particular account to a general formulation of the four types
   of knowledge that comprise the sociological field and its division of
   labor. All four types of knowledge are necessary ingredients for a
   flourishing discipline. From the general I return to the particular,
   pointing out different national expressions of this division of
   sociological labor and the conflicts they engender. Antagonisms
   notwithstanding, sociologists do share a distinctive project rooted in
   the defense and expansion of civil society, which brings me to the final
   point. With their roots in civil society, sociologists have a stake in
   responses to market fundamentalism and the economic crises it has
   caused. Inspired by these eventful times, public sociologists can now
   emerge from their academic shells to take their place in shaping the
   direction of society.

   derived from foreign investment dependence theory, ecologically unequal
   exchange theory and world society theory in analyses of industrial
   organic water pollution in less-developed countries, 1980-2000. Using
   panel data from a variety of sources, the author proposes three
   hypotheses: (1) industrial organic water pollution intensity is
   positively associated with foreign investment in manufacturing; (2)
   industrial organic water pollution intensity is positively associated
   with overall export intensity; and (3) industrial organic water
   pollution intensity is negatively associated with the presence of
   environmental international non-governmental organizations. Further
   analyses investigate the impact of organic water pollution on infant
   mortality rates in less-developed countries. In general, findings for
   Prais-Winsten regression analyses with panel-corrected standard errors
   and generalized least squares panel regression analyses of
   less-developed countries confirm the tested hypotheses, and indicate
   that industrial organic water pollution intensity does indeed contribute
   to infant mortality, net of the effects of economic development,
   fertility rates, health expenditures and other relevant factors.

AB A human social discount function measures the value to a person of a
   reward to another person at a given social distance. Just as delay
   discounting is a hyperbolic function of delay, and probability
   discounting is a hyperbolic function of odds-against, social discounting
   is a hyperbolic function of social distance. Experiment 1 obtained
   individual social, delay, and probability discount functions for it
   hypothetical $75 reward; participants also indicated how much of an
   initial $100 endowment they would contribute to a common investment in a
   public good. Steepness of discounting correlated, across participants,
   among all three discount dimensions. However, only social and
   probability discounting were correlated with the public-good
   contribution; high public-good contributors were more altruistic and
   also less risk averse than low contributors. Experiment 2 obtained
   social discount functions With hypothetical $75 rewards and delay
   discount functions with hypothetical $1,000 rewards, as well as
   public-good contributions. The results replicated those of Experiment 1;
   steepness of the two forms Of discounting correlated with each other
   across participants but Only social discounting correlated with the
   public-good contribution. Most participants in Experiment 2 predicted
   that the average contribution would be lower than their own
   contribution.

PD JAN 2009
PY 2009
AB Objective: Prior studies have suggested socioeconomic differences in
   outcome expectations for diabetes. This paper explores outcome
   expectations of adults of varied socioeconomic status with type 2
   diabetes, examining differences between African Americans and whites.
   Design: A qualitative study using focus groups of individuals with type
   2 diabetes. Interviews were tape recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data
   analysis was based on the constant comparative method, assisted by
   qualitative analysis software. Research was done in outpatient clinics
   in both a community health center and tertiary care center.
   Participants: Seventy-one participants, 46% African American, 54% with
   household income less than or equal to $40 000, diagnosed with type 2
   diabetes for at least 1 year. Interventions: Subjects discussed coping
   mechanisms, including self-control, compliance discipline, and denial
   regarding diabetes.
   Results: Behavior control was typified as (1) beliefs about controlling
   diabetes and (2) beliefs about controlling one's behavior aside from
   diabetes control. Patients described a range of strategies, including
   beliefs as self-efficacy, confidence and willingness to take on
   self-management, and positive and negative outcome expectations about
   ability to modify the natural course of the disease.
   Conclusions: Those of higher socioeconomic status espoused more positive
   outcome expectations and self-efficacy, while poorer subjects reported
   more negative outcome expectations. Factors such as perception of
   control may contribute to root causes of socioeconomic disparities seen
   in diabetes outcomes. Interventions to increase compliance should
   address class-specific disease perceptions. Practical support that
   builds on patients' preferred strategies could help improve diabetes
   disparities.

PD JAN 2009
PY 2009
AB Background: Prior research suggests that ethnic minorities and
   individuals of low socioeconomic status (SES) may be more likely to
   attempt weight loss using unproven methods.
   Methods: Data were from a national, random-digit-dial telephone survey
   of weight loss practices. Seven modalities of weight loss were examined.
   Multivariable analysis controlled for clinical and sociodemographic
   variables (including race/ethnicity, SES, and body mass index), as well
   as self-perception of weight and weight loss attitudes.
   Results: In multivariable analysis, African Americans (OR, 1.71; 95% Cl,
   1.05-2.78; p =.03) and Latinos (OR, 1.69; 95% Cl, 1.11- 2.60; p =.016)
   were more likely than Caucasians to report use of over-the-counter (OTC)
   weight loss supplements. African Americans (OR, 0.39; 95% Cl, 0.21-0.71;
   p =.002) and Latinos (OR, 0.56; Cl, 0.33-0.97; p =.038) also were less
   likely than Caucasians to report use of commercial weight loss programs.
   Higher-SES individuals were more likely than low-SES persons to report
   self-directed attempts at weight loss (OR, 1.39; Cl, 1.00-1.93; p =.05)
   and commercial programs (OR, 2.12; Cl, 1.51-2.97; p <.001) and less
   likely to report use of OTC supplements (OR, 0.64; Cl, 0.47-0.88); p
   =.006). African Americans were more likely than Caucasians to report use
   of medically supervised programs (OR, 1.74; Cl, 1.06-2.86; p =.028).
   Conclusions: With the exception of medically supervised programs, ethnic
   minorities and low-SES individuals are generally more likely to report
   use of unproven methods for weight loss and less likely to report use of
   potentially beneficial treatments. These findings should be explored in
   more detail. Use of proven treatments for weight management should be
   encouraged.

AB Allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and
   vaccines is a persistent ethical challenge. We evaluate eight simple
   allocation principles that can be classified into four categories:
   treating people equally, favouring the worst-off, maximising total
   benefits, and promoting and rewarding social usefulness. No single
   principle is sufficient to incorporate all morally relevant
   considerations and therefore individual principles must be combined into
   multiprinciple allocation systems. We evaluate three systems: the United
   Network for Organ Sharing points systems, quality-adjusted life-years,
   and disability-adjusted life-years. We recommend an alternative
   system-the complete lives system-which prioritises younger people who
   have not yet lived a complete life, and also incorporates prognosis,
   save the most lives, lottery, and instrumental value principles.

AB Both natural scientists and economists commonly use quantitative data to
   create models of the systems that interest them and then use these
   models to inform fisheries management. Other social scientists rely on
   lengthier, descriptive texts based primarily on qualitative data to
   assess the human dimensions. To their dismay, fisheries social
   scientists find that much of their rich narrative with keen insights
   ends up filling pages that are neither read nor meaningfully integrated
   into decision-making in fisheries management. Nevertheless, what all
   scientists, practitioners, and managers want and need is information
   that will lead to a better understanding of the ecosystem (comprised of
   interdependent ecological and human systems) and therefore to fisheries
   management that benefits the whole system. Based on the belief that only
   a combination of high-quality quantitative and qualitative data will
   provide both the numbers and the context needed for success in
   ecosystem-based management, we discuss efforts to present social and
   cultural information in forms that are more familiar to those who rely
   on models for a representation of reality in the fisheries context. We
   point out how the designers of these models (or how we) think the models
   might be applied to fisheries management, noting how each model attempts
   to incorporate qualitative data to depict context essential for
   grounding the more commonly used biological and economic models. We also
   assess the benefits and limitations of these models, including the
   constraints on their development and use.

AB Study Objectives: To examine racial differences in sleep in a large
   cohort of midlife women and to evaluate whether indices of socioeconomic
   status (SES) are associated with racial differences in sleep.
   Design: Cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Participants' homes.
   Participants: Caucasian (n = 171), African American (n = 138) and
   Chinese women (n = 59).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements: Sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep
   Quality Index. Polysomnographically assessed sleep duration, continuity,
   architecture, and NREM electroencephalograhic (EEG) power were
   calculated over multiple nights. Sleep disordered breathing and periodic
   leg movements were measured on a separate night. Linear regression
   analysis was used to model the independent and synergistic effects of
   race and SES on sleep after adjusting for other factors that impact
   sleep in midlife women. Indices of SES were self-reported educational
   attainment and financial strain.
   Results: Sleep was worse in African American women than Caucasian
   participants as measured by self-report, visual sleep stage scoring, and
   NREM EEG power. Slow wave sleep differences were also observed between
   Chinese and Caucasian participants. Racial differences persisted after
   adjustment for indices of SES. Although educational attainment was
   unrelated to sleep, financial strain was associated with decreased sleep
   quality and lower sleep efficiency. Financial strain-by-race
   interactions were not statistically significant, suggesting that
   financial strain has additive effects on sleep, independent of race.
   Conclusions: Independent relationships between race and financial strain
   with sleep were observed despite statistical adjustment for other
   factors that might account for these relationships. Results do not
   suggest that assessed indices of SES moderate the race-sleep
   relationship, perhaps due to too few women of low SES in the study.

AB On the surface, the constructs of place attachment and community
   attachment appear to be quite similar; however, there are substantial
   differences between the multidisciplinary place literature and community
   sociology literature it comes from. For scholars trained in a relatively
   single-disciplinary area such as community sociology, the immensity and
   complexity of place literature can be difficult to navigate. This
   article is a primer on these two constructs, written from the
   perspective of a community sociologist. To give context to place
   attachment, an overview of the place literature is presented, including
   brief descriptions of various strands of place scholarship, along with
   the primary debates within the scholarship. Place attachment and related
   place concepts are introduced, followed by a brief review of the work on
   community attachment seen in community sociology. After contrasting the
   two, the overlap between constructs is discussed. The reader is left
   with suggestions for future work.

AB During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published
   several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were
   addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black
   Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological
   triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church.
   Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a
   comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African
   American community. He addressed the social construction of African
   American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of
   the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was
   recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational
   studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership
   patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and
   ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church
   membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it
   possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these
   areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the
   discipline's past and a bridge to its future.

AB An important consequence of the economic structure transformations of
   recent decades is increased income inequality. While an extensive
   literature has explored the relationship between economic restructuring
   and inequality, the unique contribution of this article is that it
   develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this
   process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap
   between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the
   educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5
   percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of
   Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided
   strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and
   the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income
   gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality.
   Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality
   were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor
   force employed in services, and both were lower where greater
   proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing
   industries.

AB Revolutionary advances in telecommunications technology have created a
   ovirtual world.o There are a variety of new social phenomena associated
   with this novel milieu. This represents an excellent opportunity for the
   discipline of sociology to revisit its descriptive roots. This is
   especially true for the sociology of deviant behavior because new forms
   of deviance are clearly related to technological innovations (e.g.,
   Internet crimes against children, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying). The
   current undertaking examines the deviance disavowal strategies of men
   arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped
   police interrogations of 18 subjects, about half of whom were arrested
   in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three
   disavowal strategies seeking to maintain a normal definition of self and
   manage the stigma of their arrest. Directions for future studies in the
   sociology of deviance are suggested.

   professions are undergoing a dramatic transformation from being
   traditional professions to "entrepreneurial professions" populated by
   "knowledge workers." In part, this transformation is associated with the
   commodification and commercialization of professional endeavor.
   Our purpose is to enlist the processual ordering perspective to examine
   the ongoing transformation of the Big 5 (and following the collapse of
   Arthur Andersen during our field study) /4 public accounting firms to
   become entrepreneurial firms populated by global knowledge experts. More
   specifically, we focus on the inter-play of power and meta-power across
   three moments of the social construction process externalization,
   objectivation, and internalization through which the ethos of
   entrepreneurialism is being socially constructed within these firms,
   their individual members, and in the public accounting profession.
   Finally, we explore impressions gleaned from our qualitative,

   faced by instructors who seek to accurately impart what Mills meant by
   his famous neologism and the even stiffer challenge for those struggling
   to instill the sociological imagination in their students. Two pertinent
   examples of creative and probably productive pedagogy are discussed,
   Maurice R. Stein's "Sociology of Birth & Death" at Brandeis University
   and Brian Rich's senior seminar in sociology at Transylvania University.
   The essay concludes with advice for the instructor in pursuit of
   fidelity to Mills's original argument and guidance vis-a-vis the typical
   constraints encountered in today's classrooms.

AB Here I emphasize the applicability of the sociological imagination to an

   evaluating the literature on Japanese higher education and the
   construction of the Japanese student as a form of Orientalism. As I
   embraced international students' unique, context-specific capacities for
   learning, I relied on the illuminating power of C. Wright Mills's
   sociological imagination to heighten their understandings of themselves
   and others. Despite the characterization of Japanese students as passive
   learners, I discovered an engaged and responsive student body who
   developed a keen sociological imagination through storytelling.
   Employing a pedagogy of storytelling, I helped my students successfully
   explore gender and ethnic troubles as public issues in a global context.
   The insight gained abroad has led me to expand my pedagogy at home
   beyond active learning strategies to incorporate stories to enhance U.S.

AB C. Wright Mills would be a friendly critic of service learning,
   acknowledging its benefits for providing students with experiential
   learning opportunities to connect personal troubles with social issues.
   Yet he would be critical of service-learning practices that perpetuate
   institutional power inequalities and that do not advance the social
   change objectives of community-based organizations. We offer an
   innovative approach that helps to address some of these concerns which,
   when used in conjunction with "best practices" of service learning, has
   the potential to make a greater impact on the community than most
   service-learning projects. This paper highlights how two sociology
   programs in two urban universities-a large, elite university and a
   smaller, minority-serving university-have completed significant
   community-based research projects by having classes of students at both
   universities work on projects both consecutively and simultaneously
   across several semesters to complete substantial research projects with
   and for community partners. We use a case study approach to identify
   five key practices that have enabled the two universities to effectively
   collaborate across institutions,

AB Though C. Wright Mills made a pivotal contribution to the discipline by
   raising sociologists' awareness of the ideological and bureaucratic
   content of sociological practicality, he may have placed unyielding
   limits on "the promise" he profoundly proclaimed in the "sociological
   imagination." By defining types of practicality in such rigidly
   confining terms, as either "liberal" or "illiberal" those wishing to
   practice sociology in broader and more expansive ways were left with few
   of the alternatives Mills himself wished to extol. Over the past
   generation, the field of applied sociology and teaching and learning
   sociological practice have struggled to develop in the discipline. This
   has posed huge challenges for teachers wishing to address the needs of
   students who have perennially been interested in finding practical
   possibilities for applying their sociology in jobs and careers. The
   purpose of this paper is to: 1) examine the concept of sociological
   practicality propounded by Mills; 2) critically assess the concept of
   sociological practicality in the historical context of American
   sociology, 3) identify and discuss a broad typology of models of
   research and practice from which types of practicality may emerge; 4)
   discuss the implications of this typology for teaching and learning
   sociological practice; and 5) conclude by discussing ways of teaching a
   liberating practicality for sociology.

   incarcerated, or impoverished are more likely to be seen and identify as
   black and less likely to be seen and identify as white, regardless of
   how they were classified or identified previously. This is consistent
   with the view that race is not a fixed individual attribute, but rather
   a changeable marker of status.

AB In rural China, the ratio of newborn boys to newborn girls [sex ratio at
   birth (SRB)] has been rising for several decades, to values
   significantly above its biological norm. This trend has a number of
   alarming societal consequences, and has attracted the attention of
   scholars and politicians. The root of the problem lies in a
   2,500-year-old culture of son preference. This culture is intricately
   linked with the economic reality of each couple's life, so that there
   are financial and psychological repercussions to parents who have no
   sons. To bring greater clarity and understanding to this issue, we
   present a quantitative framework that describes the interaction between
   economics and cultural transmission. We start with an explicit mechanism
   by which economic incentives can change cultural beliefs of a given
   individual, and go on to include a mechanism of cultural inheritance
   from generation to generation. We then show how economic conditions can
   affect the dynamics of cultural change in an entire society, and may
   lead to a decrease in the country's sex ratio at birth.

   growth of population pressure and concern about water quality and
   quantity, demands are growing to alter the relationship of agriculture
   to water in both these locations. To illuminate the process of change in
   this relationship, the author builds on Buttel's (Research in Rural
   Sociology and Development 6: 1-21, 1995) assertion that agriculture is
   transitioning to a post "green revolution" period where farmers are paid
   for conservation, and employs actor network theory (Latour and Woolgar

AB Sociologists empirically and theoretically neglect genocide. In this

   on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and
   dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative
   dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes
   that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We
   investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of
   refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the
   Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process.
   Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African
   settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a
   collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which
   amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and
   lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial
   and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the
   instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive
   perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing
   perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously
   added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering
   discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin

AB To assess the impact of socio-economic status (SES) on cancer survival
   in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
   Patients diagnosed with one of 13 major cancers during 1992-2000 in NSW
   were followed-up to the end of 2001. The effect of SES on survival was
   estimated for each individual cancer and all 13 cancers combined using
   multivariable modeling. The numbers of lives that could be extended if
   all people had the same level of excess risk of death due to cancer as
   patients in the highest SES areas were also estimated.
   There were highly statistically significant variations in survival
   across SES groups for four cancers: stomach, liver, lung, and breast and
   all 13 cancers combined. Variation remained highly significant after
   adjusting for disease stage. Patients in lower SES areas had 10-20%
   higher excess risk than those in the highest SES areas. In total, there
   were 3,346 lives potentially extendable beyond 5 years; the highest
   number was for lung cancer (756).
   The significantly worse survival in lower SES areas from cancers of the
   stomach, liver, lung, and breast may be due to poorer access to
   high-quality cancer care. Estimates of the number of lives potentially
   extendable by improving cancer survival in lower SES areas suggest that
   priority should be given to improving lung cancer care in lower SES
   areas in NSW, Australia.

   awareness of needed cultural change, and an emerging sustainability
   movement, attention to "reenchantment"-the phenomena of sensory,
   emotional, and nonrational ways of connecting with the earth's living
   systems-strengthens our professional understanding as educators as well
   as our ability to contribute to institutional change. Research among
   participants in the Piedmont Project-a faculty development program for
   sustainability across the curriculum at Emory University-and among
   sustainability leaders in higher education across North America shows
   that wonder, delight, awe, and meaning are linked to both personal and
   political spheres of action. The experience of reenchantment can be
   understood in seven dimensions and provides restorative moments, fosters
   creativity for change, and supports a revised worldview. A stereoscopic
   paradigm that combines reason and reenchantment will serve an
   anthropology that seeks to think, in Roy Rappaport's words, "not merely

AB Purpose of review
   There is a growing awareness of the importance of cultural competency in
   pediatrics. The authors review the most recent studies that examine the
   impact of cultural competency on general pediatric care, explore
   cultural beliefs and practices affecting clinical care, and describe
   culturally sensitive interventions designed to address racial/ethnic
   health disparities.
   Recent findings
   The beneficial effects of cultural competency embrace health outcomes,
   quality of care, and patient satisfaction, while failure to consider
   language and culture can have serious adverse consequences for clinical
   care, including patient safety and healthcare access. A five-component
   model of cultural competency has been developed, and a growing
   literature details an array of normative cultural values, folk
   illnesses, parent beliefs/practices, and provider behaviors that can
   have a profound impact on pediatric care. Culturally sensitive
   interventions are being developed to lessen racial/ethnic health
   disparities.
   Summary
   A goal for the pediatrician is to provide culturally competent
   healthcare by using trained medical interpreters with limited
   English-proficient families, being familiar with normative cultural
   values that affect the healthcare of commonly encountered racial/ethnic
   groups, and asking about folk illness beliefs and ethnomedical
   treatments.

AB Within the contexts of globalization and the Atlantic Forest ecoregion,
   I present a multiscale analysis of anthropogenic landscape dynamics in
   the Florianopolis city-region, Santa Catarina, southern Brazil. Drawing
   on field research conducted between 2000 and 2004 and a review of the
   literature, I examined Brazilian demographic and agricultural census
   data for the period of 1970 to 1995-1996. I hypothesized that economic
   restructuring, new institutional arrangements, and the valuation of
   environmental amenities and ecosystem services have contributed to
   forest recovery trends and thus a forest transition in the city-region.
   My results indicate that along with rapid urbanization, in-migration,
   socioeconomic polarization, and segregation, the city-region has
   experienced the contraction of private agricultural land area, expansion
   of protected areas, recovery of forests, and conversion of coastal plain
   ecosystems to built environments. Future analyses of forest transition
   dynamics should consider the spatial configurations of socioeconomic
   inequality in city-regions.

AB Complex environmental problem solving depends on cross-disciplinary
   collaboration among scientists. Collaborative research must be preceded
   by an exploratory phase of collective thinking that creates shared
   conceptual frameworks. Collective thinking, in a cross-disciplinary
   setting, depends on the facility with which collaborators are able to
   learn and understand each others' perspectives. This paper applies three
   perspectives on learning to the problem of enabling cross-disciplinary
   collaboration: Maslow's hierarchy of needs, constructivism, and
   organizational learning. Application of learning frameworks to
   collaboration provides insights regarding receptive environments for
   collaboration, and processes that facilitate cross-disciplinary
   interactions. These environments and interactions need time to develop
   and require a long phase of idea generation preceding any focused
   research effort. The findings highlight that collaboration is itself a
   complex system of people, scientific theory, and tools that must be
   intentionally managed. Effective management of the system requires
   leaders who are facilitators and are capable of orchestrating effective
   environments and interactions.

AB This article examines the implementation of integrated water-management
   institutions in the Paraiba do Sul River basin in southeast Brazil. It
   argues that social learning has been critical in facilitating reform
   implementation so far, and will likely continue to be an important
   factor for the future sustainability of the new management system. There
   has been a synergistic relationship between social learning and Brazil's
   water-reform hybrid governance institutions, in which social learning
   facilitated the implementation of the reform's new institutions, which
   in turn enabled further learning in the context of the river basin
   committee's decision-making process. Through interviews, surveys, and
   observations, we identified social-learning capacities, including trust,
   an ability to work together, and the committee's shared understanding of
   the institution's problems, possibilities, and mission. Effective
   management through social learning was demonstrated by the institution's
   adaptive capacity in the face of a severe drought.

   the organisational culture, business model, impact of policies and
   regulations, and the trade-offs made between the original goals and
   those attained within this environment. One of the most troubling
   aspects arising from this case study was that no corrective mechanism
   was in place for program design flexibility once previously created
   policies were deemed harmful to the Centre. When the major assumptions
   on which the Centre was founded, turned out to be false, there was no
   turning back and the Centre collapsed.

AB A number of theorists in the sociology of religion hold that
   denominations in the United States have remained vital by decentralizing
   power, and shifting control from central hierarchies to individual
   congregations: a strategy dubbed "de facto congregationalism." However,
   changes in the polity of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
   (the LDS, or Mormon, Church) contravene this trend. Unlike most
   denominations, Mormonism-a vital faith by all accounts-has centralized
   its authority and standardized its programs in recent decades. This
   article investigates whether the logic of de facto congregationalism
   applies to Mormonism. From a case study of missionary outreach in an LDS
   congregation, I investigate how mandates from the church's central
   headquarters are interpreted and implemented at the grassroots level. My
   findings show that the church's centralized polity may hinder the
   functioning of Mormon congregations outside traditional strongholds in
   Utah and the Intermountain West-a finding consistent with the logic of
   de facto congregationalism.

AB BACKGROUND: There are no prospective studies that have investigated the
   effects of an intervention to improve end of life (EOL) care in an
   underserved population.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine whether homeless persons will complete an
   advance directive (AD).
   DESIGN: Randomized trial comparing two modes of providing an opportunity
   for homeless persons to complete an AD. Half of the subjects were
   randomized to a self-guided group (SG) who were given an AD and written
   instructions; the other half were given the same material but, in
   addition, were offered the opportunity to receive guidance to complete
   the AD (CG).
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine homeless persons recruited from a drop-in
   center.
   MEASURES: Rate of AD completion and baseline and 3-month follow-up
   EOL-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors.
   RESULTS: The overall AD completion rate was 44%, with a statistically
   significant higher completion rate of 59% in the CG group compared to
   30% in the self-guided only group. Frequency of worry about death
   decreased among those who filled out an AD from 50% to 12.5%, and also
   among those who did not (25% to 12.5%) (p <.05). Among those who filled
   out an AD, there were increases in plans to write down EOL wishes (56%
   to 100%; p <.05) and plans to talk about these wishes with someone (63%
   to 94%; p <.05).
   CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that people living in dire economic
   and social situations will complete an AD when offered the opportunity.
   While offering guidance resulted in higher rates of completion; even a
   simple self-guided AD process can achieve completion of ADs in this
   population.

AB Parents of children with intellectual disabilities (ID) typically report
   elevated levels of parenting stress, and child behaviour problems are a
   strong predictor of heightened parenting stress. Interestingly, few
   studies have examined child characteristics beyond behaviour problems
   that may also contribute to parenting stress. The present longitudinal
   study examined the contribution of child social skills to maternal
   parenting stress across middle childhood, as well as the direction of
   the relationship between child social skills and parenting stress.
   Families of children with ID (n = 74) or typical development (TD) (n =
   115) participated over a 2-year period. Maternal parenting stress, child
   behaviour problems and child social skills were assessed at child ages
   six and eight.
   Child social skills accounted for unique variance in maternal parenting
   stress above and beyond child intellectual status and child behaviour
   problems. As the children matured, there was a significant interaction
   between child social skills and behaviour problems in predicting
   parenting stress. With respect to the direction of these effects, a
   cross-lagged panel analysis indicated that early parenting stress
   contributed to later social skills difficulties for children, but the
   path from children's early social skills to later parenting stress was
   not supported, once child behaviour problems and intellectual status
   were accounted for.
   When examining parenting stress, child social skills are an important
   variable to consider, especially in the context of child behaviour
   problems. Early parenting stress predicted child social skills
   difficulties over time, highlighting parenting stress as a key target
   for intervention.

   Sixty-three mothers completed assessments of stress and support at two
   time points.
   Multiple regression analyses revealed that parenting support during the
   early childhood period (i.e. advice on problems specific to their child
   and assistance with child care responsibilities), irrespective of
   source, consistently predicted most dimensions of parent stress assessed
   during the early elementary years and contributed unique variance.
   General support (i.e. primarily emotional support and validation) from
   various sources had other, less widespread effects on parental stress.
   The multidimensional perspective of the construct of social support that
   emerged suggested mechanisms mediating the relationship between support
   and stress and provided a framework for intervention.

AB We know from previous research that some individuals with strong,

   phenomena incongruent with Christian beliefs (extrasensory perception,
   psychic abilities, communicating with the dead, etc.). What we don't
   have a full grasp on is to what extent people with conventional
   Christian beliefs will also experiment with these paranormal activities.
   It is one thing to believe in psychic abilities, but quite another to
   consult a psychic. We draw upon different perspectives in sociology of
   religion and present competing hypotheses about the relationship between
   conventional Christian beliefs and paranormal experimentation. We use
   the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and count regressions to model the
   number of reported paranormal experiences. In general, conventional
   Christian beliefs have no direct effect on the reported number of
   paranormal experiences, but, these effects are conditioned by the level
   of church attendance. Among those who attend church often, conventional
   Christian beliefs significantly decrease the reported number of
   paranormal experiences. Among those who do not attend church, holding
   conventional Christian beliefs increases the number of reported
   paranormal experiences. Implications for theory and research are
   discussed.

AB The writings of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) foreshadowed several
   of the dominant theories of sociology, social psychology, aesthetics,
   linguistics and literary theory. His ideas impacted generations of
   thinkers, but today he is uncelebrated, mostly unknown. His writings on
   populism, expressionism, and pluralism are relevant to contemporary
   sociology, especially community sociology. Here we consider his views on
   the nature and meaning of community, and his methods Of Studying and
   interpreting communities. These include an emphasis on the essential
   particularity of human communities and their connection to wider systems
   and networks. Herder urges special attention to the elements of context
   (place, time, language, culture) within which communi ties are situated.
   Herder's is an embedded particularism, a focus on individuality and
   diversity within larger unities. He also sensitizes LIS to the
   multivalence and multiplicity of social phenomena. As the proper stance
   for community research he Counsels involvement and empathy rather than
   objectivity and emotional distance, and he urges researchers to be
   sensitive to data from all of their senses, not merely sight. Drawing
   upon Herder's writings, we conclude with several important
   methodological principles relevant to improving current work on the
   nature and conceptualization of communities.

AB In the United States, voter turnout rates have been declining for the
   last 4 decades; however, this pattern differs substantially by region.
   Southern states have actually seen a fairly dramatic increase in turnout
   since the 1950s and currently the South and non-South have almost
   identical rates of voter registration and turnout. Using a series of
   Heckman probit models, which examine voting as a two-step process of
   registering and casting a vote, we systematically investigate
   differences in rates of registering and voting across regions and test
   explanations for regional convergence over time. Using data from the
   American National Election Studies (1956-2000), we find that regional
   convergence in voter registration is primarily due to the removal of
   formal and informal barriers to registration and voting in the South and
   declining efforts to mobilize potential voters in the non-South. In
   addition, we find some fairly distinct differences in which predictors
   are important to each stage of the voting process; for example, race is
   a better predictor of registering to vote than voting. We conclude with
   a discussion of the implications of these results.

AB Austin Turk (1969) offers a distinctly sociological explanation of
   policing by theorizing that structural reinforcers (e.g., older police
   officer, younger citizen) and reversals (e.g., younger police officer,
   older citizen) of the situationally absolute positional authority of
   police officers affect the relationship between police officers and
   citizens. To this point, however, there have been only three direct
   tests of Turk's theory (Greenleaf and Lanza-Kaduce, 1995; Lanza-Kaduce
   and Greenleaf, 2000; Weidner and Terrill, 2005). All have examined overt
   conflict and the results are mixed. The present research therefore adds
   a fourth test of Turk's (1969) theory to the sociological literature by
   examining the effects of structural reinforcers and reversals on
   citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy and propriety of police actions
   during routine traffic stop encounters. Net of control measures,
   including the legal reason for the traffic stop, and extra-legal
   measures, such as driver gender, the data provide modest to strong
   support for parts of Turk's (1969) theory and absolutely no support for
   others. The conclusion of the present study is that more research is
   needed to determine whether Turk (1969) is correct in theorizing that
   there is a sociology, and not just a social psychology, to
   police-citizen encounters.

AB This article discusses the importance of several parameters of context
   integral to jazz musicians' ability to hear musical signs as meaningful,
   such as performers' individual backgrounds and the various other styles
   of music available in the aural landscape, and how those parameters
   influence what the musicians play. Several examples from an ongoing
   ethnography of jazz jam sessions suggest that context is constituted by
   several variables, that different variables may become salient at
   different times, and that different interactants vary in their ability
   to attend to these variables. This study thus extends and elaborates
   frame analysis by showing that, while an interaction frame of the sort
   described by Goffman (1974) may perdure, it is subject to change, and
   the nature of the context it provides for interactions can change
   whenever a new interaction is initiated.

AB As genetic model systems, fish have played a key role in our
   understanding of a wide range of biological processes, including
   vertebrate pigmentation. In this review, we focus on one aspect of
   pigmentation, skin pigmentation, which has been of momentous importance
   in human history. Two fish models, medaka and zebrafish, played
   important roles in demystifying skin color and, by extension, the
   concept of "race." Related thinking has the potential to make two
   additional contributions to human welfare. Fish can be used to validate
   gene candidates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in what has
   been called "Systems Genetics." Because fish are familiar vertebrates,
   and share genetic mechanisms of skin color with humans, they also have
   outstanding potential as an educational tool-to "demystify" race, to
   increase public understanding of the role of model systems and evolution
   in science, and to enhance appreciation of both genetic and
   environmental factors that impact human health and society.

AB This paper distinguishes three major "revolutions" in the
   socio-environmental interactions that reflect growth in the extent to
   which human beings invest in and modify their environments. As people
   settled in villages during the Neolithic, interactions between more
   people became an important element in survival strategies, shifting the
   emphasis in survival strategies from mobility to sociality. The
   emergence of cities changed human societies by: i) creating dependencies
   between more and more distant regions, ii) increasing the degree of
   aggregation of human populations, iii) narrowing the range of
   subsistence resources on which people depended, and iv) increasing
   further their investment in the natural environment and in material
   culture. Altogether, urbanization drove human social systems further and
   further away from flexibility and rapid adaptation to environmental
   change, while increasing the demands on the social system, including
   major increases in energy and matter to support urban populations. This
   was achieved by linking together larger and larger hinterlands for these
   cities, in effect creating Empires. The fundamental change is one from
   humans responding to environmental change and disruption by migration to
   humans investing in the environment, and therefore responding to
   environmental change by problem solving. One therefore needs to look at
   the combined socio-environmental systems over the longer term that
   reflect the buildup and culmination of the shifts in the social and
   environmental risk spectra due to the human-environmental interactions
   in periods before the "crisis" occurs, which are a fact of life in any
   society's interaction with its environment, and should be seen as
   "social" challenges rather than "environmental" ones. These are
   generally due to the fact that the society in question has invested so
   much in a particular way of life that it cannot innovate itself out of
   difficulty before time runs out. This implies that we have to shift our
   thinking about socio-environmental issues, from "population thinking" to
   "organization thinking." In this perspective, a crisis does not imply
   the disappearance of the people involved, but a transformation of the
   organization that links them.

AB Modern concerns with climate change often overlook the extensive history
   of both climate change and human adaptation over the millennia. While
   questions of human-climate system causation are important, especially to
   the extent that our current behavior is driving environmental change,
   human societies have experienced multiple climate changes in the past,
   independent of causation. The histories of cultural adaptation to those
   changes can help us understand the dynamic interaction between climate
   and society, expanding the possibilities for "proactive adaptation" that
   may be available to us today. The underlying principles of cultural
   adaptation are generally independent of the source of the climate
   change, and the lessons of the past can suggest social and economic
   paths that can lead toward sustainability and away from collapse.

AB The organization of the meetings of the approximately 50 economics
   associations of the Allied Social Science Associations has evolved over
   the past 140 years, beginning with meetings of the American Social
   Science Association in 1865, which included social scientists from
   political science, history, sociology, and economics. Out of this
   association, the separate disciplines formed their own organizations
   beginning in the 1880s. Though several of these associations continued
   to meet together until the 1930s, each discipline gradually separated
   its meetings from those of the others. During the 1940s, however, other
   newly formed economics associations began meeting at the same time and
   place as the AEA, and the Allied Social Science Associations evolved out
   of these meetings. Though the name of the organization includes "social
   science," the associations meeting together are predominately, if not
   completely, economics associations. These associations, however, profess
   many different approaches to the study of economics. This paper traces
   the evolution of these meetings and attempts to come to some conclusions
   concerning the significance of this association, the most important of
   which is the role of the ASSA in providing a broad and tolerant platform
   and a vehicle through which different points of view toward economic
   theory and policy can be discussed.

   and 1,430 females born between 1840 and 1910 collected as part of the
   Harvard Anthropological Survey of Ireland (1934-1936), this study
   examined the secular changes in postfamine Ireland using several
   socioeconomic variables, including: occupation, migration, education,
   siblings, birthplace, and occupation of father and mother's father.
   Correlations were also calculated between height and various historical
   economic indices. Significant differences in the height of Irish males
   were found by occupation, education, and socioeconomic status of father
   and maternal grandfather. Males employed in agriculture, or whose
   fathers or grandfathers were so employed, were significantly taller than
   other males. For the smaller female sample, only occupation and
   grandfather's socioeconomic status had a significant impact on height.
   An inverse correlation was also found between the British Cost of Living
   Index (BCL) and male heights. Our results suggest that availability of
   resources plays an important role in the overall nutritional status
   reflected in terminal adult height. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 20:726-731, 2008.

AB This article adopts an institutional approach to describe the changing
   secondary market for life insurance in the United States. Since the
   1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers' life insurance
   policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The
   author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three
   conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation,
   and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are
   considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its
   success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about
   markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for
   analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within

AB This study sets out to investigate whether introducing molecular genetic

   sociological insights. The data source is the white male DNA sample in
   the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors'
   empirical gene-environment interaction analysis produces a robust
   protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype
   in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to
   be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having
   sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive
   ability. The genetics-informed sociological analysis here suggests that
   explaining a human trait or behavior may require a theory that
   accommodates the complex interplay between social contextual and
   individual influences and genetic predispositions.

AB Many other areas in the social sciences (e. g., economics, political
   science, and sociology) have devoted considerable research to
   understanding antecedents to national corruption. However, little
   research has explored psychological antecedents-specifically,
   personality measured at an aggregate level. In this study of 54
   countries, the authors examined the independent, combined, and unique
   effects of national personality and G. S. Hofstede's cultural dimensions
   on perceived national corruption. Nations scoring low on neuroticism and
   high on extraversion tended to be less corrupt, and the relationship
   between conscientiousness and corruption was explained by wealth. In
   addition, national personality contributed beyond other cultural,
   economic, and demographic variables predictive of national corruption:
   National personality incremented Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
   national wealth, and national religion. These findings suggest that
   personality at the national level has substantial relations with
   nations' corruption and that these effects merit closer scrutiny by
   researchers and policy makers alike.

   and physical competence as perceived by children and teachers. A survey
   instrument was introduced to enable identification of specific victims
   associated with specific bullies. The sample was 508 fourth and fifth
   grade children from midwest U. S. elementary schools. Results indicated
   that peer- and teacher-perceived popularity were the optimal status
   measures for capturing heterogeneity in bully-victim status imbalances.
   In addition, the gender of victims of male bullying was critical.
   Powerful, popular-aggressive bullies and unpopular victims were found in
   same-sex dyads, but unpopular-aggressive boys were also identified as
   bullying popular girls. All bullies were disliked. Implications are
   drawn for peer sexual harassment and for innovations in sociometric

   to questionnaires asking whom they depended on in six contexts of need.
   These contexts were: morning awakening, physical illness, emotional
   upset, help with homework, causing a problem, and guidance in
   extracurricular activities. Findings indicated that, relative to
   culture, contextual effects exerted an equally if not more powerful
   effect on students' responses. In line with traditional cross-national
   theorizing, U. S. youth were, overall, more self-reliant than their
   Japanese peers. In contrast to such theorizing, U. S. students were more
   interdependent with family, and Japanese students were more
   interdependent with peers, than their counterparts in the other country.
   Furthermore, both Japanese and U. S. youth showed similar age-related
   decreases in interdependence with family and increases in
   interdependence with peers. Results are discussed in terms of active
   dyadic help-seeking versus conceptualized notions of social identity,
   and recent theories of development, culture, and the self.

   observations drawn from the Six Cultures Study - with 612 five-minute
   observations of 23 children (12 girls, 11 boys) from Orchard Town, MA
   and 570 observations of 24 children (12 girls, 12 boys) from Tarong,
   Philippines, ranging in age from 3 to 11 years. Data were coded for
   instances of prosocial behaviors, as well as characteristics of social
   companions (age and relationship to actor). Results revealed several
   interesting findings. First, frequency of children's behaviors varied as
   a function of the age of their social companions. Children generally
   directed the highest number of prosocial behaviors towards infants and
   toddlers, except for younger children's prosocial behaviors towards
   relatives which were directed mostly towards adults. Second, frequency
   of prosocial behaviors varied as a function of kinship, but differently
   for the community groups. Tarong children were generally more prosocial
   towards relatives, while Orchard Town children showed more prosocial
   behaviors towards non-relatives. Results highlight the role of immediate
   contexts in prosocial behaviors of children, and the value of using
   cross-cultural methodology to examine contextual factors in

   strategies (stonewalling, triangulation, verbal aggression, and physical
   aggression) and parenting styles are related to social and physical
   aggression with peers for children followed longitudinally from age 9 to
   10 (N = 256). Parents reported on negative conflict strategies and
   parenting styles at the beginning of the study and teachers rated
   children's social and physical aggression with peers when children were
   in the 3rd and 4th grades. Structural equation modeling demonstrated
   that, for girls, mothers' negative interparental conflict strategies
   were positively associated with both social and physical aggression with
   peers. Mothers' negative conflict strategies were not related to boys'
   social and physical aggression at school, fathers' negative conflict
   strategies were not related to aggression for either gender, and no
   relations emerged for parenting styles. These results offer partial
   support for a same-gender modeling hypothesis and suggest that girls'
   social and physical aggression at school may be related to watching
   mothers resolve marital disputes by engaging in triangulation,
   stonewalling, and verbal and physical aggression with partners.

   of particles accumulated in the covering patina that includes calcite,
   dolomite, quartz and feldspar grains, iron oxides, Carbon ash particles,
   microorganisms, and gold globules (1-4 mu m in diameter). There are two
   types of patina present: thin layers of a black to orange-brown, iron
   oxide-rich patina, a product of micro-biogenetical activity, as well as
   a light beige patina mainly composed of carbonates, quartz and feldspar
   grains. The patina covers the rock Surfaces and inscription grooves
   post-dating the incised inscription as well as a fissure that runs
   across the stone and several of the engraved letters. Accelerator Mass
   Spectrometry (AMS) analyses of the carbon particles in the patina yields
   a calibrated radiocarbon age of 2340-2150 Cal BP and a conventional
   radiocarbon age of 2250 +/- 40 years BP. The presence of microcolonial
   fungi and associated pitting indicates slow growth over many years. The
   occurrence of pure gold globules is evidence of melting (above 1000
   degrees C) indicates a thermal event. This study supports the antiquity
   of the patina, which in turn, strengthens the contention that the

   for the field. Forty-five English-language cross-sectional and
   longitudinal studies that analysed the effect of at least one
   neighbourhood-level variable on either depression or depressive symptoms
   were analysed. Of the 45 studies, 37 reported associations of at least

   Seven of the 10 longitudinal studies reported associations of at least
   one neighbourhood characteristic with incident depression. Socioeconomic
   composition was the most common neighbourhood characteristic
   investigated. The associations of depressive symptoms/depression with
   structural features (socioeconomic and racial composition, stability and
   built environment) were less consistent than with social processes
   (disorder, social interactions, violence). Among the structural
   features, measures of the built environment were the most consistently
   associated with depression but the number of studies was small. The
   extent to which these associations reflect causal processes remains to
   be determined. The large variability in studies across neighbourhood
   definitions and measures, adjustment variables and study populations
   makes it difficult to draw more than a few general qualitative
   conclusions. Improving the quality of observational work through
   improved measurement of neighbourhood attributes, more sophisticated
   consideration of spatial scale, longitudinal designs and evaluation of
   natural experiments will strengthen inferences regarding causal effects
   of area attributes on depression.

AB We take a fresh look at an important question in the sociology of gender
   and family: Do single fathers "mother"? We add to the theoretical debate
   by proposing that single fathers face competing interactional pressures,
   to simultaneously act like mothers and men. Using nationally
   representative data from the American Time Use Survey 2003 - 2006 (N =
   16,654), we compare the time single fathers spend on child care to other
   parent types, paying special attention to differences in employment
   profiles, household composition, and care arrangements. Accounting for
   these differences, single fathers spend slightly less time caring for
   children than do mothers, but more time than married fathers.
   Interesting differences emerge, however, depending upon the age of the
   youngest child in the household.

AB This article presents a theoretical framework for the study of social
   and behavioral factors associated with elder self-neglect. The model
   presented reflects the authors' beliefs that a risk-vulnerability model
   offers a useful framework from which to study all forms of elder
   mistreatment, as well as elder self-neglect. This model has particular
   utility, because it can begin to define the elements of risk and
   vulnerability that may be addressed using preventative measures as
   opposed to solely addressing intervention, which is often the case when
   addressing elder mistreatment and self-neglect. The authors then address
   a method for using the Consortium for Research in Elder Self-neglect of
   Texas data as currently constructed and adding to that database to
   effectively study risks and vulnerabilities in the elder self-neglect
   population. These additional data would greatly expand the scope of the
   study. The discussant adds his perspective to the ideas proposed by the

AB Compared with late prehistoric archaeological sites attributed to the

   indicating that hide processing for trade with French voyageurs became a

   understood about how market demand for hides and other animal byproducts
   altered Wichita social organization, if at all. In this article we
   investigate polygyny We examine the hypothesis that in household
   economies where production depends on women contributions, market
   integration intensifies demand on female labor: Where polygyny is
   practiced, market integration increases the number of wives sought by
   males, leading to larger families. We compare ethnological data and
   Blackfoot accounts of polygyny with ethnohistorical and ethnographic
   information concerning the Wichita. We then review protohistoric Wichita
   documentary and archaeological data to discuss their strengths and
   weaknesses for identifying these social and economic changes.

AB Background
   Can political controversy have a "chilling effect'' on the production of
   new science? This is a timely concern, given how often American
   politicians are accused of undermining science for political purposes.
   Yet little is known about how scientists react to these kinds of
   controversies.
   Methods and Findings
   Drawing on interview (n = 30) and survey data (n = 82), this study
   examines the reactions of scientists whose National Institutes of Health
   (NIH)-funded grants were implicated in a highly publicized political
   controversy. Critics charged that these grants were "a waste of taxpayer
   money.'' The NIH defended each grant and no funding was rescinded.
   Nevertheless, this study finds that many of the scientists whose grants
   were criticized now engage in self-censorship. About half of the sample
   said that they now remove potentially controversial words from their
   grant and a quarter reported eliminating entire topics from their
   research agendas. Four researchers reportedly chose to move into more
   secure positions entirely, either outside academia or in jobs that
   guaranteed salaries. About 10% of the group reported that this
   controversy strengthened their commitment to complete their research and
   disseminate it widely.
   Conclusions
   These findings provide evidence that political controversies can shape
   what scientists choose to study. Debates about the politics of science
   usually focus on the direct suppression, distortion, and manipulation of
   scientific results. This study suggests that scholars must also examine
   how scientists may self-censor in response to political events.

AB We extend Fine's (2003) model of 'peopled ethnography' for studying
   small groups to the study of larger social units, including
   organizations and communities. While studies of small groups often
   recognize the presence of macro-level social structures, they typically
   treat these as backdrops to the interaction scene which constrain and
   enable group life, not as units of analysis in their own right. Yet
   small groups are embedded in and help constitute larger units of
   analysis, such as organizations and communities. We argue that studies
   of these larger social structures can be extended beyond ethnographic
   observation of the interactions that help comprise them, making peopled
   ethnography applicable to units of analysis larger than the small group.
   We offer illustrative examples of organizational and community
   ethnographies.

AB This article retrieves part of our historical past to address two
   omissions in American feminist sociology on the subject of global
   imperialism. The first section addresses the inadequate attention
   feminist sociologists have paid to how major leaders of the women's
   movement responded to U. S. overseas expansion in the late nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries. It documents how these early feminists
   had both progressive and reactionary responses to the anti-imperialist
   struggles of their era. Particular emphasis is given to how issues of
   race, class, and gender were interwoven in their discourses on
   imperialism.
   The second section focuses on how the writings of the most famous woman
   theorist and critic of imperialism during this era-Rosa Luxemburg-are
   virtually ignored in U. S. portrayals of feminist sociology and women
   founders of sociology. To address this omission, Luxemburg's theory of
   imperialism is examined, as well as how it has influenced contemporary
   global feminist works. A critical analysis of these Luxemburg-inspired
   works considers their implications for understanding global imperialism
   today. In this way, the past is used to clarify the present.

AB The year 1974 marked a rupture in the study of labor. It was the year in
   which Harry Braverman's Labor and Monopoly Capital was published, making
   a break with a moribund industrial sociology. It was a rupture inspired
   by the resurgence of Marxism, critical of the euphoric sociology of the
   1950s. Since 1974, labor studies have undergone a mutation, shifting
   their focus from the examination of the labor process to an engagement
   with the labor movement. What explains this in light of the continuing
   assault on labor and the decline of overall union density? The answer
   lies with the transformation of the labor movement itself-the demise of
   the old industrial, business unionism and the growing strength of New
   Labor with its orientation to the service sector, to immigrant and
   vulnerable workers, and its invention of novel organizing strategies. In
   New Labor, sociologists have found a new public.

AB As the US population continues to grow and diversify, there is a need
   for progressive physical activity measurement and cross-cultural
   research. Studies suggest that US Latinos are among the most sedentary
   of ethnic groups compared to others; however, study findings may be
   biased given that some measures may not be culturally sensitive for
   assessing behaviors that are not characterized as leisure time physical
   activity.
   The primary objective of this review was to identify and evaluate
   measures used to quantify physical activity among US Latinos.
   A review of the literature was performed and studies examining levels of
   physical activity among Spanish and English speaking Latinos were
   documented. This process involved identifying existing guidelines for
   the purpose of culturally adapting and/or translating (into Spanish)
   physical activity measures for the Latino population. These guidelines
   were used as the minimal criteria for the evaluation of the 13
   identified measures of physical activity.
   Of these 13 measures, four were available in English and nine were
   available in Spanish. One English measure met the guidelines for being
   culturally adapted for assessing physical activity among Latinos. There
   were no Spanish measures that met all the guidelines for physical
   activity assessment among Spanish-speaking Latinos. Lastly, the
   identified guidelines for developing culturally appropriate measures
   were improved to advance physical activity measurement among ethnic and
   cultural groups.
   Future research should merit the use of culturally appropriate
   guidelines to increase the understanding of physical activity patterns
   in the USA.

   two conditions were met. First, most peaceful islands had populations
   under about 1,000 people. Second, within this group, the most peaceful
   societies were those located more than 100 km from their nearest
   neighbor. The mechanisms by which peace was maintained in small
   societies included some measure of egalitarianism and direct
   representation in decision making, a rigorous program of individual
   sanctions of antisocial behavior, a network of gift-generated mutual
   obligation, and a strong kinship network. Interpersonal violence and
   warfare were correlated in Polynesia, but rather than interpersonal
   violence creating a foundation for war, it would appear that warfare
   socialized violence within the society. Given the wide range of violence
   in Polynesian societies, all of which shared a common heritage, conflict
   appears to have been a cultural response to the geographic and
   environmental conditions in which a society found itself.

AB BACKGROUND: Research on neighborhood effects increasingly includes the
   influences of the built environment on health and social well-being.
   OBJECTIVES: In this population-based study in a low-socioeconomic-status
   (SES), Hispanic neighborhood, we examined whether architectural features
   of the built environment theorized to promote direct observations and
   interactions (e.g., porches, stoops) predicted Hispanic elders' social
   support and psychological and physical functioning.
   METHODS: We coded built-environment features for all 3,857 lots in the
   403-block area of an urban Miami, Florida, community. We then conducted
   three annual assessments of social support, psychological distress, and
   physical functioning in a population-based sample of 273 low-SES
   Hispanic elders (70-100 years of age). We used structural equation
   modeling analytic techniques to examine hypothesized relationships
   between the built environment and elders' social support, psychological
   distress, and physical functioning over a 3-year period.
   RESULTS: After controlling for age, sex, and income, architectural
   features of the built environment theorized to facilitate visual and
   social contact had a significant direct relationship with elders'
   physical functioning as measured 3 years later, and an indirect
   relationship through social support and psychological distress. Further
   binomial regression analyses suggested that elders living on blocks
   marked by low levels of positive front entrance features were 2.7 times

AB A United States sample of 166 transgender adults including 50
   male-to-females (MTFs). 52 female-to-males (FTMs), and 64 genderqueers
   (neither completely female nor completely male), were surveyed about
   identity development, levels of disclosure of transgender status, and
   relationship to community. There was no difference among transgender
   groups in age of first experiencing oneself differently from assigned
   birth sex. MTFs first identified as other than their assigned sex
   earlier than FTMs. However, they did not present themselves to others in
   a gender-congruent way until much later than FTMs. MTFs were less likely
   to disclose their gender identity to their parents than were FTMs.
   Disclosure of assigned birth sex was more common among younger
   participants. There was no difference in the extent to which individuals
   felt connected to the transgender community. Genderqueers felt more
   connected to the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community than did MTFs or
   FTMs. Implications for health care professionals and transgender
   communities are discussed.

AB Background: The use of race as a variable in research continues to spark
   debate about whether it should be used, as well as the implications it
   has for research on health differences. Given this continued
   controversy, we examined how investigators interpret the concept of
   "race" and whether their views of race are reflected in their published
   work.
   Methods: Thirty-three semistructured interviews were conducted with
   investigators from 3 southeastern universities to discuss recruitment of
   participants, the use of race as a variable in research and analyses,
   and their assessment of the National Institutes of Health mandate on the
   inclusion of women and minorities. The interview data were analyzed
   using the principles of constant comparative method, theme
   identification and pattern investigation. Up to 2 publications for each
   respondent were also used to assess the use of race in their research.
   Results: Results reflect a spectrum of views on the definition of race,
   from biological to social. Findings also suggest that investigators
   think critically about the use and implications of using race in their
   research, although this is not consistently reflected in their published
   work.
   Conclusion: In our view, authors, journal editors and peer reviewers
   have an important role in moving this debate forward, and advocate that
   they engage more directly in shaping the process. When reporting results
   by race, investigators should provide a statement on the theory or
   conceptual framework underlying the hypothesized racial differences in
   health examined in the study. They should be also cautious in invoking
   either biological or social constructions of race, thus demonstrating an
   appreciation of the nuances and implications of using this variable.

AB The mean age of the human population is steadily increasing in many
   areas around the globe, a phenomenon with large social, political,
   economic and biological/medical implications. Inevitably, this
   phenomenon is stimulating great interest in understanding and
   potentially modulating the process of human aging. To foster
   interactions and collaboration between diverse scientists interested in
   the biochemical, physiological, epidemiological and psychosocial aspects
   of aging, The University of Copenhagen Faculty of Health Sciences
   recently organized and co-sponsored a workshop entitled Aging-From
   Molecules to Populations. The following questions about human aging were
   discussed at the workshop: What is the limit of human life expectancy?
   What are the key indicators of human aging? What are the key drivers of
   human aging? Which genes have the greatest impact on human aging? How
   similar is aging-related cognitive decline to pathological cognitive
   decline associated with neurological disease? Are human progeriod
   diseases, characterized by premature aging, good models for "normal"
   human aging? Is delayed or "elite" aging informative about "normal"
   human aging? To what extent and by what mechanisms do early life
   environmental factors influence aging-associated physical and cognitive
   decline? To what extent and by what mechanism does the social
   environment influence life course outcomes? What physiological factors
   underlie the timing and extent of aging-associated physical and
   cognitive decline? How do cultural stereotypes and perceptions of aging
   influence the process and experience of aging? One of the primary
   outcomes of the workshop was a recognition that cross-disciplinary
   studies and "out-of-the-box" approaches, especially those that adopt an
   integrated life course perspective on human health status, are needed to
   expedite advances in aging research. This and other outcomes of the
   workshop are summarized and discussed in this report.

AB In this paper we provide an empirically-based way to address the general
   question of the broad-scale spatial relationship between poverty
   Occurrence and areas of interest to those seeking conservation of large
   wild areas. We address the question of the spatial relationship between
   poor people and areas less impacted by human activity by asking three
   questions about the global spatial relationship between poor people and
   ecological intactness and how it varies by major biome and geographical
   region. We use infant mortality rate as a proxy for poverty and the
   Human Footprint as a proxy for ecological intactness, comparing global
   terrestrial maps of both. The analysis shows that the vast majority of
   the world's poor people live in extremely urban and very transformed
   (peri-transformed) areas. Only a small percentage of the world's most
   poor are found in areas that are somewhat or extremely wild: about 0.25%
   of the world's population. This fact has implications for the calls
   being made for conservation organizations to Undertake poverty
   alleviation, suggesting that at a global scale those groups with
   interest in conserving Wild areas would be able to contribute little to
   globally significant poverty alleviation efforts. However, these
   conservation groups are well positioned to develop new partnerships for
   delivery of benefits to some of the least accessible poor people in the
   wildest places of the World.

AB Researchers in sociology, medicine, and religion ask whether prayer
   influences health, but pay little attention to the content or experience
   of personal prayer. This paper draws insights from cognitive studies of
   religion to ask what kinds of requests people make of God in their
   prayers, how they construct God in their prayers, and what kinds of
   responses they believe possible from God based on how they frame their
   prayers. We analyze the prayers patients, visitors, and staff wrote in a
   prayer book at the Johns Hopkins University Hospital between 1999 and
   2005. Prayers are primarily written to thank God (21.8%), to make
   requests of God (28%), or to both thank and petition God (27.5%). The
   majority of prayer writers imagine a God who is accessible, listening,
   and a source of emotional and psychological support. Rather than
   focusing on specific discrete outcomes that could be falsified, writers
   tend to frame their prayers broadly in abstract psychological language
   that allows them to make multiple interpretations of the results of
   their prayers. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Studies of children and childhood are increasingly common but little is
   known about children and religion and specifically about the mechanisms
   by which religious socialization happens. This paper takes a dynamic
   approach to the study of religion and childhood and considers how
   children via their role as audience might help reflect and shape adult
   culture and religiosity. Through the lens Of Cultural sociology, the
   paper examines 19th century Sunday school books as cultural products and
   seeks to answer two fundamental questions: what can the content and form
   of materials produced for use by children tell LIS about "adult"
   religion and culture? and what does religion tell us about childhood as
   a social category? Content analysis of a sample of 100 Sunday school
   books published in the 19th century provides evidence that adults engage
   in boundary work to separate adults from children and the religious from
   the secular. Religion is presented in a child-specific format. This
   suggests both that adult religion is malleable and domain specific and
   that childhood is both a distinct stage in the life course and a social
   category. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB As a discipline, sociology has produced a rich understanding of social
   processes, and yet the pedagogical implications of this scholarship
   remain largely untapped. In this paper, we employ a framework of
   sociology as pedagogy to show how sociology can enhance and inform
   teaching and learning. We select examples from a range of classical and
   contemporary social thought to highlight the connection between
   sociological theory and the practices of teaching and learning. We use
   these theories to demonstrate a broad application of our notion of
   sociology as pedagogy, however, we believe that all sociological
   knowledge can be mined for its pedagogical significance. Furthermore,
   recognizing how sociological phenomena shape the classroom experience is
   conducive to a more reflexive pedagogy in line with the tenets of the
   sociological imagination.

AB Critical thinking is often presented as a generic technique. This
   article develops an alternative that links critique more closely to the
   sociological perspective. I suggest three answers to the above question:
   that the sociological perspective is critical for comprehending complex
   issues, that all sociology is implicitly critical by virtue of its
   debunking tendency, and that some sociology is explicitly critical by
   virtue of value commitments that lead to a critique of domination. The
   article identifies some basic themes of what it means to think
   sociologically, discusses sociology's "double critique" in more detail,
   illustrates the critical potential of scientific, humanistic and
   critical approaches to sociology, and explores some implications of this
   approach for how we teach sociology. It concludes by suggesting that the
   goal of fostering critical thinking in our students might better be met
   by returning to the critical roots of our own discipline.

AB This study uses a quasi-experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of
   Internet videoconferencing technology. The instructor used a laptop,
   webcam, highspeed DSL connection, and Polycom (TM) Viewstation to teach
   a course unit of introductory sociology from a remote location to an
   experimental group of students in a large multimedia classroom. The same
   instructor taught a control group of introductory sociology students
   without videoconferencing. The groups were compared using exam scores,
   attendance, classroom observations, and student evaluations. The use of
   Internet videoconferencing did not affect exam scores or attendance.
   However, it substantially lowered student evaluation scores. In
   comparison to classroom-based instruction and due to problems with and
   limitations of the technology, students experienced greater difficulty
   communicating with the instructor, felt more separated, and were less
   engaged in the course. Therefore, they perceived the instructor's
   teaching to be less effective, and evaluations reflected lower scores,
   thereby "punishing" the instructor. Symbolic interactionism is used to
   interpret the results. This research is compared and contrasted with a
   previous study conducted by one of the authors (Koeber 2005), also
   published in Teaching Sociology, which yielded opposite results. In
   Koeber's study the instructor was rewarded with favorable student
   evaluations for the use of new technology that enhanced engagement. We
   conclude that when instructors choose whether or not to use Internet
   videoconferencing, they must weigh the potential benefits associated
   with bridging distance gaps versus potential costs associated with
   reduction in quantity and quality of symbolic interaction that may cause
   students to disengage.

AB Although a central construct for sociologists, the concept of
   institution continues to elude clear and full specification. One reason
   for this lack of clarity is that about 50 years ago empirical
   researchers in the field of sociology turned their gaze downward, away
   from macro-sociological constructs in order to focus their attention on
   middle-range empirical projects. It took almost 20 years for the concept
   of the institution to work its back onto the empirical research agenda
   of mainstream sociologists. The new institutional project in
   organizational sociology led the way. Since then, scholars in this
   tradition have achieved a great deal but there is still much more to
   accomplish. Here, future directions for research are considered by
   reviewing how the concept of the institution has come to be treated by
   mainstream philosophers, sociologists of science and technology studies,
   and social network theorists.

AB Context Many medical schools assert that a racially and ethnically
   diverse student body is an important element in educating physicians to
   meet the needs of a diverse society. However, there is limited evidence
   addressing the educational effects of student body racial diversity.
   Objective To determine whether student body racial and ethnic diversity
   is associated with diversity- related outcomes among US medical
   students.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A Web- based survey ( Graduation
   Questionnaire) administered by the Association of American Medical
   Colleges of 20 112 graduating medical students ( 64% of all graduating
   students in 2003 and 2004) from 118 allopathic medical schools in the
   United States. Historically black and Puerto Rican medical schools were
   excluded.
   Main Outcome Measures Students' self- rated preparedness to care for
   patients from other racial and ethnic backgrounds, attitudes about
   equity and access to care, and intent to practice in an underserved
   area.
   Results White students within the highest quintile for student body
   racial and ethnic diversity, measured by the proportion of
   underrepresented minority ( URM) students, were more likely to rate
   themselves as highly prepared to care for minority populations than
   those in the lowest diversity quintile ( 61.1% vs 53.9%, respectively; P
   <. 001; adjusted odds ratio [ OR], 1.33; 95% confidence interval [ CI],
   1.13- 1.57). This association was strongest in schools in which students
   perceived a positive climate for interracial interaction. White students
   in the highest URM quintile were also more likely to have strong
   attitudes endorsing equitable access to care ( 54.8% vs 44.2%,
   respectively; P <. 001; adjusted OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15- 1.74). For
   nonwhite students, after adjustment there were no significant
   associations between student body URM proportions and diversity- related
   outcomes. Student body URM proportions were not associated with white or
   nonwhite students' plans to practice in underserved communities,
   although URM students were substantially more likely than white or
   nonwhite/ non- URM students to plan to serve the underserved ( 48.7% vs
   18.8% vs 16.2%, respectively; P <. 001).
   Conclusion Student body racial and ethnic diversity within US medical
   schools is associated with outcomes consistent with the goal of
   preparing students to meet the needs of a diverse population.

   CI], 1.20- 2.56), were attending a private school ( OR, 1.88; 95% CI,
   1.26- 2.83), were favorably impressed with their educational experience
   in IM ( OR, 4.57; 95% CI, 3.01- 6.93), reported favorable feelings about
   caring for IM patients ( OR, 8.72; 95% CI, 6.03- 12.62), or reported a
   favorable impression of internists' lifestyle ( OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.39-
   2.87).
   Conclusions Medical students valued the teaching during IM clerkships
   but expressed serious reservations about IM as a career. Students who
   reported more favorable impressions of the patients cared for by
   internists, the IM practice environment, and internists' lifestyle were
   more likely to pursue a career in IM.

AB Efforts to monitor, investigate, and ultimately eliminate health
   disparities across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups can benefit
   greatly from spatiotemporal models that enable exploration of spatial
   and temporal variation in health. Hierarchical Bayes methods are
   well-established tools in the statistical literature for fitting such
   models, as they permit smoothing of unstable small-area rates. However,
   issues presented by 'real-life' surveillance data can be a barrier to
   routine use of these models by epidemiologists. These include (I)
   shifting of regional boundaries over time, (2) social inequalities in
   racial/ethnic residential segregation, which imply differential spatial
   Structuring across different racial/ethnic groups, and (3) heavy
   computational burdens for large spatiotemporal data sets. Using data
   from a study of changing socioeconomic gradients in female breast cancer
   incidence in two population-based cancer registries covering the San
   Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles County, CA (1988-2002), we illustrate
   a two-stage approach to modeling health disparities and census tract
   (CT) variation in incidence over time. In the first stage. we fit race-
   and year-specific spatial models using CT boundaries normalized to the
   U.S. Census 2000. In stage 2, temporal patterns in the race- and
   year-specific estimates of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic effects are
   explored using a variety of methods. Our approach provides a
   straightforward means of fitting spatiotemporal models in large data
   sets, while highlighting differences in spatial patterning across
   racial/ethnic population and across time. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley

AB The quest to determine how cooperation evolves can be based on
   evolutionary game theory, in spite of the fact that evolutionarily
   stable strategies (ESS) for most non-zero-sum games are not cooperative.
   We analyse the evolution of cooperation for a family of evolutionary
   games involving shared costs and benefits with a continuum of strategies
   from non-cooperation to total cooperation. This cost-benefit game allows
   the cooperator to share in the benefit of a cooperative act, and the
   recipient to be burdened with a share of the cooperator's cost. The
   cost-benefit game encompasses the Prisoner's Dilemma, Snowdrift game and
   Partial Altruism. The models produce ESS solutions of total cooperation,
   partial cooperation, noncooperation and coexistence between cooperation
   and non-cooperation. Cooperation emerges from an interplay between the
   nonlinearities in the cost and benefit functions. If benefits increase
   at a decelerating rate and costs increase at an accelerating rate with
   the degree of cooperation, then the ESS has an intermediate level of
   cooperation. The game also exhibits non-ESS points such as unstable
   minima, convergent-stable minima and unstable maxima. The emergence of
   cooperative behaviour in this game represents enlightened self-interest,
   whereas non-cooperative solutions illustrate the Tragedy of the Commons.
   Games having either a stable maximum or a stable minimum have the
   property that small changes in the incentive structure (model parameter
   values) or culture (starting frequencies of strategies) result in
   correspondingly small changes in the degree of cooperation. Conversely,
   with unstable maxima or unstable minima, small changes in the incentive
   structure or culture can result in a switch from noncooperation to total
   cooperation (and vice versa). These solutions identify when human or
   animal societies have the potential for cooperation and whether
   cooperation is robust or fragile.

AB Theory predicts that individuals living in fission-fusion societies, in
   which group members frequently change subgroups, should modify grouping
   patterns in response to varying social and environmental conditions.
   Spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta, are long- lived carnivores that reside
   in permanent social groups called clans. Clans are complex,
   fission-fusion societies in which individual members travel, rest and
   forage in subgroups that frequently change composition. We studied two
   clans in Kenya to provide the first detailed description of
   fission-fusion dynamics in this species. Because social and ecological
   circumstances can influence the cohesiveness of animal societies, we
   evaluated the extent to which specific circumstances promote the
   formation of subgroups of various sizes. We found that cooperative
   defence of shared resources during interclan competition and protection
   from lions were cohesive forces that promoted formation of large
   subgroups. We also tested hypotheses suggesting factors limiting
   subgroup size. Mothers with small cubs avoided conspecifics, thereby
   reducing infanticide risk. Victims of aggression either reconciled
   fights or separated from former opponents to reduce the immediate costs
   of escalated aggression in the absence of food. As predicted by the
   ecological constraints hypothesis, hyaenas adjusted their grouping
   patterns over both short and long time scales in response to feeding
   competition. Crocuta were most gregarious during periods of abundant
   prey, joined clanmates at ephemeral kills in numbers that correlated
   with the energetic value of the prey and gained the most energy when
   foraging alone because cooperative hunting attracted numerous
   competitors. Overall, our findings indicate that resource limitation
   constrains grouping in this species. (C) 2008 The Association for the

AB Males can affect the number of times females mate by inducing resistance
   to remating. We investigated the associations between male courtship
   behaviour and female remating frequencies using three species of the
   parasitoid wasp Nasonia. We tested females for remating at 10 min and 24
   h after the first copulation and found that species differences in
   female remating frequencies were associated with different first male
   behaviours. Nasonia vitripennis females showed the highest average
   frequency of remating, greater than 75% for all tests, and females that
   did not remate had experienced long first courtships, suggesting that
   they were generally resistant to courtship. In N. longicornis, the two
   populations tested had a two-fold and significant difference in female
   remating frequency, from 45 to 90%, but we could not identify any
   first-male behaviour that was significantly associated with this
   difference. Fewer than 35% of N. giraulti females remated 10 min after
   the first copulation, but remating increased to about 70% in the 24 h
   tests. In N. giraulti longer postcopulatory displays by the first male
   were associated with a higher chance of female remating. These three
   species are closely related, but male behaviours that appear to
   manipulate female remating differ between them. The divergence may have
   evolved as a consequence of sexual conflict over different reproductive
   optima for each species. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of

AB The fringe-lipped bat, Trachops cirrhosus, uses frog mating calls to
   detect and locate its prey. The tungara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus, a
   preferred prey species of this bat, produces two types of sexual
   advertisement calls, simple and complex, and both female frogs and
   predatory bats prefer complex calls to simple ones. Complex calls differ
   from simple ones in that they contain chucks: short, broadband suffixes
   with distinct onsets and offsets, acoustic properties that should
   maximize binaural comparisons and facilitate localization. We
   investigated the hypothesis that frog-eating bats prefer the complex
   calls of tungara frogs to simple ones because they find complex calls
   easier to localize. We tested bats under experimental conditions that
   mirror the conditions they encounter in nature: we broadcast tungara
   frog calls with and without background noise and with and without
   intervening obstacles. We broadcast calls either continuously during the
   hunting approach or only prior to the bat's flight to mimic the
   conditions under which frogs have detected an approaching bat and ceased
   calling. Bats showed a trend for better localization performance of
   complex calls than of simple ones under all treatment conditions. We
   found significant differences in localization performance in some but
   not all levels of localization task complexity. This study is the first
   to offer evidence that an eavesdropping predator shows better
   localization performance for a preferred signal variant of its prey. (C)

AB The temperate comb-footed spider, Anelosimus studiosus, shows a social
   behaviour polymorphism: individuals may defend asocial nests against
   intrusion by conspecifics or cooperate with them in multifemale nests. A
   suite of behavioural traits, including response to predators and prey,
   degree of superfluous killing, exploratory behaviour and general level
   of activity, was examined in laboratory trials to: (1) establish the
   extent to which these traits are correlated with social phenotype and
   (2) explore the potential adaptive value of this trait suite to the
   respective asocial and social phenotypes. Populations from the two
   latitudes studied, 26 degrees and 36 degrees, showed similar suites of
   correlated traits or syndromes. The individuals tested generally fell
   into two groups in the behavioural trials, although the asocial
   individuals from the mixed-phenotype population at 36 degrees latitude
   were intermediate with respect to some of the measures. Individuals
   scored as 'social' generally showed less aggressive behaviour towards
   predatory cues, were less responsive to prey encountering their webs,
   showed little evidence of superfluous killing of prey and showed lower
   levels of activity than did most individuals scored as 'asocial'. These
   results suggest linkage or pleiotropy between social behaviour and these
   traits. The behaviour of individuals in staged, mixed-phenotype feeding
   pairs indicated that social individuals may suffer fitness consequences
   in polymorphic populations. These results are discussed with respect to
   the stability and dynamics of the respective phenotypes in polymorphic
   populations. The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Examination of the reproductive success of cooperative breeders can
   provide insights into costs and benefits of group living. We tested two
   hypotheses proposed to account for group living in prairie voles. One
   hypothesis suggests that ecological constraints such as the lack of
   available territories may cause delayed dispersal leading to formation
   of groups. The other hypothesis suggests that benefits of group living
   outweigh the benefits of dispersal. If the benefits of group living
   outweigh the costs, then per capita reproductive success should increase
   with increasing group size. If ecological constraints prevent dispersal,
   then lifetime reproductive success may not differ in groups of different
   sizes, or there may be an inverse relationship between per capita
   lifetime reproductive success and group size. We also investigated
   whether food supplementation (higher-quality habitat) and the number of
   breeding females per group influenced lifetime reproductive success.
   During two summers, we monitored reproductive success of
   food-supplemented and unsupplemented populations of prairie voles in 0.1
   ha enclosures. Live trapping allowed us to identify residents of
   breeding units. We found that per capita reproductive success increased
   with group size in food-supplemented populations. This result was not
   due to the presence of additional breeding females since per capita
   production of offspring decreased in groups with larger numbers of
   breeding females. Thus, larger groups may benefit the breeding female,
   but the presence of additional breeding females per group appears
   costly. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

AB Previous work has found that adult female brown-headed cowbirds, who do
   not sing, shape male vocal structure when in restricted housing. The
   present work extends this finding to a flock setting to examine the role
   of social behaviour in shaping male vocal development. We housed
   juvenile males with either adult or juvenile females in large flocks.
   Over the course of a year, we recorded their song and social behaviour.
   We found in early autumn that juvenile males housed with adult females
   improvised more song elements than males housed with juvenile females.
   During late autumn, we switched the males across female age-class
   conditions for 6 days. The males switched to the adult female flocks
   increased the number of improvised elements in their vocal repertoires.
   Analysis of the sequences of female-male social contact revealed that
   juvenile females, but not adult females, interacted indiscriminately
   with the males. Social network measures such as betweenness and
   closeness centrality further showed that adult females are more
   selective in their interactions with males than juvenile females. This
   study suggests a systemic role for selective social behaviour in shaping
   male vocal development. (C) 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal

   different research traditions, including the cognitive-developmental,
   domain, two orientations, three ethics, and moral identity traditions.
   The paper introduces a conception termed a cultural-developmental
   template. The template charts developmental patterns across the life
   course for moral reasoning in terms of the three Ethics of Autonomy,
   Community, and Divinity. The template, however, is not
   one-size-fits-all. Its general developmental patterns accommodate to the
   different constellations of Ethics held by culturally diverse peoples.
   From the present theoretical proposal follows a set of specific research
   expectations as well as a set of broader research implications for how
   to conduct research on morality from the vantage points of both culture
   and development. These expectations and implications include
   consideration of moral emotions, definitions of morality, and cultural
   variation in the life course itself. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Objective. To determine if neighborhood socioeconomic Status (SES) is
   independently related to physical and mental health Outcomes in systemic
   lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods. Data derived from the first 3 waves of the Lupus Outcomes
   Study, a telephone survey of 957 patients with confirmed SLE diagnoses,
   recruited from clinical and non-clinical sources. Residential addresses
   were geocoded to U.S. Census block groups. Outcome measures included the
   Systemic Lupus Activity Questionnaire (SLAQ) score, a self-reported
   assessment of SLE symptoms; the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36
   Health Survey physical functioning scored and Center for Epidemiologic
   Studies-Depression (CES-D) score of >= 19 points. Multivariate analyses
   adjusted for race/ethnicity and other demographic and health-related
   covariates.
   Results. After adjustment, lower individual SES, measured by education,
   household income, or poverty status, was associated with all outcomes.
   In models that did not include individual SES, low neighborhood SES (>
   30% of residents in poverty) was also associated with Poor outcomes.
   After adjustment for individual SES, demographic, and health-related
   covariates, only CES-D >= 19 remained associated with neighborhood SES:
   47% [95% confidence interval (CI) 38-56%] versus 35% (95% CI 32-37%).
   Conclusion. Individual SES is associated with physical and mental health
   outcomes in persons with SLE. Low neighborhood SES contributes
   independently to high levels of depressive symptoms. Future research
   should focus On mechanisms underlying these differences.

AB Background In rural India, most births take place in the home, where
   high-risk care practices are common. We developed an intervention of
   behaviour change management, with a focus on prevention of hypothermia,
   aimed at modifying practices and reducing neonatal mortality.
   Methods We did a cluster-randomised controlled efficacy trial in
   Shivgarh, a rural area in Uttar Pradesh. 39 village administrative units
   (population 104123) were allocated to one of three groups: a control
   group, which received the usual services of governmental and
   non-governmental organisations in the area; an intervention group, which
   received a preventive package of interventions for essential newborn
   care (birth preparedness, clean delivery and cord care, thermal care
   [including skin-to-skin care], breastfeeding promotion, and danger sign
   recognition); or another intervention group, which received the package
   of essential newborn care plus use of a liquid crystal hypothermia
   indicator (ThermoSpot). In the intervention clusters, community health
   workers delivered the packages via collective meetings and two antenatal
   and two postnatal household visitations. Outcome measures included
   changes in newborn-care practices and neonatal mortality rate compared
   with the control group. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study
   is registered as International Standard Randomised Control Trial, number
   NCT00198653.
   Findings Improvements in birth preparedness, hygienic delivery, thermal
   care (including skin-to-skin care), umbilical cord care, skin care, and
   breastfeeding were seen in intervention arms. There was little change in
   care-seeking. Compared with controls, neonatal mortality rate was
   reduced by 54% in the essential newborn-care intervention (rate ratio 0
   . 46 [95% CI 0 . 35-0.60], p<0 . 0001) and by 52% in the essential
   newborn care plus ThermoSpot arm (0.48 [95% Cl 0 . 35-0.66], p<0 .
   0001).
   Interpretation A socioculturally contextualised, community-based
   intervention, targeted at high-risk newborn-care practices, can lead to
   substantial behavioural modification and reduction in neonatal
   mortality. This approach can be applied to behaviour change along the
   continuum of care, harmonise vertical interventions, and build community
   capacity for sustained development.

   Israeli/Palestinian war is deflected onto the landscape and how this
   deflection erodes the boundary between law and war. Dealing with issues
   of colonization, nationalization, and the way that these implicate
   landscape as a "natural alibi," the article examines the intricate
   making of politics into nature. Further, it explores the ironic nesting
   of colonial processes from Ottoman, to British, to Zionist, and finally
   to the new Jewish settler society that seeks to unsettle the old
   colonial landscapes of this place. Utilizing a detailed interpretation
   of a range of interviews and participatory observations, the article
   unpacks the mutually constitutive relationship between law, technologies
   of seeing, and landscape, illustrating how this relationship is played
   out by various actors in the occupied West Bank.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is usually considered to be a potential
   confounder of the association between lead exposure and children's
   neurodevelopment, but experimental and epidemiological data suggest that
   SES might also modify lead neurotoxicity. The basis of this effect
   modification is uncertain, but might include differences among SES
   strata in co-exposures to other neurotoxicants, genetic
   susceptibilities, environmental enrichment, and stress. The role of SES
   in the causal nexus is likely to include other dimensions, however. It
   conveys information about lead exposure opportunities as well as about
   predictors of child outcome that are correlated with but causally
   independent of lead. Failure to distinguish these aspects of SES will
   lead to an underestimate of lead's contribution, and might even result
   in attributing to SES health effects that should be attributed to lead.
   Conventional models, which treat SES and SES-related factors solely as
   potential confounders, do not capture the possibility that a child's
   early lead exposure alters the behaviors that the child elicits from
   others. Failure to model lead's contribution to such time-varying
   covariates will also tend to bias estimates of lead neurotoxicity toward
   the null. On a trans-generational level, low SES might be a proxy for
   vulnerability to lead. To estimate the burden of lead-associated
   neurotoxicity on a population level, we need to apply analytical
   approaches that model a child's development and its context as a complex
   system of interdependent relationships that change over time. (C) 2008

   agriculture production is known to contribute to a variety of human
   health and environmental problems. Findings for random effects and

   confirm the hypotheses, and point to the sociological relevance in
   assessing the potential social and environmental impacts of both the

AB Legislative roll-call voting is crucial in policy making. Standard
   approaches to studying roll-call voting focus on legislator attributes,
   ignoring how social factors, such as legislator relations, may drive
   voting. Using original data based on a state legislature, I adopt a
   relational approach to examine how legislator relations impact roll-call
   voting net of attributes. Results show that relations strongly influence
   voting, adding significantly to the explanatory power of the models.
   These results imply that standard approaches to studying roll-call
   voting should incorporate consideration of social factors, suggesting
   the value of social influence models in studies of political phenomena.

AB In this article I first examine the ways in which the dual terms of
   structure and agency are used in sociological theories. Then, relying on
   Lacan's notions of split-subject, the formula of sexuation, and forms of
   discourses, and Laclau's theory of ideological hegemony, I argue that
   agency in most current sociological formulations is but a posited other
   of the structure that dissolves if examined closely; it is similar to
   the Lacanian fantasmic object. To resolve the fundamental paradoxes in
   structure-agency theories, I reformulate structures as paradoxical,
   incomplete, and contingent symbolic formations that are always partial
   and unstable due to their inclusion and exclusion operations.
   Consequently, social transformational agency consists in the structural
   inconsistencies that open structural gaps available to social actors. As
   a result, agency can be recognized in two moments conceived as two
   symbolic gestures. From this perspective, agency as such is always a
   possibility qua potential and its efficacy is always retroactively
   recognized-actualized from within a new social structure or symbolic
   order.

AB Using the American Housing Survey for 2001 and Census 2000, I examine
   the link between gated communities and residential segregation. I
   hypothesize that gating and segregation are defined by similar
   mechanisms, thus reinforcing urban inequality in U. S. cities. The
   results, however, indicate a more complex relationship. On the one hand,
   there are common mechanisms behind the two processes: the pursuit of
   higher property values, fear of crime, and fear of increased social
   heterogeneity. An increase in percent recent immigrants leads to higher
   levels of both segregation and gating. On the other hand, factors such
   as region, percent black, percent Hispanic, percent college graduates,
   and functional specialization affect the two processes differentially.
   Although segregation is less pronounced and declining in the U. S. urban
   Southwest, gated communities are much more prominent there. The results
   challenge the notion that the declines in residential segregation in
   recent decades indicate social progress.

AB The cultural turn has been one of the major shifts in sociology over the
   last two decades. Though nearly everyone now agrees that culture
   matters, how it matters is not terribly clear. What, exactly, is culture
   supposed to do? In this essay, I articulate two ideal-typical - though
   often implicit - ways most sociologists have thought about culture's
   role in action. Although no single sociologist or piece of research
   fully embodies either ideal type, I believe they are real tendencies in
   the field that have real consequences for how research is designed,
   undertaken, and understood. After outlining these approaches, I subject
   them to an engagement with cognitive science. This is not out a desire
   for reductionism but, as I will show, because a crucial difference
   between these perspectives is their implicit model of how human beings
   perceive, acquire, store, retrieve, and act on the symbolic information
   that surrounds them every day. This exercise will lead to the conclusion
   that both perspectives are incomplete and will point toward a synthetic
   approach that can shed new light on how culture matters for action.

   of Bourdieu and organizational sociology. It highlights particular
   structural configurations ("spaces of relations") and the specific
   cultural content ("rules of the game" and "symbolic capital") of global
   systems. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through an analysis
   of the different forms of the two hegemonic empires of the past
   centuries, Great Britain and the United States. The British state tended
   toward formal imperialism in the 19th century, characterized by direct
   territorial rule, while the United States since WWII has tended toward
   informal imperialism. The essay shows that the difference can be best
   explained by considering the different historical global fields in which
   the two empires operated.

AB When the term sexual harassment is used is association with the clergy,
   the common assumption is that it is sexual abuse by the clergy which is
   being discussed. This assumption tends to obscure another serious issue
   that has received little scholarly attention-the sexual harassment of
   clergy by church members and colleagues in ministry. This study
   investigates both the factors that contribute to the chances of clergy
   experiencing harassment, and the impact of abuse on clergy work
   outcomes. Because there is so little research on the sexual harassment
   of clergy, the more general literature on sexual harassment in the
   workplace (from organizational and sociology of work research) must be
   relied on in framing the study. A unified approach is used, which
   suggests that features of modern organizational structures which are
   known to increase satisfaction will help to create a supportive climate
   in the workplace that will reduce the likelihood of incidents of
   harassment. Support is found for the value of organizational context as
   a means of explaining both the causes and outcomes of clergy experiences
   of harassment.

AB In this article, I analyze support for religiously orthodox teachings

   with religious experience. While most Catholics disagree with Official
   teachings regarding contraception and the celibate priesthood, a
   significant minority endorse these orthodox positions. In analyses of a
   national sample of U.S. Catholics, orthodox attitudes are found to be
   more common among those who have been on a religious pilgrimage. The
   finding is interpreted using concepts from Durkheim's sociology, of
   religion, Stark and Finke's claims about the relationship, between
   religious ritual and acceptance of religious explanations, and
   Wildavsky's theory that preferences are endogenous to institutions.
   Building on these analyses, I address a question about the structural
   consequences of pilgrimage, and conclude with a call for further
   quantitative research about pilgrims' experiences.

   environment. The common currency in the model is the production of food,
   on which age-specific rates of birth and death depend. There is a single
   non-trivial equilibrium population at which productivity balances
   caloric needs. One of the most powerful controls on equilibrium hunger
   level is fertility control. Gains against hunger are accompanied by
   decreases in population size. Increasing worker productivity does
   increase equilibrium population size but does not improve welfare at
   equilibrium. As a case study we apply the model to the population of a

   drawn from a range of disciplines to delineate the ways temporality
   enters into human behavior, resource management, and the conduct of
   social-ecological research. Anthropological and historical studies
   document the culturally embedded temporal subjectivities that shape the
   way humans exploit or conserve natural resources. Analyses of
   environmental policy show how temporal considerations enter into
   intervention strategies via such concepts as discount rates, property
   rights and the precautionary principle. The centrality of temporal
   assumptions is further evidenced by the time-dependent foundations of
   disciplinary specializations. The likelihood of temporal mismatches
   between the specializations that participate in interdisciplinary
   research and between the scientific findings and environmental policy
   can be mitigated by giving attention to temporal grain, temporal fallacy
   and temporal extent.

AB People automatically evaluate faces on multiple trait dimensions, and
   these evaluations predict important social outcomes, ranging from
   electoral success to sentencing decisions. Based on behavioral studies
   and computer modeling, we develop a 2D model of face evaluation. First,
   using a principal components analysis of trait judgments of emotionally
   neutral faces, we identify two orthogonal dimensions, valence and
   dominance, that are sufficient to describe face evaluation and show that
   these dimensions can be approximated by judgments of trustworthiness and
   dominance. Second, using a data-driven statistical model for face
   representation, we build and validate models for representing face
   trustworthiness and face dominance. Third, using these models, we show
   that, whereas valence evaluation is more sensitive to features
   resembling expressions signaling whether the person should be avoided or
   approached, dominance evaluation is more sensitive to features signaling
   physical strength/weakness. Fourth, we show that important social
   judgments, such as threat, can be reproduced as a function of the two
   orthogonal dimensions of valence and dominance. The findings suggest
   that face evaluation involves an overgeneralization of adaptive
   mechanisms for inferring harmful intentions and the ability to cause
   harm and can account for rapid, yet not necessarily accurate, judgments
   from faces.

AB A number of indicators suggest that trust is becoming a major issue for
   natural resource managers and planners desiring to maintain or enhance
   community-agency relationships. Public distrust, especially local
   community distrust, can have severe implications for the quality and
   durability of natural resource policy and management decisions. This
   article addresses the research problem of understanding factors of
   community trust in a water resources management agency. To describe
   trust factors in this context, a descriptive, interpretive qualitative
   case Study approach was applied. Specifically the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers (Corps) and key communities nearby or adjacent to water
   resources managed by the Corps within the Kaskaskia River Watershed in
   central Illinois were examined. Trust between the communities and the
   Corps was the focus of analysis. This research is pertinent and
   practical because planners, managers, engineers, policy makers, and
   community stakeholders in many natural resources management Situations
   are seeking better ways of working together that produce sustainable
   agency-community relationships. The findings Suggest that local
   community trust factors relevant to the Corps are complex and critical
   to understanding the social context of natural resources management in
   the Kaskaskia River-Watershed. The management significance of this
   research is a series of suggestions for improving relationships between
   communities, agencies, and agency managers based on the different
   factors of trust. Both formal and informal mechanisms are available to
   address important factors of trust. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB opponents of the Scenic Review Ordinance for controlling the visual
   effects of development in the Lake Tahoe Basin argue that the
   regulations do not meaningfully reflect general public attitudes. In
   part to address this concern, Tahoe's federally mandated regional
   authority commissioned a study to assess public perception of the scenic
   resource. The 392 survey respondents were comprised of tourists, members
   of local environmental groups, and lakefront property owners. Survey
   results, based on responses to both photographs and written questions.
   show substantial agreement across different stakeholder groups including
   those most vocally opposed to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA).
   Although the magnitude of preferences differed somewhat, all groups
   preferred development that included more nature (particularly trees),was
   not "run down", was less visually bulky, and contrasted less with the
   environment (e.g., darker colors and without large expanses of windows).
   These findings lend credibility to TRPA's Scenic Ordinance criteria,
   which encourage developers and homeowners to break up visible structural
   mass of their construction and reduce the perceived contrast of
   structures with their surroundings. Study implications are discussed in
   terms of the future of TRPA efforts and in terms of the effectiveness of
   studies such as these in bridging the gap between planning and

   prospective study used generalized estimating equations (GEE) transition
   modeling and four annual waves of survey data from 392 American mothers
   receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) in a large
   Northern California county. Measurements We examined the effects of
   neighborhood disorder, stressful life events and economic hardship on
   psychological distress and problem drinking over time, and whether
   social support moderated these relationships for women in poverty.
   Findings Neighborhood disorder and stressful life events increased
   significantly the risk for problem drinking, largely through their
   effect on psychological distress. We found little evidence, however,
   that social support buffers poor women from the effects of these
   stressors. Conclusions Women in poverty are exposed to severe, chronic
   stressors within their communities and immediate social networks which
   increase vulnerability to psychological distress and problem drinking.
   The finding that social support does not buffer stress among these women
   may reflect their high level of exposure to stressors, as well as the
   hardships and scarce resources within their networks. If the 'private
   safety net' of the social network fails to provide a strong buffer, more
   effective environmental interventions that reduce exposure to stressors
   may be needed to prevent alcohol problems in poor women's lives.

AB Increased public and private investments in large-scale team science
   initiatives over the past two decades have underscored the need to
   better understand how contextual factors influence the effectiveness of
   transdisciplinary scientific collaboration. Toward that goal, the
   findings from four distinct areas of research on team performance and
   collaboration are reviewed: (1) social psychological and management
   research on the effectiveness of teams in organizational and
   institutional settings; (2) studies of cyber-infrastructures (i.e.,
   computer-based infrastructures) designed to support transdisciplinary
   collaboration across remote research sites; (3) investigations of
   community-based coalitions for health promotion; and (4) studies
   focusing directly on the antecedents, processes, and outcomes of
   scientific collaboration within transdisciplinary research centers and
   training programs. The empirical literature within these four domains
   reveals several contextual circumstances that either facilitate or
   hinder team performance and collaboration. A typology of contextual
   influences on transdisciplinary collaboration is proposed as a basis for
   deriving practical guidelines for designing, managing, and evaluating
   successful team science initiatives.

AB Approaching the public representation of a "difficult past" as a

   states manage reputation-damaging elements of their histories on global
   stages. Through an empirical case study, I examine how the Croatian
   government has represented the country to international audiences via
   tourism after the wars of Yugoslav secession. Challenging assumptions
   that contentious historical moments will be commemorated, I find that
   the state has managed Croatia "diflicult" recent past through covering
   and cultural reframing rather than public acknowledgment. The country
   has omitted the war from representations of national history and
   repositioned Croatia as identical in history and culture to its Western
   European neighbors. I draw from Goffman's work on stigma to explain the
   Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for
   understanding the conditions under which public recognition of
   reputation-damaging events is likely not to occur I conclude by
   discussing theoretical implications for scholarship on collective
   memory, cultural sociology, and world polity theory.

AB BACKGROUND. Understanding the ways in which socioeconomic status (SES)
   affects mortality is important for defining strategies to eliminate the
   unequal burden of cancer by race and ethnicity in the United States.
   METHODS. Disease stage, treatment, and 5-year mortality rates were
   ascertained by reviewing medical records, and SES was determined by
   analyzing income and education at the census tract level for 4844 women
   with breast cancer, 4332 men with prostate cancer, and 4422 men and
   women with colorectal cancer who were diagnosed in 7 U.S. states in
   1997.
   RESULTS. Low SES was associated with more advanced disease stage and
   with less aggressive treatment for all 3 cancers. The hazard ratio (HR)
   for 5-year all-cause mortality associated with low SES was elevated
   after a diagnosis of breast cancer when the analysis was adjusted for
   age (HR, 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-1.87). Adjustment for
   mediating factors of race/ethnicity, comorbid conditions, cancer stage,
   and treatment reduced the association. The age-adjusted mortality risk
   associated with low SES was elevated after a diagnosis of prostate
   cancer (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.13-1.57), and multivariate adjustments for
   mediating factors also reduced that association. There was less
   association between SES and mortality after a diagnosis of colorectal
   cancer. For all 3 cancer sites, low SES was a much stronger predictor of
   mortality among individuals aged <65 years and among individuals from
   racial/ethnic minority groups.
   CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that low SES is a risk factor
   for all-cause mortality after a diagnosis of cancer, largely because of
   a later stage at diagnosis and less aggressive treatment. These findings
   support the need to focus on SES as an underlying factor in cancer
   disparities by race and ethnicity.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous research demonstrated increased risk of breast
   cancer associated with hi gher socioeconomic status (SES) measured at
   both the individual and community levels. However, little attention has
   been paid to simultaneously examining both measures.
   OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the independent influences of individual and
   community SES on the risk of breast cancer using case-control data.
   Because our previous work suggests that associations may be stronger
   after including a latency period, we also assessed the effect of
   community-level SES assuming a 10-year latency period.
   METHODS: We obtained individual education for cases and matched controls
   diagnosed between 1987 and 1993 on Cape Cod, Massachusetts (USA). We
   acquired community-level SES from census data for 1980 and 1990. Using
   SES data at diagnosis and 10 years earlier, we constructed models for
   breast cancer risk using individual-level SES only, community-level SES
   only, and a multilevel analysis including both. We adjusted models for
   other individual-level risk factors.
   RESULTS: Women with the highest education were at greater risk of
   developing breast cancer both 1980 and 1990 [odds ratio (OR) = 1.17 and
   1.19, respectively]. Similarly, women living in the highest-SES
   communities in 1990 had greater risk (OR = 1.30). Results were stronger
   in the analyses considering a latency period (OR = 1.69). Adjusting for
   intragroup, correlation had little effect on the analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS: Models including individual- or community-level measures of
   SES produced associations similar to those observed in previous
   research. Results for models including both measures are consistent with
   a contextual effect of SES on risk of breast cancer independent of
   individual SES.

AB Background African Americans have been found to be more resilient to the
   caregiving role than Whites. Amount of social support and satisfaction
   with social support were studied as possible explanations for these
   racial differences.
   Methods Family caregivers of patients diagnosed as having dementia
   participated in a longitudinal study. There were 166 caregiver-patient
   dyads enrolled and annual follow-up assessments were completed. Linear
   random effects regression models examined the longitudinal trajectories
   of social support, depressive symptoms, and life satisfaction over 5
   years of community follow-up. Social support was also included as a
   time-dependent predictor of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.
   Results The number of helpful support persons available decreased
   significantly for both racial groups. African American caregivers
   reported more satisfaction with their social support networks than
   Whites. They also reported fewer depressive symptoms and higher levels
   of life satisfaction when compared to their White counterparts. Higher
   levels of satisfaction with social support were associated with fewer
   depressive symptoms and increased levels of life satisfaction and
   explained a portion of the racial differences on these measures of
   psychosocial outcome.
   Conclusions The resilience of African American caregivers, as displayed
   by their fewer depressive symptoms and higher levels of life
   satisfaction, was partially explained by their higher levels of
   satisfaction with social support. Results suggest that health care
   providers should view low levels of social support as a possible
   precursor to poor psychological outcomes in caregivers. Future research
   should focus on social support and cultural variables that might explain
   racial differences in caregiver outcomes. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley

   different network structures affect the propagation of information in
   laboratory-created groups. Participants made numerical guesses and
   received scores that were also made available to their neighbors in the

   convergence on the optimal solution. One experiment showed that
   individuals within a group tend to converge on similar solutions even
   when there is an equally valid alternative solution. Two additional
   studies demonstrated that the optimal network structure depends on the
   problem space being explored, with networks that incorporate spatially
   based cliques having an advantage for problems that benefit from broad
   exploration, and networks with greater long-range connectivity having an
   advantage for problems requiring less exploration.

   The authors test the following 3 decision process goals as the potential

   evaluating new information, (b) to increase the separation between
   alternatives, and (c) to achieve consistency between old and new units
   of information. Two methods, the nonconscious priming of each goal and
   assessing the ambient activation levels of multiple goals, reveal that
   the goal of consistency drives information distortion. Results suggest

AB Background. Medicaid beneficiaries have lower rates of dental visits and
   higher rates of dental disease compared with the rest of the population.
   Beneficiaries ascribe their low use of services to difficulties 41
   finding dentists who treat patients with Medicaid. Dentists cite low
   reimbursement rates, excessive paperwork, and patients' not keeping
   appointments and poor oral health literacy as reasons for not accepting
   patients with Medicaid. The authors pilot-tested the effectiveness of a
   dental case management program (DCMP) in increasing dentists'
   participation in Medicaid and Medicaid beneficiaries' use of services.
   Methods. A dental case manager recruits dentists to participate in the
   Medicaid program, arranges training in billing procedures, resolves
   billing and payment problems, educates clients about the use of dental
   services and keeping appointments, links clients to dental offices,
   identifies potential barriers to care and helps clients obtain
   transportation to appointments. The authors evaluated the levels of
   participation of dentists in the DCMP in Medicaid and Medicaid
   beneficiaries' use of services.
   Results. Dentists accepting new Medicaid patients increased from two to
   28, with 145 dental visits a month provided to Medicaid beneficiaries.
   The percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving dental services
   increased from 9 to 41 percent after the DCMP was implemented.
   Conclusions. The authors found that the DCMP was effective in increasing
   Medicaid beneficiaries' use of services, increasing dentists'
   participation in Medicaid, minimizing administrative burdens related to
   Medicaid participation, and increasing oral health literacy and
   treatment compliance among clients with low incomes.

AB Background: Persistent high levels of sexually transmitted infection
   (STI) in Madagascar indicate current prevention strategies are
   inadequate. STI/HIV prevention based in social venues may play an
   important role in reaching individuals at risk of infection. We
   identified venues where people meet sexual partners and measured the
   need and potential for venue-based prevention.
   Methods: Interviews were conducted in 7 Madagascar towns with 1)
   community informants to identify social venues, 2) individuals
   socializing at a sample of venues to assess sexual behavior among venue
   patrons, and 3) venue representatives to assess the potential for
   venue-based intervention.
   Results: Community informants identified numerous venues (range: 67-211
   venues, depending on the town); streets, bars, and hotels were most
   commonly reported. Among 2982 individuals socializing at venues, 78% of
   men and 74% of women reported new sexual partnership or sex trade for
   money, goods, or services in the past 4 weeks and 19% of men and 18% of
   women reported symptoms suggestive of STI in the past 4 weeks. STI
   symptom levels were disproportionately high among respondents reporting
   either sex trade or new sexual partnership in the past 4 weeks.
   Twenty-eight percent of men and 41% of women reported condom use during
   the last sex act with a new partner. Although 24% to 45% of venues had
   hosted STI/HIV interventions, interventions were deemed possible at 73%
   to 90% venues according to 644 interviews with venue representatives.
   Conclusions: Venue-based intervention is possible and would reach a
   spectrum of populations vulnerable to STI/HIV including sex workers,
   their clients, and other high-risk populations.

AB I use panel data to empirically assess the effects of a variety of
   theoretically important structural factors on national level CO(2)
   emissions in the former Soviet republics, a context of de-modernization
   and peripheralization. Several theories address the effects of
   modernization on the environment, but they neglect to consider the
   environmental consequences of de-modernization. Unlike the trends in
   most other nations over the twentieth century, former Soviet republics
   in the 1990s saw their collective population size, economy, level of
   urbanization, level of industrialization, and international trade
   decline, and, thus, they provide an ideal context in which to assess the
   effects of de-modernization on the environment. In addition to the
   dramatic changes in economic and demographic factors, the size of the
   militaries of the former Soviet republics changed substantially during
   the 1990s, with some republics expanding their militaries while other
   were scaling theirs back. I take advantage of the substantial variation
   within the former Soviet republics, and assess the effects of
   militarization, in addition to economic and demographic factors, on
   CO(2) emissions. I find that de-modernization, as indicated by declines
   in GDP per capita and urbanization, led to declines in CO(2) emissions,
   countering claims that further modernization is necessary to resolve the
   environmental crisis. I also find that militarization has an effect on
   CO(2) emissions above and beyond that of economic development.

AB Elite college admissions exemplify processes of social closure in which
   status-group conflict, organizational self-interest, the strategic use
   of cultural ideals of merit, and broader social trends and contingent
   historical events interweave to shape institutional power in the United
   States. The Chosen, Jerome Karabel's monumental study of the history of
   college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton from 1900 to 2005,
   offers a political sociology of elite recruitment and a cultural and
   social history of the definition of merit that has guided these three
   schools and shaped much current thinking about college admissions. As
   Max Weber reminded us, the very definition of cultural ideals of an
   epoch bear the stamp of elite group domination: not cultural ideals but
   cultural interests and their strategic uses guide institutional power.
   The book provides an impressive empirical demonstration of that
   proposition: it identifies four different definitions of merit as
   organizational gatekeeping tools that have guided Harvard, Yale, and
   Princeton over the last hundred years and shows how these definitions
   were molded by status-group conflict and organizational interests. This
   essay outlines the central arguments of Karabel's book; it identifies
   key contributions for our understanding of the history, culture,
   organizational interests, and politics of these three institutions; it
   highlights the social closure framework guiding the analysis; and it
   reflects on a fundamental ambiguity in Karabel's thinking about
   meritocratic ideals as governing principles for modern stratified
   societies.

AB Aims: The goal of the proposed study was fourfold: (i) to examine the
   effects of parental alcoholism on adult offspring's self-esteem; (ii) to
   identify and test possible mediators and moderators of parental
   alcoholism effects on the self-esteem of adult offspring; (iii) to
   examine the utility and relevance of attachment theory (Bowlby J. (1969)
   Attachment and Loss: Vol. 1. Attachment. New York: Basic Books) in
   explaining parental alcoholism effects on self-esteem and (iv) to
   address some of the methodological limitations identified in past
   research on adult children of alcoholics (ACOA). Methods: Participants
   (N = 515) completed retrospective reports of parental alcoholism, family
   stressors, family communication patterns, parental attachment and a
   current measure of self-esteem. Results: The results showed support for
   the detrimental effects of parental alcoholism on offspring self-esteem
   and offered partial support for family stressors as a mediator of
   parental alcoholism effects on parental attachment and parental
   attachment as a mediator of parental alcoholism effects on offspring
   self-esteem, respectively. Finally, support was found for family
   communication patterns as a moderator of the effects of family stressors
   on attachment. Conclusions: The study findings offer preliminary support
   for the utility of attachment theory in explicating parental alcoholism
   effects on the self-esteem of adult offspring. Findings from the present
   study make salient the need to consider factors beyond the
   identification of parental alcohol abuse when explicating individual
   differences in offspring self-esteem in adulthood. The identification of
   protective and risk factors can contribute to the development of optimal

AB In his massively influential work, Clifford Geertz crystallized core
   methodological and theoretical elements of a strong program in cultural
   sociology, a program that argues for a meaning-centered social science.
   If meaning is to be so central, then the theoretical tools that the
   humanities have developed to investigate art and language must become
   central to the human sciences more generally. The 'thick descriptions'
   Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the
   empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local
   knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing,
   global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not
   enriched but different as it emerges locally. Interests can never be
   objective, and extra-individual structures are both cultural and social
   at the same time. Yet, while structures are central, they take form only
   through contingent process, and intertwining them is what Geertz's turn
   to performance was about.

AB The essay by Geertz on the Balinese cockfight is by far his most famous
   and influential piece of work. Why? Using resources from the Russian
   formalism of the early 20th century, the article uncovers the textual
   and structural foundations that gave it a competitive advantage over his
   other writings. In so doing the analysis seeks to reconcile Geertz with
   the structuralism that he famously and perhaps unwisely dismissed as
   irrelevant for interpretative sociology. The reception trajectory of
   Geertz points to the need for a more robust theory of culture than his
   hermeneutics could offer. The Yale strong program is understood as a
   solution to this malaise, one that combines structuralist analysis with
   Geertzian sensibilities.

AB The strong program in cultural sociology faces - and creates for
   sociology generally - an epistemic dilemma: does an interpretation of
   culture constitute an explanation of social action? The work of Clifford
   Geertz suggests the two are not mutually exclusive. In his empirical
   studies he artfully produced 'maximal interpretations' that went beyond
   both extant theories and the immediate data given by participant
   observation. Maximal interpretations, I argue, claim the epistemic
   status of sociological explanations. Indeed, the core problems of the
   philosophy of social science and social theory can be reframed in terms
   of the difference between relatively uncontroversial 'minimal
   interpretation' and relatively tendentious (but powerful) 'maximal
   interpretation'. The implications of this distinction for research can
   be made clear by considering, as an example, what is required to explain
   witch hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, and the Salem
   witch trials in particular.

AB Human infants rely on social interactions to acquire food-related
   information. 1, 2 Adults actively teach children about food through
   culturally diverse feeding practices. Characteristics we share with the
   other primates, such as complex diets, highly social lives, and extended
   juvenile periods, suggest that social learning may be important during
   ontogeny throughout the order. Although all young primates typically pay
   attention to feeding adults, great apes and callitrichids, in
   particular, acquire new foraging techniques through abilities unknown in
   other nonhuman primates; that is, they learn by imitation. However, ape
   social learning is almost exclusively infant-initiated, while adult
   callitrichids actively teach their young. It is unlikely that the same
   selective forces have acted to favor sophisticated social-learning
   mechanisms in both taxa.(3,4) Equipped with an ape brain, complex
   foraging methods, and a cooperative infant-care system, early hominins
   were uniquely poised to take social learning about food and foraging
   techniques to a new level.

AB Objective: We examined the influence of thin ideal internalization on
   body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in Mexican girls.
   Method: We sampled 137 public school girls aged 12-15 from a small city
   in Mexico. Participants were given Spanish versions of the sociocultural
   attitudes toward appearance scale, two measures of body dissatisfaction,
   the eating attitudes test, and the attitudinal familism scale.
   Results: Thin ideal internalization mediated the relationship between
   thin ideal awareness and body dissatisfaction, and the relationship
   between thin ideal awareness and eating disorder symptoms. Attitudinal
   familism was negatively correlated with thin ideal internalization for
   girls outside of the normal weight range.
   Conclusion: Mexican girls are at risk of eating disorder symptoms, and
   there is support for the sociocultural model of disordered eating in
   this population. Hispanic family values may mark protection from thin
   ideal internalization in Mexican girls outside of the normal weight
   range. (C) 2008 by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Context: Professional socialization during formal educational
   preparation can help students learn professional roles and can lead to
   improved organizational socialization as students emerge as members of
   the occupation's culture. Professional socialization research in
   athletic training is limited.
   Objective: To present the role of legitimation and how it influences the
   professional socialization of second-year athletic training students.
   Design: Modified constructivist grounded theory and case study methods
   were used for this qualitative study.
   Setting: An accredited undergraduate athletic training education
   program.
   Patients or Other Participants: Twelve second-year students were
   selected purposively. The primary sample group (n = 4) was selected
   according to theoretical sampling guidelines. The remaining students
   made up the cohort sample (n = 8). Theoretically relevant data were
   gathered from 14 clinical instructors to clarify emergent student data.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data collection included document
   examination, observations, and interviews during 1 academic semester.
   Data were collected and analyzed through constant comparative analysis.
   Data triangulation, member checking, and peer-review strategies were
   used to ensure trustworthiness.
   Results: Legitimation from various socializing agents initiated
   professional socialization. Students viewed trust and team membership as
   rewards for role fulfillment.
   Conclusions: My findings are consistent with the socialization
   literature that shows how learning a social or professional role, using
   rewards to facilitate role performance, and building trusting
   relationships with socializing agents are important aspects of
   legitimation and, ultimately, professional socialization.

AB Background: The study was designed to provide evidence of a cascade
   effect linking socioeconomic position to anthropometric indicators of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk through effects on psychosocial
   stress, psychological distress and health-related behaviours, and
   consider implications for disease prevention and health promotion.
   Methods: A cross-sectional stratified two-stage probability sample of
   occupied housing units in three areas of Detroit, Michigan, was used in
   the study. 919 adults aged >= 25 years completed the survey ( mean age
   46.3; 53% annual household income <$ 20 000; 57% non-Hispanic black, 22%
   Latino, 19% non-Hispanic white). Variables included self-report ( eg,
   psychosocial stress, depressive symptoms, health behaviours) and
   anthropometric measurements ( eg, waist circumference, height, weight).
   The main outcome variables were depressive symptoms, smoking status,
   physical activity, body mass index and waist circumference.
   Results: Income was inversely associated with depressive symptoms,
   likelihood of current smoking, physical inactivity and waist
   circumference. These relationships were partly or fully mediated by
   psychosocial stress. A suppressor effect of current smoking on the
   relationship between depressive symptoms and waist circumference was
   found. Independent effects of psychosocial stress and psychological
   distress on current smoking and waist circumference were found, above
   and beyond the mediated pathways.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that relatively modest improvements in
   the income of economically disadvantaged people can set in motion a
   cascade of effects, simultaneously reducing exposure to stressful life
   conditions, improving mental well-being, increasing health-promoting
   behaviours and reducing anthropometric risks associated with CVD. Such
   interventions offer important opportunities to improve population health
   and reduce health disparities.

AB Objective: To examine the association of both individual and community
   socioeconomic status (SES) with inflammatory mediators relevant to
   cardiovascular pathophysiology, i.e., interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive
   protein (CRP), in a midlife community sample. Growing evidence suggests
   that socioeconomic attributes of both individuals and communities confer
   risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Methods:. Subjects were
   851 men and women, 30 to 54 years of age (Caucasian = 77%,
   African-American = 23%). Individual SES was indexed by a composite of
   educational attainment and family income, and community SES was indexed
   by corresponding indicators derived. from US Census data for
   participants' census tracts of residence. Plasma concentrations of IL-6
   and CRP were determined from blood samples. Results: Regression analyses
   adjusting for age, sex, and race showed individual SES to be associated
   inversely with IL-6 (13 = -0.126, p < .01), and community SES to be
   associated inversely with both IL-6 and CRP (B = -0.144, p < .01, B =
   -0.097, p < .01, respectively). The relationship of community SES with
   IL-6, but not CRP, persisted on multivariable adjustment for both
   lifestyle risk factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep, exercise,
   body mass index) and individual SES (IL-6: B = -0.084, p < .05; CRP: B =
   -0.047, p > .10). After adjustment for lifestyle factors, however,
   individual SES was no longer associated with IL-6. Conclusions:
   Independent of personal income or educational attainment, midlife adults
   living in less advantaged neighborhoods exhibit higher levels of
   circulating proinflammatory markers than residents of more affluent
   areas. This association may help explain the increased risk of
   atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality conferred by low
   community-level SES.

AB This essay attempts to take a broad view of the historical forces that
   have shaped the discipline of sociology and continue to shape it. It is
   organized around the concept of crisis, arguing that sociology has been
   produced by crises and that it has been defined by its responses to
   crises. It identifies an ethic of control and manipulation as a chief
   product of 19th century responses. It suggests that we have once again
   entered a period of disruption and rapid change, and that the current
   challenge of sociology is to situate ourselves, reflexively, within a
   dense web of philosophical, psychological, social, biological, and
   environmental linkages, recognizing that we can never see the network in
   its entirety because we ourselves are nodes within it. However, the
   ethic of control and manipulation that we have inherited from earlier
   sociological responses often prevents sociologists from developing an
   immanent, reflexive, and ecological approach to the crisis of the
   present that would enable us to place ourselves within this web.

AB In this article / explore the ethical terrain of experiential learning
   activities drawing on my experiences leading college students on field
   trips into criminal justice settings. Though there are numerous
   educational benefits to adopting experiential learning activities, the
   rewards must be evaluated in light of the potential harms to nonstudent
   participants. Student observations of criminal justice settings can
   reinforce common stereotypes of prisoners as scary and dangerous while
   reifying the legitimacy of state power exercised through agents of
   social control, More broadly, experiential learning activities can also
   highlight the shame and embarrassment of subordinate groups when such
   activities devolve into voyeuristic spectacles of human misery. In light
   of these potential harms to nonstudent groups, this article proposes
   guiding questions for educators to address in designing experiential
   activities. These questions draw attention to the following issues: the
   vulnerability of participants, the relative social power of nonstudent
   participants, whether participation is truly voluntary, the
   accessibility of the setting to outside observers, group size, benefits
   to nonstudent participants, duration of activity, protection of
   confidentiality, the role of students in the activity, and the
   curricular focus of the experience.

AB We have updated Ferree and Hall's (1990) study of the way gender and
   race are constructed through pictures in introductory sociology
   textbooks. Ferree and Hall looked at 33 textbooks published between 1982
   and 1988. We replicated their study by examining 3,085 illustrations in
   a sample of 27 textbooks, most of which were published between 2002 and
   2006. We found important areas of progress in the presentation of both
   gender and race as well as significant areas of stasis. The face of
   society we found depicted in contemporary textbooks was distinctly less
   likely to be that of a white man, very prominent in the 1980s texts, and
   much more likely to be that of a minority woman. Thus, while only 34
   percent of the pictures of identifiable individuals in the textbooks
   examined by Ferree and Hall were of women, almost 50 percent of such
   pictures were of women in the recent texts. Moreover, while the
   percentage of white men portrayed dropped from about 45 percent to 30
   percent, the percentage of portrayals of minority women rose from about
   11 percent to 22 percent. Another sign of progress has been the
   decreasing likelihood of textbooks to depict race and gender as being
   nonoverlapping categories: while women of color apparently "had" only
   race in the sample examined by Ferree and Hall, they "had" both gender
   and race in the sample we studied. Still, our examination of pictures as
   a whole as a unit of analysis found that blacks continue to be more
   likely than any other racial group to be depicted in the presence of
   other racial groups and thus, to idealize the degree of social
   integration in American society. We also still see non-white women
   enjoying very little (in fact, no) visibility in sections devoted to
   theory, despite developments in feminist theory, generally, and
   multicultural feminist, specifically. In general, though, our analysis
   suggests that the various criticisms of introductory texts that have
   appeared in this forum and others can have an impact on the content of
   those texts and, by extension, the sociology we teach.

AB High- performance organizations and economies work on the basis not only
   of material interests but also of Adam Smith's "moral sentiments." Well-
   designed laws and public policies can harness self- interest for the
   common good. However, incentives that appeal to self- interest may fail
   when they undermine the moral values that lead people to act
   altruistically or in other public- spirited ways. Behavioral experiments
   reviewed here suggest that economic incentives may be counterproductive
   when they signal that selfishness is an appropriate response; constitute
   a learning environment through which over time people come to adopt more
   self- interested motivations; compromise the individual's sense of self-
   determination and thereby degrade intrinsic motivations; or convey a
   message of distrust, disrespect, and unfair intent. Many of these
   unintended effects of incentives occur because people act not only to
   acquire economic goods and services but also to constitute themselves as
   dignified, autonomous, and moral individuals. Good organizational and
   institutional design can channel the material interests for the
   achievement of social goals while also enhancing the contribution of the
   moral sentiments to the same ends.

   differences use an innovative photography and video experience with
   Positive Exposure (PE), a non-profit organization based in New York
   City, as a way to cope with their conditions. Thirty-five individuals
   between 12 and 61 years of age participated in this study. We
   administered surveys comprised of open-ended qualitative questions and
   quantitative measures designed to assess self-esteem, perceived stigma,
   and hopefulness. Data for this analysis was generated front the written
   questionnaires and interview transcripts. Most participants reported
   high levels of self-esteem and hopefulness, suggesting that they were
   relatively well adapted to their condition. Almost all participants
   described experiences of stigmatization throughout their lives. However,
   participants demonstrated their ability to implement a variety of coping
   strategies to manage stigma. "Helping others" emerged as a prominent
   strategy among participants, aiding in the often lifelong process of
   adapting to their genetic difference. PE was described as in avenue
   through which participants could reach out to individuals and society at
   large, helping them adapt further to their condition. "Helping others"
   may also benefit individuals with craniofacial differences who do not
   consider themselves to be well adapted to their condition. Health care
   providers can collaborate with PE, advocacy groups and other community
   or support groups to identify additional Ways individuals with
   craniofacial differences can help themselves by reaching out to others.

   cognition and behaviour contingent upon the relative presence of
   pathogens in the local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental
   cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist
   values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of
   collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the
   transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism
   (compared with individualism) will more often characterize cultures in
   regions that have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens.
   Drawing on epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide
   cross-national surveys of individualism/collectivism, our results
   support this hypothesis: the regional prevalence of pathogens has a
   strong positive correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and
   a strong negative correlation with individualism. The correlations
   remain significant even when controlling for potential confounding
   variables. These results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic
   cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented
   consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of human
   societies.

AB I provide an historical overview of the development of the Sociology of
   Agriculture as a critical response to perceived inadequacies of
   conservative theories of social change regarding rural society in
   general, and agriculture in particular. I do this by focusing on the
   three questions that have dominated the discourse on agrifood studies:
   "The Agrarian Question," "The Environment Question," and "The Food
   Question." I analyze the success and constraints of selected alternative
   agrifood initiatives in relation to the three questions and introduce a
   fourth, the Emancipatory Question. I conclude that agrifood social
   scientists need to embrace a praxis orientation to agrifood studies and
   participate in social movements designed to create a more socially just
   alternative agrifood system.

AB Despite much popular interest in food issues, there remains a lack of
   social justice in the American agrifood system, as evidenced by
   prevalent hunger and obesity in low-income populations and exploitation
   of farmworkers. While many consumers and alternative agrifood
   organizations express interest in and support social justice goals, the
   incorporation of these goals into on-the-ground alternatives is often
   tenuous. Academics have an important role in calling out social justice
   issues and developing the critical thinking skills that can redress
   inequality in the agrifood system. Academics can challenge ideological
   categories of inquiry and problem definition, include justice factors in
   defining research problems, and develop participatory, problem-solving
   research within social justice movements. In addition, scholars can
   educate students about the power of epistemologies, discourse, and
   ideology, thereby expanding the limits and boundaries of what is
   possible in transforming the agrifood system. In these ways, the academy
   can be a key player in the creation of a diverse agrifood movement that
   embraces the discourse of social justice.

AB This paper describes a role for rural sociology in linking agrifood
   system vulnerabilities to opportunities for encouraging sustainability
   and social justice. I argue that the California rice industry is
   particularly vulnerable for two reasons. First, a quarter of rice
   growers' revenues derive from production-based subsidies that have been
   recently deemed illegal by the World Trade Organization. Second, about
   half of California's rice sales depend on volatile export markets, which
   are susceptible to periodic market access disruptions. Such
   vulnerabilities present political opportunities to reconfigure the
   connection between production and consumption. By exploring how
   production subsidies could be transformed into multifunctionality
   payments, and investigating new regional markets, rural sociology can
   contribute to discussions about how to encourage a more sustainable and
   socially just California rice industry. My discussion aims to prompt
   rural sociologists to explore similar questions in comparable agrifood
   systems.

AB We use the case of red meat food safety to illustrate the need to
   problematize policy. Overtime, there have been numerous red meat
   scandals and scares. We show that the statutes and regulations that
   arose out of these events provided the industry with a means of
   demonstrating safety, facilitating large-scale trade, legitimizing
   conventional production, and limiting interference into its practices.
   They also created systemic fragility, as evidenced by many recent
   events, and hindered the development of an alternative, small-scale
   sector. Thus, the accumulated rules help to structure the sector, create
   superficial resilience, and are used in place of an actual policy
   governing safety. We call for rigorous attention to not only food
   safety, but also the role and effect of agrifood statutes and
   regulations in general, and engagement in policy more broadly.

AB Background: Adequate fruit and vegetable intake has been found to
   promote health and reduce the risk of several cancers and chronic
   diseases. Understanding the psychological determinants of fruit and
   vegetable intake is needed to design effective intervention programs.
   Methods: Papers published in English from 1994 to 2006 that described
   the relationship between psychosocial predictors and fruit and vegetable
   intake in adults were reviewed. Studies and their constructs were
   independently rated based oil the direction of significant effects,
   quality of execution, design suitability, and frequency. Methodology
   from the Guide to Community Preventive Services was used to
   systematically review and synthesize findings.
   Results: Twenty five psychosocial constructs spanning 35 Studies were
   reviewed (14 prospective and 21 cross-sectional/descriptive studies).
   Strong evidence was found for self-efficacy, social support, and
   knowledge as predictors of adult fruit and vegetable intake. Weaker
   evidence was found for variables including barriers, intentions,
   attitudes/beliefs, stages of change, and autonomous motivation.
   Conclusions: The findings underscore the need to design future
   behavioral interventions that use strong experimental designs with
   efficacious constructs and to conduct formal mediation analyses to
   determine the strength of these potential predictors of fruit and
   vegetable intake.

AB Objectives. We explored how young men's perceptions of and participation
   in hip hop culture-urban social and artistic expressions, such as
   clothing style, breakdancing, graffiti, and rap music-and how contextual
   factors of the hip hop scene may be associated with their condom use,
   condom-use self-efficacy, and sense of community.
   Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 95 African American
   and Latino men aged 15 to 25 years as part of a 4-year ethnographic
   study in New York City.
   Results. Differences in young men's perceptions of and levels of
   affiliation with hip hop culture were not statistically associated with
   differences in their sense of community or condom-use self-efficacy.
   Frequency of participation in the hip hop nightclub scene was the
   strongest factor negatively associated with condom use.
   Conclusions. Popular discourses on young men's health risks often blame
   youths' cultures such as the hip hop culture for increased risk
   practices but do not critically examine how risk emerges in urban young
   men's lives and what aspects of youths' culture can be protective.
   Further research needs to focus on contextual factors of risk such as
   the role of hip hop nightlife on increased HIV risk.

AB Objectives. We sought to identify neighborhood-level resources
   associated with lower levels of aggression and delinquency among youths
   aged 9-15 years at baseline after accounting for risk factors and other
   types of resources.
   Methods. Data were derived from the Project on Human Development in
   Chicago Neighborhoods, which focused on 2226 ethnically diverse, urban
   youths, their caregivers, and the 80 neighborhoods in which they resided
   at baseline.
   Results. Living in a neighborhood with a higher concentration of
   organizations or services serving young people and adults was associated
   with lower levels of aggression (odds ratio [OR] =0.9; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] =0.8, 1.0); living in such a neighborhood also moderated
   family, peer, and mentor resources. For example, the presence of
   well-behaved peers was associated with lower levels of aggression among
   youths living in neighborhoods where the concentration of organizations
   and services was at least 1 standard deviation above the mean; the
   association was less strong among youths living in neighborhoods with
   organizations and services 1 standard deviation below the mean or less.
   Conclusions. Certain family, peer, and mentoring resources may confer
   benefits only in the presence of neighborhood resources. Increasing
   neighborhood resources should be considered in interventions designed to
   reduce urban youths' involvement in violence.

AB Objectives. We determined the associations of ecosocial factors and
   psychosocial factors with having a prevalent sexually transmitted
   infection (STI), recent STI diagnoses, and sexual risk behaviors.
   Methods. Young adults aged 18 to 27 years in the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health (n = 14322) provided ecosocial, psychosocial,
   behavioral, and STI-history data. Urine was tested for Chlamydia
   trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae by ligase chain reaction and for
   Trichomonas vaginalis, human papillomavirus, and Mycoplasma genitalium
   by polymerase chain reaction.
   Results. Prevalent STI was associated with housing insecurity (adjusted
   odds ratio [AOR] = 1.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 1.72),
   exposure to crime (AOR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.02,1:80), and having been
   arrested (AOR = 1.4; 95% Cl = 1.07, 1.84). STI prevalence increased
   linearly from 4.9% for 0 factors to 14.6% for 4 or more (P <.001, for
   trend). Nearly all contextual conditions predicted more lifetime
   partners and earlier sexual debut. Recent STI diagnosis was associated
   with childhood sexual abuse, gang participation, frequent alcohol use,
   and depression, adjusted for sexual risk behaviors.
   Conclusions. Often present before sexual debut, contextual conditions
   enhance STI risk by increasing sexual risk behaviors and likelihood of
   exposure to infection. These findings suggest that upstream conditions
   such as housing and safety contribute to the burden of STIs and are
   appropriate targets for future intervention.

   of biofuels depends not only on development of effective and efficient
   technologies but also on the social, economic, and political climate
   within which people decide to use or avoid these new fuel sources and
   technologies. On a social psychological level, individual behaviors are
   often guided by people's attitudes toward the behavior or objects
   involved and by the norms established by others within the social
   setting. Therefore, understanding technology adoption requires an
   understanding of how public attitudes and beliefs are formed or changed,
   as well as the implications of these changes for social norms. We
   provide an overview of basic social psychology research connecting
   attitudes and norms to individual behavior, and we describe implications
   of these social factors for biofuel development and use.

AB Through an ethnographic and participatory investigation, this article
   argues that tango, more than other social or performative dance,
   displays exceptional resilience to a loss of authenticity and aura.
   Three fundamental and distinct types of connection will be examined
   here: the kinetic and somatic relationship between leader and follower;
   musicality, or how the couple moves with the music; and the link dancers
   have with the history and culture of the tango. The first of these
   facets, the kinetic connection, is most important because it
   distinguishes the dance as intimate and dynamic, and superbly
   exemplifies the trademark interpersonal bond of social dancing. In
   conjunction with the social and improvised nature of the dance, the
   kinetic connection enables tango to retain an authentic and auratic
   character, despite the global wayfaring and hybridization the dance
   continues to experience. Finally, this article describes some mores of
   American tango, and discusses implications regarding social capital and
   subcultural resistance through dance.

   outmoded "dominant western worldview" in favor of one that recognizes
   human-ecosystem interdependence. Drawing on field research, I examine
   the practical means by which ecovillages strive to institute and
   reinforce an alternative paradigm. In addition to explicit intention,
   rules, the organization of social interaction, and physical
   characteristics, I identify an expanded notion of community and its

AB A diverse body of literature suggests that social contacts have direct
   regulatory influences on biological rhythms such as the diurnal cortisol
   decline. Although our previous prospective research has found a link
   between social contacts and cortisol secretion, a manipulation of social
   contacts is necessary to definitively evaluate causality. The current
   study involved a laboratory-based manipulation of daily social contacts.
   Fifty-three females experienced both high and low social contact
   conditions in the lab while collecting ambulatory data on their social
   contact and cortisol levels. Data were analyzed using hierarchical
   linear modeling, such that cortisol production on high social contact
   days was compared within person to cortisol production on low social
   contact days. Although the manipulation successfully altered daily
   social contacts, it had no significant effect on cortisol slope.
   However, cortisol slope differences were significant when participants
   had contact with someone whom they usually saw every day. Social
   relationships that provide daily contact may have the strongest
   influence on biological rhythms.

   Examining the creation of local meaning within this context shows that
   its members have developed a significant criticism of the material
   values and work ethic connected to what has been called the American
   Dream. They are generally upper and upper middle-class white men who
   have come out ahead in the economic competition and yet have found it
   emotionally damaging and unfulfilling for themselves and their wives,
   children, and others in their lives. As a result, they take significant
   steps to change their lives, deprioritizing work and economic success in
   favor of emotional values and spiritual well-being. The analysis
   synthesizes ethnography with cultural sociology to explore this curious

AB Women in a small coastal village in western India were asked to explain

   six focus groups (n=60) and individually (n=15) regarding contraceptive
   methods and their use and side-effects. Women publicly denied
   contraceptive use but privately acknowledged limited use. They obtained
   contraceptive information from other village women and believed that
   modem reversible methods and vasectomy have high physical and social
   risks, and fertility goals could be achieved without their use. Women
   felt that reversible contraception is undesirable, socially

   fertility goals is likely due to the use of female sterilization with

AB Racial differences in bone become apparent during puberty. Studies of
   areal bone mineral density (aBMD) generally show the greatest aBMD in
   African Americans followed by American white, Hispanic, and Native
   Americans, with the least aBMD in Asian Americans. Racial differences in
   fracture risk, however, do not exactly follow racial variation in aBMD.
   These group differences in bone mass are largely explained by
   differences in bone size, although calcium intake and physical activity
   are also significant predictors of aBMD and bone mineral content. Racial
   differences in calcium metabolism, as influenced by calcium and sodium
   intake, explain much of the black vs. white differences in skeletal
   calcium accretion during puberty. The relative importance of calcium and
   sodium in calcium metabolism has not yet been elucidated among Asians.
   Predictors of aBMD have been reported for African American and American
   white adults and predictors of aBMD in Chinese American women have
   recently been studied. Much remains to be studied regarding interactions
   between race and diet.

   October 14-19, 2006.
   The Internet is increasingly important for many cancer survivors because
   it provides access to the latest information on cancer treatments and
   also allows them to receive support by participating in online cancer
   support groups. Unfortunately, little is known about why
   African-American cancer survivors are underrepresented in online cancer
   support groups. This article reviews the relevant literature and
   discusses three possible explanations for why African Americans are
   underrepresented in online cancer support groups: the digital
   divide/digital inequality, preferences for face-to-face support or
   culture-specific online support, and trust concerns. We conclude that a
   health inequity exists with regard to the utilization of information
   that can be obtained from online cancer support groups. However, with
   regard to the potential benefits of the psychosocial and emotional
   support aspect of online cancer support groups, a health inequity may
   not exist, as African Americans have other preferred avenues for
   obtaining needed support, and there is no evidence that this is
   detrimental to their health.

AB Despite the dominant role of market fundamentalist ideas in U. S.
   politics over the last thirty years, the Federal government has
   dramatically expanded its capacity to finance and support efforts of the
   private sector to commercialize new technologies. But the partisan logic
   of U. S. politics has worked to make these efforts invisible to
   mainstream public debate. The consequence is that while this " hidden
   developmental state" has had a major impact on the structure of the U.
   S. national innovation system, its ability to be effective in the future
   is very much in doubt. The article ends by arguing that the importance
   of these developmental initiatives to the U. S. economy could present a
   significant opening for new progressive initiatives.

AB The sociology of knowledge, derived from research on the hard sciences,
   overlooks the potential for outsiders to determine the content of
   knowledge within professional disciplines. Using the case of the Sally
   Hemings affair, I introduce the concept of "knowledge advocacy" to
   analyze how outside groups shape historical knowledge. The Hemings
   controversy involved not only historical evidence, but also the
   understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against
   the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates
   successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of "objectivity as
   neutrality" eventually embracing "objectivity as the scientific method"
   in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic
   interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in
   knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the
   potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity
   is compromised.

AB Sociologists of religion have often connected secularization to science,
   but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists
   or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address
   this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite
   academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005.
   Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university
   scientists as well as a change in their religious composition.
   Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to
   natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred
   between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion
   of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists.
   Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general
   population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact
   among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise
   older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists.
   Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master
   identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of
   religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion
   that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and
   connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional
   spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership
   role in society.

   in U. S. sociology, one of which was the "widespread diffusion of a
   relatively clear and sophisticated conception of the place of values in
   sociological study, as an object of research, as a factor in behavior,
   and as an element to be controlled in the prosecution of research''
   (Williams, 1958: 621). In this essay, I ask what has become of that
   rising interest in the sociological study of values? I follow three
   distinct trajectories of sociological research on values, briefly
   describing the contributions of each, and identifying several lines of
   inquiry that strike me as particularly important and promising for the

AB Drawing inspiration from the work of Robin M. Williams Jr., I map out
   the complexities of ethnic and racial relations in the contemporary
   United States by focusing on the impacts of 9/11 - particularly in
   relation to immigration policy. Because the attackers entered the
   country through regular immigration channels (i.e., as foreign students)
   the U. S. government has introduced policies to enhance border security,
   restrict immigration, increase the surveillance of immigrant
   populations, and more actively enforce immigration policy. These
   national-security-related immigration policies, however, are
   exacerbating existing tensions and producing new sets of ethnic and
   racialized conflicts in the United States. In this article, I first
   provide an overview of the key national-security-related immigration
   policies that were passed in the wake of September 11, 2001. Then, I
   review some of the recent sociological literature, as well as draw from
   my own preliminary research in the State of New Jersey, to illustrate
   the social impacts of these policies on ethnic and racial relations. I
   conclude with an outline of the ways the sociology of ethnic and racial
   relations specifically, as well as other subfields of the discipline,
   might approach analyses of social conflict in the contemporary United
   States, post - September 11.

   the top-ranked and second-ranked disciplines on a number of items.
   Sociology fared quite well or well on commitment and concern with
   students, success in conducting research aimed at ameliorating community
   problems, ability to work in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
   teams, involvement in college and university governance, and involvement
   in the surrounding community. Sociology did not fare well on academic
   rigor, success in attracting students to the discipline, success of
   students with regard to occupational and graduate education achievement,
   securing funded grants and contracts, success in producing peer-reviewed
   publications, involvement in international activities, fundraising, and
   overall prestige on campus. The author offers suggestions on how

AB Nearly all of sociology's top graduate training programs require their

   instructors for these courses have an extraordinary opportunity to
   affect the perspectives and practices of future generations of scholars.
   This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices
   of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with
   particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory
   construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the
   discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of
   questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were
   teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of
   the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the
   nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most
   important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However,
   attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical
   theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific
   standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author
   explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices.

AB 'Theory' is one of the most important words in the lexicon of
   contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite
   unclear what sociologists mean by the words 'theory,' 'theoretical,' and
   'theorize.' I argue that confusions about the meaning of 'theory' have
   brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and
   even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions:
   (a) what does 'theory' mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what
   ought 'theory' to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five
   stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about
   'theory.' Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of
   the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some
   difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology
   to. Fourth, I articulate the question, 'what ought "theory" to mean?,'
   which I dub the 'semantic predicament' (SP), and I consider what one can
   learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a
   'semantic therapy' for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP:
   (a) the principle of practical reason-SP is to a large extent a
   political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political
   mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological
   pluralism-the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and
   epistemologically demanding.

AB Drawing on interview data, this article is a case study of the
   "medicated self." Specifically, we analyze how ADHD-diagnosed college
   students construct how they are shaped by the behavioral effects of
   medicine. Students may perceive that pharmaceutical enhancement is
   necessary in the context of a competitive academic ethic. In this
   context something akin to Lareau's concept of concerted cultivation
   thrives as students practice what we call concerted medicalization in an
   attempt to literally embody the academic ideal. However, while medicine
   may enable students to manage academic performance and take control of
   "disordered bodies," many remain uneasy about the extent to which they
   feel controlled by a drug. In the context of medical ambivalence, ADHD
   students engage in reflexive identity management and strategic
   pharmaceutical use to achieve some semblance of self-control and
   self-preservation during their college years. As their college education
   comes to a close, many prepare to return to what they construct as their
   " authentic," nonmedicated selves as they enter the work world.

AB Limited migration results in kin selective pressure on helping behaviors
   under a wide range of ecological, demographic and life-history
   situations. However, such genetically determined altruistic helping can
   evolve only when migration is not too strong and group size is not too
   large. Cultural inheritance of helping behaviors may allow altruistic
   helping to evolve in groups of larger size because cultural transmission
   has the potential to markedly decrease the variance within groups and
   augment the variance between groups. Here, we study the co-evolution of
   culturally inherited altruistic helping behaviors and two alternative
   cultural transmission rules for such behaviors. We find that conformist
   transmission, where individuals within groups tend to copy prevalent
   cultural variants (e.g., beliefs or values), has a strong adverse effect
   on the evolution of culturally inherited helping traits. This finding is
   at variance with the commonly held view that conformist transmission is
   a crucial factor favoring the evolution of altruistic helping in humans.
   By contrast, we find that under one-to-many transmission, where
   individuals within groups tend to copy a "leader" (or teacher),
   altruistic helping can evolve in groups of any size, although the
   cultural transmission rule itself hitchhikes rather weakly with a
   selected helping trait. Our results suggest that culturally determined
   helping behaviors are more likely to be driven by "leaders" than by
   popularity, but the emergence and stability of the cultural transmission
   rules themselves should be driven by some extrinsic factors. Published

AB Low-density residential development has had a tremendous impact on the
   rural New England landscape. The costs of sprawl have been well
   documented in terms of land use and environmental impacts; however,
   there has been less research on the psychological impacts of sprawl.
   Place attachment is an area of research that seeks to understand the
   emotional and psychological connections between people and place. It is
   important to understand and recognize the emotional attachment local
   residents may have to the rural landscape, particularly for planners who
   must address both conservation and residential development in rural
   areas.
   This study explores local residents' attachment to the rural landscape
   in a small but fast-growing town in Maine. In particular, the study
   utilized a photo-preference survey to ascertain the level of attachment
   that local residents have to different landscape types. Further, this
   study examined the influence that landscape attachment has on residents'
   willingness to engage in conservation and land use planning strategies
   (e.g. farmland protection, historic preservation, zoning, and other land
   use planning tools). Results indicate that there is a strong positive
   correlation between rural residents' level of support for conservation
   planning and their level of attachment to the landscape. This study
   renders new evidence for landscape planners that attachment to the land
   can be a strong motivation for building local residents' support for
   land protection strategies. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   long-run or "permanent" income as our dependence measure-which we argue
   is more appropriate than the short-run income-based measure commonly
   used in the literature-we find that for households that collect any
   resources at all, dependence exhibits a U-shaped relationship with
   income. That is, the poorest and richest households depend more on
   resources than households with intermediate incomes. The poorest and
   richest households are also found to be least likely to collect,
   however, indicating that resource use at the income extremes is
   bimodal-either zero or above average. Moreover, the observed trends for
   resources as a whole are not mirrored in those for individual resources.
   Dependence on fuelwood and dung declines with income, for example, while
   dependence on fodder and construction wood increases. These findings
   suggest that common-pool resources are a productive source of income not
   just for the poor but also for the rich, and that improvements in the
   stocks of these resources can potentially form the basis of poverty
   reduction efforts in these economies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Background: Several studies have reported ethnic, education, and income
   differentials in concentrations of selected nutritional biomarkers in
   the US population. Although biomarker measurements are not subject to
   biased self-reports, biologic variability due to individual
   characteristics and behaviors related to dietary exposures contributes
   to within-subject variability and measurement error.
   Objective: We aimed to establish whether the magnitude of components of
   variance for nutritional biomarkers also differs in these high-risk
   groups.
   Design: We used data from 2 replicate measurements of serum
   concentrations of vitamins A, C, D, and E; folate; carotenoids;
   ferritin; and selenium in the third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey second examination subsample (n = 948) to examine the
   within-subject and between-subject components of variance. We used
   multivariate regression methods with log-transformed analyte
   concentrations as outcomes to estimate the ratios of the within-subject
   to between-subject components of variance by categories of ethnicity,
   income, and education.
   Results: In non-Hispanic blacks, the within-subject to between-subject
   variance ratio for beta-cryptoxanthin concentration was higher (0.23;
   95% CI: 0.17, 0.29) relative to non-Hispanic whites (0.13; 0.11, 0.16)
   and Mexican Americans (0.11; 0.07, 0.14), and the lutein + zeaxanthin
   ratio was higher (0.29; 0.21, 0.38) relative to Mexican Americans (0.15;
   0.10, 0.19). Higher income was associated with larger within-subject to
   between-subject variance ratios for serum vitamin C and red blood cell
   folate concentrations but smaller ratios for serum vitamin A. Overall,
   there were few consistent up- or down-trends in the direction of
   covariate-adjusted variability by ethnicity, income, or education.
   Conclusion: Population groups at high risk of adverse nutritional
   profiles did not have larger variance ratios for most of the examined
   biomarkers.

AB A new approach to the statistical estimation of age-period-cohort (APC)
   accounting models, called the intrinsic estimator (IE), recently has
   been developed. This article (1) further describes the IE algebraically,
   geometrically, and verbally, (2) reviews properties of the IE as a
   statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE
   both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4)
   relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained
   APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability,
   hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a
   criticism that often has been lodged at general-purpose methods of APC
   analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE
   that interested users can readily access. The authors conclude that the
   IE holds the potential for applications not only to APC analysis but
   also to similar problems of structural underidentification in sociology.

AB A growing body of literature and experience revolves around the

   and social processes like interaction. This literature argues that the
   natural environment is a critical component of personal and community
   pride and well-being and a stimulus for collaborative action.
   Furthermore, it argues that empowering people to become involved in the
   process of landscape and park creation and maintenance increases social
   interaction, builds community capacity, and supports both development of
   community and community. Tree plantings and other civic environmental
   projects can be used to promote both healthy environments and healthy
   social structure even in the most deteriorated neighborhoods. As such,
   participatory environmental projects are strong tools of community
   development, and the work of arborists and urban foresters can play an
   important part in the process of community.

AB Objective: To assess verbal interactions related to television and other
   electronic media exposure among mothers and 6 month-old-infants.
   Design: Cross-sectional analysis of 154 mother-infant dyads
   participating in a long-term study related to early child development.
   Setting: Urban public hospital.
   Participants: Low socioeconomic status mothers of 6-month-old infants.
   Main Exposure: Media exposure and content.
   Main Outcome Measures: Mother-infant verbal interaction associated with
   media exposure and maternal coviewing.
   Results: Of 154 low socioeconomic status mothers, 149 (96.8%) reported
   daily media exposure in their infants, with median exposure of 120
   (interquartile range, 60-210) minutes in a 24-hour period. Among 426
   program exposures, mother-infant interactions were reported during 101
   (23.7%). Interactions were reported most frequently with educational
   young child-oriented media (42.8% of programs), compared with 21.3% of
   noneducational young child-oriented programs (adjusted odds ratio, 0.4;
   95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.98) and 14.7% of
   school-age/teenage/adult-oriented programs (adjusted odds ratio, 0.2;
   95% confidence interval, 0.1-0.3). Among coviewed programs with
   educational content, mothers reported interactions during 62.7% of
   exposures. Coviewing was not reported more frequently for educational
   young child-oriented programs.
   Conclusions: We found limited verbal interactions during television
   exposure in infancy, with interactions reported for less than
   one-quarter of exposures. Although interactions were most commonly
   reported among programs with educational content that had been coviewed,
   programs with educational content were not more likely to be coviewed
   than were other programs. Our findings do not support development of
   infant-directed educational programming in the absence of strategies to
   increase coviewing and interactions.

   Finally, through what form of public discourse can sociology articulate

AB Successful recruitment and retention of HIV-uninfected at-risk
   participants are essential for HIV vaccine efficacy trials. A
   multicountry vaccine preparedness study was started in 2003 to assess
   enrollment and retention of HIV negative high-risk participants and to
   assess their willingness to participate in future vaccine efficacy
   trials. HIV negative high-risk adults were recruited in the Caribbean,
   in Southern Africa, and in Latin America, and were followed for 1 year.
   Participants included men who have sex with men, heterosexual men and
   women, and female sex workers. History of sexually transmitted
   infections and sexual risk behaviors were recorded with HIV testing at
   0, 6, and 12 months, and willingness to participate in future vaccine
   trials was recorded at 0 and 12 months. Recruitment, retention, and
   willingness to participate in future trials were excellent at 3 of the 6
   sites, with consistent declines in risk behaviors across cohorts over
   time. Although not powered to measure seroincidence, HIV seroincidence
   rates per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]) were as
   follows: 2.3 (95% CI: 0.3 to 8.2) in Botswana, 0.5 (95% CI: 0 to 2.9) in
   the Dominican Republic, and 3.1 (95% CI: 1.1 to 6.8) in Peru. The HIV
   Vaccine Trials Network 903 study helped to develop clinical trial site
   capacity, with a focus on recruitment and retention of high-risk women
   in the Americas, and improved network and site expertise about
   large-scale HIV vaccine efficacy trials.

AB In this paper, longitudinal data from northern Ghana is used to assess
   the effects of encouragement to use family planning that men receive
   from their personal network partners on the adoption of modern
   contraception by their wives. The study tests a conceptual model that,
   in addition to the effect of men's network encouragement, incorporates
   the effect of encouragement to use family planning that women receive
   from their respective network partners and the effect of spousal
   communication on reproductive matters and approval of family planning.
   Results show that encouragement received by men from their social
   networks significantly increases the likelihood of subsequent
   contraceptive use by their wives but this effect operates primarily by
   galvanizing spousal communication on reproductive matters. The effect of
   encouragement received by women from their respective network partners
   is largely independent from the effect of male network encouragement but
   it influences contraceptive adoption both directly and through spousal
   communication.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to identify potential
   explanatory factors for racial differences in blood pressure (BP)
   control.
   DESIGN: The design of the study was a cross-sectional study
   PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: The study included 608 patients with hypertension
   who were either African American (50%) or white (50%) and who received
   primary care in Durham, NC.
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Baseline data were obtained from the Take
   Control of Your Blood pressure study and included clinical, demographic,
   and psychosocial variables potentially related to clinic BP measures.
   African Americans were more likely than whites to have inadequate
   baseline clinic BP control as defined as greater than or equal to 140/90
   mmHg (49% versus 34%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.8; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] 1.3-2.5). Among factors that may explain this disparity,
   being older, reporting hypertension medication nonadherence, reporting a
   hypertension diagnosis for more than 5 years, reporting high levels of
   stress, being worried about hypertension, and reporting an increased
   number of medication side effects were related to inadequate BP control.
   In adjusted analyses, African Americans continue to have poor BP control
   relative to whites; the magnitude of the association was reduced
   (OR=1.5; 95% CI 1.0-2.1). Medication nonadherence, worries about
   hypertension, and older age (> 70) continued to be related to poor BP
   control.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive patients, there were a
   number of factors associated with poor BP control that partially
   explained the observed racial disparity in hypertension control
   including age, medication nonadherence, and worry about BP. Medication
   nonadherence is of particular interest because it is a potentially
   modifiable factor that might be used to reduce the racial disparity in
   BP control.

AB BACKGROUND: Disparities in cancer survival may be related to differences
   in stage. Segregation may be associated with disparities in stage,
   particularly for cancers for which screening promotes survival.
   OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study was to examine whether
   segregation modifies racial/ethnic disparities in stage.
   DESIGN: The design of the study was analysis of Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results Medicare data for seniors with breast,
   colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer (n=410,870).
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The outcome was early- versus late-stage
   diagnosis. Area of residence was categorized into 4 groups: low
   segregation/high income (potentially the most advantaged), high
   segregation/high income, low segregation/low income, and high
   segregation/low income (possibly the most disadvantaged). Blacks were
   less likely than whites to be diagnosed with early-stage breast,
   colorectal, or prostate cancer, regardless of area. For colorectal
   cancer, the black/white disparity was largest in
   low-segregation/low-income areas (black/white odds ratio [OR] of early
   stage 0.51) and smallest in the most segregated areas (ORs 0.71 and
   0.74, P<.005). Differences in disparities in stage by area category were
   not apparent for breast, prostate, or lung cancer. Whereas there were
   few Hispanic-white differences in early-stage diagnosis, the
   Hispanic/white disparity in early-stage diagnosis of breast cancer was
   largest in low-segregation/low-income areas (Hispanic/white OR of early
   stage 0.54) and smallest in high-segregation/low-income areas (OR 0.96,
   P<.05 compared to low-segregation/low-income areas).
   CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in stages for cancers with an established
   screening test were smaller in more segregated areas.

AB In this paper, we provide a framework for understanding variation in
   stakeholder attitudes and behaviors related to public lands and natural
   resources. In this framework, we suggest that individual and collective
   perspectives related to these resources can best be understood by
   examining the congruence between the individual's identity, the identity
   of their cultural group, and the identity of the setting in question.
   Adopting a social constructivist orientation, we suggest that identity
   governs the meanings associated with place that are manifested in
   attitude and behavior. Although a variety of propositions have been
   presented in the literature that have been tailored toward the
   perspectives of specific populations, testing of those propositions have
   highlighted significant limitations. Our framework transcends the
   characteristics of specific social units and provides insight on an
   approach that can be used to understand the perspectives of a broad

AB Background Impaired physical fitness, a contributor to obesity and
   cardiovascular disease, has been associated with both an individual's
   socioeconomic status (SES) and with residence in disadvantaged
   neighborhoods. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which
   neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with impaired
   fitness, independent of clinical characteristics and individual-level
   SES.
   Methods Two thousand five hundred five participants 25 to 42 years old
   examined in the CARDIA study from 1992 to 1993 underwent symptom-limited
   exercise stress testing. Physical fitness was considered impaired if
   metabolic equivalents were in the lowest sex-specific quintile.
   Neighborhood SES was determined for each census tract using 1990 census
   data. Generalized estimating equations assessed the association between
   neighborhood SES and physical fitness, before and after adjustments for
   individual SES, sociodemographic, and clinical characteristics, and
   accounted for clustering within census tracts.
   Results Individuals in disadvantaged neighborhoods had lower educational
   attainment and income, and were more likely unemployed, black, and
   uninsured. The odds ratio (95% CI) for impaired physical fitness in the
   lowest vs highest tertile of neighborhood SES was 5.8 (3.7-7.3). These
   became 3.9 (2.7-5:7) after adjusting for individuals' educational
   attainment, personal income, employment status, and ability to pay for
   basic needs; and 1.9 (1.2-2.9) after additional adjustment for other
   sociodemographic and clinical factors.
   Conclusions Features of one's neighborhood of residence are relevant to
   cardiovascular health. A health policy perspective that looks beyond an
   individual's characteristics may therefore be useful in identifying more
   effective interventions to reduce the prevalence of low physical fitness
   and its consequences in young adults.

   >= 65 from 1992 to 1999 was identified from the surveillance,
   epidemiology, and end results-medicare linked databases with up to 11
   years Of follow-up. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was
   performed to determine the risk of all-cause and breast cancer-specific
   mortality.
   Results: African-American women with breast cancer were more likely to
   live in the poorest quartiles of socioeconomic status at the census
   tract level than whites (73.7% versus 20.7%, P < 0.001). Those living in
   communities with the lowest socioeconomic status were 11% more likely to
   die than those in the highest (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence
   interval, 1.04-1.16). The risk of dying changed slightly after
   controlling foi- race/ethinicity (1.11; 1.05-1.18). Compared with white
   women with breast cancer, crude hazard ratios of all-cause and breast
   cancer-specific mortality were 1.35 (1.27-1.45) and 1.83 (1.56-2.16) for
   African-Americans. After adjusting for treatment and socioeconomic
   status, hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was no longer significant in
   African-Americans (1.02; 0.84-1.10), whereas the risk of breast
   cancer-specific mortality was marginally higher in African-Americans
   (1.21; 1.01-1.46).
   Conclusions: Racial disparities in overall survival between African
   American and white women with breast cancer were not present after
   controlling for treatment and socioeconomic status. Efforts to eliminate
   these barriers have important public health implications for reducing
   disparities in health outcomes.

AB Background Demographic, labor market and economic forces are combining
   to produce increases in the number and percentage of U.S. workers 55 and
   older In some ways these workers will be our most skilled and productive
   employees but in others the most vulnerable.
   Methods The literature on aging and work was reviewed, including
   demographic trends, physical and cognitive changes, safety and
   performance, work ability, and retirement patterns.
   Results and Conclusions Older workers have more serious, but less
   frequent, workplace injuries and illnesses than younger ones. There is
   evidence that many of these problems can be prevented and their
   consequences reduced by anticipating the physical and cognitive changes
   of age. Many employers are aware that such efforts are necessary, but
   most have not yet addressed them. There is a need for implementation and
   evaluative research of programs and policies with four dimensions: the
   work environment, work arrangements and work-life balance, health
   promotion and disease prevention, and social support. Employers who
   establish age-friendly workplaces that promote and support the work
   ability of employees as they age may gain in safety, productivity,
   competitiveness, and sustainable business practices.

AB Objectives To examine the effect of job strain on survey response.
   Methods 1,613 health care workers received a self-administered
   questionnaire. Thirty percent of them completed the survey on personal
   time without any personal monetary compensation. Working conditions were
   extracted by job title from the national database O*NET 6.0. Job strain
   was defined as the ratio of job demands to job control. Two
   complementary models (multi-level logistic and binomial pseudo Poisson
   regressions) were used to model individual survey response as a function
   of individual level demographic variables (age and gender), job-level
   socioeconomic status (SES) and job strain, and facility type (third
   level).
   Results Survey response was associated with higher SES and with less job
   strain. The association of SES and survey response was mediated by job
   strain.
   Conclusion Employees' exposure to job strain may be an important
   influence on survey response, at least for workers who are not
   compensated for their time in completing a survey.

AB Background: Walking to school may be an important source of daily
   physical activity in children's lives, and government agencies are
   supporting programs to encourage walking to school (e.g., Safe Routes to
   School and the CDC's KidsWalk programs). However, little research has
   looked at differences in behavior across racial/ethnic and income
   groups.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study used data from the 2001 National
   Household Travel Survey to document rates of walking and biking to
   school among low-income and minority youth in the U.S. (N= 14,553).
   Binary models of the decision to use active transport to school were
   developed to simultaneously adjust for trip, individual, household, and
   neighborhood correlates. All analyses were conducted in 2007.
   Results: The data showed that low-income and minority groups,
   particularly blacks and Hispanics, use active travel modes to get to
   school at much higher rates than whites or higher-income students.
   However, racial variation in travel patterns is removed by controlling
   for household income, vehicle access, distance between home and school,
   and residential density.
   Conclusions: Active transportation to school may be an important
   strategy to increase and maintain physical activity levels for
   low-income and minority youth. Current policy interventions such as Safe
   Routes to School have the opportunity to provide benefits for low-income
   and minority students who are the most likely to walk to school.

AB We conducted a 10-day diary study that assessed daily stressors and
   end-of-day affect and self-esteem. We predicted that sociotropy would be
   associated with stronger sadness and self-esteem reactivity to daily
   interpersonal, but not achievement events, and that autonomy would be
   associated with the same pattern for daily achievement, but not
   interpersonal events. For the sample as whole, both daily interpersonal
   and achievement stressors were related to increased sadness and
   decreased self-esteem. As expected, the relationships involving
   interpersonal stressors were stronger for those high on sociotropy.
   However, the negative relationship between achievement stressors and
   self-esteem was also stronger for those high on sociotropy. Autonomy was
   associated with weaker self-esteem reactivity to interpersonal
   stressors. Our results are consistent with previous research on major
   life events, suggesting that sociotropy functions as a nonspecific
   vulnerability factor, and that autonomy's role is unclear. Our results
   also suggest the heuristic value of a daily diary design to study the
   mechanisms underlying vulnerability factors' role in the development and
   maintenance of depression.

   foregrounds its Freudian and Durkheimian aspects and explicates the

   dynamics of moral panics to the dynamics of culture wars, the author
   shows that both phenomena involve group relations and status

   one not only of adapting a southern subsistence to an extreme climate
   but also to the effects of Russian colonization, Soviet
   collectivization, and post-Soviet decentralization. In the post-Soviet
   period a majority of rural Viliu Sakha adapted to the loss of a
   centralized agro-industrial state farm system by developing a
   smallholder food production system relying on cattle husbandry
   supplemented with other subsistence sources including fish, game,
   forage, other domesticates, and garden products. In the twenty-first
   century, this "cows-and-kin" system represents a resilient smallholder
   adaptation based on reviving pre-Soviet production knowledge, recalling
   ecological knowledge, and relying on kin. The article concludes with a
   discussion of the future of cows-and-kin by exploring issues of
   alienated youth, accessing land and the overwhelming concern of
   inhabitants about the local effects of global climate change.

AB The juxtaposition of nonfarming residences to operating dairy farms
   often precipitates conflict over appropriate land use. This was the
   situation facing the residents of the town of Charlotte, Vermont, in
   2002 when a local dairy farmer proposed expanding from 225 to 684 cows
   with the construction of a new dairy facility and manure storage lagoon.
   The proposal raised considerable concern within the community and
   presented a unique opportunity for extension researchers to examine and
   analyze the attitudes and concerns of local residents toward the planned
   expansion, including their reasons for supporting or opposing the
   expansion, and to develop recommendations for farm operators considering
   future expansions. A survey instrument was developed and inserted in a
   local newspaper that was delivered to all households of Charlotte to
   identify important concerns of the community and explanatory factors
   differing between supporters and nonsupporters. Of those responding to
   the survey, 44.3% opposed the proposed dairy facility, 30.6% supported
   it, 17.9% needed more information to make a decision, and 7.2% had no
   opinion or were unaware of the proposal. There were no significant
   demographic (age, gender, educational attainment) differences between
   supporters and nonsupporters. Yet, the closer the proximity of the
   respondent's residence to the farm, the more likely he or she was to
   oppose it (ss =1.018). The concerns of greatest importance were water
   quality (4.42/5), effect on property values (3.07/5), and animal welfare
   (3.58/5). Responses to the open-ended questions on the survey revealed
   strong views toward the farmer personally as well as concentrated animal
   feeding operations in general. The results indicate that farmers and
   extension need to take proactive steps to provide education and
   information relevant to the facts and issues surrounding new dairy
   facilities for 500 to 700 dairy cows.

AB Objective: To examine the association of self-reported health (SRH) with
   the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, life stress, and sociobehavioural
   factors in adults aged 55 and over.
   Design: Secondary analysis of data from the Social Environment and
   Biomarkers of Aging Study (SEBAS) in Taiwan in 2000, comprising 1023
   individuals in 24 communities, using multilevel logistic regression.
   Results: Allele frequencies are 7.9%, 84.7% and 7.4% for E2, E3 and E4,
   respectively, similar to those reported in other populations of Asian
   origins. The apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele was significantly
   associated with poor SRH overall (odds ratio (OR) 1.54, 95% confidence
   interval (CI) 1.03 to 2.35), but the association was stronger in women
   (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.88) than in men. Individuals who were not
   satisfied with their living arrangement (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.99 to 5.29),
   lived with more than five people in a household (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.11 to
   2.09) or suffered from housing damage in the 1999 earthquake (OR 1.54,
   95% CI 0.99 to 2.39) were more likely to report negatively on their
   heath. Individuals who had secondary education (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.30 to
   0.91), often ate vegetables and fruits (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.94) or
   exercised often (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.77) were less likely to
   negatively rate their health. A significant interaction between the
   APOE4 allele and physical exercise was found to be associated with SRH.
   Conclusions: The APOE4 allele and life-stress factors are associated
   with SRH, especially in women. Physical exercise is good for health, but
   benefits may be attenuated among APOE4 allele carriers. This is the
   first evidence associating a genetic factor and an interaction between
   APOE4 and physical exercise with SRH. We suggest that well studied
   genetic factors should be included in health research to control
   potential heterogeneity.

AB Homeless youth are one of the most marginalized groups in our society.
   Many researchers identify much higher levels of various problem
   behaviors among these youth compared to their non-homeless peers. The
   Current study examined the utility of social capital in predicting
   problem behaviors among homeless youth. Overall, the theoretically
   derived social capital variable significantly predicted substance use
   frequency, sexual risk behavior, depression, delinquent behavior as well
   as number of days homeless. Thus, social capital was useful in
   understanding and predicting the current life situation among these
   youth and may be worthy of further study. Findings suggest that
   meaningful change should utilize interventions that go beyond the
   individual and are geared towards modifying the social context of
   individuals' lives.

AB Decision making in a social group has two distinguishing features.
   First, humans and other animals routinely alter their behavior in
   response to changes in their physical and social environment. As a
   result, the outcomes of decisions that depend on the behavior of
   multiple decision makers are difficult to predict and require highly
   adaptive decision-making strategies. Second, decision makers may have
   preferences regarding consequences to other individuals and therefore
   choose their actions to improve or reduce the well-being of others. Many
   neurobiological studies have exploited game theory to probe the neural
   basis of decision making and suggested that these features of social
   decision making might be reflected in the functions of brain areas
   involved in reward evaluation and reinforcement learning. Molecular
   genetic studies have also begun to identify genetic mechanisms for
   personal traits related to reinforcement learning and complex social
   decision making, further illuminating the biological basis of social
   behavior.

AB Objective: To describe the prospective relationship between social
   networks and nonfatal stroke events in a sample of women with suspected
   myocardial ischemia. Social networks are an independent predictor of
   all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but their relationship with
   stroke events in at-risk populations is largely unknown. Method: A total
   of 629 women (mean age = 59.6 +/- 11.6 years) were evaluated at baseline
   for cardiovascular disease risk factors as part of a protocol including
   coronary angiography; the subjects were followed over a median 5.9 years
   to track the incidence of cardiovascular events including stroke.
   Participants also completed the Social Network Index (SNI), measuring
   the presence/absence of 12 types of common social relationships.
   Results: Stroke events occurred among 5.1 % of the sample over
   follow-up. More isolated women were older and less educated, with higher
   rates of smoking and hypertension, and increased use of cardiovascular
   medications. Women with smaller social networks were also more likely to
   show elevations (scores of >= 10) on the Beck Depression Inventory (54%
   versus 41%, respectively; p = .003). Relative to women with higher SNI
   scores, Cox regression results indicated that more isolated women
   experienced strokes at greater than twice the rate of those with more
   social relationships after adjusting for covariates (hazard ratio = 2.7;
   95% Confidence Interval = 1.1-6.7). Conclusions: Smaller social
   networks, are a robust predictor of stroke in at-risk women, and the
   magnitude of the association rivals that of conventional risk factors.

AB Sociologists may encounter myriad obstacles in the research process that
   affect the research design and outcomes. There is, for example, a
   certain measure of resistance and hostility experienced in sociological
   research on distasteful social movements that is seldom acknowledged or
   included in published findings. The present analysis explores the
   emotional conflicts between the research program and the 'gatekeeping'
   activities of research respondents and the professional academic
   community in the USA. Politically sensitive, even volatile subjects such
   as the US immigration reform movement may rest on the classic
   affective/cognitive dichotomy found in sociology. I suggest that
   moralistic or politically positioned emotional resistance complicated
   the research process in two ways: 1) academic associates and mentors
   likened involvement with the immigration reform movement to scholarly
   complicity that marginalized the study's validity; and, 2) activists
   were inherently distrustful of the research and its goals given what
   they claimed to be a history of misinterpretation and scholarly 'bad

AB Across the field of higher education and within the discipline of

   emerged. While not absolutely in sync, there is a striking overlap
   across three of the most visible of these: Boyer's Scholarship
   Reconsidered, Carnegie's Stewardship of the Discipline, and Burawoy's
   Public Sociology. Putting the development of these conceptualizations
   into the larger context of shifts in higher education, I briefly review
   each, putting special emphasis on the synergy among them. However,
   despite these overarching guides and a number of other noted innovations
   (particularly in the scholarship of teaching and learning), new
   challenges have arisen, I end by discussing these new developments,
   drawing from basic sociological research to provide insights for
   maintaining gains and pushing these efforts forward. In particular, SoTL
   and the aging of the cohort of leaders who pioneered these redefinition
   efforts emphasize the importance of Preparing Future Faculty (PFF)
   programs, and the placement of new PhDs with this broad vision in
   PhD-granting departments, as well as in liberal arts colleges and

   considerably more likely than other sociologists to engage students in

AB This paper advances the concept of a coupled social-ecological system
   (SES), where human and biophysical systems are closely linked, to
   examine and explain variations in landscape values perceived by people
   in their region. In this paper, we describe an approach that allows the
   mapping of SES by linking survey research with geographic information
   systems (GIS) to provide spatial representations of social and
   ecological system convergence. Using survey data that measured landscape
   values from multiple communities on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, we
   identify geographical areas where both human-perceived and physically
   measured ecological values overlap and are referred to as
   social-ecological "hotspots". Community landscape values, collected as
   point data, were used to generate point density maps to produce hotspot
   surfaces for each value. These value surfaces were spatially
   cross-correlated with other communities' value surfaces and with an
   ecological map layer (net primary productivity) to demonstrate
   social-ecological mapping. Moderate spatial cross-correlation
   coefficients were found between most landscape values by community with
   18 hotspot surfaces pairings exhibiting strong positive spatial cross
   correlations. Moderately significant, positive linear relationships were
   found between perceived biological values and net primary productivity
   for three of six communities. The exploratory spatial analysis presented
   in this paper is a first step in identifying and describing the presence
   of SES in a regional context. We conclude the paper by discussing the
   potential managerial and ecological implications of coupled
   social-ecological systems including system resilience and vulnerability,
   and the limitations of the approach that need to be considered. (c) 2007

AB If individuals will cooperate with cooperators, and punish
   non-cooperators even at a cost to themselves, then this strong
   reciprocity could minimize the cheating that undermines cooperation.
   Based upon numerous economic experiments, some have proposed that human
   cooperation is explained by strong reciprocity and norm enforcement.
   Second-party punishment is when you punish someone who defected on you;
   third-party punishment is when you punish someone who defected on
   someone else. Third-party punishment is an effective way to enforce the
   norms of strong reciprocity and promote cooperation. Here we present new
   results that expand on a previous report from a large cross-cultural
   project. This project has already shown that there is considerable
   cross-cultural variation in punishment and cooperation. Here we test the
   hypothesis that population size (and complexity) predicts the level of
   third-party punishment. Our results show that people in larger, more
   complex societies engage in significantly more third-party punishment
   than people in small-scale societies.

AB Objective: The relationship between suicide and social class has been
   equivocal. While some authors have reported that higher social class is
   related to higher rates of suicide, most other studies report that lower
   social class is associated with higher rates of suicide. Our study
   attempted to resolve these inconsistencies by using a High Risk for
   schizophrenia method.
   Method: Children of women with severe schizophrenia were assessed in
   1962. In 2005, when subjects were a mean age of 58 years, we identified
   those who had committed suicide.
   Results: A higher rate of suicide was associated with risk for
   schizophrenia in the High-Risk sample. Higher social class origin was
   associated with suicide in persons at risk for mental illness.
   Conclusion: Higher social class origin was associated with suicide in
   subjects at genetic risk for schizophrenia (but not those without risk).

AB This study uses appraisal theory, functionalist approach to emotions,
   and recent theory on group emotions as a basic framework to model the
   genesis of supporting military action. During the year after the events
   of 9/11, 588 college students participated in a series of four studies
   that assessed religious affiliation, appraisal antecedents, anger
   response to viewing photographs of the 9/11 attack, and support for
   military action. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that the
   relation between support for the war and attitudes toward terrorism and
   relevance could be explained adequately by a model in which anger
   mediated the effects of attitudes and relevance on support. Attitudes
   toward terrorism were further identified as mediators that could explain
   the group effect by Christians. The result was not only generalizable
   across the conflict in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also in terms of how
   consent for war manifests itself-outright calls for bloodshed versus
   more subtle, politically loaded, posturing (e.g. entreaties to "support
   our troops").

AB Background: The suggested declining trend in social capital among
   Americans could be due, in part, to long commute times associated with
   urban sprawl.
   Methods: In 2007, the 2001 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) was
   used to determine the association between commute time and
   socially-oriented trips, a proxy measure of social capital, while
   controlling for individual-level and regional-level characteristics.
   Socially-oriented trips were those taken to: attend school/religious
   activities; attend social/recreational activities; visit
   friends/relatives; go out for entertainment; attend
   funerals/weddings/social events; exercise/play sports; attend to
   family/personal obligations; participate in organizational meetings; or
   transport someone. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated for the
   association between commute time and socially-oriented trips for
   full-time working adults (N=54,747).
   Results: Higher commute time (>20 minutes) was significantly associated
   with no socially-oriented trips (adjusted OR=1.17, 95% CI=1.09-1.25).
   The strongest association was among 90+ minute commuters (adjusted OR=
   1.50, 95% CI= 1.16-1.94).
   Conclusions: This study suggests that individuals with longer commutes
   have less access to social capital, as indicated by fewer
   socially-oriented trips.

AB The association between cultural orientation and material outcomes is

   understanding of this relationship by exploring how religious
   affiliation affects wealth ownership for conservative Protestants (CPs).
   The results demonstrate that religion affects wealth indirectly through
   educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation.
   The results also provide evidence of a direct effect of religion on
   wealth. Low rates of asset accumulation and unique economic values
   combine to reduce CP wealth beyond the effects of demographics. The
   findings improve understanding of the relationship between religious
   beliefs and inequality.

AB We use a reputational approach to create a theory of martyrdom that
   synthesizes scholarship on the body politic, cultural symbols, and
   collective memory. The making of a martyr, a contested social process,
   depends on both the resources of the martyr's supporters and the
   cultural context into which the martyr's image is introduced. Our
   approach is well suited to analyzing how martyrs are used 'on the
   ground' and given cultural and material utility. We highlight the
   attention paid to the conception and reception of the martyr's corporeal
   body, in particular, as a source of identity and meaning, giving
   emotional weight to social ideas about death and sacrifice. Control over
   martyrs' bodies derives from the cultural and political intricacies of
   reputational entrepreneurship, thus employing the body as a medium of
   culture. To examine this concept of embodied martyrdom, we examine the
   cases of Joan of Arc, John Brown, and Che Guevara.

AB To address the dearth of literature on the relations between local
   residents in urban areas and nearby higher-order exurban protected
   areas, this study examined the perceptions of Columbia (South Carolina)
   residents toward Congaree National Park. Mail-out survey results from a
   random sample of 455 adult residents showed positive overall attitudes
   toward the park, although this did not extend to a desire to personally
   volunteer in park activities. Cluster analysis on the basis of seven
   perceptual statements produced three groups: "very enthusiastic park
   supporters" (VEPS), accounting for one fourth of the sample; "less
   enthusiastic park supporters" (LEPS), accounting for approximately one
   half of the sample; and "ambivalents" (AMBS), accounting for the rest.
   The AMBS tend to be younger than members of the other clusters and have
   higher income, but enthusiasm was more clearly related to high levels of
   interaction and awareness relative to the park. Managerial implications
   of the study are considered, including the need to encourage higher
   levels of park awareness and visitation, as well as more ecologically
   responsible behavior, among residents of the greater Columbia urban
   area.

AB Same-sex friendships are an important source of social support and
   typically contribute to positive adjustment. However, there can be
   adjustment trade-offs if the friends co-ruminate (i.e., talk excessively
   about problems) in that co-rumination is related to having close
   friendships but also to increased internalizing symptoms. The current
   study utilized an experimental manipulation that elicited co-rumination
   in young women and thus mirrored an everyday response to stress.
   Observed co-rumination was associated with a significant increase in the
   stress hormone, cortisol (after controlling for self-reported
   co-rumination and for cortisol levels assessed before the discussion of
   problems). These findings suggest that co-rumination can amplify, rather
   than mitigate, the hormonal stress response to personal life stressors.

AB Little is known about spatial inequalities and potential access to the

   ground-truthed methods that included direct observation and on-site
   Global Positioning System technology to examine the relationship between
   neighborhood inequalities (e.g., socioeconomic deprivation and minority
   composition) and network distance from all 101 rural neighborhoods to
   the nearest food store (FS). Neighborhood deprivation was determined
   from socioeconomic characteristics using 2000 census block group (CBG)
   data. Network distances were calculated from the population-weighted
   center of each CBG to the nearest supermarket, grocery, convenience, and
   discount store. Multiple regression models examined associations among
   deprivation, minority composition, population density, and network
   distance to the nearest FS. The median distance to the nearest
   supermarket was 14.9 km one way (range 0.12 to 54.0 km). The distance
   decreased with increasing deprivation, minority composition, and
   population density. The worst deprived neighborhoods with the greatest
   minority composition had better potential spatial access to the nearest
   FS. For > 20% of all rural residents, their neighborhoods were at least
   17.7 km from the nearest supermarket or full-line grocery or 7.6 km from
   the nearest convenience store. This makes food shopping a challenge,
   especially in rural areas that lack public transportation and where many
   have no vehicular access. Knowledge of potential access to the food
   environment is essential for combining environmental approaches and
   health interventions so that families, especially those in rural areas,
   can make healthier food choices.

AB Objective: American Indians and Alaska Natives have the nation's highest
   morbidity and mortality owing to alcohol but also have opportunities to
   employ policies that could reduce the harmful effects of drinking. As
   sovereign nations, federally recognized tribes can adopt policies that
   are highly likely to have a beneficial impact on alcohol problems. The
   most recently published nationwide research on American Indian alcohol
   policies (conducted some 30 years ago) suggested that tribal policies
   may help minimize adverse consequences related to drinking. However,
   much has changed in Indian country during the last few decades,
   including redefinitions of relationships among tribes, states, and the
   federal government; recognition of tribes not previously acknowledged by
   federal authorities; and the advent of gaming and casinos. These
   developments raise numerous questions regarding the adoption and
   implementation of policies pertaining to alcohol. Method: This project
   used the Federal Register to catalog alcohol statutes adopted by the 334
   federally recognized tribes in the lower 48 states between 1975 and
   2006. Tribes that do not have an alcohol policy have, by default,
   retained federal prohibition. Results: During the 30-year study period,
   the percentage of tribes with statutes that permit alcohol increased
   from 29.2% to 63.5%. Later policies showed increases in complexity; such
   as tribal licensing requirements and facility restrictions to accompany
   increases in gaming and tourism. Conclusions: These data are highly
   relevant to Native decision makers as they attempt to develop and
   implement policies that will minimize the harmful effects of alcohol
   among indigenous peoples.

   secondary sex ratios (males: 100 females) were 102, 108, and 141;
   respectively, for the parental, present, and projected generations.
   Average family size decreased progressively during the period of study.
   Secondary sex ratios ranged from 97 to 108 males: 100 females. Gender
   composition of the first two and three children influenced parities in
   two ways, namely preference for both genders and preference for males.
   Results of the present and previous studies indicated that the most
   desired families consisted of two children, both genders, and the male
   born first. Realization of this preference would contribute toward a
   balanced sex ratio. Other preferences included more male than female
   children. Overall, sex ratios for desired families in the four studies

   overcome the organizational barriers low-income minorities face in
   trying to obtain screening colonoscopy. Patients of average risk for CRC
   were referred by their primary care physician for screening colonoscopy.
   After the PN received the referral, patients were randomly assigned to
   either receive navigation (PN+) to screening colonoscopy or not receive
   navigation (PN-) We hypothesized that a PN would increase patient
   compliance with screening colonoscopy. A total of 21 patients were
   enrolled in the pilot study (PN+= 13, PN-=8); 54% of navigated patients
   completed screening colonoscopy versus 13% of nonnavigated patients
   (p=0.058). Eighty-six percent of navigated patients had an excellent or
   very good colon prep; however, there was no difference in prep quality
   between groups (p=0.10). One-hundred percent of navigated patients were
   very satisfied with navigation services. A PIN improves compliance with
   screening colonoscopy in low-income minorities. Larger studies are
   needed to evaluate what features of navigation are most effective in

AB Much of the debate about the ethics of enhancement has proceeded
   according to two framing assumptions. The first is that although
   enhancement carries large social risks, the chief benefits of
   enhancement are to those who are enhanced (or their parents, in the case
   of enhancing the traits of children). The second is that, because we now
   understand the wrongs of state-driven eugenics, enhancements, at least
   in liberal societies, will be personal goods, chosen or not chosen in a
   market for enhancement services. This article argues that both framing
   assumptions must be rejected, once it is understood that some
   enhancements-especially those that are most likely to garner resources
   and become widespread-will increase human productivity. Once one
   appreciates the productivity-increasing potential of enhancements, one
   can begin to see that enhancement need not be primarily a zero sum
   affair, that the,social costs of forgoing enhancements may be great, and
   that the state may well take an interest in facilitating biomedical
   enhancements, just as it does in facilitating education and other
   productivity-increasing traditional enhancements. Appreciating the
   productivity-increasing potential of enhancements also makes it possible
   to view the enhancement debate in a new light, through the lens of the
   ethics of development.

AB Health care in the United States has become a privilege rather than a
   right. Patients who have the greatest need are the ones most likely to
   be denied this privilege. Despite recent advances in disease detection
   and treatment, many patients do not receive even the bare minimum of
   care. The high complexity of the health care system in the setting of
   patients with low levels of health literacy significantly affects the
   ability to seek and receive treatment in a timely fashion. In addition,
   lack of insurance, transportation, and social support further complicate
   access to care. To truly provide a standard of care to all patients,
   regardless of resources, our health care system must evolve to address
   the needs of the population. In this paper, we report a tragic case
   where social factors affected the outcome of. a single mother with
   advanced cervical cancer.

AB A complex array of socio-historical, demographic, and organizational
   factors have combined in recent years to threaten both the current
   status of and future prospects for the discipline of rural sociology,
   and for the Rural Sociological Society (RSS). This paper examines the
   somewhat problematic recent trajectories of the RSS as a professional
   organization and of.,rural sociology more generally and notes a degree
   of disciplinary and organizational inertia that have limited the pursuit
   of new directions. It also presents a discussion of selected factors
   that have contributed to these concerns, including both "external"
   factors that are largely beyond the organizational reach of RSS and
   "internal" factors that are more directly linked to organizational
   characteristics and actions. Drawing upon the distinctions between "red
   ocean" and "blue ocean" strategies outlined by market strategists Kim
   and Mauborgne, the discussion then shifts to a focus on action
   alternatives that, if pursued, could help to create an expanded set of
   opportunities and a brighter future for rural sociology, and for the
   Rural Sociological Society.

AB Sociology with a Southern face characterizes Southern sociologists and
   Southern social issues. This article asks why we are sociologists and
   what we are doing about it in the South. I posit that many Southern
   sociologists share common biographical experiences that provide insights
   for understanding and solving Southern problems. Longstanding conditions
   of the Black Belt are used as an example with special focus on Southern
   demographics and persistent impoverishment. Given the magnitude of the
   southern issues involved, I believe there are good reasons for doing
   sociology about the South. I conclude with a call for sociologists with
   Southern faces - wherever they live - to pay greater attention to
   solutions as well as using our sociological expertise to diagnose social
   problems we see through the Southern face of sociology.

AB Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge
   from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions
   produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A
   work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers
   that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get
   from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained.
   The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings
   reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance
   feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to
   feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations.
   These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest
   that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on
   emotions.

AB Many analysts of civil society argue that the path from activity in

   mediated-membership leads to unintentional political socialization
   through discussion and/or cognitive engagement, which then leads to
   participation. Others, however, have noted that groups are often
   effective in the direct mobilization of their members. This article
   tests these competing claims, while also considering the extent to which
   the mediation process relies on negative social capital (targeted
   requests for activity). Employing a series of structural equation
   models, I find strong support for the mediation argument, as well as for
   the perspective that negative social capital is a significant mediator
   in the pathway from social joiner to political activist.

AB Drawing on recent advances in community-ecological research, emerging

   current research on gender stratification, this article lays out a
   theoretical framework and offers evidence of the importance of two forms
   of male capital, men in families and old heads, for lessening female and
   male violence rates across communities. Using arrest and ecological data
   from more than 1,600 counties and seemingly unrelated regression
   techniques, the author finds that the presence of men in families is
   integral to community efforts to reduce both female and male violence
   levels, net controls for ecological variables; old heads are moderately
   effective in reducing male violence levels. Men in families have robust
   effects on both female and male violence rates, though male homicide is
   somewhat more responsive to shifts in the presence of men in families
   and old heads. Gender differences across other ecological variables are
   minimal.

AB This study advances the sociological inquiry on social categories by
   synthesizing two lines of research in economic and organizational
   sociology - studies of industrial categories in market dynamics and
   neo-institutional analyses of social categories. It compares the
   classificatory schemes and structures in the California and French wine
   industries and investigates the impact of institutionalized categories
   on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price.
   Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems,
   similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and
   affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound
   consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in
   classification systems. They also enrich the institutional analyses by
   demonstrating that institutional categories systematically differentiate
   market products and create social differences and hierarchies.

AB Donald Black insists that sociology must be purged of its psychological
   elements in order to become a genuinely distinct and scientific
   discipline. But such "purification" is simultaneously unnecessary,
   undesirable, and unattainable. It is unnecessary because the scientific
   shortcomings of sociology are indigenous and have nothing to do with
   psychologism. Indeed, a more scientific sociology would look more, not
   less, like psychology. Purity is undesirable in that it is not only not
   a scientific virtue, but is antithetical to the very scientific values
   that Black invokes to justify it. His systems are neither theories nor
   laws, but heuristics, more akin to common sense than to scientific
   theory. Finally, purity is unattainable because though society is indeed
   discontinuous with the individuals who make it up, it and all theorizing
   about it, are ontologically and conceptually dependent upon them.

   These include the following: that the theory is literally false, and is
   not defensible as an approximation; that the magnitudes to which his
   "geometry" refers are not magnitudes according to standard measurement
   theory: that the form of the theory precludes testing by correlational

   that elite, corpulent athletes might enact through their mere presence,

   to disciplining bodies is not a point of contention for us. It is,
   however, unclear where the disciplining lines are drawn, and what
   happens when bodies that resist corporeal rationality refuse to
   disappear. What are the consequences of/for publicly successful,
   undisciplined bodies operating instead in a corporeal irrationality? Of
   course this entire line of questioning suggests fissures in the

AB Lower socioeconomic status (SES) was associated with reduced treadmill
   exercise capacity and predicted adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Why
   patients with low SES had reduced exercise capacity and whether this
   relation existed in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) was not
   known. Using data from the Heart and Soul Study, the association of 4
   indicators of SES (household income, education, housing status, and
   occupation) with treadmill exercise capacity was analyzed in 943 men and
   women with stable CHD. In multivariable linear regression models
   adjusted for demographic variables, co-morbiditie's, medication use, and
   health behaviors (smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, physical
   activity, and medication adherence), exercise capacity significantly
   decreased in a graded fashion from the highest to lowest categories of
   each SES variable (p <0.001 for all trends). Differences in exercise
   capacity between the lowest and highest SES categories were 2.4 METs for
   household income, 1.8 METs for education, 2.3 METs for housing, and 1.3
   METs for occupation. In similarly adjusted logistic regression models
   comparing the lowest with the highest categories of SES, low SES was
   strongly associated with impaired exercise capacity (defined as <5 METs;
   odds ratios for income 5.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 16.0;
   education 4.3, 95% CI 2.0 to 9.5; housing 4.5, 95% CI 2.1 to 9.6; and
   occupation 2.8, 95% Cl 1.4 to 5.7, p <= 0.001 for all trends). In
   conclusion, 4 indicators of low SES were strongly associated with
   decreased exercise capacity in patients with CHD. Differences in
   traditional cardiac risk factors and health behaviors did not explain

AB There is growing awareness that common mental health disorders are key
   contributors to the burden of disease in developing countries. Studies
   examining the correlates of mental health have primarily been carried
   out in urban settings and focused on the burden rapid economic change
   places on individuals. In these settings, poverty and low education are
   consistent predictors of anxiety and depressive symptoms. We argue here
   that these variables are proxies for insecurity, and that a more general
   model of symptoms of depression and anxiety should focus on locally
   salient forms of insecurity. Building on previous work in a seasonal
   subsistence setting, we identify food insecurity as a potent source of
   insecurity in a rural African setting, and then test whether seasonal
   changes in food insecurity are correlated with concomitant changes in a
   measure of symptoms of anxiety and depression among 173 caretakers.
   Results indicate that food insecurity is a strong predictor of symptoms
   of anxiety and depression (P < 0.0001), that changes in food insecurity
   across the seasons predict changes in symptoms of anxiety and depression
   (P < 0.0001), and that this is robust to the inclusion of covariates for
   material assets and household production. These results hold for
   individuals in both ethnic groups studied (Pimbwe and Sukuma); however,
   at the group level the burden falls disproportionately on Pimbwe. The
   results add to the growing literature on the causes of population level
   differences in mental health disorders and suggest new research avenues
   and strategies to link mental health disorders with variation in
   physical and biosocial outcomes.

   Next, the article reviews three structural theories of police violence
   developed as part of Western sociology but applied to Brazil-the
   reaction-to-crime, the reaction-to-violence, and the threat models.
   Lastly, using occurrence data on reports of police excessive use of
   force (n = 4018) from the University of S (a) over tilde Paulo Nucleo,
   de Estudos de Violencia (Center for the Study of Violence) database on
   Gross Human Rights Violations, these three theories are tested with time
   series regression techniques through the regression of municipality
   rates of police violence on crime rates, concentrations of
   Afro-Brazilians and rural state migrants, and poverty indicators. The
   findings offer no support for threat explanations. The findings do
   support a partial reaction-to-crime explanation for police violence with
   rates of assault and robbery having a positive relationship to rates of
   police violence. Rates of homicide were found to have a negative
   relationship, indicating that homicide may be addressed by official
   policing practices whereas police may react to robbery and assault with
   "unofficial" violence.

AB The Nazi's cornerstone precept of "racial hygiene" gave birth to their
   policy of "racial cleansing" that led to the murders of millions. It was
   developed by German physicians and scientists in the late 19th century
   and is rooted in the period's Social Darwinism that placed blacks at the
   bottom of the racial ladder. This program was first manifested in the
   near-extermination of the African Herero people during the German
   colonial period. After WWI, the fear among the German populace that
   occupying African troops and their Afro-German children would lead to
   "bastardization" of the German people formed a unifying racial principle
   that the Nazis exploited. They extended this mind-set to a variety of
   "unworthy" groups, leading to the physician-administered racial
   Nuremberg laws, the Sterilization laws, the secret sterilization of
   Afro-Germans, and the German euthanasia program. This culminated in the
   extermination camps.

   Mississippi in the US, destroying properties and flooding areas. Many
   people left the region and still have not returned. While some of these
   people may eventually return, some may not, becoming "migrants."
   Assuming this phenomenon will occur, is it unique? What is the role of
   the environment in migration? Can there be violent conflict between such
   migrants and residents in areas absorbing migrants? We evaluate these
   questions in the cases of Hurricane Katrina, the US Dust Bowl in the
   1930s, and Bangladesh since the 1950s, demonstrating that environmental
   change can trigger large out-migration, which can cause violent conflict
   in areas receiving migrants. These findings have important policy
   implications. Climate change is expected to degrade the environment
   considerably in this century. Minimizing climate change-induced
   migration and violent conflict in receiving areas requires an engineered
   economic slowdown in the developed countries, and population
   stabilization and economic growth in the developing countries financed

AB Pro-woman nation-states need to be identified because these states may
   help diminish traditional gender roles and gender stratification by
   providing structural opportunities for women (Wang, 2004; Wernet et al.,
   2005). Comparative, country-level data on multiple domains, such as
   female life expectancy, low fertility rates, education levels, the legal
   status of abortion, the percent of women in public life, female labor
   force participation, and family leave policies, are gathered from the
   Population Reference Bureau (1998) and the International Labor
   Organization (1997). This article explores the differential access that
   people in 39 countries have to the aforementioned rights and privileges
   in order to identify which countries have policies that are the most
   beneficial for women by ranking pro-woman nation-states in a comparative
   index.

AB Purpose: We investigated the effects of comorbidity and urinary
   incontinence on both generic and incontinence specific quality of life
   outcome measures, and investigated whether the association between
   urinary incontinence and quality of life varies by race.
   Materials and Methods: Study participants were 2,109 women 40 to 69
   years old randomly selected from an urban health maintenance
   organization and interviewed in person for a study of risk factors for
   urinary incontinence. The sample was racially diverse consisting of 48%
   white, 18% black, 17% Hispanic and 16% Asian-American women. In addition
   to incontinence, reproductive and medical history questionnaires, all
   participants completed the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, a
   measure of health related quality of life. All participants with daily
   and weekly incontinence (29%) completed the Incontinence Impact
   Questionnaire, an incontinence specific quality of life measure. The
   health maintenance organization's inpatient and outpatient electronic
   databases were used to calculate a Charlson comorbidity index score for
   each participant. ANCOVA was used to produce a model adjusting for
   sociodemographic variables, comorbidity and incontinence frequency. The
   same model was run for each of 4 racial groupings to examine differences
   by race/ethnicity.
   Results: Urinary incontinence is significantly associated with a
   decreased quality of life and those with more frequent incontinence have
   significantly lower quality of life scores. In our model the Charlson
   score, an objective measure of comorbidity based on hospital and
   physician records, also has a significant negative impact on quality of
   life. When comorbidity is controlled, incontinence frequency continues
   to have a significant negative association with quality of life except
   among the sickest women. For women with the greatest extent of
   comorbidity, incontinence frequency is not significantly associated with
   negative quality of life outcomes. We did not find clear patterns of
   variation by race.
   Conclusions: Urinary incontinence and comorbidity each have an
   independent and significant role in reducing quality of life outcomes
   for all but the sickest women.

AB OBJECTIVE. We sought to (1) confirm the discrepancy between
   parent-reported and youth-reported adolescent health in a nationally
   representative sample, (2) compare the predictors of parent-reported and
   adolescent self-reported health, and (3) determine whether the
   discrepancy between the 2 ratings differed by sociodemographic
   characteristics, particularly income.
   METHODS. Data were from the 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey. A total of 1157 adolescents aged 12 to 15 years,
   representative of 16 227 827 US youth, were included. Youth and their
   parents reported on the youth's health status along with other
   indicators of health and illness and sociodemographic characteristics.
   To examine predictors of self-rated and parent-rated adolescent health
   (excellent to poor), bivariate analyses were conducted, followed by
   multiple linear regression adjusted for relevant covariates. All of the
   analyses were stratified by income (standardized poverty income index:
   <= 1 vs > 1).
   RESULTS. Parents and youth differed in subjective judgments regarding
   the child's health, even when these differences were not supported by
   other health indicators (days of school missed because of illness or
   injury or days of poor mental or physical health). Poor adolescents
   reported worse self-rated health than higher-income youth, and their
   parents did also. In income-stratified multiple regression models,
   higher-income adolescents' and their parents' ratings were predicted by
   indicators of physical health. In contrast, poor youth and parent
   ratings were better predicted by mental health care use. Poor youth with
   a mental health visit in the last year reported better health, but their
   parents saw these mental health visits as an indication of poor health.
   CONCLUSIONS. The findings suggest that social class differences in
   subjective ratings of adolescents' health are related to the
   differential ways that youth and parents determine what constitutes
   health and are not simply a reflection of objective health status.

AB OBJECTIVE. Recently, public attention has focused on the possibility
   that social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook are being
   widely used to sexually solicit underage youth, consequently increasing
   their vulnerability to sexual victimization. Beyond anecdotal accounts,
   however, whether victimization is more commonly reported in social
   networking sites is unknown.
   PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS. The Growing up With Media Survey is a national
   cross-sectional online survey of 1588 youth. Participants were 10- to
   15-year-old youth who have used the Internet at least once in the last 6
   months. The main outcome measures were unwanted sexual solicitation on
   the Internet, defined as unwanted requests to talk about sex, provide
   personal sexual information, and do something sexual, and Internet
   harassment, defined as rude or mean comments, or spreading of rumors.
   RESULTS. Fifteen percent of all of the youth reported an unwanted sexual
   solicitation online in the last year; 4% reported an incident on a
   social networking site specifically. Thirty-three percent reported an
   online harassment in the last year; 9% reported an incident on a social
   networking site specifically. Among targeted youth, solicitations were
   more commonly reported via instant messaging (43%) and in chat rooms
   (32%), and harassment was more commonly reported in instant messaging
   (55%) than through social networking sites (27% and 28%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS. Broad claims of victimization risk, at least defined as
   unwanted sexual solicitation or harassment, associated with social
   networking sites do not seem justified. Prevention efforts may have a
   greater impact if they focus on the psychosocial problems of youth
   instead of a specific Internet application, including funding for online
   youth outreach programs, school antibullying programs, and online mental
   health services.

AB When a New York City man risked his own life to save a stranger on the
   subway tracks, the New York Times interpreted his behavior not in terms
   of virtue but as a product of certain 'hard-wiring' he happened to
   possess. In denying virtue, the Times followed a school of thought that
   is pervasive in social science (referred to in this paper as the
   'individualists') who, for example, explain charitable donations by
   pointing out tax deductions, explain volunteer work by revealing the
   opportunities contained therein to meet other singles, and so on.
   Actually, the assumptions and arguments which ground this widespread
   'denial of virtue' are both empirically and normatively flawed, and the
   theory itself is belied by data about people doing good for moral
   reasons. Evidence drawn from personal introspection, from empirical
   studies of human behavior, from analysis of voting as a civil act, from
   interpreting peoples' reaction to Alzheimer's disease, from critical
   inspection of the logic of 'individualist' social explanations, and from
   a normative criticism of the products of the 'individualist' approach
   all support a rejection of the 'individualist' approach. The deniers of
   virtue should heed the evidence and pay mind to the amoralizing
   consequences of their erroneous theories.

AB This article argues that while elements of Pierre Bourdieu's sociology
   are increasingly employed in American sociology, it is rare to find all
   three of Bourdieu's master concepts-habitus, capital, and
   field-incorporated into a single study. Moreover, these concepts are
   seldom deployed within a relational perspective that was fundamental to
   Bourdieu's thinking. The article "Bourdieu and Organizational Analysis"
   by Mustafa Emirbayer and Victoria Johnson is a welcomed exception, for
   it draws on all three of Bourdieu's pillar concepts to propose a
   relational approach to the study of organizations. It both reframes
   existing thinking about organizations, particularly from the
   neo-institutional and resource dependence schools, and indicates new
   directions for research in organizations to move. This paper evaluates
   their contribution calling attention to its many strengths and
   suggesting a few points that need future clarification and elaboration.

AB Harriet Martineau analyzed the structural characteristics associated
   with health, sickness, medicine, occupations, and the bureaucratic
   administration of health care in her later writings. I concentrate here
   on two major examples of this type of work: England and Her Soldiers
   (1859a) and Health, Husbandry, and Handicraft (London: Bradbury and
   Evans, 1861). In this type of study, in contrast to her early
   non-fiction, her own illnesses and bodily difficulties are invisible.
   Her sympathy with the sick and ill, nonetheless, helped her maintain her
   interest in the topic and her sense of mission to document and discuss
   it.
   Martineau was aided in this work through a close alliance with Florence
   Nightingale and together they created a public sociology with major
   social impact on health, war, and occupations delivering health care.
   Their intellectual and personal alliance is one of the first examples of
   female sociologists successfully co-ordinating their work for the common
   good, a model also applicable to their female successors at Hull-House
   and the University of Chicago.

AB Objectives: The Dimensions of Change Instrument (DCI) (1) assesses
   aspects of the therapeutic community treatment process. More positive
   scores on two of the eight dimensions of treatment process assessed at
   the beginning of treatment, Clarity and Safety, and Resident Support,
   Sharing and Enthusiasm predict retention in treatment at 30, 90, 180,
   and 270 days as well as overall length of stay. This study explored
   whether these process subscales assessed at different phases predicted
   retention at the next phase, and of treatment. Methods: Five-hundred
   nineteen individuals, aged 18 to 62, undergoing therapeutic community
   treatment completed the DCI at baseline, one, three, six, and nine
   months of the therapeutic community treatment. Results: DCI scale scores
   at each stage of treatment predicted dropout in the subsequent period.
   In the early stages of treatment, higher scores predicted a higher
   probability of retention in the subsequent stage of treatment. In later
   stages, lower DCI scores predicted a higher probability of retention.
   Conclusions: We conclude that predictions about retention made using the
   DCI scale scores are treatment stage dependentthe DCI predicts retention
   at the next stage but the direction of the scale prediction varies as a
   function of client tenure in treatment. This suggests that treatment
   processes that influence clients to remain early in treatment may change
   their valence for clients more advanced in treatment.

AB In previous research in Brazil, we found socioeconomic and gender
   differences in body mass and percent body fat, consistent with a model
   in which individuals in higher socioeconomic strata, especially women,
   could achieve a cultural ideal of body size and shape. In this article,
   using new data, we examine these processes more precisely using measures
   of cultural consonance. Cultural consonance refers to the degree to
   which individuals approximate, in their own beliefs and behaviors, the
   shared prototypes for belief and behavior encoded in cultural models. We
   have found higher cultural consonance in several domains to be
   associated with health outcomes. Furthermore, there tends to be a
   general consistency in cultural consonance across domains. Here we
   suggest that measures of body composition can be considered indicators
   of individuals' success in achieving cultural ideals of the body, and
   that cultural consonance in several domains will be associated with body
   composition. Using waist circumference as an outcome, smaller waist size
   was associated with higher cultural consonance in lifestyle (beta =
   -0.311, P < 0.01) and higher cultural consonance in the consumption of
   high prestige foods (beta = -0.260, P < 0.01) for women (n = 161), but
   not for men (n = 106), controlling for age, family income, tobacco use,
   and dietary intake of protein and carbohydrates. Similar results were
   obtained using the body mass index and weight as outcomes, while there
   were no associations with height. These results help to illuminate the
   cultural mediation of body composition.

AB Recent research documents the effects of adverse conditions during

   life. Most research linking adverse conditions in early life with adult
   health comes from industrial nations. We know little about the
   plasticity of growth responses to environmental perturbations early in
   life among foragers and horticulturalists. Using 2005 data from 211
   women and 215 men 20+ years of age from a foraging-horticultural society
   of native Amazonians in Bolivia (Tsimane'), we estimate the association
   between (a) adult height and (b) rainfall amount and variability during
   three stages in the life cycle: gestation (year 0), birth year (year 1),
   and years 2-5. We control for confounders such as height of the same-sex
   parent. Rainfall amount and variability during gestation and birth year
   bore weak associations with adult height, probably from the protective
   role of placental physiology and breastfeeding. However, rainfall
   variability during years 2-5 of life bore a negative association with
   adult female height. Among women, a 10% increase in the coefficient of
   variation of rainfall during years 2-5 was associated with 0.7-1.2%
   lower adult height (1.08-1.93 cm). Environmental perturbations that take
   place after the cessation of weaning seem to leave the strongest effect
   on adult height. We advance possible explanations for the absence of
   effects among males.

   4446 (78%), who provided the analytic sample.
   Main Exposure: Low subjective social status in the school.
   Main Outcome Measures: Change in BMI between 1999 and 2001 and
   multivariable odds ratio for a 2-U increase in BMI in girls with low
   subjective social status in the school compared with girls with higher
   subjective social status in the school.
   Results: After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, baseline BMI, diet,
   television viewing, depression, global and social self-esteem, menarche,
   height growth, mother's BMI, and pretax household income, adolescent
   girls who placed themselves on the low end of the school subjective
   social status scale had a 69% increased odds of having a 2-unit increase
   in BMI (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-2.60) during the
   next 2 years compared with other girls.
   Conclusion: Higher subjective social standing in school may protect
   against gains in adiposity in adolescent girls.

AB High-stakes, standardized testing has become the central tool for
   educational reform and regulation in many industrialized nations in the
   world, and it has been implemented with particular intensity in the
   United States and the United Kingdom. Drawing on research on high-stakes
   testing and its effect on classroom practice and pedagogic discourse in
   the United States, the present paper applies Bernstein's concept of the
   pedagogic device to explain how high-stakes tests operate as a relay in
   the reproduction of dominant social relations in education. This
   analysis finds that high-stakes tests, through the structuring of
   knowledge, actively select and regulate student identities, and thus
   contribute to the selection and regulation of students' educational
   success.

AB This article analyzes the two distinct communicative logics that inform
   the institutional geography and normative understanding of global
   sociology. The globalizing logic imagines a unitary global space that
   organizes sociological debate; the transnational logic envisions a
   series of overlapping sociological debates, often organized within a
   national context that is in the process of cosmopolitan, global, and
   transnational transformation. We argue that both logics shape
   communication in the sociological tradition, even if neither project is
   fully realized. The main challenge to global sociology, particularly in
   its globalizing form, is the existence of extremely influential spaces
   of sociological debate in North America and Europe, which reproduce the
   privileges of the larger and more powerful national associations. At the
   same time, these large, powerful national associations are becoming
   increasingly transnationalized, putting centre and periphery into
   dialogue, if in limited and uneven ways.

AB Medical encounters are interactional/interpersonal processes taking
   place within contexts shaped by macro-level social structures. In the
   case of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), medical encounters occur
   at a stigmatized crossroads of social control and gendered norms of
   sexual behavior. When women are diagnosed and treated for chronic STDs,
   practitioner demeanor has an important impact on how patients will view
   not only their health status but also their moral status. This chapter
   draws on in depth interviews with 40 women diagnosed with genital
   infections of herpes and/or human papillomavirus (HPV-the cause of
   genital warts) to explore three models of patient-practitioner
   interaction. The analysis focuses on the relationship between gender,
   construction of illness, and practitioner interaction style. In a
   broader context, the health risks posed by particular interaction styles
   to female STD patients shed light on larger public health implications
   of combining morality with medicine for the broader range of patients
   with stigmatizing diagnoses.

AB Background: Although school-based behavioral interventions for
   increasing physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents have been
   conducted, little evidence suggests that these curriculum-based
   approaches lead to increases in overall activity outside of program
   days. The overall goal of the "Active by Choice Today" (ACT) trial is to
   expand the body of knowledge concerning the factors that influence
   long-term increases in PA in underserved adolescents (low socioeconmic
   status, minorities) during their middle school years.
   Design and setting: An overview of the ACT study design, theoretical
   framework, process evaluation, and primary hypotheses is presented. The
   trial involves twenty-four middle schools (1560 6th graders) in South
   Carolina that are randomly assigned to one of two after-school programs
   (motivational and life skills intervention, or general health
   education).
   Intervention: The intervention integrates constructs from
   Self-Determination and Social Cognitive Theories to enhance intrinsic
   motivation and behavioral skills for PA. The intervention targets skill
   development for PA outside of program days and the after-school program
   social environment (autonomy, choice, participation, belongingness, fun,
   enjoyment, support) is designed to positively impact cognitive mediators
   (self-efficacy, perceived competence), and motivational orientation
   (intrinsic motivation, commitment, positive self-concept).
   Main hypotheses/outcomes: It is hypothesized that the 17-week
   motivational and life skills intervention will lead to greater increases
   in moderate-to-vigorous PA (based on 7-day accelerometry estimates) at
   post-intervention as compared to the general health education program.
   Conclusions: Implications of this innovative school-based trial are
   discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Individuals from low socioeconomic backgrounds are disproportionately
   affected by the burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet data
   regarding risk factors in this population are lacking, particularly
   regarding emerging biomarkers of CVD such as C-reactive protein (CRP).
   We measured high-sensitivity CRP and examined its association with
   demographic and lifestyle factors in a sample of 792 participants aged
   40-79 years from the Southern Community Cohort Study, which has an
   over-representation of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals (over
   60% with a total annual household income <$ 15,000). We found that
   within this population the prevalence of elevated CRP (> 3 mg/L) varied
   significantly by sex, race, smoking status, and body mass index (BMI).
   The multivariable-adjusted prevalence odds ratios (ORs) (95% CIs) for
   having elevated CRP were 1.6 (1.1-2.3) for women vs. men, 1.4 (0.9-2.0)
   for African Americans vs. whites, 2.3 (1.4-3.8) for African American
   women vs. white men, 1.8 (1.2-2.7) for current smokers vs. non-smokers,
   and 4.2 (2.7-6.6) for obese (BMI 30.0-44.9 kg/m(2)) vs. healthy-weight
   (BMI 18.3-24.9 kg/m(2)) participants. Further stratified analyses
   revealed that the association between BMI and elevated CRP was stronger
   among African Americans than whites and women than men, with prevalence
   ORs (95% CI) comparing obese vs. healthy-weight categories reaching 22.8
   (7.1-73.8) for African American women. In conclusion, in this
   socioeconomically disadvantaged population, sex, race, smoking, and BMI
   were associated with elevated CRP. Moreover, inflammatory response to
   obesity differed by race and sex, which may contribute to CVD
   disparities.

AB Four decades of theory and research on resilience in human development
   have yielded informative lessons for planning disaster response and
   recovery. In developmental theory, resilience following disaster could
   take multiple forms, including stress resistance, recovery, and positive
   transformation. Empirical findings suggest that fundamental adaptive
   systems play a key role in the resilience of young people facing diverse
   threats, including attachment, agency, intelligence, behavior regulation
   systems, and social interactions with family, peers, school, and
   community systems. Although human resilience research emphasizes the
   adaptive well-being of particular individuals, there are striking
   parallels in resilience theory across the developmental and ecological
   sciences. Preparing societies for major disasters calls for the
   integration of human research on resilience with the theory and
   knowledge gained from other disciplines concerned with resilience in
   complex, dynamic systems, and particularly those systems that interact
   with human individuals as disaster unfolds.

AB This article analyses the network epistemologies that underlie several
   frameworks for studying global economic organization. Specifically, the
   embedded network of the new economic sociology is compared with various
   global chain constructs that seek to emphasize the connectedness of
   actors and activities across space. I argue that the micro-sociological
   foundations of the new economic sociology make embeddedness a
   problematic concept for analysing economic organization at a global
   level. I then contrast the embedded network as a trust-based governance
   structure with the construct of the global commodity chain, which
   understands network governance in terms of power relations or
   'drivenness'. Finally, I explain how the recent theory of global value
   chain governance by Gereffi, Humphrey and Sturgeon (2005) departs from
   the macro-sociological tradition that oriented earlier chain frameworks:
   this theory, which focuses on the coordination of inter-firm dyads in a
   global value chain, returns to a micro-oriented understanding of
   governance, but one that draws more from transaction cost theory than
   from the new economic sociology.

AB We draw on recent developments in the sociology of race and ethnicity
   and theories of the duality of social structure to explain how the
   formation of 'educational identities' interacts with racial
   stratification to shape the school choices of highly educated whites in
   the United States. Analysis of the 1996 National Household Education
   Survey shows that the racial composition of schools plays an important
   role in the schooling choices of highly educated whites. As the per cent
   black in a residential area increases, whites are more likely to select
   alternative, higher-percentage-white schooling for their children.
   Importantly, this effect is amplified for highly educated whites (but
   not highly educated blacks). Ironically, then, despite many positive
   effects of formal education on racial attitudes, increased education for
   whites leads to greater negative sensitivity to blacks in public
   schools, which may in turn have the unintended effect of increasing
   school segregation and racial inequality.

AB Vygotsky's notions of speech, language and thought have recently begun
   to receive more attention in the west, but some of his basic
   distinctions are not well understood. The first part of this paper deals
   with some of the confusions that have arisen due to inaccurate
   translation and misunderstanding of Vygotsky's general theoretical
   framework. The focus of this analysis is on Vygotsky's distinction
   between language and speech. The second part of the paper deals with the
   emergence of self-regulative capacities in ontogenesis - a central theme
   in the work of Vygotsky and his followers. It is argued that their ideas
   about self-regulation can be properly understood only if we conduct a
   genetic analysis that goes back to the origins of self-regulation. These
   origins are to be found in adult-child interaction where adults provide
   the 'other-regulation' necessary for a child to carry out a task. We
   argue that it is by coming to function in communicative settings
   involving other-regulation that the child can develop self-regulative
   capacities. These self-regulative capacities are seen as emerging as the
   result of the child's taking over the communicative and regulative
   responsibilities formerly carried out by the adult.

AB In his 1979 Human Development article reprinted in this anniversary
   issue, James Wertsch presented an approach to genetic analysis of the
   shifting regulation of problem-solving behavior in early childhood. In
   my reflections on Wertsch's seminal contribution, I discuss ways that
   subsequent inquiry built upon ideas he elaborated in the 1979 article,
   using my own work as an illustrative case. One strand of my discussion
   focuses on method. Wertsch's treatment involved lab-based studies, and I
   discuss how, in my research on early number development, I coordinated
   laboratory methods similar to Wertsch's with field methods. The second
   strand broadens the scope of Wertsch's approach to genetic analyses.
   Wertsch presented a compelling case for the utility of genetic analysis
   in investigations of the emergence of forms of problem solving. I
   discuss the importance of extending genetic explanation by incorporating
   sociogenetic analysis of the reproduction and alteration of collective
   systems of representation in the social history of communities. As an
   illustration I present my research on numerical representations used by
   a remote Papua New Guinea cultural group. I conclude by considering the
   utility of a genetic analysis of collective forms of representation and
   the functions these forms serve, in ontogeny as well as in social
   history. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

   portray behavior as purely self-directed, thereby neglecting everyday
   reasoners' understanding of behavior as normatively based. However, in
   everyday reasoning, belief-desire (theory of mind) and
   obligation-permission (deontic) concerns interrelate. Moreover, both
   belief-desire reasoning and obligation-permission reasoning are early
   developing, universal, and inseparable in children's understanding of
   persons. Thus, for both conceptual and empirical reasons, deontic and
   mentalistic perspectives should be seen as interdependent and integrated
   in understanding theory of mind. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Purpose-A geologist and sociologist have developed a pair of Earth
   resource courses to teach geology in global context and critical
   thinking and negotiation skills. The energy and minerals courses
   emphasize the physical and geological sciences as well as an
   understanding of the political, social structural, cultural, economic,
   and environmental factors that influence resource extraction and use. We
   are seeking to develop the global citizenship skills students will need
   to participate in future discussions on Earth resource issues. To this
   end, active learning approaches involve students in group problem
   solving and negotiation.
   Methodology-For five years we have been developing these courses and
   regularly assessing the accomplishment of course goals. Focus groups and
   before/after surveys guide course modifications.
   Findings-Though limited, our evidence shows an increased awareness and
   willingness on the part of our students to engage in discussions
   searching for solutions to Earth resource issues. Geology students are
   enthusiastic about the content that goes beyond geology. Non-geology
   students appreciate knowing more of the science of Earth resources that
   help thereby providing critical insight and background for their
   interest in environmental and social problems.
   Value of the paper - The L(SC)(2) paradigm we have developed can be
   adopted or adapted to a variety of possible partnerships between the
   sciences and the social sciences and humanities. Studying Earth resource
   issues in global context connects the immediate concerns of consumers to
   the practices and problems of Earth resource extraction and processing
   around the world to better foster citizen involvement.

   praise in Chinese-immigrant and European-American families. Three
   process models of praise with distinctive communicative content were
   uncovered. Two models focus on adherence to parental expectations, which
   promote the development of an interdependent self
   (interdependence-promoting praise). One focuses on child's
   self-initiated behaviors and supports the development of an independent
   self (independence-supportive praise). Consistent with past findings,
   independence-supportive praise is widely distributed in
   European-American families. Although interdependence-promoting praise
   has been overlooked in previous research, it is commonly found in
   Chinese-immigrant families. The findings are discussed in terms of their
   implications for the development of culturally inclusive models of
   praise.

AB Most acculturation research has been conducted in immigrant settings.
   The present study examined the generalizability of acculturation models
   and the adaptiveness of acculturation strategies in another bicultural
   environment - a colonial setting. The sample included 138 girls (M =
   13.8 years) and their parents from Hong Kong, a former British colony.
   Results verified that both Chinese and western acculturation occurred on
   individual psychological levels and that the bidimensional model was a
   suitable acculturation framework. Using hierarchical multiple
   regression, results suggested that acculturation towards Chinese
   (majority) culture was related to better adaptation in terms of higher
   academic achievement and positive family dynamics (parental nurturance
   and closer family relationships). Acculturation towards western
   (minority) culture was related to poorer adaptation in terms of engaging
   in greater misconduct and negative family interactions (larger
   intergenerational value discrepancies and family conflicts). Thus,
   acculturation towards the majority culture held adaptive implications,
   whereas acculturation towards the minority culture held maladaptive
   implications. Consideration of the bicultural composition (e. g.,
   status, prestige, strength of cultural networks of each culture) should
   be incorporated into acculturation theory to better understand
   adjustment implications across a wide range of contexts.

AB Based on the conceptual argument that the European apprenticeship might
   explain cross-national variability in adolescent adjustment, the current
   investigation tested the relationships between mentoring experiences,
   namely joint activities with mentors as well as perceived mentoring
   behaviors by unrelated adults in the work setting, and measures of both
   psychosocial competencies ( job skills, self esteem, and well-being) and
   measures of adjustment ( alcohol use, drug use, and deviance). Data were
   collected from n = 2735 Swiss apprentices and n = 368 U. S. part-time
   employees who attended high school. Findings provide evidence that
   perceived mentoring behaviors by unrelated adults in the work setting in
   both developmental contexts were associated with both psychosocial
   competencies and adjustment indicators. Contrary to the idea that the
   European apprenticeship may provide a unique "protective" developmental
   experience for youth in comparison with U. S. adolescents who work
   part-time, adolescents in both contexts benefited equally from good
   mentoring experiences.

AB Evolutionary and biological approaches tend to suggest that social
   dominance is predominately an aspect of male social organization.
   Furthermore, when females behave non-normatively, they are less
   positively evaluated than males engaging in the same behavior.
   Alternate, less familiar models of females and dominance/aggression
   underlie the present study which proposes that dominant males and
   females are more similar in both behavioral profile and social reception
   than commonly believed. Participants (N = 1723; grades 5-10) self-rated
   their aggression, social motivations, and strategies and beliefs
   associated with interpersonal influence. Peer ratings of strategies of
   influence, aggression, and the degree to which peers were liked and
   disliked were also obtained. Results demonstrated that socially dominant
   males and females balance prosocial and coercive strategies and win
   positive peer regard, their aggressiveness notwithstanding. These
   findings highlight competitiveness in females and provide insights into
   the paradoxical relationship between positive peer regard and aggression
   (the peer regard-aggression paradox).

AB Purpose We hypothesized that alterations of subcomponents
   ('harm-avoidance') of personality and the sense of Self in patients with
   PD would be associated with executive cognitive dysfunction.
   Methods Thirty-four patients with PD and 17 age-matched controls with
   chronic disease were assessed with a set of neuropsychologic,
   personality and mood tests as well as an experimental assessment of the
   sense of Self.
   Results On personality and self tests, PD patients evidenced higher harm
   avoidance, lower novelty seeking scores, and lower recall rates of
   personally experienced events from childhood than controls and this PD
   personality profile was associated with poor performance on
   neuropsychologic tests of executive prefrontal function. PD patients,
   however, did not differ significantly from controls in their
   subjectively felt congruence between their present Selves and their
   hoped-for Selves.
   Conclusions We suggest that harm-avoidance personality and Self-related
   changes of PID are due, in part, to a memory disorder associated with
   frontal dysfunction. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Injection drug users who exchange sex for money or drugs may serve as a

   While many individual characteristics have been linked to exchanging
   sex, little attention has been given to the influence of social network
   members. The present study assessed the relationship between exchanging
   sex and perceptions of peers' sex exchange behaviour and attitude toward
   sex exchange. The sample was composed of 267 women heroin and cocaine
   injectors in Baltimore, MID, USA. The results indicate that women who
   believed that their friends exchanged sex were more twice as likely to
   exchange sex in the past 90 days (95% CI: 1.49-2.70). Also, participants
   who thought their peers disapproved of sex exchange were 20% less likely
   to exchange sex (95% CI: 0.67-0.95). These findings suggest the need for
   peer education interventions that promote norms about safer behaviours.

AB Maternal mortality is a serious public health concern in Bangladesh.
   However, most deaths could be prevented through proper and timely care
   seeking and adequate management. Unfortunately, fewer than half of
   pregnant women in Bangladesh seek antenatal care, and only one in eight
   receive delivery care from medically trained providers. The specific
   objectives of this research are to examine the socioeconomic
   differentials of maternity care seeking, and to determine whether
   accessibility of health services reduces the socioeconomic differentials
   in maternity care seeking. A multi-level logistic regression method is
   employed to analyse longitudinal data collected from a sample of 1019
   women from all over Bangladesh. The study finds significant
   socioeconomic disparities in both antenatal and delivery care seeking.
   Service accessibility, however, significantly reduces the socioeconomic
   differentials in delivery care seeking. Services need to be made
   accessible to reduce the inequality in maternity care seeking between
   rich and poor, empowered and non-empowered.

   (servings/week) in men enrolled in any intervention at follow-up (b =
   0.39, P = 0.05) vs. baseline (b = 0.04, P = 0.75). The 1-item fruit and

   instrument used, and randomization condition are comparable to what has

PD JAN 2008

AB Objective: Religiousness is known to be inversely related to alcohol use
   and problems, but few studies have attempted to identify mediators of
   this relationship. We examined beliefs about alcohol, social influences,
   well-being, and motives for drinking as potential mediators of the
   relationship between religiousness/spirituality and alcohol use and
   problems. Method: Participants were 315 female and 197 male college
   students who responded to a survey sent to a stratified (by gender and
   year in school) random sample. We used path analysis to test models
   specifying hypothesized mediators of the relationship between several
   religious/spiritual constructs (identified via factor analysis in
   previous studies) and alcohol use and problems. Models were tested in
   the full sample and a subsample consisting of alcohol users only.
   Results: The effect of religious/spiritual involvement on alcohol use
   was mediated by negative beliefs about alcohol, social influences, and
   spiritual well-being. The effect of religious struggle on alcohol
   problems was mediated by spiritual well-being. Search for meaning had
   both direct and indirect (via negative beliefs about alcohol) effects on
   use and problems. Negative beliefs about alcohol and social influences
   were related to alcohol use via enhancement motives and, in some models,
   social motives for drinking. Spiritual well-being was related to alcohol
   problems via coping motives. Social influences also had direct effects
   on alcohol use. Conclusions: Although future studies using longitudinal
   designs are needed the study identified several plausible mechanisms by
   which religiousness/spirituality could causally impact alcohol use and
   problems. Results also provide further support for the motivational
   model of alcohol use.

AB Census block-group-specific predicted outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2; a

   socioeconomic position (SEP) measures were used to evaluate whether
   chronic exposures to traffic-related air pollutants are higher in areas
   with lower SEP, after controlling for spatial autocorrelation in mixed
   models. NO2 levels were predicted using a geographic information system
   (GIS)-based spatiotemporal model that was validated with measured NO2
   concentrations. The GIS-based model predicted weekly NO2 concentrations
   with high accuracy (slope of 0.98 from regression of held-out
   observations on predictions) and precision (cross-validation mean
   absolute error of 2.2 ppb). The model performed well in both rural and
   urban areas and warm and cold seasons. Estimated mean block group NO2
   concentrations were significantly negatively associated with median
   household income, and positively associated with poverty, crowding, and
   low educational attainment rates after controlling for spatial
   autocorrelation. Results indicated that a standard deviation (3.5 ppb)
   increase in block group NO2 concentrations was associated with a $9090
   decrease in median household income. Results suggest that on average
   those with lower SEP experience higher chronic exposure to outdoor NO2.

AB Background/Aims: Little is known about the possible effects of social

   Understanding this association may help us identify strategies to
   improve stroke recovery and help elucidate the etiology of dementia.
   Methods: We examined the relationship of social ties and social support
   to cognitive function and cognitive change 6 months after stroke.
   Participants in the Families in Recovery from Stroke Trial (FIRST) (n =
   272) were interviewed approximately 17 days (baseline) and 6 months
   (follow-up) after stroke. Cognition was assessed with the Mini Mental
   State Examination ( MMSE) and a summary battery of 7 neuropsychological
   tests. Median-based regression was used to model cognitive outcomes by
   level of baseline intimate, personal and organizational social ties and
   received emotional and instrumental support. Results: Baseline social
   ties and emotional support independently predicted 6-month Cognitive
   Summary Scores. Emotional support also predicted greater improvements in
   Cognitive Summary Scores from baseline to the 6-month follow-up. No
   other social exposures predicted improvements in the MMSE or the
   Cognitive Summary. Conclusions: Our results suggest that emotional
   support may promote cognitive resilience while social ties provide
   cognitive reserve that protects against impaired cognition after stroke.
   Social ties did not predict cognitive recovery however, so reverse
   causation cannot be ruled out. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB Since Karl Marx fashioned his theory of capitalism in the nineteenth
   century, scholars have continually updated Marxian theory to capture the
   pervasiveness of commodity relations in modern society. Influenced by
   Georg Lukacs and Henri Lefebvre, the members of the French avantguard
   group, the Situationist International (1957-1972), developed an
   intransigent critique of consumer capitalism based on the concept of the
   spectacle. In the spectacle, media and consumer society replace lived
   experience, the passive gaze of images supplants active social
   participation, and new forms of alienation induce social atomization at
   a more abstract level than in previous societies. We endeavor to make
   two theoretical contributions: First, we highlight the contributions of
   the Situationist International, pointing out how they revised the
   Marxian categories of alienation, commodification, and rei. cation in
   order to analyze the dynamics of twentieth century capitalism and to
   give these concepts new explanatory power. Second, we build a critical
   theory of consumer capitalism that incorporates the theoretical
   assumptions and arguments of the Situationists and the Frankfurt School.
   Today, critical theory can make an important contribution to sociology
   by critically examining the plurality of spectacles and their reifying
   manifestations. In addition, critical theorists can explore how
   different spectacles connect to one another, how they connect to
   different social institutions, and how spectacles express contradictions
   and conflicting meanings. A critical theory of spectacle and consumption
   can disclose both novelties and discontinuities in the current period,
   as well as continuities in the development of globalized consumer
   capitalism.

   is that the program of public sociology, under the leadership of Michael

   whether this drift in fact comports with Marx's ideas on the
   relationship between scientific knowledge, the role of intellectuals in

   fins that critics are fundamentally mistaken about the extent to which

AB Purpose - Recent research on the modes of patient activism has displaced
   older notions of patients as passive, compliant subjects of biomedical
   power. This chapter expands analyses of patient activism to examine the
   intersections between the processes of identity formation, the emergence
   of a new scientific field (human stem cell research), and political
   institutions.
   Methodology - This chapter uses in-depth interviews, ethnographic
   techniques, and textual analyses to collect data regarding California's
   2004 ballot initiative, Proposition 71, The California Stem Cell
   Research and Cures Act. Data were analyzed using a situational analysis
   approach. Situational analysis is a variant of grounded theory that
   organizes data in the form of maps of connections between actors and
   social worlds.
   Findings - This chapter examines the content and significance of this
   event through the construction of a collective identity among supporters
   of Proposition 71, what I call "stem cell activists." The construction
   of this collective identity serves as an important ground from which
   individuals and groups carve out political claims of
   self-representation. Stem cell activists also helped pass a
   controversial initiative through the efforts in publicly supporting Prop
   71 and human stem cell research.
   Research limitations - This research is limited in that it only examined
   individuals who became stem cell activists, and not individuals from
   whom this identity failed to gain salience. More research is needed to
   understand the conditions under which this identity becomes incorporated
   within a person's political repertoire.
   Value of chapter - This chapter brings together theoretical perspectives
   on the symbolic aspects of identity construction and the political
   economy of biomedical science. This chapter will be of interest to
   scholars in medical sociology, science and technology studies, and
   social movement researchers

   term intersectionality within the academy and across a broad spectrum of
   institutional and grass roots environments in which it is
   operationalized and deployed.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on the authors' experiences within
   the academy and their respective participation as researchers and
   organizers with in feminist, queer, and racial and economic justice
   movements, the chapter surveys the rhetorical, political, and
   organizational uses of intersectionality across these realms.
   Findings - Five general challenges to intersectional practice are
   identified and described: misidentification, appropriation,
   institutionalization, reification, and operationalization. The authors
   trace these challenges across the academy, grass roots movements, and
   non profit organizations.
   Originality/value - Offers a new articulation of intersectional practice
   as the application of scholarly or social movement methodologies aimed
   at intersectional and sustainable social justice outcomes.

AB New institutionalisms in economic and organizational sociology need
   grounding in theories of capitalism. Comparative studies show that
   multiple, viable forms of capitalism have been constructed through the
   interplay of institutions, mobilizations of political power, and state
   policies. Further theoretical development requires attention to the
   contradictions of capitalism. Promising theoretical sources for this
   task are examined. The political process produces new forms of
   capitalist institutions, but contradictions built into those
   institutions cannot be fully resolved and provide the basis for new acts
   of social construction and power mobilization. The power and cultural
   arguments of the comparative institutionalists are joined, at least in
   aspiration, to theories of capitalist contradictions.

AB The success of cooperative relationships is influenced by
   interorganizational commitment, which is a long-run goal of networks.
   Our research examined cooperative relationships in the tourism industry
   to better understand what makes them successful. The study is an
   extension of previous empirical research on commitment. The overall
   research questions were: "What factors lead to interorganizational
   commitment in remote tourism destinations?" and "What are the
   relationships between the factors?" A literature search was conducted to
   identify factors related to organizational commitment. Search findings
   suggested a model proposing that interpersonal commitment mediates the
   effect of trust and reciprocity on interorganizational commitment. Data
   for the model was collected from a sample of tourism firms in successful
   cooperative networks. The theoretical model was purified based on
   convergent, nomological and discriminant validity as well as construct
   reliability. Our findings demonstrated that the relationship between
   trust and interorganizational commitment is in fact mediated by
   interpersonal commitment. We confirmed that reciprocity is directly
   related to interorganizational commitment, and is not mediated by
   interpersonal commitment. Thus, tourism firms should develop cooperative
   strategies in their networks by focusing on enhancing interpersonal
   commitment through trust, thereby ultimately helping to strengthen
   interorganizational commitment.

AB Research suggests global self-esteem among persons with schizophrenia
   may be negatively affected by stigma or stereotyped beliefs about
   persons with severe mental illness. Less clear however, is whether
   particular dimensions of self-esteem are linked to particular domains of
   stigma. To examine this we surveyed a range of self-esteem dimensions
   including lovability, personal power, competence and moral self-approval
   and four domains of stigma: Stereotype endorsement, Discrimination
   experience, Social withdrawal and Stigma rejection. Participants were
   133 adults with diagnoses of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.
   Stepwise multiple regressions controlling for a possible defensive
   response bias suggested that aspects of self-esteem related to
   lovability by others were more closely linked with lesser feelings of
   being alienated from others due to mental illness. Aspects of
   self-esteem related to the ability to manage one's own affairs were more
   closely associated with the rejection of stereotypes of mental illness.
   A sense of being able to influence others was linked to both the absence
   of discrimination experiences and the ability to ward off stigma.
   Implications for treatment are discussed. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

   on the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA), a
   performance-based measure of functional capacity, and level of patient
   community responsibilities (i.e., work for pay; volunteer work; attend
   school; household duties) in a Latino sample. Participants were 58
   middle-aged and older Latmos of Mexican origin (mean age =48.8 years)
   with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. We
   conducted an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), controlling for age,
   symptoms of psychosis, and participant language, to determine if greater
   participation in community responsibilities was associated with higher
   functional capacity, as measured by the UPSA. Results indicated
   significant group differences in UPSA scores (F= 5.11, df= 2, 51; p
   =.009), with patients reporting only a single community responsibility
   having significantly higher UPSA scores than those reporting zero
   community responsibilities (p=.016) and those reporting two
   responsibilities scoring significantly higher than those reporting zero
   community responsibility (p=.008). There were no differences found
   between those reporting one and those reporting two community
   responsibilities (p=.256). In contrast, no group differences were
   observed on the Dementia Rating Scale, a global measure of cognitive
   functioning (F=2.14, df=2, 51; p=.128). These results provide initial
   support for the validity of the UPSA in Latino patients of Mexican
   origin, and suggest that improvement in functional capacity (i.e., UPSA
   scores) may be associated with increased capacity for greater community
   involvement in this population. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Processes of decentralization characterize much of the developing
   world's natural resource sectors (e.g., forestry). At the heart of
   decentralization processes lies the question of power, given that most
   decentralization efforts involve some transfer of authority from a
   central agency to downwardly accountable groups, or some claim to
   empower local-level actors. These processes often involve organizations
   such as the state, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local
   communities, who may have divergent interests. The question thus arises,
   how is power reflected in various approaches to natural resources
   conservation and management? In this article, we trace some theoretical
   understandings of the concept of power from disciplines such as critical
   theory, adult education, and development sociology. We then illustrate
   these conceptions of power with various examples from the field of
   natural resources. Our purpose is to shed light on how power can be
   understood with the aim of informing more deliberate, and perhaps more
   democratic, professional practice.

AB Sociology and other social sciences struggle to emulate a model of
   scientific evidence that is often inappropriate. Not only do social
   researchers encounter special limits, but they are also handicapped by a
   distorted and idealized picture of practices in the "hard sciences."
   Ironically, while often obliged to use data of lower quality, sociology
   employs standards for evaluating a theory that are not attained in the
   hard sciences. After a brief review of these obstacles, we describe a
   set of procedures for using empirical data to rigorously evaluate
   theories and hypotheses without resorting to the mimicking of hard
   science. The interaction between theory and evidence normally involves
   deriving implications from the theory (usually referred to as
   hypotheses) and then ascertaining how closely the empirical evidence
   meets these implications. The appropriateness of the implications is a
   key factor in the entire operation, linking as they do the data and the
   theory. The evaluation of a theory is no better than the theory's
   implications (as generated by the investigator) coupled with the quality
   and appropriateness of the evidence. It is our impression, however, that
   because this step is insufficiently addressed, there are unnecessary
   problems in the evaluation of theories. We use the term "Implication
   Analysis" to describe our efforts to review and improve current
   procedures.

   may be America's most famous sociologist, yet the professional journals
   rarely cite his work. In contrast, introductory sociology textbooks
   almost always discuss the sociological imagination, yet
   characteristically refer to only half of his concept, hardly ever
   mentioning its revolutionary character. Both the American Western and
   the murder mystery reveal parallels with Mills's biography and analysis
   of American sociology. Mills attempted to murder his father and older
   brother figures and invited us to join him, but he failed to rally our
   support. He left a legacy as much iconic as ironic.

AB Adolescent substance use is an important area of research in sociology;
   however, there is a lack of research on nonmedical prescription drug
   use. The dearth of research on this topic is problematic given the
   relatively high prevalence of use among adolescents, the drastic
   increase in use in recent years, and the potential negative consequences
   from misusing prescription drugs. Using data from a national sample of
   adolescents, this research fills an important gap in the literature by
   testing one of the most prominent theories of deviance: social learning
   theory. Findings support variables related to social learning theory as
   correlates of nonmedical prescription drug use. Adolescents with
   definitions that are pro-substance use, whose peers use drugs, and whose
   parents and peers have attitudes that condone substance use are more
   likely to report nonmedical prescription drug use in the past year.
   Important implications and future research directions are discussed.

   undergraduates in lower-division substantive courses and Exploring Data
   through Research Literature presents an alternative to traditional
   research methods assignments. Searching and browsing tools, archive

   students in upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses to engage
   in exercises that increase quantitative literacy, and paper competitions
   reward them for doing so.

AB This paper describes two teaching strategies from our workshop,
   "Teaching the Sociology of Gender and Work," that can help students
   understand the mechanisms and consequences of workplace gender
   inequality at the macro- and micro-levels. Cynthia Anderson's class
   project uses wage and sex composition data that allows students to learn
   actively how data are used to study general trends and changes over
   time. It encourages students to explore the reality of their possible
   careers and fields in terms of wages, proportion of women and men, and
   other factors. Sharon Bird's class exercise requires students to
   consider the interactional dynamics of everyday work life and encourages
   them to see the subtle processes of marginalization and exclusion while
   also thinking about how to overcome gender biases. Some of this
   information will contribute to student angst about inequality in the
   workplace; thus, we conclude with suggestions for decreasing potential
   student distress and increasing student empowerment.

AB At the 2007 annual meetings of the American Sociological Association, we
   presented a workshop entitled "How to do the Scholarship of Teaching."
   The workshop had three main goals: to introduce participants to the
   literature on the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) and to
   various SoTL outlets, to guide participants in the process of doing
   their own SoTL research, and to enhance participants' chances of getting
   their SoTL work published, especially in the discipline's teaching
   journal, Teaching Sociology. The overarching purpose of the workshop and
   this paper is to help participants and readers think about how their own
   experiences in the classroom could be transformed into research.

AB Divorce is increasingly common around the world. Its causes, dynamics,
   and socioeconomic impacts have been widely studied, but little research
   has addressed its environmental impacts. We found that average household
   size (number of people in a household) in divorced households
   (households with divorced heads) was 27-41% smaller than married
   households (households with married heads) in 12 countries across the
   world around the year 2000 (between 1998 and 2002). If divorced
   households had combined to have the same average household size as
   married households, there could have been 7.4 million fewer households
   in these countries. Meanwhile, the number of rooms per person in
   divorced households was 33-95% greater than in married households. In
   the United States (U.S.) in 2005, divorced households spent 46% and 56%
   more on electricity and water per person than married households.
   Divorced households in the U.S. could have saved more than 38 million
   rooms, 73 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, and 627 billion gallons
   of water in 2005 alone if their resource-use efficiency had been
   comparable to married households. Furthermore, U.S. households that
   experienced divorce used 42-61% more resources per person than before
   their dissolution. Remarriage of divorced household heads increased
   household size and reduced resource use to levels similar to those of
   married households. The results suggest that mitigating the impacts of
   resource-inefficient lifestyles such as divorce helps to achieve global
   environmental sustainability and saves money for households.

AB Objective: To examine characteristics of circumcised and uncircumcised
   Latino and black men who have sex with men (MSM) in the United States
   and assess the association between circumcision and HIV infection.
   Methods: Using respondent-driven sampling, 1154 black MSM and 1091
   Latino MSM were recruited from New York City, Philadelphia, and Los
   Angeles. A 45-minute computer-assisted interview and a rapid oral fluid
   H IV antibody test (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA) were
   administered to participants.
   Results: Circumcision prevalence was higher among black MSM than among
   Latino MSM (74% vs. 33%; P < 0.0001). Circumcised MSM in both
   racial/ethnic groups were more likely than uncircumcised MSM to be bom
   in the United States or to have a USborn parent. Circumcision status was
   not associated with prevalent HIV infection among Latino MSM, black MSM,
   black bisexual men, or black or Latino men who reported being
   HIV-negative based on their last HIV test. Further, circumcision was not
   associated with a reduced likelihood of HIV infection among men who had
   engaged in unprotected insertive and not unprotected receptive anal sex.
   Conclusions: in these cross-sectional data, there was no evidence that
   being circumcised was protective against HIV infection among black MSM
   or Latino MSM.

AB With the transition into marriage, marijuana and other substance use
   tends to decline; however, this is not true for all individuals. The
   objective of this work was to examine the impact of premarital
   individual and partner psychological health and substance use behaviors
   on the likelihood of using marijuana over the first four years of
   marriage. Couples' (N=634) marijuana use, other substance use, and
   psychological variables were assessed at the time they applied for their
   marriage license and then again at the first, second and fourth
   anniversaries. Generalized estimating equation models were used to
   estimate the risk for using marijuana over the first four years of
   marriage after controlling for the natural decrease in risk associated
   with time and other relevant sociodemographic variables. Smoking prior
   to marriage and heavy alcohol use was associated with an increased risk
   for using marijuana over the first four years of marriage for both
   husbands and wives. After considering the impact of time: and individual
   risk factors, a spouse's use of marijuana prior to marriage was a strong
   predictor of increased risk for marijuana use during the first four
   years of marriage. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Treatment retention is of paramount importance in cocaine treatment
   research as treatment completion rates are often 50% or less. Failure to
   retain cocaine patients in treatment has both significant research and
   clinical implications. In this paper we qualitatively and quantitatively
   demonstrate the inconsistency found across analyses of retention
   predictors in order to highlight the problem. First, a qualitative
   review of the published literature was undertaken to identify the
   frequency of predictors studied and their relations to treatment
   retention. Second, an empirical demonstration of predictor stability was
   conducted by testing a common set of variables across three similar
   12-week cocaine clinical trials conducted by the same investigators in
   the same research clinic within a five-year period. Results of the
   literature review indicated inconsistently selected variables of
   convenience, widely varying statistical procedures, and discrepant
   findings of significance. Further, quantitative analyses resulted in
   discrepancies in variables identified as significant predictors of
   retention among the three studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity
   affecting the consistency of findings across studies and recommendations
   to improve the validity and generalizability of predictor findings in
   future studies are proposed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   included questions on: 1) current and past tobacco use behaviors; 2)
   demographics; 3) tobacco dependence; 4) decisional balance; 5) health
   behaviors; and 6) perceived stress and depressive symptoms. Saliva
   samples were obtained for measurement of cotinine. The variables related
   to salivary cotinine concentration in the multiple regression model were
   age, marital status, occupation, quit attempts, years of ST use, and
   tobacco dependence score (adjusted R-2 =0.24). Among the 199 snuff only
   users, cotinine concentration was positively related to age, being
   divorced/widowed/separated, no quit attempts in the previous year,
   dependence score, and brand of snuff (adjusted R-2 =0.29). This is one
   of the largest studies to examine influences beyond topography on
   cotinine concentration in a group of rural ST users. These findings
   suggest that smokeless tobacco users and smokers share some similarities
   with respect to tobacco dependence. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   susceptibility in 7th grade, and selecting susceptibles predicted future
   friendship selection and peer influence. Influence processes were

   SDIs participated in the study. Extent of multidrug use and degree of

   into one of four groups: high antisocial/low multidrug use, high
   antisocial/high multidrug use, low antisocial/low multidrug use, and low
   antisocial/high multidrug use. All subjects completed the Iowa Gambling
   Task to assess cognitive impulsivity and the Stroop Task to measure
   motor impulsivity. Contrary to expectations, antisociality was
   associated with more advantageous performance on the Iowa Gambling Task,
   independent of extent of multidrug use. In contrast, greater multidrug
   use was associated with general psychomotor slowing on the Stroop Task.
   Results suggest that a subclinical form of antisociality may have a

   impulsivity among SDIs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

PD DEC 2007

AB Driven by the popularity of social capital theories, the concept of
   community is enjoying a renaissance in sociology. Yet much research in
   this area relies on exclusively "structural" thinking, attributing group
   identification to mechanisms such as the arrangement of physical space,
   power relations, or high investment requirements. Often neglected is a
   strand of theory that attributes gemeinschaft to shared moral order and
   culture. Using data from the Urban Communes Project, this article
   directly tests the influence of both structural and cultural mechanisms
   in producing the experience of community. Although the results show that
   both structural and cultural mechanisms are positively correlated with
   gemeinschaft, they also confirm the existence of shared moral order as
   the most likely proximate mechanism for creating community in these
   groups. Analyses using fuzzy-set techniques illustrate how culture and
   structure combine to sustain-or inhibit-the experience of community.

AB Though largely overlooked by scholars of ethnicity and culture, animal
   practices can structure and reflect identity and social relations. Based
   on individual and group interviews and observations in Berlin, Get-many,
   this study examines how a group of Turkish men experience and assign
   significance to the activity of caring for domestic pigeons. Building on
   approaches to ethnicity that follow the "cognitive turn," as well as
   recent studies of human-anitnal interaction and cultural examinations of
   nature and the environment, this article demonstrates how: (1) these men
   frame their animal practices within their understandings of ethnicity,
   culture, and territory; and (2) communal relationships formed through
   pigeon caretaking reinforce definitions of Turkish ethnicity and culture
   for participants. Beyond offering in situ data on the link between
   animal practices and ethnicity, the analyses and case suggest how and
   why sociologists should consider animals and nature as potential

PY 2007
AB This paper contends that price-setting markets operate as definitional,
   not merely allocation, practices. It argues that such markets operate as
   definitional practices because market participants in the natural course
   of market transactions engage in interactive, interpretive,
   "role-taking" behaviors. These markets are a family of socially evolved
   practices that are not only affected by non market practices, but also
   affect such non market practices, not manifestations of a single
   analytic model. After providing a theoretical framework for these
   claims, the paper examines two emerging auction markets that elucidate
   these claims and played a significant role in generating them: sponsored
   word/phrase Internet search engine markets and equity option markets.
   The paper concludes with three programmatic recommendations grounded in
   this market paradigm.

   the "survivor identity" by those who have been treated for cancer.
   First, we review recent and growing theoretical and empirical
   literatures on cancer and identity and identity transformation. With
   that review as background, we present our own research findings from 2
   separate studies on survivorship and identity. Our data suggest that
   most older adults who have survived cancer for at least 5 years,
   identify as cancer survivors and/or as ex-patients rather than as
   victims or patients. Most also view being a survivor as an important
   part of who they are, do not see themselves as less whole, and are not
   overly concerned about how others view them. To the degree that a
   survivor orientation is associated with better mental health outcomes
   and encourages health promotion and appropriate symptom monitoring, it
   can reinforce the effects of the quality medical care provided by
   clinical staff. The support of clinicians encouraging this orientation,
   where it is appropriate, may further enhance the quality of life of
   individuals who living with a history of cancer.

AB People have been living on Mwoakilloa, a coral atoll in the Federated
   States of Micronesia (FSM), for well over a millennium. Foreign
   interlopers, colonial governments, global commerce, and a host of
   internal and external forces have all played a role in shaping the uses,
   values, and meanings assigned to the atoll, its reefs, and its
   resources. This paper explores the changing relationships among the
   people and reefs of Mwoakilloa, highlighting the multiple, co-existing,
   and sometimes competing meanings and values assigned to atoll resources.
   It emphasizes the point that even in a small, ethnically homogeneous
   population there exists a diversity of meanings associated with reef
   resources that are dependent upon wider socioeconomic contexts.
   Identifying the sources of these cultural meanings is critical for
   understanding behaviors toward and uses of reef resources, the status
   and application of traditional ecological knowledge, and the success and
   failure of local management measures on Mwoakilloa.

AB The social contexts surrounding the use and abuse of inhalants are

   analysis (LPA) to identify specific subgroups of adolescents based on
   social contextual effects surrounding inhalant use episodes in a sample
   of 279 adolescent inhalant users. Findings revealed that a three-class
   solution exhibited the best empirical and conceptual fit with the data.
   Identified classes represented a gradient of low, moderate, and high
   levels of contextual effects where approximately one third of adolescent
   inhalant users reported high levels of inhalant use in response to
   social contextual influences. Subsequent validation analysis showed that
   these gradient-based classes were directly correspondent with severity
   in measures of psychopathology, past drug use, variety of inhalants
   used, and measures of impulsivity and fearlessness. Results indicate
   heterogeneity in contextual effects on inhalant use and suggest that
   follow-up studies should examine the role that susceptibility and
   exposure to contextual effects has on inhalant use. (c) 2007 Elsevier

AB This study examines relationships between country of origin, age of
   drinking onset, and adverse drinking outcomes among young adult Mexican
   Americans in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and
   Related Conditions (NESARC). Logistic regression models estimate
   associations between age of drinking onset, age of onset in relation to
   age at immigration, and adverse drinking outcomes, controlling for sex,
   age, employment, education, marital status, and income. Adjusted
   analyses indicate the odds of adverse drinking outcomes decreased as age
   of drinking onset increased. Mexican Americans who initiated drinking in
   Mexico had significantly lower odds of current or lifetime harmful
   drinking than U.S. born but the odds were not significantly different
   between foreign-born Mexican Americans who initiated drinking in the
   U.S. and U.S. born. Irrespective of whether drinking onset was in Mexico
   or the U.S., foreign-born Mexican Americans had lower odds of alcohol
   abuse than U.S. born. However, odds of dependence were not significantly
   different between foreign-born and U.S.-born Mexican Americans. While
   findings suggest that being foreign born may be protective, further
   research on social and cultural factors impacting drinking onset and
   related outcomes among young Mexican Americans may help inform
   prevention efforts. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Smoking is associated with particular moods and activities, but it is
   not known whether there are individual differences in these associations
   and whether these differences are associated with success in smoking
   cessation. We assessed such associations using ecological momentary
   assessment: real-world, real-time data, collected by palm-top computer.
   Two hundred and fourteen smokers participating in a smoking cessation
   study provided data during ad lib smoking at baseline. Participants
   recorded moods and activities each time they smoked and, for comparison,
   at randomly selected non-smoking occasions. Situational associations
   with smoking were captured by examining the associations between smoking
   and antecedents considered relevant to lapse risk: negative affect (NA),
   arousal, socializing with others, the presence of others smoking, and
   consumption of coffee and alcohol. The associations varied across
   participants, confirming individual differences in situational smoking
   associations. Survival analyses revealed that only the NA pattern
   predicted first lapse. The effect was only seen in EMA assessments of NA
   smoking, and was not captured by questionnaire measures of negative
   affect smoking, which did not predict lapse risk. Moreover, the effect
   was not mediated by nicotine dependence. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Although improvement in psychosocial functioning is a common goal in
   substance-abuse treatment, the primary outcome measure in most cocaine
   trials is urinalysis-verified cocaine use. However, the relationship
   between cocaine use and psychosocial outcomes is not well documented. To
   investigate this relationship and identify the optimal urine-screen
   method, we retrospectively analyzed data from two 25-week randomized
   controlled trials of abstinence reinforcement (AR) in 368 cocaine/heroin
   users maintained on methadone. Cocaine use was measured thrice weekly by
   qualitative urinalysis, benzoylecgonine concentration (BE), and an
   estimate of New Uses of cocaine by application of an algorithm to BE.
   Social adjustment (SAS-SR), current diagnosis of cocaine dependence
   (DSM-IV criteria), and depression symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory)
   were determined at study exit. Cocaine use was significantly lower in AR
   groups than in controls. Across groups, in-treatment cocaine use was
   significantly associated with worse social adjustment, current cocaine
   dependence, and depression at exit. Significant differences were
   detected more frequently with New Uses than qualitative urinalysis or
   BE. Nevertheless, the amount of variance accounted for by the urine
   screens was typically < 15%. Cocaine use during treatment, especially
   when measured with New Uses criteria, can predict psychosocial
   functioning, but cannot substitute for direct measures of psychosocial
   functioning. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objectives: To examine the relations between characteristics of the
   neighborhood built environment and recent alcohol use.
   Methods: We recruited participants through a random digit dial telephone
   survey of New York City (NYC) residents. Alcohol consumption was
   assessed using a structured interview. All respondents were assigned to
   neighborhood of residence. Data on the internal and external built
   environment in 59 NYC neighborhoods were collected from archival
   sources. Multilevel models were used to assess the adjusted relations
   between features of the built environment and alcohol use.
   Results: Of the 1355 respondents, 40% reported any alcohol consumption
   in the past 30 days, and 3% reported more than five drinks in one
   sitting (heavy drinking) in the past 30 days. Few characteristics of the
   built environment were associated with any alcohol use in the past 30
   days. However, several features of the internal and external built
   environment were associated with recent heavy drinking. After
   adjustment, persons living in neighborhoods characterized by poorer
   features of the built environment were up to 150% more likely to report
   heavy drinking in the last 30 days compared to persons living in
   neighborhoods characterized by a better built environment.
   Conclusions: Quality of the neighborhood built environment may be
   associated with heavy alcohol consumption in urban populations,
   independent of individual characteristics. The role of the residential
   environment as a determinant of alcohol abuse warrants further
   examination. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is generally a slowly progressive
   disease that may lead to cirrhosis and liver failure. However, patients
   with PBC often suffer from a variety of symptoms long before the
   development of cirrhosis that include issues of daily living that have
   an impact on their work environment and their individual quality of
   life. We therefore examined multiple parameters by taking advantage of
   the database of our cohort of 1032 patients with PBC and 1041 matched
   controls. The data were obtained from patients from 23 tertiary referral
   centers throughout the United States and from rigorously matched
   controls by age, sex, ethnicity, and random-digit dialing. The data
   showed that patients with PBC were more likely than controls to have
   significant articular symptoms, a reduced ability to perform household
   chores, and the need for help with routine activities. Patients with PBC
   rated their overall activity similar or superior to that of controls;
   however, more of them reported limitations in their ability to carry out
   activities at work or at home and difficulties in everyday activities.
   PBC cases also more frequently reported limitations in participating in
   certain sports or exercises and pursuing various hobbies; however, they
   did not report significant limitations in social activities. In a
   multivariable analysis, household income, a diagnosis of systemic lupus
   erythematosus, limitations in work activities, a reduction in work
   secondary to disability, and church attendance were independently
   increased in PBC cases with respect to controls. Conclusion: Our data
   indicate that the quality of life of patients with PBC in the United
   States is generally well preserved. Nevertheless, patients with PBC
   suffer significantly more than controls from a variety of symptoms that
   are beyond the immediate impact of liver failure and affect their
   lifestyle, personal relationships, and work activities.

AB In this analysis a largely unrecognized contradiction in environmental
   sociology is explored, on one hand as environmental sociologists we wish
   to see humans and their social systems as deeply connected to nature,
   but on the other hand we think of human consciousness as unique and
   somehow altogether different than the phenomena of the natural world. It
   is argued this contradiction comes from an uneven rejection of
   Enlightenment metanarrative. While we have been quite willing to reject
   the human exemptionalist vision of society as independent from nature,
   we have nevertheless been largely unwilling to reject the exemptionalist
   version of consciousness that comes to us from the Cartesian metaphor of
   the mind. A nonexemptionalist version of human consciousness is
   presented that places human thinking squarely within natural
   constraints.

   degradation, low incomes, and multifaceted negative impacts of AIDS.
   Efforts to stimulate and support innovation in agricultural production
   technology, forms of social organization, and poor markets are essential
   elements in promotion of sustainable rural livelihoods. Iowa State
   University's Center for Sustainable Rural Livelihoods and its partner
   organizations are applying a multi-dimensional approach to engage Uganda
   farmers and rural leaders in community-based learning and capability
   strengthening. We describe the role played by livelihood diversification
   and explore the promotion of sustainable livelihoods through scholarship
   with praxis. Sustainable livelihoods concepts are examined as a means to
   better understand contemporary African rural development. We identify
   principles and processes critical to achieving sustainable livelihoods.
   Their application is highlighted based on our early collaborative
   experience, including a discussion of the complexities associated with
   entering into balanced partnerships required for a successful

AB Background: Despite the many triumphs of biomedical research over
   infectious diseases, human pathogens continue to impact profoundly
   populations deprived of social resources. Correspondingly, health
   researchers have advocated a social determinants approach to the study
   and prevention of infectious diseases. However, it is unknown whether
   this call has resulted in an increase in the number of studies examining
   social determinants of infectious outcomes.
   Methods: Research on social determinants of infectious diseases was
   systematically quantified by assessing temporal trends in the published
   literature using MEDLINE, PsycINFO and ISI Web of Science.
   Results: Results of the literature review spanning 1966-2005 show that
   socially related citations increased an annual average of 180.3 for
   neuropsychiatric conditions, 81.9 for chronic conditions, 44.7 for
   sexually transmitted diseases and 18.9 for non-sexually transmitted
   infectious diseases ( p < 0.0001). Of the 279 publications found to
   employ the term "socialepidemiology'', 15 (5.4%) investigated infectious
   outcomes.
   Conclusions: The results of the literature review suggest a paucity of
   social research on infectious diseases. There is a need for increased
   dialogue and collaboration between infectious disease epidemiologists
   and social epidemiologists.

   makes the case that universal social programs are critical to reducing

AB Psychosocial issues are an understudied yet important concern in the
   overall health of hemodialysis (HD) patients. Stress is a concomitant of
   chronic illness and its treatment, and may have meaningful influences on
   psychological and medical outcomes. This article reviews the influences
   of psychopathology, social support, family issues, dialysis unit
   culture, and socioeconomic status on patients treated with center HID.
   Depressive affect and decreased perception of social support have been
   linked with mortality in several studies of ESRD patients. Decreased
   marital satisfaction, disturbances in family dynamics, and lower
   socioeconomic status (SES) have been associated with poorer health
   outcomes and can affect patients' perception of social support and
   depressive affect. Chronically ill ESRD patients who undergo treatment
   with constant interaction and observation by medical staff are
   potentially an ideal group for evaluation of the effects of stress and
   psychosocial factors on outcomes in those with chronic disease, as well
   as an excellent patient population for intervention to reduce morbidity
   and mortality. These interactions between potentially modifiable
   psychosocial risk factors for disease and medical aspects of illness
   form a paradigm for the study of interventions related to adjustment to
   chronic illness in the ESRD population.

   of "The Boarding School for the Gifted Disadvantaged" in Israel. This
   school has proposed a new life category, the "gifted disadvantaged,"
   which was previously unknown in the discursive and practical fields in
   Israel, though closely linked to widespread ethnic classifications in
   Israel. The main findings of this case study show that the boundary work
   engaged in by interviewees differs from that which is widespread in
   research on boundaries. Accordingly, this article identifies three sets
   of in-group boundary work: between types of self (former and current
   selves); between types of personal nature (first nature and second
   nature); and between ethnic intellectuals and everyday ethnics. In
   conclusion, this article examines the finding of this case study in

   resources are used in interaction to facilitate social actors' goal of
   self-verification. As the control of resources fosters
   self-verification, self-verification is expected to influence the
   availability of additional resources for actors to use to sustain
   themselves in future interactions. The authors employ a principal theory
   in sociology on the self, identity theory, to theoretically frame this
   research, and they use a representative sample of individuals in newly
   forged relationships to examine the reciprocal relationship between
   resources and the verification of a person identity and role identity.
   The findings reveal that the relationship between resource use and
   identity verification is mutually reinforcing: resource use facilitates
   identity verification and identity verification increases the resources
   available for future use. This reciprocal relationship occurs across
   identities and over time. The results provide insights on the idea that
   resources at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are mobilized among
   social actors to support the self and each other, help maintain a system
   of interaction, and reproduce culture and social structure.

AB According to the literature, commemorations of difficult pasts can be
   categorized into two main types, fragmented and multivocal-both of which
   serve to express, if not to enhance, social conflicts. Our analysis of
   the first apartheid museum in South Africa, however, points to a
   commemorative type that aims at agreement, not through disagreement and
   debate but through overarching consensus. That consensus is constructed
   through a large degree of control in terms of the form and content of
   the mnemonic object. Having outlined the techniques used to control for
   consensus, we briefly explore the social context of the commemorating
   society, which informed and enabled such a mnemonic construction.

AB We examine here recent arguments that embodied experience is an
   important site of collective memory, and related challenges to the
   standard emphasis on discourse and symbols in collective memory
   research. We argue that although theories of embodied memory offer new
   insights, they are limited by (1) an overdrawn distinction between
   embodied memory and textual memory that neglects the complex relations
   between the two, (2) an overemphasis on ritual performance at the
   expense of collective conversation, (3) an oversimplified view of
   performativity. and (4) an underestimation of the ambiguity in embodied
   performance. Theories of embodied collective memory should be narrowed
   and specified with focused comparisons examining the influence of
   embodied experience in the formation of collective identities, in
   conflicts over collective memories, and in the persistence and
   malleability of memories across generations. We illustrate our argument
   throughout with examples drawn from the collective memory of Bloody
   Sunday in Northern Ireland in 1972.

AB People's connection to land is an important contributor to identity in
   traditional southern society. In small southern communities, to know
   where someone lives is to know who someone is because place assigns
   biography. Studies have investigated the physical and economic
   implications of landscape change in the South, but comparatively little
   research focuses on the impacts to culture of urban growth. We consider
   how sense of place (as an indicator of culture) may be impacted, over
   time, by physical and structural changes in a locale. This point of
   departure examines the temporal dimension of sense of place, or how
   place perceptions may vary as familiar places and practices are altered
   by landscape moderations. We review the literature on sense of place and
   changing Southern landscapes and also offer a conceptual framework for
   analyzing sense of place over the long-term.

AB Here we show that rapid judgments of competence based solely on the
   facial appearance of candidates predicted the outcomes of gubernatorial
   elections, the most important elections in the United States next to the
   presidential elections. In all experiments, participants were presented
   with the faces of the winner and the runner-up and asked to decide who
   is more competent. To ensure that competence judgments were based solely
   on facial appearance and not on prior person knowledge, judgments for
   races in which the participant recognized any of the faces were excluded
   from all analyses. Predictions were as accurate after a 100-ms exposure
   to the faces of the winner and the runner-up as exposure after 250 ms
   and unlimited time exposure (Experiment 1). Asking participants to
   deliberate and make a good judgment dramatically increased the response
   times and reduced the predictive accuracy of judgments relative to both
   judgments made after 250 ms of exposure to the faces and judgments made
   within a response deadline of 2 s (Experiment 2). Finally, competence
   judgments collected before the elections in 2006 predicted 68.6% of the
   gubernatorial races and 72.4% of the Senate races (Experiment 3). These
   effects were independent of the incumbency status of the candidates. The
   findings suggest that rapid, unreflective judgments of competence from
   faces can affect voting decisions.

   for >5 months. The quality of the interaction between children and
   robots improved steadily for 27 sessions, quickly deteriorated for 15
   sessions when the robot was reprogrammed to behave in a predictable
   manner, and improved in the last three sessions when the robot displayed
   again its full behavioral repertoire. Initially, the children treated
   the robot very differently than the way they treated each other. By the
   last sessions, 5 months later, they treated the robot as a peer rather
   than as a toy. Results indicate that current robot technology is
   surprisingly close to achieving autonomous bonding and socialization

AB Background: Women who are victims of domestic violence frequently seek
   care in an emergency department. However, it is challenging to hold
   sensitive conversations in this environment.
   Objective: To describe communication about domestic violence between
   emergency providers and female patients.
   Design: Analysis of audiotapes made during a randomized, controlled
   trial of computerized screening for domestic violence.
   Setting: 2 socioeconomically diverse emergency departments: one urban
   and academic, the other suburban and community-based.
   Participants: 1281 English-speaking women age 16 to 69 years and 80
   providers (30 attending physicians, 46 residents, and 4 nurse
   practitioners).
   Results: 871 audiotapes, including 293 that included provider screening
   for domestic violence, were analyzed. Providers typically asked about
   domestic violence in a perfunctory manner during the social history.
   Provider communication behaviors associated with women disclosing abuse
   included probing (defined as asking >= 1 additional topically related
   question), providing open-ended opportunities to talk, and being
   generally responsive to patient clues (any mention of a psychosocial
   issue). Chart documentation of domestic violence was present in one
   third of cases.
   Limitations: Nonverbal communication was not examined. Providers were
   aware that they were being audiotaped and may have tried to perform
   their best.
   Conclusion: Although hectic clinical environments present many obstacles
   to meaningful discussions about domestic violence, several provider
   communication behaviors seemed to facilitate patient disclosure of
   experiences with abuse. Illustrative examples highlight common pitfalls
   and exemplary practices in screening for abuse and response to
   disclosures of abuse.

AB Racial and ethnic minorities often receive lower-quality health care
   than white patients, even when socioeconomic status, education, access,
   and other factors are used as controls. To address these pervasive
   disparities, health care professionals should learn more about them and
   the roles they can play in eliminating them, but few curricula are
   focused on understanding and addressing racial and ethnic health
   disparities, and well-accepted guidelines on what and how to teach in
   this complex area are lacking.
   The Society of General Internal Medicine Health Disparities Task Force
   used a review and consensus process to develop specific recommendations
   and guidelines for curricula focusing on health disparities. Learning
   objectives, content, methods for teaching, and useful resources are
   provided. Although the guidelines were developed primarily for teaching
   medical students, residents, and practitioners in primary care, the Task
   Force's general recommendations can apply to learners in any specialty.
   The Task Force recommends that a curricula address 3 areas of racial and
   ethnic health disparities and focus on the following specific learning
   objectives: 1) examining and understanding attitudes, such as mistrust,
   subconscious bias, and stereotyping, which practitioners and patients
   may bring to clinical encounters; 2) gaining knowledge of the existence
   and magnitude of health disparities, including the multifactorial causes
   of health disparities and the many solutions required to diminish or
   eliminate them; and 3) acquiring the skills to effectively communicate
   and negotiate across cultures, languages, and literacy levels, including
   the use of key tools to improve communication. The broad goal of a
   curriculum on disparities should be for learners to develop a commitment
   to eliminating inequities in health care quality by understanding and
   assuming their professional role in addressing this pressing health care
   crisis.

AB Background: Wealthier populations do better than poorer ones on most
   measures of health status, including nutrition, morbidity and mortality,
   and healthcare utilization.
   Objectives: This study examines the association between household wealth
   status and HIV serostatus to identify what characteristics and
   behaviours are associated with HIV infection, and the role of
   confounding factors such as place of residence and other risk factors.
   Methods: Data are from eight national surveys in sub-Saharan Africa
   (Kenya, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Tanzania, Lesotho, Malawi, and
   Uganda) conducted during 2003-2005. Dried blood spot samples were
   collected and tested for HIV, following internationally accepted ethical
   standards and laboratory procedures. The association between household
   wealth (measured by an index based on household ownership of durable
   assets and other amenities) and HIV serostatus is examined using both
   descriptive and multivariate statistical methods.
   Results: In all eight countries, adults in the wealthiest quintiles have
   a higher prevalence of HIV than those in the poorer quintiles.
   Prevalence increases monotonically with wealth in most cases. Similarly
   for cohabiting couples, the likelihood that one or both partners is HIV
   infected increases with wealth. The positive association between wealth
   and HIV prevalence is only partly explained by an association of wealth
   with other underlying factors, such as place of residence and education,
   and by differences in sexual behaviour, such as multiple sex partners,
   condom use, and male circumcision.
   Conclusion: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV prevalence does not exhibit the
   same pattern of association with poverty as most other diseases. HIV
   programmes should also focus on the wealthier segments of the
   population. (c) 2007 Wolters Kluwer Health.

AB The authors draw on developmental psychopathology, life course
   sociology, and scholarship on educational processes to develop a
   conceptual framework for understanding the association of children's
   mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this
   framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of
   attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider
   diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent
   classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and
   externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the
   classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school
   completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three
   sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude,
   disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational
   expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude
   and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health
   problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational
   trajectories.

AB Conflict is a dynamic and complex form of human interaction, often
   emerging from incompatible actions, values, and goals and consuming a
   considerable amount of resources. Conflicts are an expression of and a
   contribution to system instability and may lead to chaotic escalation
   between adversaries, causing a breakdown of social and natural systems.
   To resolve conflicts, the actors can adjust their actions toward
   cooperatively stabilizing their interaction and form stable coalitions.
   To study the dynamics of conflict and the evolution of cooperation, we
   introduce an integrated framework for modeling the interaction of
   multiple actors who pursue objectives by allocating their resources to
   various action paths. In repeated learning cycles, actors can adjust
   their actions and resources to those of other actors, thus shifting from
   conflict to cooperation. Within our general framework, it is possible to
   study the complexity and instability of multiactor constellations and
   the transition to cooperation for specific examples in a wide range of
   fields, including military security of missile defense systems and
   environmental conflicts in fishery management, energy, and climate
   change. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   in Grades 1 through 6. Older children were more accurate than younger
   children, yet even the youngest children were able to accurately infer

   suggested that academic ability affects both self and others' (i.e.,

AB This article addresses the question of interaction between Western and
   "non-Western" international relations (IR) by analyzing liberal theory
   of IR that is emerging in contemporary Russia. We argue that, despite a
   growing diversity within Russian scholarship of liberal orientation, it
   remains largely a product of Western, particularly American,
   intellectual hegemony, and more so than any other theoretical
   perspective. As compared to two other existing traditions in Russian
   IR-realism and critical studies-liberalism remains the most dependent
   and therefore must be explored before any other traditions as a crucial
   case for understanding the dialectic of cultural dependence and hegemony
   in production of global knowledge. We argue that the greater dependence
   of Russian liberal IR results from its relatively weak indigenous
   tradition, perception of Russia's material weakness as opportunity, and
   greater availability of Western research funds. We also discuss an
   alternative, less dependent version of Russian liberal IR, and
   opportunities that its existence implies for development of a global,
   de-centered international relations theory.

AB Objective: Research indicates that the social networks of women differ
   from those of men. Although studies indicate that social support greatly
   affects alcohol use, little attention has been paid to gender
   differences in this area. The objective of the current study is to
   examine the pretreatment social networks of women seeking conjoint
   treatment for an alcohol-use disorder. Method: As part of a larger
   randomized clinical trial, 102 women in committed heterosexual
   relationships who were seeking treatment for an alcohol-use disorder at
   an outpatient clinic were interviewed before treatment entry
   Participants completed the Important People and Activities Instrument to
   assess the size and composition of the women's social networks.
   Pretreatment drinking was assessed using the Timeline Followback
   interview. Results: Participants in this study reported fairly large
   supportive networks. Drinking quantity and frequency in the 3 months
   before treatment were examined in light of social network connection.
   Women with moderate/heavy drinking partners reported more drinking days
   but drank fewer drinks per drinking day than women with light
   drinking/abstaining partners. In addition, we found a positive
   association between the number of drinkers in the social network and the
   participant percentage of drinking days. Conclusions: The main findings
   of this study were the significant interrelationships between moderate
   or heavy drinking among social network members and the drinking patterns
   of women with alcohol-use disorders.

AB Objective: Neighborhoods represent a unique level of analysis where
   social and material determinants of social capital may be lodged. The
   1992 civil unrest in Los Angeles following the Rodney King verdict
   provided an opportunity to determine if a change in the material
   environment (i.e., the loss of off-sale alcohol outlets) resulted in a
   subsequent change in a potential indicator of social capital-civic
   engagement-as measured by voting rates. Method: Longitudinal analyses of
   voting rates between 1990 and 1996 for the 480 census tracts affected by
   the civil unrest were conducted. Tracts that lost and did not lose
   off-sale alcohol outlets were compared using piecewise hierarchical
   models that accounted for both time-varying and census-tract-level
   confounders, as well as for spatial autocorrelation. Results: In the
   post-unrest period, the increase in voting was significantly greater in
   tracts where there was a loss of alcohol outlets (P = 0.393, p <.05).
   Findings remained after taking into account time-varying effects of the
   changes in ethnicity, gender, and age; and baseline effects of voting,
   potential for social organization., outlet density, and deprivation. The
   loss of alcohol outlets was associated with an average 3.0% increase in
   voting rate in the post-unrest period, translating into an average
   increase of 50212 voters per tract, depending on the size of the tract.
   Conclusions: Loss of off-sale alcohol outlets in the 1992 civil unrest
   was associated with increased voting at the census tract level. Findings
   support the concept that loss of alcohol outlets in the neighborhood

AB It has been suggested that older adults are more variable in their
   performance because they are more prone to lapses of either attention or
   intention. In the present experiment, 9 young and 9 older adults each
   performed nearly 2,000 trials of a same-different judgment task. As
   expected, older adults were slower and more variable than young adults.
   When the age-related difference in speed was taken into account,
   however, the older adults were, if anything, less variable than the
   young adults. When younger and older adults' RT distributions were
   analyzed using quantile-quantile plots and by fitting ex-Gaussian and
   Weibull functions, there was no consistent evidence that older adults'
   distributions were more skewed than young adults', as would be predicted
   by age-related increases in lapses of attention or intention.
   Importantly, there was a positive, linear relation between RT and
   intraindividual variability, and the same relation was observed both
   within subjects (practice increased speed and reduced variability) as
   well as between subjects (regardless of age, slower individuals were
   more variable). Thus, the present results suggest that there may be a
   general law governing the relation between average RT and variability,
   and that the greater performance variability of older adults primarily
   reflects their greater average RTs.

AB Humla District in Nepal is a very remote area, prone to food shortages
   and characterized by a harsh environment. The livelihoods of
   agropastoralists in this district became much more vulnerable during the
   recent Maoist insurgency, and this vulnerability was particularly acute
   in some areas. As a result, people in different villages responded quite
   differently to an externally funded holistic community development
   project-one of the only projects the Maoists allowed to proceed with in
   Humla during the height of the unrest. Villagers' responses to this
   health- and conservation-oriented development project seem to correlate
   most closely with socioeconomic status and ability to extract resources
   from the local environment, as well as with the nature of the
   relationship with the local Maoist cadres. Villagers' perceptions of the
   risks of becoming involved in the holistic community development
   projects in this area, and their ability or willingness to take part in
   them, are analyzed here, drawing on anthropological analyses of
   perceptions of risk and the diffusion of innovations. We conclude with
   brief recommendations based on this evidence and our experience in the
   field.

AB Objective: To review international research on somatic presentations
   often seen together with or attributed to psychopathology. For
   conceptual clarity, we refer to these presentations as "idiopathic
   somatic complaints and syndromes" (ISCS). This review will also pose
   specific questions on cultural issues affecting these somatic
   manifestations. Method: Selective review of the international literature
   dealing with the phenomenology, epidemiology, and cultural profile of
   ISCS focusing on papers published in refereed journals and written in
   English. Results: Major problems with much of the previous research in
   this area are the use of different definitions and ascertainment
   procedures. As currently conceptualized in the literature, ISCS are
   universal and seem closely related to psychological issues (stress) and
   psychopathological conditions such as depression worldwide. Although
   there are many similarities regarding the form and content of these
   somatic presentations across cultures, there is some evidence for
   cultural patterning of symptoms. Unfortunately, current classifications
   for ISCS are unsatisfactory. Conclusions: We outline specific
   recommendations for conducting future research and for improving the
   classification of ISCS of presumed psychological origin or import in
   future nosologies.

AB Objective: To test the influence of neurocognitive functioning on
   community functioning among formerly homeless persons with serious
   mental illness and to determine whether that influence varies with
   social context, independent of individual characteristics. Methods: In
   metropolitan Boston, 112 persons in Department of Mental Health shelters
   were administered a neuropsychological test battery and other measures
   and then randomly assigned to empowerment-oriented group homes or
   independent apartments, as part of a longitudinal study of the effects
   of housing on multiple outcomes. Subjects' case managers completed
   Rosen's 5-dimensional Life Skills Inventory at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months
   and subjects reported on their social contacts at baseline, 6, 12, and
   18 months. Subject characteristics are controlled in the analysis.
   Results: Three dimensions of neurocognitive functioning-executive
   function, verbal declarative memory, and vigilance-each predicted
   community functioning. Better executive function predicted improved
   self-care and less turbulent behavior among persons living alone, better
   memory predicted more positive social contacts for those living in a
   group home, and higher levels of vigilance predicted improved
   communication in both housing types. Conclusion: Neurocognition predicts
   community functioning among homeless persons with severe mental illness,
   but in a way that varies with the social context in which community
   functioning occurs.

AB The concept of illness career conceptualizes the illness experience as a
   dynamic pathway that takes shape over time as the person interacts with
   the treatment system. In this article we use data from 238 persons
   treated in Vermont State Hospital during the 1950s to evaluate several
   fundamental career assumptions and to illustrate how different
   predictors are contextualized by the career We find that, among persons
   hospitalized for severe mental illness prior to deinstitutionalization,
   social status was more strongly associated with the length of the
   initial hospitalization than illness or community characteristics. We
   also find evidence of accumulation of hospital experience, with the pace
   of later hospitalizations shaped by earlier ones. Institutional reform
   was successful redirecting hospitalization careers and illness
   characteristics become more salient for the pace of hospitalization in
   this post-reform era. While mental health researchers have debated the
   relative influence of social and illness characteristics for predicting
   hospitalization, our findings suggest that the specific influence of any
   of these characteristics depends on where person is in their own illness
   career as well as where that career is located in historical time.

AB The credibility of quantitative social science benefits from policies
   that increase confidence that results reported by one researcher can be
   verified by others. Concerns about replicability have increased as the
   scale and sophistication of analyses increase the possible dependence of
   results on subtle analytic decisions and decrease the extent to which
   published articles contain full descriptions of methods. The author
   argues that sociology should adopt standards regarding replication that
   minimize its conceptualization as an ethical and individualistic matter
   and advocates for a policy in which authors use independent online
   archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating
   published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the
   conditions of availability for any necessary materials that are not
   provided. The author responds to several objections that might be raised
   to increasing the transparency of quantitative sociology in this way and
   offers a candidate replication policy for sociology.

   for replicating quantitative results in sociology. Nonetheless,
   reservations remain, and the author addresses several of them and
   explains why improved replication standards do not endanger participant
   confidentiality, do not undermine incentives for collecting data, do not
   need to wait for greater standardization of data formats, need not
   require that editors assign a reviewer to actually replicate results,
   and do not diminish methodological diversity in any positive sense. The
   author concludes by encouraging sociologists to find a way of moving
   beyond intermittent discussions of replication standards to collective
   action.

AB Background: The HIV/AIDS epidemic in the U.S. South is undergoing a
   marked shift toward a greater proportion of new HIV/AIDS cases in women,
   African-Americans, and through heterosexual transmission.
   Methods: Using consecutive sampling, 611 participants were interviewed
   from eight Infectious Diseases clinics in five southeastern states in
   2001 to 2002.
   Results: Sixty four percent. of participants were African-American, 31%
   were female, and 43% acquired HIV through heterosexual sex; 25% had
   private health insurance. Eighty-one percent were on anfiretroviral
   therapy, and 46% had HIV RNA viral loads (VL) < 400. Women and
   racial/ethnic minorities were less likely to be on antiretrovirals and
   to have VL < 400. Probable psychiatric disorders (54%) and history of
   childhood sexual (30%) and physical abuse (21%) were common.
   Conclusions: Prevention and care systems need to address the HIV
   epidemic's shift into poor, minority, and female populations. High
   levels of trauma and probable psychiatric disorders indicate a need to
   assess for and address these conditions in HIV clinical care.

AB Given the high rates of co-occurring marijuana use and social anxiety,
   the present investigation examined the relations among marijuana use
   motives, marijuana use and problems, and social anxiety in 159 (54.7%
   female) young adults (M-age = 18.74, SD = 1.20). As expected, after
   covarying for a number of variables related to both marijuana use and
   social anxiety (e.g. gender, alcohol use problems, anxiety sensitivity),
   social anxiety predicted greater numbers of marijuana use problems.
   Interestingly, social anxiety was not related to marijuana use
   frequency. Also consistent with prediction, social anxiety was a
   significant predictor of coping and conformity motives for marijuana use
   above and beyond relevant variables. Finally, coping motives for
   marijuana use mediated the relation between social anxiety and marijuana
   use problems. These data provide novel evidence for the unique effects
   of coping-motivated marijuana use in the link between marijuana-related
   impairment and social anxiety. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   treatment research to corroborate subject self-reported alcohol and

   was to examine the associations between college students self-reported
   substance use and corresponding collateral (i.e., friends') reports. A
   total of 100 subject-collateral pairs were recruited from psychology
   courses at a large public university located in the Southeastern, United
   States. Subjects and collaterals provided information specific to their
   own, as well as their friend's, recent (i.e., last 90-days) substance
   use. Study data yielded moderate to good, statistically significant,
   correlations between subject-friend pairs for each type of substance
   use. Discrepancy analyses revealed that the majority of subjects
   reported greater substance use relative to their collateral reports.
   This pattern of response (i.e., subject reporting greater use) is
   consistent with the extant literature. In addition, the friend's
   personal substance use appeared to influence his/her report of the
   subject's alcohol and other drug use. It appears that college student
   self-reports regarding alcohol and other drug use are reasonably

AB Limited research has examined the association of diet with immigrant
   status, adjusting for multiple socio-demographic and contextual
   influences. Among 662 WIC-eligible postpartum women, those who were
   foreign-born and had lived in the United States for 4 or fewer years
   consumed 2.5 more fruit and vegetable servings daily than native-born
   women; this difference diminished with longer US residence. White women
   consumed 1 serving less than Latinas, and those speaking both English
   and Spanish at home consumed 1.4 servings more than English-only
   speakers after adjusting for other covariates.

AB Trends in cocaine use over the past 2 decades were compared across
   levels of education in a population-based US sample of adults.
   Significant inverse associations between educational achievement and
   cocaine use after 1990 were driven by dramatic decreases in persistent
   cocaine use among more highly educated adults, whereas persistent
   cocaine use remained relatively unchanged among those who did not finish
   high school. This emerging health disparity highlights the need for
   improved interventions that target persistent cocaine users with low
   educational achievement.

AB Objectives. We examined how ethnicity and social class influence women's
   perceptions of reproductive health care. Of primary interest was
   assessing whether health care providers are perceived as advising
   low-income women, particularly women of color, to limit their
   childbearing and to what extent they feel they are discouraged by
   providers-from having future children.
   Methods. Ethnically diverse, low-income (n = 193) and middle-class women
   (n = 146) completed a questionnaire about their pregnancy-related health
   care experiences.
   Results. Logistic regression analyses revealed that low-income women of
   color experienced greater odds of being advised to limit their
   childbearing than did middle-class White women. A separate model
   demonstrated that low-income Latinas reported greater odds of being
   discouraged from having children than did middle-class White women.
   Conclusions. Low-income women of color were more likely to report being
   advised to limit their childbearing and were more likely to describe
   being discouraged from having children than were middle-class White
   women. More research is needed regarding how ethnicity and social class
   impact women's experiences with reproductive health care.

AB Objectives. We examined the associations between social support and
   mental and behavioral outcomes among adolescents whose parents were
   infected with or died of HIVAIDS.
   Methods. Families (parents who were HIV infected and their adolescent
   children) were randomly assigned to a coping skills intervention or a
   standard care group. After completing the intervention, the parents and
   adolescents were assessed for 2 years.
   Results. Adolescents who had more social support providers reported
   significantly lower levels of depression and fewer conduct problems;
   adolescents who had more negative influence from role models reported
   more behavior problems. Reductions in depression, multiple problem
   behaviors, and conduct problems were significantly associated with
   better social support.
   Conclusions. Our findings underscore the complex relations between
   social support and mental and behavioral outcomes among adolescents
   affected by HIV/AIDS. Future prevention programs must focus on
   increasing social support to reduce negative outcomes among adolescents
   affected by HIV/AIDS as well as the need to reduce influence from
   negative role models.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of
   perfectionism to judgmental biases, including estimates of aversiveness
   and probability of negative events and consequences, as well as the
   relationship of each of these constructs to measures of anxiety, stress,
   and depression. The Maladaptive Evaluative Concerns (MEC), but not the
   Pure Personal Standards (PPS), dimension of perfectionism was associated
   with greater psychological cost and perceived probability estimates,
   even controlling for concurrent psychological distress. In mediational
   analyses, judgmental bias scores significantly mediated, although only
   partially, the relationship between MEC-MPS scores and each measure of
   psychopathology. In contrast, the relationship of PPS-MPS scores to
   psychopathology was either non-significant or fully mediated by the
   judgmental bias measures, with one exception. Of the two judgmental bias
   factor scores, perceived probabilities rather than psychological costs
   most consistently mediated the relationship between the perfectionism
   dimensions and measures of psychological distress. This is the first
   study providing evidence that judgmental bias as well as the MEC
   dimension of perfectionism are each uniquely associated with risk for
   psychopathology. These findings warrant further investigation in order
   to elucidate how these two sets of cognitive factors increase risk for
   the development of psychopathology.

AB In this analytic review, the authors consider the 'boom' in demand for
   the services of practitioners of modalities of complementary and
   alternative medicine (CAM). The evidence for the increase in demand for
   these services is reviewed and explanations for this phenomenon
   considered and evaluated. Two particular explanations are considered:
   the postmodern thesis and the gendered spirituality thesis, as well as
   more general changes in society. Finally the paper considers the role of
   the social sciences in the legitimation and increasing use of CAM. The
   paper concludes that the trend is likely to continue, as will the role
   of social scientists in observing and documenting CAM.

AB This study examines the impact of self-identified disability experience
   on specific aspects of perceived stigma and their consequences.
   University students with disabilities, close family members of
   individuals with disabilities, those with regular occupational or social
   contact with individuals with disabilities, and others with no
   experience with disability, are compared by means of multivariate
   analyses of survey data. Results suggest that individuals with
   disabilities are expected, both by students with and without disability
   experience, to face social awkwardness and discomfort from others in the
   community, but are not generally expected to be devalued by others
   because of their disabilities. Having a disability, however, increases
   the perception that individuals with disabilities are devalued, and
   decreases perceived emotional well-being. Findings support the
   complexity and multi-dimensionality of the relationship between stigma
   and the disability experience, and suggest that stigma as a
   uni-dimensional construct is far too broad.

AB Introduction: Residence in a deprived neighbourhood is associated with
   lower rates of physical activity. Little is known about the
   manifestation of deprivation that mediates this relationship. This study
   aimed to investigate whether access to physical activity resources
   mediated the relationship between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and
   physical activity among women.
   Method: Individual data from women participating in the Stanford Heart
   Disease Prevention Program (1979-90) were linked to census and archival
   data from existing records. Multilevel regression models were examined
   for energy expenditure and moderate and vigorous physical activity as
   reported in physical activity recalls.
   Results: After accounting for individual-level socioeconomic status,
   women who lived in lower-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods reported
   greater energy expenditure, but undertook less moderate physical
   activity, than women in moderate-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods. In
   contrast, women living in higher-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods
   reported more vigorous physical activity than women in
   moderate-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods. Although availability of
   physical activity resources did not appear to mediate any neighbourhood
   socioeconomic status associations, several significant interactions
   emerged, suggesting that women with low income or who live in
   lower-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods may differentially benefit
   from greater physical activity resource availability.
   Discussion: Although we found expected relationships between residence
   in a lower-socioeconomic status neighbourhood and undertaking less
   moderate or vigorous physical activity among women, we also found that
   these same women reported greater overall energy expenditure, perhaps as
   a result of greater work or travel demands. Greater availability of
   physical activity resources nearby appears to differentially benefit
   women living in lower-socioeconomic status neighbourhoods and low-income
   women, having implications for policy-making and planning.

AB Introduction: Physical activity (PA) is inversely related to the risk of
   many chronic diseases. Understanding PA patterns and their correlates
   thus has significant public health implications. Methods: We evaluated
   PA patterns and their association with socioeconomic status and
   lifestyle factors in the Shanghai Men's Health Study (SMHS), a cohort of
   61,582 Chinese men (participation rate: 74.1%) ages 40-74 living in
   eight communities of urban Shanghai, China. Information on PA from
   exercise, household chores, and walking and bicycling for transportation
   and daily living activities was collected by in-person interviews using
   a validated questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: Participation in exercise was reported by 35.6% of study
   participants, walking and cycling for transportation by 22.6% and 23.5%,
   and walking and cycling for daily living activities by 99.9% and 24.5%.
   Nine percent had high-PA jobs. All kinds of PA, except household chores,
   were more common in older men. Education and income levels were
   positively associated with exercise and housework but inversely
   associated with transportation and daily living activities. Men with
   higher BMI participated in more exercise, whereas those with higher
   waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were less active in all kinds of PA. Current
   smokers, particularly heavy smokers, were less active in all kinds of PA
   compared with former smokers and nonsmokers. Current alcohol drinkers,
   tea drinkers, and ginseng users were more likely to participate in
   exercise but less likely to participate in nonexercise PA. Total energy
   intake was positively associated with PA, except for household chores.
   Conclusions: Despite low participation in exercise/sports, most
   middle-aged and elderly Chinese men in Shanghai participate in a high
   level of nonexercise PA. Their PA patterns are closely associated with
   socioeconomic/lifestyle factors.

AB Eric Bogosian's Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll provides a case study of

   performative directions for masculinities in the future. In this
   article, using Arthur Frank's sociology of the body as an organizing
   lens, I examine the rich narratives Bogosian wrote and performed. The
   problematization of the performance of the male form provides fertile
   ground for testing what it meant to be a man at the time and more
   importantly how masculinities danced across popular culture using
   consumer, aggressive-consumer, aggressive, and communicative forms. I
   interrogate Bogosian's performance as a text that argues against the
   "sex," "drugs," "rock & roll" lifestyle of the era in favor of a more
   communication-based orientation.

   the etiologies of violent and aggressive behavior range from definitive
   biological environmental stressors like lead or polychlorinated
   biphenyls to various socio-cultural environmental stressors, such as
   social, economic, and racial factors. The aim of this paper is (a) to
   provide an overview of the specific effects of the environmental
   stressors that have been associated with violent behavior, and (b) to
   discuss current policies and regulations implemented by the United

AB Sociology, as conceived by Comte, was to put an end to the anarchy of
   opinions characteristic of liberal democracy by replacing opinion with
   the truths of sociology, imposed through indoctrination. Later
   sociologists backed away from this, making sociology acceptable to
   liberal democracy by being politically neutral. The critics of this
   solution asked whose side are we on? Burawoy provides a novel
   justification for advocacy scholarship in sociology. Public sociology is
   intended to have political effects, but also to be funded by the
   politically neutral state. He argues that public sociology is
   institutionally neutral, but that committing to an organic relation with
   a social movement is legitimate as a matter of the sociologist's
   personal value choice. Although this produces side-taking sociology, by
   improving the case for particular standpoints it serves to improve
   democratic discussion generally, which is an appropriately neutral
   public aim.

AB Sociologists have long reflected on what should be taught in sociology.
   In recent years, the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) has
   produced several important publications on key principles and learning
   goals for the introductory course, However, little current work has
   systematically examined what peer-recognized leaders in the field deem
   important for introductory sociology. This paper is an effort to fill
   this research gap. Our research questions include: What do leaders think
   students should understand after an introduction to sociology course? Do
   the goals of Teaching Award winners differ from those of other leaders?
   How do the leaders' goals compare with those expressed in leading SoTL
   publications? To address these questions, we interviewed a sample of 44
   leaders in 2005-2006. Using qualitative content analysis, we
   systematically coded, analyzed, and compared their goals.

AB Teaching about intersecting, fluid and historically contingent
   identities has been taken up extensively within the sociology of race,
   class and gender and women's studies. Oddly, the case of Jewish women
   has been virtually left out of this robust literature. This article
   explores the challenges raised through teaching the course "Jewish Women
   in Contemporary America," and links these challenges to the pedagogy of
   race, class and gender more broadly. Using the classroom as a research
   site, the authors conducted post-course interviews with students and
   kept detailed field notes on class sessions. The authors use Judith
   Butler's theorization of performativity to analyze classroom dynamics.
   After redesigning and teaching the course a second time, the authors
   conclude that the relationship between "experience" and "theory" must be
   constantly interrogated by both instructor and students; that personal
   narratives merit space within the classroom, but must be problematized;
   and a critical Jewish Women's Studies, based on illuminating the
   socially constructed and hybrid character of contemporary Jewish
   American women's identities, can help to expose the tendency to
   methodological essentialism still prevalent in much of the feminist
   race, class, and gender literature.
