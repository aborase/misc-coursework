AB It has become common for sustainability science and resilience theory to
   be considered as complementary approaches. Occasionally the terms have
   been used interchangeably. Although these two approaches share some
   working principles and objectives, they also are based on some distinct
   assumptions about the operation of systems and how we can best guide
   these systems into the future. Each approach would benefit from some
   scholars keeping sustainability science and resilience theory separate
   and focusing on further developing their distinctiveness and other
   scholars continuing to explore them in combination. Three areas of
   research in which following different procedures might be beneficial are
   whether to prioritize outcomes or system dynamics, how best to take
   advantage of community input, and increasing the use of knowledge of the
   past as a laboratory for potential innovations.

AB Ecologists recognize that fire and herbivory are essential to
   maintaining habitat quality in grassland ecosystems. Prescribed fire and
   grazing are typically used on public reserves to increase biodiversity,
   improve grassland productivity, and control encroachment of woody
   plants. However, these tools, particularly prescribed fire, have not
   been widely adopted by private landowners. Fire suppression and
   prescribed fire are strategies that present competing risks to owners
   who make management decisions. We explore landowner perceptions of risk
   associated with (1) eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana)
   encroachment, and (2) the use of prescribed fire to control woody
   species in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri, USA. We
   found that although mapping data of eastern redcedar in this region
   showed substantial encroachment over the past three decades, concept
   mapping of landowner beliefs and in-person interviews of local community
   leaders revealed that perceived risks associated with prescribed fire
   often outweighed those associated with loss of forage and grassland
   habitats.

   foodways among the residents of Hammondville, a late 19th-century,
   multi-ethnic, company-owned mining town located in the Adirondack region
   of eastern upstate New York (USA). The Crown Point Iron Company
   (C.P.I.Co.), which operated the only store in the village, controlled
   both peoples' incomes and the types of food available for purchase.
   Despite this, analysis of company store records and zooarchaeological
   data suggest that individuals and families from different backgrounds
   worked within the structures of company control to construct diets that
   met their subsistence needs and expressed their cultural identities.
   They accomplished this by selectively utilising the store inventory and
   by supplementing store-bought foods through fishing, hunting and raising
   small numbers of domesticated animals.

AB Sacrificing individual material interests for collective benefits
   involves trust that others will act in good faith. Inherent to
   situations concerning collective goods is the problem of the free rider
   that plagues collective action: the individual who maximizes their
   short-term interests at the cost of the greater good. Prior research in
   environmental sociology has identified various social structural factors
   predicting pro-environmental behavior and concern, while research on
   social dilemmas has explored the role of trust in determining
   cooperation in situations regarding collective goods. This research
   draws upon these areas of scholarship to examine the interaction between
   free rider fears with education, income, and ideology in determining the
   willingness of Americans to sacrifice individual interest for
   environmental protection through an analysis of 2010 General Social
   Survey data. Findings help differentiate the engagement of
   pro-environmental behavior from general environmental concern, with the
   fear of free riders particularly impacting the highly educated and
   ideological liberals.

AB The rate of HIV infections among young black men who have sex with men
   (YBMSM) continues to rise at an alarming pace. YBMSM are particularly
   vulnerable to social isolation and a lack of social support due to
   experiences with racism and homophobia, which may have implications for
   sexual risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to explore
   perceptions of social isolation and sense of community among YBMSM, the
   need for and receptivity to social networking features designed to
   reduce social isolation and build community within an Internet-and
   mobile phone-based primary and secondary HIV prevention intervention for
   YBMSM and to identify strategies to develop these features. Focus groups
   were conducted with 22 YBMSM aged 20-30 years at three sites in North
   Carolina. Data from the focus groups were thematically analyzed using
   NVivo. Feelings of social isolation and lack of a sense of community
   were strongly endorsed by participants with homophobia, lack of
   opportunities for social engagement, and a focus on sex rather than
   friendship in interpersonal relationships with other YBMSM cited as
   contributing factors. Participants were receptive to a social networking
   intervention designed to reduce social isolation and build community.
   Recommendations offered by participants to increase acceptability and
   usability of such features included: availability of information about
   healthy relationships, the ability to connect with other YBMSM and
   health care providers, and ensuring the site had ongoing facilitation by
   the study team as well as monitoring for inappropriate content. The
   development of a social networking feature of an HIV prevention
   intervention may present an opportunity to reduce social isolation,
   build community, and reduce risky sexual behaviors among YBMSM. The
   findings from this study are being used to inform the development of a
   social networking feature for an existing Internet-and mobile
   phone-based primary and secondary HIV prevention intervention for YBMSM.

AB This article addresses cultural differences in children's initiative in
   helping in their home. Many 6- to 8-year-old children from an
   Indigenous-heritage community in Guadalajara, Mexico, were reported to
   engage, on their own initiative, in complex work for the benefit of the
   whole family (such as tending younger siblings, cooking, or running
   errands). In contrast, few children from a cosmopolitan community in
   Guadalajara, in which families had extensive experience with Western
   schooling and associated practices, were reported to contribute to
   family household work, and seldom on their own initiative. They were
   more often reported to be involved in activities managed by adults, and
   to have limited time to play, compared with the children in the
   Indigenous-heritage community, who were often reported to have plenty of
   time for free play and often planned and initiated their own
   after-school activities. The differences in children's contributions on
   their own initiative support the idea that children in some Indigenous
   American communities have opportunities and are expected and allowed to
   learn with initiative by observing and pitching in to collaborative
   endeavors of their families and communities. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG,

AB Children's views on their household work as mutual contribution within

   and 10-year-old children from a Mexican city how they viewed child
   participation in family household work. Almost all of the 16 children
   reported that children want to contribute to family household work,
   which they regarded as the shared responsibility of everyone in the
   family. However, the 8 children who lived in an Indigenous-heritage
   community were more often reported to take initiative to make broad and
   complex work contributions than children from a newly schooled
   community. The children in the Indigenous-heritage community more often
   emphasized their mutual coordination and collaboration with other
   members of the family, whereas children from the newly schooled
   community often focused on their personal contributions. We examine
   cultural values that may support children in viewing household work as
   part of being a responsible family member, and consider the possibility

   We report case studies of the instructional approaches taken by 4
   research assistants who were asked to follow a script to casually
   demonstrate how to make an object, leaving room for children's
   initiative. The 2 research assistants who were bilingual European
   American elementary school teachers attempted to control the children's
   attention, motivation, and behavior in accord with accepted pedagogical
   practice - calling children's attention, controlling children's pace and
   keeping them on task using extensive step-by-step explanation, and
   evaluating the children's efforts with praise - even when they were
   trying not to, in order to follow the script. In contrast, the 2
   bilingual Mexican-heritage research assistants guided the children with
   support for their initiative, in line with the cultural tradition of
   Learning by Observing and Pitching In to family and community endeavors,
   allowing the children to take initiative in managing their own
   attention, adjusting the pace of instruction collaboratively, using
   subtle nonverbal cues, and giving feedback without praise. We discuss

   deepen our understanding of the processes involved in LOPI, we discuss

   involve: a calm measured pace; articulate nonverbal conversation and
   parsimonious verbal conversation that build on shared endeavors;
   encouragement of appropriate behavior through narrative approaches; and
   assessment in support of learning to contribute to shared productive

AB What explains the rise of race-conscious affirmative action policies in
   undergraduate admissions? The dominant theory posits that adoption of
   such policies was precipitated by urban and campus unrest in the North
   during the late 1960s. Based on primary research in a sample of 17
   selective schools, we find limited support for the dominant theory.
   Affirmative action arose in two distinct waves during the 1960s. A first
   wave was launched in the early 1960s by northern college administrators
   inspired by nonviolent civil rights protests in the South. A second wave
   of affirmative action emerged in the late 1960s, primarily as a response
   to campus-based student protests. Most late-adopting schools were those
   most favored by the Protestant upper class. Our findings are most
   consistent with a theoretical perspective on institutional change in
   which social movements' effects are mediated by the moral and
   ideological beliefs of key administrators.

AB Primary objective: To summarize the factors associated with athletes'
   disclosure-and non-disclosure-of sports-related concussion and
   concussion symptoms within the context of the socio-ecological framework
   and to identify research gaps in the current literature.
   Methods: Searches using electronic databases identified studies written
   in English, published through October 2013 and addressing some aspect of
   disclosure of concussion and concussion symptoms. The literature search
   aimed to be comprehensive and inclusive of all previous contributions.
   Main outcomes and results: Of the 30 identified studies, most originated
   from the US (n = 19) and sampled athletes (n = 21) and coaches (n = 10)
   from high school (n = 11) and college levels (n = 9). The identified
   reasons for non-disclosure were organized into four levels using the
   socio-ecological framework: intra-personal (e. g. lack of knowledge;
   internal pressure; sex; concussion history; n = 20 studies);
   inter-personal (e. g. others' knowledge/attitudes; external pressure;
   external support; n = 15 studies); environment (e. g. access to
   concussion prevention materials; sports culture; n = 4 studies); and
   policy (e. g. concussion-related legislation; n = 3 studies). No study
   examined all four levels.
   Conclusions: Research gaps exist concerning factors influencing
   athletes' disclosure of sports-related concussions and concussion
   symptoms. Notably, researchers have focused on intra-personal and
   inter-personal levels, placing less emphasis on the environment and
   policy levels.

   revolves around the simple, and often overlooked fact, "All artistic
   work, like all human activity, involves the joint activity of a number,
   often a large number, of people." Among Becker's writing about music, he
   presents an idea that I find is still relevant today, namely, that
   sociological and ethnomusicological work seem to be two hands of a
   single body that have little idea of what each other are doing. Drawing
   on the work of scholars such as Becker and Kay Kaufman Shelemay, I
   propose a model for the construction of the music event that highlights
   the relationship among the many systems behind the musical experience. I
   provide a case study of Inuit throat singing to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of this model in trying to explore the relationships among
   music, culture, and society.

   a template for studying the organization of various musical styles and
   the people who work together to create the musical experiences. Writers
   including Howard Becker, Richard Peterson, Andy Bennett, David Grazian,
   and Joseph Kotarba have explored music scenes ranging from jazz, blues
   and rock to country and Latino styles. Although there is no one
   consensual definition of music scene, the notion of place, in a
   physical, empirical, and geo-local sense, seems to be a universal
   concern in the literature. In this chapter, we will outline a more
   inclusive, interactionist-oriented, and updated concept of the music
   scene that is at once interactionist in tone and perspective, while
   sensitive to dramatic changes occurring both in the world of politics
   and in the world of digital media. Perhaps most importantly, the concept
   of music scene can provide insight into the historical fact that, in
   spite of technological advancements, the live music experience is still
   at the heart of musical experiences across communities and cultures.

AB This is an interpretive study in the sociology of literature that
   explores Aeschylus's trilogy of dramatic plays known as the Oresteia.
   The plays dramatize a normative argument that exemplifies the
   dialectical struggle between domination and democracy. Social relations
   are characterized by agon (struggle), domination, and contradictions
   brought about by learning through suffering. These social realities
   reflect the primary theoretical claim of radical interactionism (RI)
   that domination and conflict are profound, pervasive, and perennial. On
   the interpersonal level, the plays dramatize structure, agency,
   role-taking, and the Thomas Axiom. As the first drama to interrogate an
   inchoate polity as an object of the public's gaze, the Oresteia
   anticipates the sociological importance of critical consciousness,
   collective decision-making, political institutions, moral and,
   ultimately, cultural transformation. Despite a social context of
   slavery, imperialism, xenophobia, ostracism, misogyny, exclusivity, and
   constant warfare, the Oresteia foreshadows Western civilization's ideals
   of legal-rational domination, citizenship, human rights, persuasion, and
   justice that have been imperfectly institutionalized to reduce surplus
   domination. The West still struggles to realize those ideals.

AB Background In 2007, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health
   launched Check Yourself, a new social marketing campaign, as part of
   ongoing efforts to address the persistent syphilis epidemic among men
   who have sex with men (MSM) in the county. The goals of the campaign
   were to increase syphilis testing and knowledge among MSM. Check
   Yourself was planned with careful attention to the principles of social
   marketing, including formative research, market segmentation, and an
   emphasis on building a strong brand.
   Methods A cross-sectional survey using a time-location sample was
   conducted in 2009 for the evaluation. The survey assessed demographics,
   syphilis knowledge, and recent syphilis testing as well as unaided
   awareness, aided awareness, and confirmed awareness, meaning that a
   person had both awareness of the campaign and could correctly identify
   that the campaign was about syphilis. The total sample size was 306.
   Results Unaided awareness for Check Yourself was 20.7%, and aided
   awareness was 67.5%, bringing total campaign awareness to 88.2%;
   confirmed awareness was 30.4%. Unaided campaign awareness was associated
   with syphilis knowledge and important risk behaviors for syphilis,
   indicating that the campaign reached an appropriate audience. Total
   awareness was not associated with recent syphilis testing in a
   multivariate model. However, MSM with confirmed awareness were more than
   6 times more likely to have been recently tested.
   Conclusions The evaluation of Check Yourself found that the campaign had
   a very strong brand among MSM. Although total awareness was not
   associated with syphilis testing, confirmed awareness, a more robust
   measure, was strongly associated.

AB Goodness of fit has been a key theoretical construct for understanding
   caregiver-child relationships. We developed an interview method to
   assess goodness of fit as a relationship construct, and employed this
   method in a longitudinal study of child temperament, family context, and
   attachment relationship formation. Goodness of fit at 4 and 8 months of
   age predicted secure attachment at 15 months, after accounting for
   variance associated with SES, maternal depression, child temperament,
   parenting quality, and family functioning. Structural models indicated
   that prediction of security by goodness of fit and parenting quality was
   relatively independent. The goodness-of-fit pathway was most associated
   with maternal depression, whereas the parenting sensitivity pathway was
   most associated with child temperament, family functioning, and SES.

AB When attempting to value ecosystem services and support their
   production, two critical aspects may be neglected. The term "ecosystem
   services" implies that they are a function of natural processes; yet,
   human interaction with the environment may be key to the production of
   many. This can contribute to a misconception that ecosystem service
   production depends on, or is enhanced by, the coercion or removal of
   human industry. Second, in programs designed to encourage ecosystem
   service production and maintenance, too often the inter-relationship of
   such services with social and ecological processes and drivers at
   multiple scales is ignored. Thinking of such services as
   "social-ecological services" can reinforce the importance of human
   culture, perspectives, and economies to the production of ecosystem
   services. Using a social-ecological systems perspective, we explore the
   integral role of human activity and decisions at pasture, ranch, and
   landscape scales. Just as it does for understanding ecosystems, a
   hierarchical, multiscaled framework facilitates exploring the complexity
   of social-ecological systems as producers of ecosystem services, to
   develop approaches for the conservation of such services. Using
   California's Mediterranean rangelands as a study area, we suggest that
   using a multiscaled approach that considers the importance of the
   differing drivers and processes at each scale and the interactions among
   scales, and that incorporates social-ecological systems concepts, may
   help avoid mistakes caused by narrow assumptions about "natural"
   systems, and a lack of understanding of the need for integrated,
   multiscaled conservation programs.

AB We applied an integrative framework to illuminate and discuss the
   complexities of exurbanization in Macon County, North Carolina. The case
   of Macon County, North Carolina, highlights the complexity involved in
   addressing issues of exurbanization in the Southern Appalachian region.
   Exurbanization, the process by which urban residents move into rural
   areas in search of unique natural amenities and idealized lifestyles,
   can often have a dramatic impact on the local economy, culture, and
   environment. Within Macon County, complex debates and tensions among
   multiple stakeholders struggle to address local residential development.
   How can better problem definition benefit rural communities in
   addressing exurbanization pressures and effects? We asserted that a key
   factor in the shortcomings of previous solutions was the
   shortsightedness inherent in policy that attempts to treat individual
   symptoms without being able to adequately characterize the underlying
   problem. The goal of the integrative framework is to initiate an
   iterative process of transparent negotiation, which recognizes a range
   of potential choices to be considered and to embrace the social
   complexities that can at times overwhelm scholars and practitioners,
   inviting simplification and polarization of the issues. This new and
   emerging framework offers a novel way of approaching conservation and
   development issues where other frameworks have failed. It helps
   acknowledge the difficult choices, i.e., trade-offs, that have to be
   made in a material process like exurbanization. Trade-offs will be
   necessary in any negotiation related to conservation. Therefore,
   conflict surrounding specific values, e. g., cultural, financial, or
   ecological, must be acknowledged upfront to move deeper into issues of
   plurality. Given the complexity, understanding how the process of
   exurbanization is being played out within Macon County provided not only
   an opportunity to demonstrate the functionality of an integrative
   approach, but also a call for further study of exurbanization dynamics.

   are in place to reverse such trends, there seems to be limited

   recent studies showing how the issue of population growth has been
   downplayed and trivialized among scientific fields, which may in part
   account for the reduced public interest in the issue and in turn the
   limited will for policy action. Different sources of evidence suggest
   that population growth could fundamentally affect society, nature, and
   the climate. Although tackling the issue of overpopulation will suffer
   from major impediments including scientific motivation, public
   scientific illiteracy, religion, and media attention, ongoing neglect of
   this issue will increase not only the extent of anthropogenic stressors

   loss and improve human welfare.

AB Background: Research has indicated associations between risky alcohol
   consumption and sexual risk behavior, which may in turn present risk of
   HIV acquisition or transmission. Little is known about social
   determinants of problematic alcohol use among African American MSM (AA
   MSM), a risk group disproportionately affected by HIV. The present study
   sought to explore associations between risky alcohol use and perceived
   peer norms of alcohol use among a sample of urban African American men
   who have sex with men (AA MSM).
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 142 AA MSM in
   Baltimore, Maryland, recruited using active and passive methods. Risky
   and hazardous alcohol use was assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders
   Identification Test (AUDIT) and participants self-reported descriptive
   and injunctive peer norms regarding frequency and quantity of alcohol
   consumption.
   Results: Nearly half reported hazardous or high risk consumption of
   alcohol. Perceived peer alcohol norms, both descriptive and injunctive,
   were associated with alcohol use, including hazardous use.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight the role of social factors on
   problematic alcohol use among AA MSM. Results indicate that AA MSM's use
   of alcohol is associated with their perceptions of peer alcohol use.
   Potential interventions could include norms-based campaigns that seek to
   reduce risky alcohol consumption among AA MSM as well as programs to
   screen and identify individuals with problematic alcohol use. (C) 2013

   35 sociology students in a doctoral program at a large university in the

   felt a great deal of anxiety due to challenges they faced when teaching
   their own course for the first time: challenges such as feelings of
   unpreparedness, constant and unremitting time demands, problems with
   students, a lack of confidence, and insufficient support. Instructors
   employed a number of informal strategies in attempts to mediate the
   personal and professional impact of these challenges. Strategies
   included adjusting expectations, making sacrifices, becoming savvy, and
   creating informal peer networks that provided social support and
   increased access to resources. Findings indicate the need for
   institutional-level changes, including how graduate student teaching is
   viewed within the discipline and the ways graduate instructors are
   supported and prepared to teach. This article concludes with specific

   and a Teaching Confidence Scale. Findings from pre- and posttest data
   show that the seminar lowered graduate students' feelings of anxiety
   about teaching for the first time and increased their levels of
   confidence regarding mastery of common pedagogical skills. Qualitative
   feedback from evaluations further illustrates the positive effects of
   the seminar on students' senses of themselves as teachers and their

   asks two questions: (1) What are the most useful aspects of the
   Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program? (2) Is participation in the PFF
   program associated with greater job satisfaction, confidence, or
   competence? Qualitative data from Indiana University alumni suggest that
   the program is beneficial for exposing students to pedagogical
   knowledge, encouraging professionalization, and providing
   institutionalized support in the form of peer and faculty mentorship.
   Quantitative data indicate that although PFF participants were not
   significantly more satisfied or confident than their nonparticipating
   peers, the PFF program did appear to help to make participants feel more
   competent in their first jobs.

   pedagogy into substantive seminars. Teaching-infused graduate seminars
   are a great way to transmit norms, values, and common practices of the
   department to graduate students, and they allow for discussions of
   particular substantive challenges that graduate student instructors may
   face when teaching undergraduates about privilege, inequality,

   This five-step method provides a plan of action for faculty and graduate
   students who wish to co-develop a course in such a way that graduate
   student mentees are exposed to the entire teaching process with the
   supervision and assistance of a faculty mentor. This relationship moves
   beyond the traditional professor/teaching assistant hierarchy (the TA

   tourism and it also resituates discussions on authenticity within the
   context of capitalist relations of production, consumerism, and
   existentialism. The goal of this conceptual paper is two-fold. First, it
   discusses the evolution of the concept of alienation within sociology
   and cognate disciplines. Second, it addresses the applicability of the
   concept to tourism studies and proposes a working model to guide future

AB Women's social networks and social power are increasingly seen as
   important factors modulating their health in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Polygyny, a common marital structure in many societies, mediates
   important intra-household relationships by requiring both competition
   and co-operation among co-wives. Using mixed methods, semi-structured
   questionnaires were administered to 298 women aged 15-84 living in the
   Kolondieba region of rural Mali in 1999, and supplemented by detailed
   interviews with 40 women. Three categories of outcome were explored:
   illness experience, therapeutic itinerary and social support received.
   Quantitative data were analysed using regression analysis and
   qualitative data using a grounded theory approach. In quantitative
   analyses, controlling for age and household wealth index, senior wives
   were less likely to be escorted to a healer by their husbands during
   illness than were junior wives or monogamous women. Polygynous women
   were also less likely to obtain a treatment for which there was a
   monetary fee. Fewer than one-third of polygynous women reported the
   assistance of a co-wife during illness in any given task. In qualitative
   analyses, women further related varied mechanisms through which polygyny
   impacted their health trajectories. These ranged from strongly
   supportive relationships, to jealousy because of unequal health or
   fertility, bias in emotional and material support provided by husbands,
   and accusations of wrong-doing and witchcraft. This study highlights the
   need for more prospective mixed methods analyses to further clarify the
   impact of polygyny on women's health-related experiences and behaviours
   in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background/Study Context: Social support has been shown to buffer
   cognitive decline in older adults; however, few studies have examined
   the association of distinct functions of perceived social support and
   cognitive function. The current study examined the relations between
   distinct functions of social support and numerous cognitive domains in
   older adults. Methods: Data were derived from a cross-sectional,
   correlational study of cardiovascular risk factors, cognitive function,
   and neuroimaging. The participants were 175 older adults with a mean age
   of 66.32. A number of neuropsychological tests and the Interpersonal
   Support Evaluation List were administered. Multiple linear regression
   analyses were conducted to determine cross-sectional relations of social
   support to cognitive function after controlling for age, gender,
   education, depressive symptomatology, systolic blood pressure, body mass
   index, total cholesterol, and fasting glucose. Results: No significant
   positive relations were found between distinct functions of social
   support and cognitive function in any domain; however, inverse relations
   emerged such that greater social support across several functions was
   associated with poorer nonverbal memory and response inhibition.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that the receipt of social support may be a
   burden for some older adults. Within the current study, fluid cognitive
   abilities reflected this phenomenon. The mechanism through which social
   support is associated with poorer cognitive function in some domains
   deserves further exploration.

   the mode of transport into the park (flying versus driving), and the
   inclusion of cultural tourism helped predict the price of a tour
   package. Our findings suggest that tour operators charge 92% more for a
   day in the Serengeti than other Northern Circuit attractions, but we do
   not examine what happens to the additional rent generated by the
   Serengeti. Additionally, the utility of cultural tourism in attracting
   foreign tourists presents both tremendous opportunities and potential
   challenges to efforts to realize culturally sensitive ecotourism. (C)

AB Previous studies from the US have found that female physicians often
   experience gender-based discrimination related to professional
   advancement. In Japan, female physicians are underrepresented in
   leadership positions but little is known about the prevalence of gender
   discrimination. We investigated the perception and prevalence of
   gender-based career obstacles and discrimination among Japanese
   physicians. The study was based on surveys of alumnae from 13 medical
   schools and alumni from 3 medical schools. In total, 1,684 female and
   808 male physicians completed a self-administered questionnaire
   (response rate 83% and 58%). More women than men had the perception of
   gender-based career obstacles for women (77% vs. 55%; p < 0.0001). Women
   with part-time positions were more likely to have the perception of
   gender-based career obstacles than women working full-time (OR 1.32, 95%
   Cl: 1.01-1.73). More women than men reported experience of gender
   discrimination related to professional advancement (21% vs. 3%; p <
   0.0001). Factors associated with experience of gender discrimination
   included age (p < 0.0001), marital status (p < 0.0001), academic
   positions (p < 0.0001), subspecialty board certification (p = 0.0011),
   and PhD status (p < 0.0001). Women older than 40 years were more likely
   to experience gender discrimination compared with younger women (OR
   5.77, 95% CI: 1.83-18.24 for women above 50, and OR 3.2, 95% CI:
   1.48-7.28 for women between 40 and 49) and women with PhD were more
   likely to experience gender discrimination (OR 4.23, 95% Cl: 1.81-9.89).
   Our study demonstrated that a significant proportion of Japanese women
   experienced gender-based discrimination and perceived gender-based
   career obstacles compared with male physicians.

AB This article presents an alternative account of comparative trajectories
   of secularization and religious change in Europe and America. Building
   on (1) supply-side,' (2) neo-orthodox secularization, and (3)
   historicist schools, the authors develop a synthetic explanatory
   framework which emphasizes changed conditions of religious belonging
   amid the transition to modernity. Modernization, they suggest, disrupted
   older, parochialized forms of religious community which emerged in the
   Middle Ages. The authors describe the rise and diffusion of newer,
   de-parochialized forms of religious belonging and organization in the
   18th and 19th centuries and stress their comparative compatibility with
   modernity; here the authors draw special attention to the impact of
   missionary organizational schemas derived in colonial environments and
   re-purposed for domestic evangelism. They argue that mass unchurching
   was positively related to the persistence of parochialism and negatively
   related to the spread of post-parochialism. The salient comparison is
   therefore not merely between Western Europe and the US, but rather
   between national cases in which de-parochialization accompanied
   political and economic modernization and those in which it did not.

AB BackgroundWhite, compared with Black, adolescents have higher rates of
   alcohol use and show more rapid increases in alcohol use. Racial
   differences in type of alcohol beverage (i.e., beer, wine, and liquor)
   consumed by youth have received scant attention, and little is known
   regarding changes in type of alcohol beverage consumed during
   adolescence, when experimentation may transition to more regular use.
   MethodsThis study used repeated measures latent class analysis to
   identify distinct profiles that represent change in type of alcohol
   beverage consumed across ages 11 to 18 and to examine predictors (e.g.,
   caretaker alcohol use, perceived peer alcohol use, ease in accessing
   alcohol, perceived neighborhood risk indicated by witnessing drug
   dealing), most of which were measured at ages 11 to 12, of alcohol use
   profiles in the Pittsburgh Girls Study (n=2,171; 57% Black, 43% White),
   a community sample with annual follow-ups.
   ResultsAmong Black girls, 2 profiles were identified: Low Use (76%), and
   Alcohol Use involving primarily liquor starting around age 15 (24%).
   Among White girls, 4 profiles were identified: Wine sippers (11%); a Low
   Use profile with low probability of drinking until age 18, when use of
   beer and liquor increased (52%); an Increasing Use profile with
   increased probability of drinking beer and liquor starting at age 15
   (23%); and a High Alcohol Use profile, starting with use of wine, then
   shifting to use primarily of beer and liquor after age 13 (14%).
   Separate risk factor analyses conducted by race indicated similar
   predictors for Black and White girls: perceived ease in accessing
   alcohol, witnessing neighborhood drug dealing, and perceived peer
   alcohol use were each associated with heavier drinking profiles.
   ConclusionsLongitudinal profiles of type of alcoholic beverages, within
   and across racial groups, can guide the tailoring of interventions to
   address developmentally salient turning points in alcohol use for
   specific subgroups of girls.

AB Previous studies have demonstrated significant relationships among
   various cognitive variables such as negative cognition, self-efficacy,
   and social anxiety. Unfortunately, few studies focus on the role of
   cognition among youth, and researchers often fail to use domain-specific
   measures when examining cognitive variables. Therefore, the purpose of
   the present study was to examine domain-specific cognitive variables
   (i.e., socially oriented negative self-referent cognition and social
   self-efficacy) and their relationships to social anxiety in children and
   adolescents using structural equation modeling techniques. A community
   sample of children and adolescents (n = 245; 55.9% female; 83.3%
   Caucasian, 9.4% African American, 2% Asian, 2% Hispanic, 2% "other," and
   1.2% not reported) completed questionnaires assessing social cognition
   and social anxiety symptomology. Three latent variables were created to
   examine the constructs of socially oriented negative self-referent
   cognition (as measured by the SONAS scale), social self-efficacy (as
   measured by the SEQSS-C), and social anxiety (as measured by the SPAI-C
   and the Brief SA). The resulting measurement model of latent variables
   fit the data well. Additionally, consistent with the study hypothesis,
   results indicated that social self-efficacy likely mediates the
   relationship between socially oriented negative self-referent cognition
   and social anxiety, and socially oriented negative self-referent
   cognition yields significant direct and indirect effects on social
   anxiety. These findings indicate that socially oriented negative
   cognitions are associated with youth's beliefs about social abilities
   and the experience of social anxiety. Future directions for research and
   study limitations, including use of cross-sectional data, are discussed.

AB For half a century explaining human altruism has been a major research
   focus for scholars in a wide variety of disciplines, yet answers are
   still sought. Here, paradigms like reciprocal altruism, mutualism, and
   group selection are set aside, to examine the effects of social
   selection as an under-explored model. To complement Alexander's
   reputational-selection model, I introduce group punishment as another
   type of social selection that could have impacted substantially on the
   development of today's human nature, and on our potential for behaving
   altruistically. Capital punishment is a decisive type of social
   selection, which in our past hunter-gatherer environment was aimed
   primarily against intimidating, selfish bullies, so it is proposed that
   moral sanctioning has played a major part in genetically shaping our
   social and political behaviours. Aggressive suppression of free-riding
   deviants who bully or deceive has made a cooperatively generous,
   egalitarian band life efficient for humans, even as it has helped our
   species to evolve in directions that favour altruism.

AB What we humans call ethics or morality depends on four interlocking
   brain processes: (1) caring (supported by the neuroendocrine system, and
   emerging in the young as a function of parental care); (2) learning
   local social practices and the ways of others - by positive and negative
   reinforcement, by imitation, by trial and error, by various kinds of
   conditioning, and by analogy; (3) recognition of others' psychological
   states (goals, feelings etc.); (4) problem-solving in a social context.
   These four broad capacities are not unique to humans, but are probably
   uniquely developed in human brains by virtue of the expansion of the
   prefrontal cortex (this formulation is based on Chapter 1 of my book,
   Braintrust: What neuroscience tells us about morality).

AB Moral judgment constitutes an important aspect of adults' social
   interactions. How do adults' moral judgments develop? We discuss work
   from cognitive and social psychology on adults' moral judgment, and we
   review developmental research to illuminate its origins. Work in these
   fields shows that adults make nuanced moral judgments based on a number
   of factors, including harm aversion, and that the origins of such
   judgments lie early in development. We begin by reviewing evidence
   showing that distress signals can cue moral judgments but are not
   necessary for moral judgment to occur. Next, we discuss findings
   demonstrating that both children and adults distinguish moral violations
   from violations of social norms, and we highlight the influence of both
   moral rules and social norms on moral judgment. We also discuss the
   influence of actors' intentions on moral judgment. Finally, we offer
   some closing thoughts on potential similarities between moral cognition
   and reasoning about other ideologies.

AB Morality is at the core of what it means to be social. Moral judgments
   require the recognition of intentionality, that is, an attribution of
   the target's intentions towards another. Most research on the origins of
   morality has focused on intragroup morality, which involves applying
   morality to individuals in one's own group. Yet, increasingly, there has
   been new evidence that beginning early in development, children are able
   to apply moral concepts to members of an outgroup as well, and that this
   ability appears to be complex. The challenges associated with applying
   moral judgments to members of outgroups includes understanding group
   dynamics, the intentions of others who are different from the self, and
   having the capacity to challenge stereotypic expectations of others who
   are different from the ingroup. Research with children provides a window
   into the complexities of moral judgment and raises new questions, which
   are ripe for investigations into the evolutionary basis of morality.

AB Research has documented that sexual minorities are at greater risk for
   substance use than heterosexuals. However, there are limited studies and
   mixed findings when investigating these health disparities among racial
   and ethnic minority samples. We used an intersectionality framework to
   examine disparities in lifetime substance use problems between
   heterosexual and sexual minority men and women and within sexual
   minority groups among a racially diverse sample. Method: A
   nonprobability sample of heterosexual (n = 1,091) and sexual minority (n
   = 1,465) patients from an urban community health center ranged in age
   from 18 to 72 years. Participants completed a brief patient survey and
   reported demographic information and history of lifetime substance use
   problems. Logistic regressions analyses were used to examine
   interactions between and among sexual orientation, gender, and race.
   Results: We found a significant three-way interaction among sexual
   orientation, gender, and race. Sexual minorities had a greater risk of
   self-reported lifetime substance use problems than heterosexuals, with
   nuanced gender and racial differences. Of greatest note, sexual minority
   women of color had greater risks than heterosexual women of color and
   than White sexual minority women. Sexual minority men of color did not
   differ in their risk when compared with heterosexual men of color, and
   they had lower risk than White sexual minority men. Conclusions: The
   results of this study demonstrate that an intersectionality framework is
   crucial to clearly identify lifetime substance use disparities between
   racially diverse sexual minority and heterosexual men and women. Future
   research, treatment, and policy should use intersectionality approaches
   when addressing substance use disparities.

   and surrogate decision-making were explored using qualitative, thematic
   content analysis, and overarching themes from focus group transcripts
   were identified. The mean age of the 69 participants was 69 +/- 14, and
   29% were African American, 26% were white, 26% were Asian or Pacific
   Islander, and 19% were Latino. Seventy percent of participants engaged

   subthemes were identified within three overarching categories:
   communication (unspoken expectations and discussion of death as taboo),
   emotion (emotional stress and feelings of loneliness), and conflict
   (family conflict and potential solutions to prevent conflict). These
   findings suggest that birth order and family dynamics can have profound
   effects on surrogate stress and coping. Clinicians should be aware of
   potential unspoken filial expectations for firstborns and help
   facilitate communication between the patient, surrogate, and extended
   family to reduce stress and conflict.

AB Background. Food store availability may determine the quality of food
   consumed by residents. Neighborhood racial residential segregation,
   poverty, and urbanicity independently affect food store availability,
   but the interactions among them have not been studied.
   Purpose. To examine availability of supermarkets, grocery stores, and
   convenience stores in US census tracts according to neighborhood
   racial/ethnic composition, poverty, and urbanicity. Methods. Data from
   2000 US Census and 2001 InfoUSA food store data were combined and
   multivariate negative binomial regression models employed.
   Results. As neighborhood poverty increased, supermarket availability
   decreased and grocery and convenience stores increased, regardless of
   race/ethnicity. At equal levels of poverty, Black census tracts had the
   fewest supermarkets, White tracts had the most, and integrated tracts
   were intermediate. Hispanic census tracts had the most grocery stores at
   all levels of poverty. In rural census tracts, neither racial
   composition nor level of poverty predicted supermarket availability.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood racial composition and neighborhood poverty
   are independently associated with food store availability. Poor
   predominantly Black neighborhoods face a double jeopardy with the most
   limited access to quality food and should be prioritized for
   interventions. These associations are not seen in rural areas which
   suggest that interventions should not be universal but developed
   locally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Childhood scholars have found that age inequality can be as profound an
   axis of meaningful difference as race, gender, or class, and yet the
   impact of this understanding has not permeated the discipline of
   sociology as a whole. This is one particularly stark example of the
   central argument of this article: despite decades of empirical and
   theoretical work by scholars in "the social studies of childhood,"
   sociologists in general have not incorporated the central contributions
   of this subfield: that children are active social agents (not passive),
   knowing actors strategizing within their constraints (not innocent),
   with their capacities and challenges shaped by their contexts (not
   universally the same). I contend that mainstream sociology's relative
   imperviousness has led to theoretical costs for both childhood
   scholars-who must re-assert and re-prove the core insights of the
   field-and sociologists in general. Using three core theoretical debates
   in the larger discipline-about independence, insecurity, and
   inequality-I argue that children's perspectives can help scholars ask
   new questions, render the invisible visible, and break through
   theoretical logjams. Thus would further research utilizing children's
   perspectives and the dynamics of age extend the explanatory power of
   social theory.

AB Smoking has declined in Canada in recent years. However, it is not clear
   whether differences in current smoking by socioeconomic status have

   We examined rates of current smoking by sex, education, and province
   from 1950 to 2011. Differences in current smoking, initiation, and
   cessation were summarized using relative and absolute measures.
   Between 1950 and 2011, the prevalence of current smoking (including
   daily and non-daily) among adults aged 20 years and older decreased
   steadily in men from 68.9 % (95 % CI 63.9-73.3) to 18.6 % (14.9-22.1)
   but in women increased slightly from 38.2 % (32.3-42.2) in 1950 to 39.1
   % (36.4-41.2) in 1959 before declining to 15.4 % (11.9-18.9) in 2011.
   Among men, there was an inverse association between educational
   attainment and smoking which was consistent from 1950 to 2011. A similar
   gradient emerged in the mid-1960s in women. Absolute differences in
   rates of smoking across levels of education increased despite overall
   declines in smoking across all levels of education. Rates of smoking in
   women and men were higher in the Atlantic Provinces and Quebec, although
   in men these differences have declined since the 1990s. In a subset of
   data from 1999 to 2011, those with lower levels of education had higher
   levels of smoking initiation and lower levels of cessation.
   Smoking rates have fallen over time but socioeconomic differences have
   increased. Smoking prevalence peaked later in lower socioeconomic status
   (SES) groups, and rates of decline in lower SES groups and certain
   provinces have been less steep. This suggests that SES gradients emerge
   rapidly in later stages of the tobacco epidemic and may have increased
   through greater efficacy of tobacco control policies in reducing smoking
   among those of higher SES compared to those of lower SES. Tailored
   approaches may be required to reduce smoking rates in those of lower SES
   and narrow SES differences.

AB The lack of individual socioeconomic status (SES) information in cancer
   registry data necessitates the use of area-based measures to investigate
   health disparities. Concerns about confidentiality, however, prohibit
   publishing patients' residential locations at the subcounty level. We
   developed a census tract-based composite SES index to be released in
   place of individual census tracts to minimize the risk of disclosure.
   Two SES indices based on the measures identified in the literature were
   constructed using factor analysis. The analyses were repeated using the
   data from the 2000 decennial census and 2005-2009 American Community
   Survey to create the indices at two time points, which were linked to
   2000-2009 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data to
   estimate incidence and survival rates.
   The two indices performed similarly in stratifying census tracts and
   detecting socioeconomic gradients in cancer incidence and survival. The
   gradient in the incidence is positive for breast and prostate, and
   negative for lung cancers, in all races, although the level varies. The
   positive gradient in survival is more salient for regional-staged
   breast, colorectal, and lung cancers.
   The census tract-based SES index provides a valuable tool for monitoring
   the disparities in cancer burdens while avoiding potential identity
   disclosure. This index, divided into tertiles and quintiles, is now
   available to the researchers on request.

AB This article provides a new view on the old problem of herding in the
   global south by foreign portfolio investors. It advocates a liquidity
   perspective that problematizes the capacity for a herd to form because
   of the absence of sufficient counterparties willing to trade. Drawing on
   ethnographic interviews with local professional investors in Malaysia (a
   substantively and theoretically important stock market) the findings are
   non-intuitive relative to the common-sense expectations of the
   information asymmetry and identity-based herding literatures. Although
   locals watch their foreign competitors closely, and therefore could
   imitate their trades, these small, local finance firms find few reasons
   to imitate these powerful international actors. Instead, locals enable
   crowds of foreigners because they are willing to be counterparties even
   when they perceive the foreigner's trade as savvy, highly skilled or
   informed. The conclusion explores implications for herding, global
   capital flows and social structures that may generate liquidity in
   business-to-business markets.

AB Over the last few decades, primate sanctuaries have become more
   numerous, particularly in Africa. Sanctuaries play an obvious and vital
   role in the battle against the illegal trade in wildlife and provide
   opportunities for local people to learn about the importance of
   protecting habitat and laws governing wildlife trade. Given the
   multi-disciplinary role of sanctuaries, the Pan African Sanctuary
   Alliance provides mechanisms to exchange best practices and establishes
   links to other conservation partners. In April 2011, the managers of the
   22 Pan African Sanctuary Alliance members were surveyed in order to
   collect detailed information on the conservation activities of each
   sanctuary. The majority of the 22 sanctuaries conducted both on- and
   off-site education activities, engaging more than 429,000 people in
   education activities per year. Sanctuaries reported that they provided
   employment for over 550 local community members across Africa, as well
   as resources for community education and infrastructure, with an
   economic impact over $3 million per year. Sanctuaries were also involved
   in activities that promote law enforcement and believed that the
   activities they supported have led to better protection of primate
   habitats. The results of the survey demonstrate that sanctuaries have
   moved towards supporting and implementing community development
   activities aimed at poverty reduction, while conducting conservation
   activities. While Pan African Sanctuary Alliance sanctuaries were
   initially established to provide care and housing for orphaned,
   confiscated and displaced primates, this paper demonstrates how
   sanctuaries have combined ex-situ with in-situ initiatives to support
   social, economic, and environmental progress in primate range countries
   in Africa.

AB It is established in the literature that disparities exist in the
   quality of healthcare for patients from disadvantaged backgrounds and
   lower socioeconomic status. There may be roadblocks within the field of
   neurosurgery preventing equal access and quality of care. Our goal was
   to study the similarities between pediatric patients with shunted
   hydrocephalus of different insurance types and race.
   A retrospective chart review was performed on all pediatric patients who
   underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting from 1990-2010 at our
   institution. Race and insurance type were recorded and assessed against
   specific outcome measures to statistically compare complication rates.
   A complete record was found for 373 patients who received 849 shunting
   procedures at our institution. No differences were found between racial
   groups and insurance type for overall shunt survival, total revision
   number, or average time to failure. However, nonwhite patients spent an
   average of 3 days longer in the hospital at initial shunting (p = 0.04),
   and those with public insurance stayed for 5 days longer (p = 0.002).
   Patients with public insurance were more likely to present with shunt
   failure from outside hospitals (p = 0.005) and be born prematurely (p <
   0.001). Private patients were more likely to have a neoplasm present at
   time of initial shunt placement (p = 0.003).
   While overall revision rate was not affected by race or insurance
   status, there were significant delays in discharge for patients with
   public insurance. Moreover, potential disparities in outpatient access
   to primary physicians and specialists may be affecting care.

AB Bariatric surgery is one of few obesity treatments to produce
   substantial weight loss but only a small proportion of
   medically-eligible patients, especially men and racial minorities,
   undergo bariatric surgery.
   To describe primary care patients' consideration of bariatric surgery,
   potential variation by sex and race, and factors that underlie any
   variation.
   Telephone interview of 337 patients with a body mass index or BMI > 35
   kg/m(2) seen at four diverse primary care practices in Greater-Boston.
   Patients' consideration of bariatric surgery.
   Of 325 patients who had heard of bariatric surgery, 34 % had seriously
   considered surgery. Men were less likely than women and African
   Americans were less likely than Caucasian patients to have considered
   surgery after adjustment for sociodemographics and BMI. Comorbid
   conditions did not explain sex and racial differences but racial
   differences dissipated after adjustment for quality of life (QOL), which
   tended to be higher among African American than Caucasian patients.
   Physician recommendation of bariatric surgery was independently
   associated with serious consideration for surgery [OR 4.95 (95 % CI
   2.81-8.70)], but did not explain variation in consideration of surgery
   across sex and race. However, if recommended by their doctor, men were
   as willing and African American and Hispanic patients were more willing
   to consider bariatric surgery than their respective counterparts after
   adjustment. Nevertheless, only 20 % of patients reported being
   recommended bariatric surgery by their doctor and African Americans and
   men were less likely to receive this recommendation; racial differences
   in being recommended surgery were also largely explained by differences
   in QOL. High perceived risk to bariatric surgery was the most commonly
   cited barrier; financial concerns were uncommonly cited.
   Single geographic region; examined consideration and not who eventually
   proceeded with bariatric surgery.
   African Americans and men were less likely to have considered bariatric
   surgery and were less likely to have been recommended surgery by their
   doctors. Differences in how obesity affects QOL appear to account for
   some of these variations. High perceived risk rather than financial
   barrier was the major deterrent for patients.

AB Inequity in cancer outcomes for minorities and vulnerable populations
   has been linked to delays in cancer care that arise from barriers to
   accessing care. Social service barriers represent those obstacles
   related to meeting life's most basic needs, like housing and income,
   which are often supported by public policy, regulation and services.
   To examine the association between social service barriers and timely
   diagnostic resolution after a cancer screening abnormality.
   Secondary analysis of the intervention arm of Boston Patient Navigation
   Research Program (2007-2008) conducted across six urban community health
   centers. Subjects with no barriers, other barriers, and social service
   barriers were compared on their time to diagnostic resolution.
   Women a parts per thousand yen 18 years of age with a breast or cervical
   cancer screening abnormality.
   Social service barriers included: income supports, housing and
   utilities, education and employment, and personal/family stability and
   safety. Time to event analyses compared across five groups: those with
   no barriers, one barrier (other), one barrier (social service), two or
   more barriers (all other), and two or more barriers (at least one social
   service).
   1,481 navigated women; 31 % Hispanic, 27 % Black, 32 % White; 37 %
   non-English speakers and 28 % had private health insurance. Eighty-eight
   women (6 %) had social service barriers. Compared to those without
   social service barriers, those with were more likely to be Hispanic,
   younger, have public/no health insurance, and have multiple barriers.
   Those with two or more barriers (at least one social service barrier),
   had the longest time to resolution compared to the other four groups
   (aHR resolution < 60 days = 0.27, a parts per thousand yen 60 days =
   0.37).
   Vulnerable women with multiple barriers, when at least one is a social
   service barrier, have delays in care despite navigation. The impact of
   patient navigation may never be fully realized if social service
   barriers persist without being identified or addressed.

AB PurposeSecond generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are widely used for
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), although without strong evidence
   base. With substantial numbers of veterans returning from
   Iraq/Afghanistan conflicts with PTSD, it is important to characterize
   the extent of SGA use and identify associated factors.
   MethodsWe determined time trends and patient characteristics associated
   with the use of SGAs in veterans with PTSD, without comorbid
   schizophrenia or bipolar disorders, using the Department of Veterans
   Affairs national administrative data 2003-2010.
   ResultsAmong 732085 veterans with PTSD, 27.6% received an intentional
   trial of an SGA in 2003-2010. The annual number treated with SGAs almost
   doubled (45268 to 84197, p<0.001), while prescribing rates decreased
   (28.6% to 21.5%, p<0.001). In multivariate analyses, African Americans
   (odds ratio (OR)=1.07, 95%confidence interval (CI)=1.06-1.09) and
   Hispanics (OR= 1.13, 95%CI=1.10-1.17) were more likely to receive SGAs
   than Whites. Strongest clinical associations were with prior diagnosis
   of depression (OR=1.96; 95%CI=1.94-1.99), substance use disorders
   (OR=1.86; 95%CI=1.84-1.88), and other anxiety disorders (OR=1.27;
   95%CI=1.26-1.29) (all p-<0.0001) as well as cardiovascular risk factors.
   Veterans previously deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan had lower likelihood of
   SGA receipt. Substantial regional differences were demonstrated
   (South>Northeast; Midwest and West<Northeast; p<0.0001); regional
   administrative units (veterans integrated service networks) contributed
   minimally to regional differences.
   ConclusionsPost-traumatic stress disorder population growth is driving
   substantial increases in SGA use. Decreasing rates of the Department of
   Veterans Affairs prescribing may be due to integrated system-wide
   mechanisms (e.g., national practice guidelines), although regional
   variations remain prominent. These analyses provide foundational steps
   for identifying modifiable provider-level and organization-level
   determinants of SGA prescription in this growing population. Published

AB Many studies report an association of cognitive and social experiential
   factors and related traits with dementia risk. Further, many
   clinical-pathologic studies find a poor correspondence between levels of
   neuropathology and the presence of dementia and level of cognitive
   impairment. The poor correspondence suggests that other factors
   contribute to the maintenance or loss of cognitive function, with
   factors associated with the maintenance of function referred to as
   neural or cognitive reserve. This has led investigators to examine the
   associations of cognitive and social experiential factors with
   neuropathology as a first step in disentangling the complex associations
   between these experiential risk factors, neuropathology, and cognitive
   impairment. Despite the consistent associations of a range of cognitive
   and social lifestyle factors with cognitive decline and dementia risk,
   the extant clinical-pathologic data find only a single factor from one
   cohort, linguistic ability, related to AD pathology. Other factors,
   including education, harm avoidance, and emotional neglect, are
   associated with cerebrovascular disease. Overall, the associations are
   weak. Some factors, such as education, social networks, and purpose in
   life, modify the relation of neuropathology to cognition. Finally, some
   factors such as cognitive activity appear to bypass known pathologies
   altogether suggesting a more direct association with biologic indices
   that promote person-specific differences in reserve and resilience.
   Future work will first need to replicate findings across more studies to
   ensure the veracity of the existing data. Second, effort is needed to
   identify the molecular substrates of neural reserve as potential
   mediators of the association of lifestyle factors with cognition.

   properties of the Psychosocial Assessment Tool 2.0_General (PAT2.0_GEN),
   a brief screener for psychosocial risk in families of children with
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Methods:Caregivers of 42 youth with IBD
   were recruited and administered a battery of measures including the
   PAT2.0_GEN and well-validated measures of child emotional and behavioral
   functioning at baseline and at a 6-month follow-up.Results:Internal
   consistency for the PAT2.0_GEN total score was good (=0.82). Baseline
   was significantly associated with the 6-month follow-up (r=0.79,
   P<0.001). Significant correlations between the baseline PAT2.0 _GEN
   total score and caregiver-reported Child Behavior Checklist total scores
   at baseline (r=0.74, P<0.001) and at a 6-month follow-up (r=0.62,
   P<0.001) support the content and predictive validity of the PAT2.0_GEN.
   Baseline PAT2.0_GEN was also significantly correlated with
   youth-reported Child Behavior Checklist total scores at baseline
   (r=0.37, P=0.02) but not at the 6-month follow-up (r=0.23,
   P=0.17).Conclusions:A number of indicators support the concurrent and
   predictive utility of the PAT2.0_GEN. The PAT2.0_GEN is a promising tool
   for screening psychosocial risk that could facilitate the provision of
   psychosocial services to those patients most in need.

AB Understanding the intentions and desires of those around us is vital for
   adapting to a dynamic social environment. In this paper, a novel
   event-related functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) paradigm with
   dynamic and natural stimuli (2 s video clips) was developed to directly
   examine the neural networks associated with processing of gestures with
   social intent as compared to nonsocial intent. When comparing social to
   nonsocial gestures, increased activation in both the mentalizing (or
   theory of mind) and amygdala networks was found. As a secondary aim, a
   factor of actor-orientation was included in the paradigm to examine how
   the neural mechanisms differ with respect to personal engagement during
   a social interaction versus passively observing an interaction. Activity
   in the lateral occipital cortex and precentral gyrus was found sensitive
   to actor-orientation during social interactions. Lastly, by manipulating
   face-visibility we tested whether facial information alone is the
   primary driver of neural activation differences observed between social
   and nonsocial gestures. We discovered that activity in the posterior
   superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) and fusiform gyrus (FFG) was partially
   driven by observing facial expressions during social gestures.
   Altogether, using multiple factors associated with processing of natural
   social interaction, we conceptually advance our understanding of how
   social stimuli is processed in the brain and discuss the application of
   this paradigm to clinical populations where atypical social cognition is
   manifested as a key symptom. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives: Rates of powder cocaine and crack use have fluctuated among
   adolescents over recent decades. Little attention has been paid to
   recent trends, particularly regarding differences between users of
   powder cocaine and crack-two forms of the substance that are commonly
   reported together as "cocaine" use, despite having different effects and
   rates of adverse outcomes. Methods: We examined data from nationally
   representative samples of high school seniors who participated in the
   Monitoring the Future study during years 2005-2011 (weighted N = 65
   717). Results: Many demographic and socioeconomic variables were
   similarly correlated with lifetime use of powder cocaine and crack.
   Income of >$50/week from job increased the odds for use, and income of
   >$50/week from sources other than a job more than doubled the odds for
   use. High religiosity, high parent education, identifying as black, and
   residing with one or two parents reduced odds for use. Hispanic students
   were at higher odds for use of crack and females were at lower odds for
   using powder cocaine. Among cocaine users, residing with one or two
   parents lowered odds for using both forms, and more religious students
   and Hispanics were at higher odds for crack-only use. Conclusions: Those
   interested in preventing initiation and adverse consequences of cocaine
   use should take into account the overlapping, yet different risk
   profiles of powder cocaine and crack users when developing programming.
   This is particularly important when considering differences in legal
   consequences for these pharmacologically similar forms of cocaine.

AB ObjectivesSleep comprises one-third of one's life, yet little is known
   about sleep in developing countries. Furthermore, many studies in
   industrialized countries have reported that sleep duration and quality
   decline with aging, but whether this association persists globally is
   unknown. This study's objectives were to characterize sleep in a
   community without electricity in Haiti and to examine associations
   between measures of sleep and age.
   MethodsFifty-eight Haiti residents (50% women) in four age groups,
   18-30, 31-50, 51-64, and 65 years participated. Three days of wrist
   actigraphy were used to estimate sleep patterns.
   ResultsMean (standard deviation) values of sleep measures were: 20:57
   (0:40) for sleep onset, 4:54 (0:43) for sleep end, 9.3 (1.2) h for time
   in bed, 7.0 (1.0) h for sleep duration, 54 (24) min awake after sleep
   onset, and 88.7 (5.4)% for sleep maintenance (percentage of sleep period
   actually spent sleeping). There were no significant differences in the
   sleep measures between men and women. Regression analyses adjusting for
   sex, household size, and number of people sleeping in the same room
   indicated that only sleep fragmentation differed by age group.
   Specifically, mean fragmentation was higher in the youngest age group
   than all other age groups, which did not differ from one another.
   ConclusionsAverage time in bed in this Haitian sample was greater than
   previously reported for industrialized countries like the United States
   (9.3 versus. 7-8 h);, however, actual sleep duration averaged only 7 h.
   No age-related decline in sleep duration or quality was observed in
   Haiti. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 26:80-86, 2014. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

AB Recent findings suggest that tracking others' beliefs is not always
   effortful and slow, but may rely on a fast and implicit system. An
   untested prediction of the automatic belief tracking account is that own
   and others' beliefs should be activated in parallel. We tested this
   prediction measuring continuous movement trajectories in a task that
   required deciding between two possible object locations. We
   independently manipulated whether participants' belief about the object
   location was true or false and whether an onlooker's belief about the
   object location was true or false. Manipulating whether or not the
   agent's belief was ever task relevant allowed us to compare performance
   in an explicit and implicit version of the same task. Movement
   parameters revealed an influence of the onlooker's irrelevant belief in
   the implicit version of the task. This provides evidence for parallel
   activation of own and others' beliefs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Group functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies suggest that
   anxiety disorders are associated with anomalous brain activation and
   functional connectivity (FC). However, brain-based features sensitive
   enough to discriminate individual subjects with a specific anxiety
   disorder and that track symptom severity longitudinally, desirable
   qualities for putative disorder-specific biomarkers, remain to be
   identified. Blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI during emotional
   face perceptual tasks and a new, large-scale and condition-dependent FC
   and machine learning approach were used to identify features (pair-wise
   correlations) that discriminated patients with social anxiety disorder
   (SAD, N = 16) from controls (N = 19). We assessed whether these features
   discriminated SAD from panic disorder (PD, N = 16), and SAD from
   controls in an independent replication sample that performed a similar
   task at baseline (N: SAD = 15, controls = 17) and following 8-weeks
   paroxetine treatment (N: SAD = 12, untreated controls = 7). High SAD vs
   HCs discrimination (area under the ROC curve, AUC, arithmetic mean of
   sensitivity and specificity) was achieved with two FC features during
   unattended neutral face perception (AUC = 0.88, P<0.05 corrected). These
   features also discriminated SAD vs PD (AUC = 0.82, P = 0.0001) and SAD
   vs HCs in the independent replication sample (FC during unattended angry
   face perception, AUC = 0.71, P = 0.01). The most informative FC was left
   hippocampus-left temporal pole, which was reduced in both SAD samples
   (replication sample P = 0.027), and this FC increased following the
   treatment (post>pre, t((11)) = 2.9, P = 0.007). In conclusion, SAD is
   associated with reduced FC between left temporal pole and left
   hippocampus during face perception, and results suggest promise for
   emerging FC-based biomarkers for SAD diagnosis and treatment effects.

AB Introduction: Black women have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy
   outcomes and the characteristics of thrombotic risk factors in this
   population are unknown. The objective of this study was to examine the
   racial differences in thrombotic risk factors among women with adverse
   pregnancy outcomes.
   Methods: Uniform data were collected in women with adverse pregnancy
   outcomes (pregnancy losses, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),
   prematurity, placental abruption and preeclampsia) referred to
   Thrombosis Network Centers funded by the Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention (CDC).
   Results: Among 343 white and 66 black women seen for adverse pregnancy
   outcomes, protein S and antithrombin deficiencies were more common in
   black women. The prevalence of diagnosed thrombophilia was higher among
   whites compared to blacks largely due to Factor V Leiden mutation. The
   prevalence of a personal history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) did not
   differ significantly by race. A family history of VTE, thrombophilia,
   and stroke or myocardial infarction (MI) was higher among whites. Black
   women had a higher body mass index, and a higher prevalence of
   hypertension, while the prevalence of sickle cell disease was
   approximately 27 fold higher compared to the general US black
   population.
   Conclusions: Thrombotic risk factors differ significantly in white and
   black women with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Such differences highlight
   the importance of considering race separately when assessing thrombotic
   risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB ObjectivesTo determine themes and beliefs that influence health-seeking
   behaviour and barriers to accessing surgical care.
   MethodsIn January 2012 in Western Area Province of Sierra Leone, six
   Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were conducted. The FDGs consisted of
   three male only and three female only groups in an urban, a slum and a
   rural setting. Researchers investigated a wide range of topics including
   definitions of surgery, types of surgical procedures, trust, quality of
   care, human resources, post-operative care, permission-seeking and
   traditional beliefs.
   ResultsAlthough many individual beliefs were expressed, common fears
   were as follows: becoming half human after surgery; complications from
   procedures; stigma from having a scar; and financial burdens resulting
   from the cost of care. Participants also expressed concern about the
   quality of the care available in Sierra Leone.
   ConclusionsThe concept of being half human after surgery, previously not
   documented in the literature, is noteworthy and should be explored more
   fully. Qualitative research in other parts of Sierra Leone and other
   LMICs into beliefs of the local population could improve programmes for
   access and delivery of surgical care.

AB BackgroundThe influences of socioeconomic status (SES) on the incidence
   rates of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) are unclear.
   MethodsData from the California Cancer Registry and U.S. Census were
   used to compare incidence rates and trends of OPSCC and other human
   papillomavirus-related and -unrelated cancer sites by neighborhood SES,
   race/ethnicity, and sex.
   ResultsThe incidence of OPSCC rose in both higher and lower SES
   neighborhoods. Absolute rates were greater in the latter. Only
   non-Hispanic white males with OPSCC demonstrated a significant increase
   in the incidence rate of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
   (SCCHN). The incidence rate for this group increased from 4.5/100,000
   person-years between 1988 and 1992 to 7.1 between 2003 and 2009.
   Regression analysis demonstrated an annual percentage change of 1% from
   1988 to 1997 and 4% thereafter.
   ConclusionsIncreases in incidence rates are SES independent. Incidence
   rates are higher in lower-SES groups. The rise in OPSCC incidence is
   limited to non-Hispanic white males. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Black men have higher blood pressure (BP) levels and consequently higher
   prevalence of hypertension compared with men from other ethnic groups in
   the United States. Socio-familial factors in childhood have been found
   to play an important role in hypertension, but few studies have examined
   this relationship among black men. We investigated whether childhood
   family living arrangements are independently associated with mean BP and
   hypertension in a cross-sectional sample of 515 unrelated black male
   participants aged 20 years enrolled in the Howard University Family
   Study between 2001 and 2008. Black men who lived with both parents
   compared with the reference group of men who never lived with both
   parents during their lifetime had lower systolic BP (-4.4 mm Hg [95%
   confidence interval {CI}, -7.84 to -0.96]), pulse pressure (-3.9 mm Hg
   [95% CI, -6.28 to -1.51]), and mean arterial BP (-2.0 mm Hg [95% CI,
   -4.44 to 0.51]). This protective effect was more pronounced among men
   who lived with both parents for 1 to 12 years of their lives; they had
   decreased systolic BP (-6.5 mm Hg [95% CI, -10.99 to -1.95]), pulse
   pressure (-5.4 mm Hg [95% CI, -8.48 to -2.28]), mean arterial pressure
   (-3.3 mm Hg [95% CI, -6.56 to 0.00]), and a 46% decreased odds of
   developing hypertension (odds ratio=0.54; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.99). No
   statistically significant associations were found for diastolic BP.
   These results provide preliminary evidence that childhood family
   structure exerts a long-term influence on BP among black men.

AB Avant-garde theatre is often invoked as the bellwether for a society
   that has become postdramatic - fragmented, alienated, and critical of
   efforts to create collectively shared meanings. A theatre whose
   sequenced actions have no narrative (so the story goes) mirrors a social
   world where the most conflictual situations no longer appear as drama
   but merely as spectacle: a society where audiences look on without any
   feeling or connection. Because only half right, these theses about
   postdramatic theatre and society are fundamentally wrong. As modern
   societies have expanded and differentiated, the elements that compose
   performances have become separated and often fragmented in both theatre
   and society. If they can be brought back together again, performances
   are viewed as authentic and meaningful. If (re)fusion cannot be
   achieved, performances fail to communicate meaning. The aim of this
   essay is to demonstrate that a shared ambition to (re)fuse fragmented
   performative elements has defined the most important strain of
   avant-garde theatre over the last two centuries. Most radical theatrical
   innovation has sought to open live drama back up to the telos of myth
   and ritual. Neither in theatre nor social life can the world transcend
   dramaturgy; it is fundamental to the search for meaning in a world
   beyond cosmological religion.

AB Background: Although maternal postpartum depression (PPD) is a
   well-documented phenomenon that has been the focus of a large body of
   literature, much less is known about the prevalence and predictors of
   depressive symptoms among fathers following the birth of a child.
   Particularly scarce is research with Mexican American men, an
   understudied population at high risk given limited socioeconomic
   resources and elevated rates of maternal PPD.
   Methods: The current study used descriptive and path analyses to examine
   the prevalence and predictors of PPD in 92 Mexican American Gathers (M
   age =31.3 years).
   Results: At both 15 and 21 postpartum week assessments, 9% of fathers
   met criteria for PPD. Path analyses suggested that unemployment status,
   fewer biological children, poor marital relationship quality, and lower
   orientation to Anglo culture predicted higher 15 week paternal PPD
   symptoms, which was associated with greater paternal depressive symptoms
   at 21 weeks. Predictive paths from symptoms of maternal to paternal PPD
   were not significant.
   Limitations: Lack of generalizability to other ethnic groups, sampling
   of primarily resident fathers, and the absence of historical assessments
   of depression are limitations of the current study.
   Conclusions: Findings support the importance of PPD screenings among
   Mexican American fathers and suggest certain demographic, familial, and
   cultural factors may render men particularly vulnerable for
   maladjustment during the early infancy period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB The current study examined whether reactive and/or proactive aggression
   in adolescent males prospectively predicted increased levels of
   internalizing symptoms (depression and anxiety) in late adolescence. It
   was postulated that reactive aggression would be robustly related to
   later internalizing problems, but only among adolescent males who had
   problematic family or peer social relationships. Participants were a
   racially diverse group of 289 adolescent males (Mean age=16). Measures
   of reactive and proactive aggression, peer rejection, and poor
   parent-adolescent communication were examined as predictors of both
   depression and anxiety symptoms assessed approximately 3 years later.
   The interactive effects between the two facets of aggression and
   measures of peer rejection and poor parent-adolescent communication in
   predicting internalizing problems was also examined. Adolescents with
   high levels of reactive aggression were more likely to exhibit elevated
   internalizing problems during late adolescence, even when controlling
   for pre-existing levels of anxiety/depression. However, this association
   only emerged for adolescents who had high levels of peer rejection
   and/or poor communication with their parent. Consistent with
   expectations, proactive aggression was unrelated to internalizing
   symptoms regardless of social relationship quality. Adolescent reactive,
   but not proactive, aggression is a risk factor for the development of
   internalizing problems. However, the findings suggest that interventions
   designed to foster positive social relationships among reactively
   aggressive youth may help protect them from developing significant
   internalizing problems over time. Aggr. Behav. 40:69-78, 2014. (c) 2013

AB When parents select similar sounding names for their children, do they
   set themselves up for more speech errors in the future? Questionnaire
   data from 334 respondents suggest that they do. Respondents whose names
   shared initial or final sounds with a sibling's reported that their
   parents accidentally called them by the sibling's name more often than
   those without such name overlap. Having a sibling of the same gender,
   similar appearance, or similar age was also associated with more
   frequent name substitutions. Almost all other name substitutions by
   parents involved other family members and over 5% of respondents
   reported a parent substituting the name of a pet, which suggests a
   strong role for social and situational cues in retrieving personal names
   for direct address. To the extent that retrieval cues are shared with
   other people or animals, other names become available and may substitute
   for the intended name, particularly when names sound similar.

AB Studies of Asian-American adults have found high estimates of
   problematic gambling. However, little is known about gambling behaviors
   and associated measures among Asian-American adolescents. This study
   examined gambling perceptions and behaviors and health/functioning
   characteristics stratified by problem-gambling severity and
   Asian-American and Caucasian race using cross-sectional survey data of
   121 Asian-American and 1659 Caucasian high-school students.
   Asian-American and Caucasian adolescents significantly differed on
   problem-gambling severity, with Asian-American adolescents more often
   reporting not gambling (24.8% vs. 16.4%), but when they did report
   gambling, they showed higher levels of at-risk/problem gambling (30.6%
   vs. 26.4%). Parental approval or disapproval of adolescent gambling also
   significantly differed between races, with Asian-American adolescents
   more likely to perceive both parental disapproval (50.0% vs. 38.2%) and
   approval (19.3% vs. 9.6%) of gambling. Asian-American adolescents were
   also more likely to express concern about gambling among close family
   members (25.2% vs. 11.6%). Among Asian-American adolescents, stronger
   associations were observed between at-risk/problem gambling and smoking
   cigarettes (interaction odds ratio = 12.6). In summary, differences in
   problem-gambling severity and gambling perceptions indicate possible
   cultural differences in familial attitudes towards gambling. Stronger
   links between cigarette smoking and risky/problematic gambling amongst
   Asian-American adolescents suggest that prevention and treatment efforts
   targeting youth addictions consider cultural differences. (C) 2013

AB Background: Recent obesity prevention initiatives focus on healthy
   neighborhood design, but most research examines neighborhood food retail
   and physical activity (PA) environments in isolation. We estimated
   joint, interactive, and cumulative impacts of neighborhood food retail
   and PA environment characteristics on body mass index (BMI) throughout
   early adulthood.
   Methods and Findings: We used cohort data from the Coronary Artery Risk
   Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study [n=4,092; Year 7 (24-42
   years, 1992-1993) followed over 5 exams through Year 25 (2010-2011);
   12,921 person-exam observations], with linked time-varying geographic
   information system-derived neighborhood environment measures. Using
   regression with fixed effects for individuals, we modeled time-lagged
   BMI as a function of food and PA resource density (counts per
   population) and neighborhood development intensity (a composite density
   score). We controlled for neighborhood poverty, individual-level
   sociodemographics, and BMI in the prior exam; and included significant
   interactions between neighborhood measures and by sex. Using model
   coefficients, we simulated BMI reductions in response to single and
   combined neighborhood improvements. Simulated increase in supermarket
   density (from 25th to 75th percentile) predicted inter-exam reduction in
   BMI of 0.09 kg/m(2) [estimate (95% CI): -0.09 (-0.16, -0.02)].
   Increasing commercial PA facility density predicted BMI reductions up to
   0.22 kg/m(2) in men, with variation across other neighborhood features
   [estimate (95% CI) range: -0.14 (-0.29, 0.01) to -0.22 (-0.37, -0.08)].
   Simultaneous increases in supermarket and commercial PA facility density
   predicted inter-exam BMI reductions up to 0.31 kg/m(2) in men [estimate
   (95% CI) range: -0.23 (-0.39, -0.06) to -0.31 (-0.47, -0.15)] but not
   women. Reduced fast food restaurant and convenience store density and
   increased public PA facility density and neighborhood development
   intensity did not predict reductions in BMI.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that improvements in neighborhood food
   retail or PA environments may accumulate to reduce BMI, but some
   neighborhood changes may be less beneficial to women.

AB Objective To examine whether observed differences in dementia rates
   between black and white older people living in the community could be
   explained by measures of socioeconomic status (income, financial
   adequacy, education, and literacy) and health related factors.
   Design Prospective cohort study.
   Setting General community from two clinic sites in the United States
   (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee).
   Participants 2457 older people (mean age 73.6 years; 1019 (41.5%) black;
   1233 (50.2%) women), dementia-free at baseline, in the Health, Aging,
   and Body Composition study.
   Main outcome measure Dementia was determined over 12 years (ending
   January 2011) by prescribed dementia drugs, hospital records, and
   decline in global cognitive scores. The influence of socioeconomic
   status and health related factors on dementia rates was examined in a
   series of Cox proportional hazard models in which these variables were
   added sequentially in covariate blocks.
   Results Over follow-up, 449 (18.3%) participants developed dementia.
   Black participants were more likely than white participants to develop
   dementia (211 (20.7%) v 238 (16.6%), P<0.001; unadjusted hazard ratio
   1.44, 95% confidence interval 1.20 to 1.74). The hazard ratio lessened
   somewhat after adjustment for demographics, apolipoprotein E e4,
   comorbidities, and lifestyle factors (1.37, 1.12 to 1.67) but was
   greatly reduced and no longer statistically significant when
   socioeconomic status was added (1.09, 0.87 to 1.37).
   Conclusion These findings suggest that differences in the burden of risk
   factors, especially socioeconomic status, may contribute to the higher
   rates of dementia seen among black compared with white older people.
   Strategies aimed at reducing these disparities may favorably affect the
   incidence of dementia.

AB Research evidence indicates that obesity has spread through social
   networks, but lever points for interventions based on overlapping
   networks are not well studied. The objective of our research was to
   construct and parameterize a system dynamics model of the social
   transmission of behaviors through adult and youth influence in order to
   explore hypotheses and identify plausible lever points for future
   childhood obesity intervention research. Our objectives were: (1) to
   assess the sensitivity of childhood overweight and obesity prevalence to
   peer and adult social transmission rates, and (2) to test the effect of
   combinations of prevention and treatment interventions on the prevalence
   of childhood overweight and obesity. To address the first objective, we
   conducted two-way sensitivity analyses of adult-to-child and
   child-to-child social transmission in relation to childhood overweight
   and obesity prevalence. For the second objective, alternative
   combinations of prevention and treatment interventions were tested by
   varying model parameters of social transmission and weight loss behavior
   rates. Our results indicated child overweight and obesity prevalence
   might be slightly more sensitive to the same relative change in the
   adult-to-child compared to the child-to-child social transmission rate.
   In our simulations, alternatives with treatment alone, compared to
   prevention alone, reduced the prevalence of childhood overweight and
   obesity more after 10 years (1.2-1.8% and 0.2-1.0% greater reduction
   when targeted at children and adults respectively). Also, as the impact
   of adult interventions on children was increased, the rank of six
   alternatives that included adults became better (i.e., resulting in
   lower 10 year childhood overweight and obesity prevalence) than
   alternatives that only involved children. The findings imply that social
   transmission dynamics should be considered when designing both
   prevention and treatment intervention approaches. Finally, targeting
   adults may be more efficient, and research should strengthen and expand
   adult-focused interventions that have a high residual impact on
   children.

AB In the third millennium B. C., the Indus Civilization flourished in
   northwest India and Pakistan. The late mature phase (2200-1900 B. C.)
   was characterized by long-distance exchange networks, planned urban
   settlements, sanitation facilities, standardized weights and measures,
   and a sphere of influence over 1,000,000 square kilometers of territory.
   Recent paleoclimate reconstructions from the Beas River Valley
   demonstrate hydro-climatic stress due to a weakened monsoon system may
   have impacted urban centers like Harappa by the end of the third
   millennium B. C. the impact of environmental change was compounded by
   concurrent disruptions to the regional interaction sphere. Climate,
   economic, and social changes contributed to the disintegration of this
   civilization after 1900 B. C. We assess evidence for paleopathology to
   infer the biological consequences of climate change and socio-economic
   disruption in the post-urban period at Harappa, one of the largest urban
   centers in the Indus Civilization. Bioarchaeological evidence
   demonstrates the prevalence of infection and infectious disease
   increased through time. Furthermore, the risk for infection and disease
   was uneven among burial communities. Corresponding mortuary differences
   suggest that socially and economically marginalized communities were
   most vulnerable in the context of climate uncertainty at Harappa.
   Combined with prior evidence for increasing levels of interpersonal
   violence, our data support a growing pathology of power at Harappa after
   2000 B. C. Observations of the intersection between climate change and
   social processes in proto-historic cities offer valuable lessons about
   vulnerability, insecurity, and the long-term consequences of short-term
   strategies for coping with climate change.

AB To account for the widespread human tendency to cooperate in one-shot
   social dilemmas, some theorists have proposed that cooperators can be
   reliably detected based on ethological displays that are difficult to
   fake. Experimental findings have supported the view that cooperators can
   be distinguished from defectors based on "thin slices'' of behavior, but
   the relevant cues have remained elusive, and the role of the judge's
   perspective remains unclear. In this study, we followed triadic
   conversations among unacquainted same-sex college students with
   unannounced dyadic one-shot prisoner's dilemmas, and asked participants
   to guess the PD decisions made toward them and among the other two
   participants. Two other sets of participants guessed the PD decisions
   after viewing videotape of the conversations, either with foreknowledge
   (informed), or without foreknowledge (naive), of the post-conversation
   PD. Only naive video viewers approached better-than-chance prediction
   accuracy, and they were significantly accurate at predicting the PD
   decisions of only opposite-sexed conversation participants. Four
   ethological displays recently proposed to cue defection in one-shot
   social dilemmas (arms crossed, lean back, hand touch, and face touch)
   failed to predict either actual defection or guesses of defection by any
   category of observer. Our results cast doubt on the role of
   "greenbeard'' signals in the evolution of human prosociality, although
   they suggest that eavesdropping may be more informative about others'
   cooperative propensities than direct interaction.

AB Post-acute inpatient rehabilitation services are associated with
   improved functional outcomes among persons with traumatic brain injury
   (TBI). We sought to investigate racial and insurance-based disparities
   in access to rehabilitation. Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample
   from 2005-2010 were analyzed using standard descriptive methods and
   multivariable logistic regression to assess race- and insurance-based
   differences in access to inpatient rehabilitation after TBI, controlling
   for patient- and hospital-level variables. Patients with moderate to
   severe TBI aged 18-64 years with complete data on race and insurance
   status discharged alive from inpatient care were eligible for study.
   Among 307,675 TBI survivors meeting study criteria and potentially
   eligible for discharge to rehabilitation, 66% were white, 12% black, 15%
   Hispanic, 2% Asian, and 5% other ethnic minorities. Most whites (70%),
   Asians (70%), blacks (59%), and many Hispanics (49%) had insurance.
   Compared with insured whites, insured blacks had reduced odds of
   discharge to rehabilitation (odds ratio [OR] 0.84; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] 0.75-0.95). Also, insured Hispanics (OR 0.52; 95% CI
   0.44-0.60) and insured Asians (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39-0.73) were less
   likely to be discharged to rehabilitation than insured whites. Compared
   with insured whites, uninsured whites (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.51-0.63),
   uninsured blacks (OR 0.33; 95% CI 0.26-0.42), uninsured Hispanics (OR
   0.27; 95% CI 0.22-0.33), and uninsured Asians (OR 0.40; 95% CI
   0.22-0.73) were less likely to be discharged to rehabilitation. Race and
   insurance are strong predictors of discharge to rehabilitation among
   adult TBI survivors in the United States. Efforts are needed to
   understand and eliminate disparities in access to rehabilitation after
   TBI.

AB Background: Default from multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
   treatment remains a major barrier to cure and epidemic control. We
   sought to identify patient risk factors for default from MDR-TB
   treatment and high-risk time periods for default in relation to
   hospitalization and transition to outpatient care.
   Methods: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 225 patients who
   initiated MDR-TB treatment between 2007 through 2010 at a rural TB
   hospital in the Western Cape Province, South Africa.
   Results: Fifty percent of patients were cured or completed treatment,
   27% defaulted, 14% died, 4% failed treatment, and 5% transferred out.
   Recent alcohol use was common (63% of patients). In multivariable
   proportional hazards regression, older age (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.97 [95%
   confidence interval 0.94-0.99] per year of greater age), formal housing
   (HR=0.38 [0.19-0.78]), and steady employment (HR= 0.41 [0.19-0.90]) were
   associated with decreased risk of default, while recent alcohol use (HR=
   2.1 [1.1-4.0]), recent drug use (HR= 2.0 [1.0-3.6]), and Coloured (mixed
   ancestry) ethnicity (HR= 2.3 [1.1-5.0]) were associated with increased
   risk of default (P< 0.05). Defaults occurred throughout the first 18
   months of the two-year treatment course but were especially frequent
   among alcohol users after discharge from the initial four-to-five-month
   in-hospital phase of treatment, with the highest default rates occurring
   among alcohol users within two months of discharge. Default rates during
   the first two months after discharge were also elevated for patients who
   received care from mobile clinics.
   Conclusions: Among patients who were not cured or did not complete
   MDR-TB treatment, the majority defaulted from treatment. Younger,
   economically-unstable patients and alcohol and drug users were
   particularly at risk. For alcohol users as well as mobile-clinic
   patients, the early outpatient treatment phase is a high-risk period for
   default that could be targeted in efforts to increase treatment
   completion rates.

AB Prior work has established robust diversity in the extent to which
   different moral values are endorsed. Some people focus on values related
   to caring and fairness, whereas others assign additional moral weight to
   ingroup loyalty, respect for authority and established hierarchies, and
   purity concerns. Five studies explore associations between endorsement
   of distinct moral values and a suite of interpersonal orientations:
   Machiavellianism, prosocial resource distribution, Social Dominance
   Orientation, and reported likelihood of helping and not helping kin and
   close friends versus acquaintances and neighbors. We found that
   Machiavellianism (Studies 1, 3, 4, 5) (e. g., amorality, controlling and
   status-seeking behaviors) and Social Dominance Orientation (Study 4)
   were negatively associated with caring values, and positively associated
   with valuation of authority. Those higher in caring values were more
   likely to choose prosocial resource distributions (Studies 2, 3, 4) and
   to report reduced likelihood of failing to help kin/close friends or
   acquaintances (Study 4). Finally, greater likelihood of helping
   acquaintances was positively associated with all moral values tested
   except authority values (Study 4). The current work offers a novel
   approach to characterizing moral values and reveals a striking
   divergence between two kinds of moral values in particular: caring
   values and authority values. Caring values were positively linked with
   prosociality and negatively associated with Machiavellianism, whereas
   authority values were positively associated with Machiavellianism and
   Social Dominance Orientation.

AB Objectives: To provide an accurate estimate of antenatal HIV screening
   and its determinants among pregnant women in El Salvador and help local
   authorities make informed decisions for targeted interventions around
   mother-to-child transmission (MTCT).
   Methods: A total sample of 4,730 women aged 15-49 years were interviewed
   from a random sample of 3,625 households. We collected data on antenatal
   care services, including HIV screening, during last pregnancy through a
   pre-established questionnaire. We used a backward elimination
   multivariate logistic regression model to examine the association
   between HIV screening and sociodemographic and health care-related
   factors.
   Results: A total of 2,929 women were included in this analysis. About
   98% of participants reported receiving antenatal care, but only 83% of
   these reported being screened for HIV. Screening was lower in geographic
   areas with higher HIV incidence and ranged from 69.1% among women who
   were not seen by a physician during antenatal care, to 93.7% among those
   who attended or completed college. Odds for screening varied also by
   age, employment status, household economic expenditure, possession of
   health care coverage, health care settings, and number of antenatal care
   visits.
   Conclusions: We found disparities in HIV screening during antenatal care
   at the environmental, social, demographic, and structural levels despite
   a high uptake of antenatal care in El Salvador. Our findings should urge
   health authorities to tailor and enhance current strategies implemented
   to eliminate MTCT and reduce inequities and HIV morbidity among women in
   El Salvador.

   strategies that minimize the risk of retaliation and reduce the strength
   of other girls. Girls' competitive strategies include avoiding direct
   interference with another girl's goals, disguising competition,
   competing overtly only from a position of high status in the community,

AB The Institute of Medicine has stated that greater diversity within
   health care professionals leads to improved patient outcomes. Therefore,
   greater diversity within academia and student bodies is required to
   create future diverse health care professionals. Cultural sensitivity is
   required from recruitment to physical environment for administrators,
   faculty, staff, and students. University, college, and department
   recruitment, search committees, hiring practices, and admissions
   policies and procedures need to be assessed to determine whether they
   reflect the applicant pool and patient populations in their regions and
   whether they are culturally sensitive to a wide variety of cultures. The
   mission, vision, policies, procedures, curriculums, and environments
   should also be created or reviewed, modified, and/or expanded to ensure
   that no administrator, faculty member, staff member, or student is
   discriminated against or disadvantaged because of cultural beliefs or
   practices. In addition to discussing the interplay between cultural
   sensitivity and academic policies, procedures, and environments, this
   article briefly discusses specific cultural issues related to religion,

AB Culture influences patients' beliefs and behaviors toward health and
   illness. As the U. S. population becomes more diverse, a critical need
   exists for pharmacy education to incorporate patient-centered culturally
   sensitive health care knowledge and skills into the curriculum. Nursing
   was the first profession to incorporate this type of learning and
   training into its curriculums, followed by medicine. Pharmacy has also
   made great progress to revise curriculums, but inconsistency exists in
   depth, breadth, and methods across pharmacy colleges. This article
   addresses important aspects of pharmacy education such as curriculum
   development, incorporation of educational innovations and techniques
   into the teaching of patient-centered culturally sensitive health care
   across the curriculum from didactic to experiential learning, assessment
   tools, and global education. A preliminary model curriculum with
   objectives and examples of teaching methods is proposed. Future
   directions in pharmacy education, teaching and learning scholarship,
   postgraduate education, licensure, and continuing education are also
   presented.

AB In a joint program, Innolytics and the U. S. Department of
   Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service National Wildlife
   Research Center collaborated in the development of nicarbazin as an
   avian contraceptive, initially for resident Canada geese and
   subsequently for feral pigeons. Unfortunately, the introduction of the
   original goose product in 2005 was a commercial failure. Political and
   social barriers effectively thwarted attempts to establish the new
   technology with any meaningful market success. Although the market
   adoption of the pigeon contraceptive has been less difficult, the
   product still encounters significant social and political obstacles and
   opposition. Given the focus on instant results and gratification, the
   introduction of contraceptive technology for birds has been challenging
   and broad market acceptance remains elusive. Nevertheless, especially
   for short-lived and rapidly reproducing species, customers continue to
   replace outdated or ineffective techniques with the safer and more
   effective contraceptive tool.

AB AimTo investigate early medical and family factors associated with later
   feeding risk in preterm infants.
   MethodsFor this longitudinal study, 136 infants born 30weeks gestation
   were enrolled. Medical and social background factors were assessed at
   term equivalent age. Infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging,
   neurobehavioral evaluation and feeding assessment. Parent involvement in
   the neonatal intensive care unit was tracked, and maternal mental health
   was assessed at neonatal intensive care unit discharge. At age 2years,
   feeding outcome was assessed using the Eating Subscale of the
   Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (n=80). Associations between
   feeding problems at age 2 years and (i) early medical factors, (ii)
   neurobehavioral functioning and feeding at term equivalent age, (iii)
   cerebral structure and (iv) maternal mental health were investigated
   using regression.
   ResultsEighteen (23%) children had feeding problems at age 2years.
   Feeding problems were associated with early hypotonia (p=0.03; =0.29)
   and lower socio-economic status (p=0.046; =-0.22). No associations were
   observed between early medical factors, early feeding performance,
   cerebral structure alterations or maternal well-being and feeding
   outcome.
   ConclusionEarly hypotonia may disrupt the development of oral-motor
   skills. Hypotonia and poor feeding also may share a common aetiology.
   Associations with lower socio-economic status highlight the potential
   influence of family background factors in feeding problems in the
   preterm infant.

AB One of the most pressing challenges facing environmental philosophers is
   how to address social and economic inequality while pursuing ecological
   sustainability. Bioregionalism is a view that is theoretically and
   practically well-equipped to grapple with the ecological, sociocultural,
   and economic complexity of the ecological crisis. However, its virtue
   ethics-oriented communitarianism as well as its spatial understanding of
   the just human polity render it unable to adequately address the
   on-the-ground reality of environmental degradation and political
   injustice as they occur in urban regions. Indeed, legacies of
   environmental racism and present patterns of social exclusion and
   economic inequality give good reason to designate multibioregional urban
   areas as the principal polity. Iris Young's conception of justice as the
   "being together of strangers" critically yet sympathetically helps
   bioregionalism address these problems and that of the proper scale of
   the polity. The New York City region is a case study.

AB Poverty is a critical social determinant of health. A particular
   approach toward mitigating inequitable access to health services in
   Kenya has been through a community-based distribution program
   implemented by the Safe Water and AIDS Project (SWAP) that has achieved
   modest uptake of public health interventions. To explore reasons for
   modest uptake, we asked program participants about child health
   problems, daily tasks, household expenditures, and services needed by
   their communities. Respondents identified child health problems
   consistent with health data and reported daily tasks, expenses, and
   needed services that were more related to basic needs of life other than
   health. These findings highlight the challenges of implementing
   potentially self-sustaining preventive interventions at scale in poor
   populations in the developing world.

AB American Indians (AIs) have some of the poorest documented health
   outcomes of any racial/ethnic group. Research plays a vital role in
   addressing these health disparities.
   Historical and recent instances of unethical research, specifically the
   Havasupai diabetes project, have generated mistrust in AI communities.
   To address the concerns about unethical research held by some AIs in the
   Heartland (Midwest), the Center for American Indian Community Health
   (CAICH) has launched a series of efforts to inform AIs about research
   participants' rights.
   CAICH educates health researchers about the importance of learning and
   respecting a community's history, culture, values, and wishes when
   engaging in research with that community. Through community-based
   participatory research, CAICH is also empowering AIs to assert their
   rights as research participants.

AB Deaf American Sign Language (ASL) users represent a small population at
   risk for marginalization from research and surveillance activities
   resulting from cultural, language, and ethical challenges. The Deaf
   community's view of deafness as a cultural identity, rather than a
   disability, contradicts the medical community's perception of deafness
   as a disease or deficiency in need of correction or elimination.
   These differences continue to have significant cultural and social
   implications within the Deaf community, resulting in mistrust of
   research opportunities. Two particularly contentious ethical topics for
   the Deaf community are the absence of community representation in
   genetic research and the lack of accessible informed consents and
   research materials.
   This article outlines a series of innovative strategies and solutions to
   these issues, including the importance of community representation and
   collaboration with researchers studying deaf populations.

AB Community health centers (CHCs) provide optimal research settings. They
   serve a high-risk, medically underserved population in the greatest need
   of intervention. Low socioeconomic status renders this population
   particularly vulnerable to research misconduct.
   Traditional principles of research ethics are often applied to
   participants only. The social-ecological model offers a comprehensive
   framework for applying these principles across multiple levels
   (participants, providers, organizations, communities, and policy).
   Our experience with the Trial Using Motivational Interviewing, Positive
   Affect and Self-Affirmation in African-Americans with Hypertension, a
   randomized trial conducted in CHCs, led us to propose a new platform for
   discussing research ethics; examine the social, community, and political
   factors surrounding research conducted in CHCs; and recommend how future
   research should be conducted in such settings.

   (LNHL), a peer-mentoring and networking program that introduced American
   Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) undergraduates to health and research
   careers and concepts of community-based participatory research (CBPR).
   Methods. We conducted 15 interviews and 1 focus group with students who
   had attended 1 or more LNHL meetings, which took place during 9
   professional health research conferences in 2006 to 2009. We completed
   data collection in 2010, within 1 to 4 years of LNHL participant
   engagement in program activities.
   Results. Participants described identity and cultural challenges they
   encountered in academic institutions and how their views shifted from
   perceiving research as an enterprise conducted by community outsiders
   who were not to be trusted toward an understanding of CBPR as
   contributing to AI/AN health.
   Conclusions. LNHL provided a safe environment for AI/AN students to
   openly explore their place in the health and research arenas. Programs
   such as LNHL support AI/AN student development as leaders in building
   trust for academic-tribal partnerships.

AB Objectives. We assessed the effectiveness of P4 for Women, a faith-based
   HIV intervention.
   Methods. We used a 2-arm comparative effectiveness trial involving 134
   African American women aged 18 to 34 years to compare the effectiveness
   of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-defined evidence-based
   Sisters Informing Sisters about Topics on AIDS (SISTA) HIV intervention
   with P4 for Women, an adapted faith-based version of SISTA. Participants
   were recruited from a large black church in Atlanta, Georgia, and
   completed assessments at baseline and follow-up.
   Results. Both SISTA and P4 for Women had statistically significant
   effects on this study's primary outcome-consistent condom use in the
   past 90 days-as well as other sexual behaviors. However, P4 for Women
   also had statistically significant effects on the number of weeks women
   were abstinent, on all psychosocial mediators, and most noteworthy, on
   all measures of religious social capital. Results were achieved by
   enhancing structural social capital through ministry participation,
   religious values and norms, linking trust and by reducing negative
   religious coping. High intervention attendance may indicate the
   feasibility of conducting faith-based HIV prevention research for
   African American women.
   Conclusions. P4 for Women enhanced abstinence and safer sex practices as
   well as religious social capital, and was more acceptable than SISTA.
   Such efforts may assist faith leaders in responding to the HIV epidemic
   in African American women.

AB Objectives. We explored associations between the abolition of Jim Crow
   laws (i.e., state laws legalizing racial discrimination overturned by
   the 1964 US Civil Rights Act) and birth cohort trends in infant death
   rates.
   Methods. We analyzed 1959 to 2006 US Black and White infant death rates
   within and across sets of states (polities) with and without Jim Crow
   laws.
   Results. Between 1965 and 1969, a unique convergence of Black infant
   death rates occurred across polities; in 1960 to 1964, the Black infant
   death rate was 1.19 times higher (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18,
   1.20) in the Jim Crow polity than in the non-Jim Crow polity, whereas in
   1970 to 1974 the rate ratio shrank to and remained at approximately 1
   (with the 95% CI including 1) until 2000, when it rose to 1.10 (95% CI =
   1.08, 1.12). No such convergence occurred for Black-White differences in
   infant death rates or for White infants.
   Conclusions. Our results suggest that abolition of Jim Crow laws
   affected US Black infant death rates and that valid analysis of societal
   determinants of health requires appropriate comparison groups.

   Methods. We obtained Campylobacter case data (2002-2010; n = 3694) from

   community-level socioeconomic and environmental data from the 2000 US
   Census and the 2007 US Census of Agriculture. We linked data by zip
   code. We derived incidence rate ratios by Poisson regressions. We mapped
   a subset of zip code-level characteristics.
   Results. In zip codes that were 100% rural, incidence rate ratios (IRRs)
   of campylobacteriosis were 6 times (IRR = 6.18; 95% confidence interval
   [CI] = 3.19, 11.97) greater than those in urban zip codes. In zip codes
   with broiler chicken operations, incidence rates were 1.45 times greater
   than those in zip codes without broilers (IRR = 1.45; 95% CI = 1.34,
   1.58). We also observed higher rates in zip codes whose populations were
   predominantly White and had high median incomes.
   Conclusions. The community and environment in which one lives may
   significantly influence the risk of campylobacteriosis.

AB Objectives. We sought to understand interpersonal and systems-level
   factors relevant to delivering health care to emergency department (ED)
   patients who are homeless.
   Methods. We conducted semistructured interviews with emergency medicine
   residents from 2 residency programs, 1 in New York City and 1 in a
   medium-sized northeastern city, from February to September 2012. A team
   of researchers reviewed transcripts independently and coded text
   segments using a grounded theory approach. They reconciled differences
   in code interpretations and generated themes inductively. Data
   collection and analysis occurred iteratively, and interviews continued
   until theoretical saturation was achieved.
   Results. From 23 interviews, 3 key themes emerged: (1) use of pattern
   recognition in identifying and treating patients who are homeless, (2)
   variations from standard ED care for patients who are homeless, and (3)
   tensions in navigating the boundaries of ED social care.
   Conclusions. Our study revealed practical and philosophical tensions in
   providing social care to patients in the ED who are homeless. Screening
   for homelessness in the ED and admission practices for patients who are
   homeless are important areas for future research and intervention with
   implications for health care costs and patient outcomes.

AB Objectives. In this population-based cohort study, we assessed baseline
   risk factors for homelessness, including the role of service in the Iraq
   or Afghanistan conflicts, among a large cohort of recent veterans.
   Methods. Data for this study came from administrative records for 310
   685 veterans who separated from active military duty from July 1, 2005,
   to September 30, 2006. We used survival analysis methods to determine
   incidence rates and risk factors for homelessness, based on baseline
   data for military factors, demographic characteristics, and diagnoses of
   behavioral health disorders and traumatic brain injury.
   Results. Service in Iraq or Afghanistan and, more specifically,
   posttraumatic stress disorder among veterans deployed there, were
   significant risk factors of modest magnitude for homelessness, and
   socioeconomic and behavioral health factors provided stronger indicators
   of risk. Gender was not a significant indicator of differential risk.
   Conclusions. Although service in Iraq and Afghanistan was significant,
   socioeconomic and behavioral health indicators show more promise in
   efforts to use administrative data to inform prevention efforts by
   identifying veterans who are at elevated risk for becoming homeless upon
   their return to civilian life.

   no place of one's own since wave 1.
   Results. Alcohol-use disorders (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.34),

   increased prospective risk for first-time homelessness, after adjustment
   for ecological variables. Substance-use disorders and poverty interacted
   to differentially influence risk for first-time homelessness (P < .05),
   before, but not after, adjustment for controls.
   Conclusions. This study reinforces the importance of both substance-use
   disorders and poverty in the risk for first-time homelessness, and can
   serve as a benchmark for future studies. Substance abuse treatment
   should address financial status and risk of future homelessness.

AB The 145th symposium of the Wenner-Gren Foundation took place June 1--8,
   2012, in Haaringe Slott near Stockholm, Sweden. The primary goal of the
   symposium was to reframe discussions of behavioral evolution among
   Neanderthals and early modern humans. We hoped to replace conventions of
   a single scale of evolutionary progress (in which the primary benchmark
   is modern human behavior) with a more Darwinian framework that could
   allow for independent evolutionary trajectories in different areas. The
   15 participants included archaeologists researching material culture and
   subsistence in Eurasia, Africa, and China; physical anthropologists; a
   demographer; a geneticist; modelers of cultural evolution; and a
   climatologist. Participants were asked to draw on evidence in their
   areas of expertise, focusing on evolutionary trends in both modal
   tendencies and levels of variation/diversity within various regions
   during the interval in which the Middle Stone Age and Middle Paleolithic
   developed, spread, and eventually disappeared. It was agreed that there
   is compelling evidence for very different trajectories of cultural
   evolution in different parts of the world but that we are not yet in a
   position to fully evaluate and understand the outcomes of the parallel
   cultural evolutionary pathways among modern Homo sapiens in Africa and
   Neanderthals in Europe. Answering questions this large in scope requires
   synthesis on a large geographic scale comparable to studies by climate
   scientists and biogeographers. Conventional approaches to collecting,
   reporting, and analyzing archaeological and skeletal data do not lend
   themselves to rigorous tests of alternative evolutionary models. At the
   same time, the intellectual tools needed to research these questions are
   well developed, and answers are within reach.

AB In this paper I aim to define basic characteristics of the Eurasian
   Middle Paleolithic (MP) and trace their development. I first outline
   some generalized features of MP material culture and behavior. A key
   characteristic of the MP is diversity in lithic technology, manifest at
   various temporal and spatial scales. Looking more closely, this
   diversity is composed of repeated recurrences of a restricted range of
   alternatives. Many of the varieties of lithic production common in the
   MP first appeared during the early MP and some even earlier. Other
   typical behaviors include frequent use of fire, ochre, and hafting.
   These are first seen in Eurasia during the later MP (marine isotope
   stage [MIS] 6 and 7), the period when the entire suite of MP behaviors
   seems to coalesce. Many shared patterns of MP behavior reflect a set of
   adaptations shaped by Eurasian habitats and climates. Other aspects of
   spatial and temporal variation are more likely to reflect demographic
   conditions or patterns of cultural transmission among and within groups.

AB Purpose: Previous studies suggest that African Americans (AA) have lower
   levels of cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) than their Caucasian (C)
   counterparts. However, the association between CRF and race/ethnicity in
   the context of higher socioeconomic status (SES) has not been explored.
   Methods: We evaluated 589 AA (309 men and 203 women) and 33,015 C
   (19,399 men and 8753 women) enrolled in the Cooper Center Longitudinal
   Study. Education years and access to a preventive health care
   examination were used as a proxy for higher SES. Data were collected
   from a questionnaire, maximal treadmill exercise stress test, and other
   clinical measures. The outcome variable was CRF, which was stratified
   into low fit (quintile 1 of CRF) and fit (quintiles 2-5). Multivariable
   regression was used to compare adjusted mean CRF between groups. P
   values were adjusted for unbalanced sample size and unequal variance
   between groups. Results: The mean education years were similar for AA
   and C men at 16 yr; however, AA women had more years of education than C
   (15.8 vs 15.2 yr, P = 0.0062). AA men and women had a significantly
   higher prevalence of being unfit compared with their C counterparts (men
   26.7% vs 12.6%, P < 0.0001; women 21.3% vs 8.4%, P < 0.0001). The
   adjusted mean estimated maximal METs were 10.9 vs 11.7 and 8.8 vs 9.8
   for AA and C men and women, respectively. Fully adjusted odds ratios
   revealed that AA men had more than twice the risk of being unfit
   compared with C men. A trend persisted for AA women to have a lower MET
   value than their counterparts. Conclusions: Despite comparable higher
   SES, lower CRF existed among AA men versus C men. These results suggest
   that CRF may not be mediated strictly by environmental factors related
   to SES.

AB Reference points are an approach to defining the thresholds of
   sustainable human use of environmental resources. The rationale for
   reference points can be found in a number of foundational environmental
   frameworks, including common property resources, carrying capacity,
   ecosystem management, and sustainability. However, these frameworks also
   suggest that reference points have both ecological and social
   components, and that formulation of reference points should be informed
   by society. Social norms, developed in sociology, offer a theoretical
   and empirical approach to informing reference points and have been
   useful in defining, measuring and managing the sustainability of parks
   and protected areas. Integrating sociology and ecology through the
   application of social norms to reference points may be a useful approach
   to environmental management. This paper describes social norms and their
   application, and illustrates the integration of sociology and ecology to
   more fully inform reference points.

AB Background: Effective screening and prevention strategies for bladder
   cancer require accurate risk stratification models. We developed models
   to predict the risk of bladder cancer based on clinical and
   sociodemographic data on participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal,
   and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) screening trial.
   Methods: Baseline clinical and sociodemographic data were obtained from
   149,542 PLCO participants, ages 55 to 74 years, without a prior history
   of bladder cancer. Cox proportional hazards models were used to predict
   the risk of all bladder cancers (ABC) and of high-grade bladder cancers
   (HGBC) from baseline information. We used the HGBC risk model to design
   a hypothetical bladder cancer mortality prevention trial.
   Results: Over a median follow-up of 12 years, 1,124 men and 259 women
   developed bladder cancer (including 392 and 72 with HGBC, respectively).
   The incidence in men and in women was 133.6 and 29.6 cases per 100,000
   person-years, respectively. Nomograms constructed for predicting the
   risk of ABC and HGBC had c-indices of 0.746 and 0.759, respectively.
   Age, race, education, smoking (intensity and duration), comorbidity,
   prostatitis, syphilis, and hormone replacement therapy use were
   statistically significant predictors in the models. We show that our
   risk model can be used to design a bladder cancer mortality prevention
   trial half the size of a trial designed without risk stratification.
   Conclusion: Models to predict the risk of ABC and HGBC have been
   developed and validated.
   Impact: Using the upper 40th percentile from the HGBC model, a suitable
   cohort for a screening or chemoprevention trial could be identified,
   although the size and follow-up of such a trial would be costly. (C)2013

AB According to alcohol expectancy theory, drinking-related information is
   stored in memory and, when cue activated, influences alcohol-related
   behavior. Priming of alcohol cues and expectancies has been shown to
   elicit both drinking and nonconsumptive behavior associated with alcohol
   consumption, such as willingness to meet with a stranger and aggression.
   These social influence effects have been shown to be moderated by
   individual differences in alcohol expectancies. In the present study, we
   tested whether an alcohol prime would facilitate social group bonding
   even in the absence of consumption, and whether such group bonding would
   be moderated by individually held social expectancies. One hundred
   twenty undergraduates (75% female) completed an alcohol expectancy
   measure prior to participation. Participants were primed with either
   alcohol or neutral beverage words and completed a collaborative group
   activity followed by questionnaires measuring perceived group cohesion.
   Several interactions were found between condition and expectancy
   reflecting that those in the alcohol prime condition with higher social
   alcohol expectancies reported greater cohesion on task-related, but not
   emotion-related, group measures. These findings underscore the
   complexity of the impact of expectancy and social behavior on drinking:
   the priming of alcohol expectancies may activate aspects of pro-social
   behavior, which may influence drinking, which in turn may feedback to
   positively reinforce social expectancies.

   show that Marx's concept of capital was not economistic. Second, I trace
   Bourdieu's changing understanding of capital, showing how it became less
   compatible with Marx's over time. Third, I point out ambiguities in
   Bourdieu's concept of capital that, despite gestures toward a Marxist
   understanding of capital, further distance him from Marx. Fourth, I
   argue that Bourdieu tends to take the economic field and economic
   capital for granted, unlike Marx. I conclude that if different forms of
   capital are but extended forms of economic capital, the notion of
   economic capital that they extend is not a Marxist one.

   ties, has reemerged in urban sociology, yet the urban literature on
   place and the organizations literatures on organizational network
   activity are not fully integrated. This article bridges these theories
   through an investigation of the social and spatial underpinnings of
   interorganizational network ties. Quantitative analysis of data from 152
   interviews with nonprofit organizations serving youth across 12
   contiguous neighborhoods in Boston reveals a propensity for
   organizations to share resources within the local neighborhood,
   controlling for proximity to other organizations, organizational
   characteristics, and various network properties. Qualitative data
   suggest a multilevel social process underlying the parochial network
   structure, illustrating the context for collaboration, restrictions on
   extra-local exchange, and incentives guiding a local focus. Based on
   this evidence, I propose a theory of organizational parochialism,
   extending research on organizations, networks, and urban social
   processes.

AB OBJECTIVES: To test the association of life events in childhood with
   overweight risk in adolescence; to examine the effects of chronicity,
   timing, intensity, valence, and type of life events; and to test
   potential moderators.
   METHODS: Mothers of children enrolled in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver
   National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early
   Child Care and Youth Development responded to the Life Experiences
   Survey at ages 4, 9, and 11 years. Using logistic regression analysis,
   we tested the association of experiencing many negative life events with
   being overweight at age 15 years, controlling for child gender,
   race/ethnicity, maternal education, and maternal obesity. Child gender,
   maternal education, maternal obesity, child's ability to delay
   gratification for food, and maternal sensitivity were tested as
   moderators.
   RESULTS: Among the 848 study children (82% non-Hispanic white),
   experiencing many negative life events was associated with a higher risk
   of overweight (odds ratio: 1.47 [95% confidence interval: 1.04-2.10]).
   Greater chronicity and negative valence of the event were associated
   with greater overweight risk; timing of exposure and maternal reported
   impact of the event were not. The association was more robust for events
   related to family physical or mental health and among children of obese
   mothers and children who waited longer for food.
   CONCLUSIONS: Children who experience many negative life events are at
   higher risk of being overweight by age 15 years. Future work should
   investigate mechanisms involved in this association, particularly those
   connected to appetitive drive and self-regulation; these mechanisms may
   hold promise for obesity prevention strategies.

   with hunters from the coastal community of Wainwright, Alaska, to
   document their observations of environmental change (e.g., sea ice,
   wind, temperature) and the implications of those changes for
   opportunities to hunt bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) during spring
   and caribou (Rangifer tarandus) during summer. We integrated hunter
   observations on wind with statistical analysis of daily wind speed data
   collected in the nearby community of Barrow, Alaska, between 1971 and
   2010 to characterize changes in the number of days with suitable hunting
   conditions. Hunters in Wainwright currently observe fewer days than in
   previous decades with wind conditions suitable for safely hunting
   bowhead whales and caribou. The statistical analysis of wind speed data
   supported these conclusions and suggested that the annual windows of
   opportunity for hunting each species have decreased by up to seven days
   since 1971. This study demonstrates the potential power of collaboration
   between local communities and researchers to characterize the societal
   impacts of climate change. Continued collaborative research with
   residents of rural northern Alaskan communities could produce knowledge
   and develop tools to help rural Alaskans adapt to novel
   social-ecological conditions.

AB In the 1960s, general practitioners organized themselves into a
   state-based nationwide political movement that lobbied state legislators
   and state-funded medical schools to create departments of family
   practice. They framed their calls in the context of the national
   shortages of primary care physicians by arguing that those medical
   schools that received state funding had an obligation to the state to
   train sufficient numbers of primary care physicians to ensure the health
   care needs of the state's residents would be met. As this article
   reveals, two defining features of this activism were rural politics and
   the politics of town and gown. The history of family practice thus
   introduces a new dimension to the familiar dyad of town and gown
   relations: the plow-rural physicians who brought to the medical politics
   of the post-World War II United States a distinctive and powerful set of
   political, social, and economic interests.

   sustainability, an examination is presented into the complexity of one
   particular aspect of intra-generational equity, racial and class
   discrimination and its role in distorting urban form and in generating
   resource inefficient and environmentally destructive human activity
   patterns. The article, therefore, focuses on the role of discrimination
   itself in encouraging ecological degradation. The Detroit region shows
   that racial and class conflicts can facilitate the shaping of the urban
   built environment as one population sub-group, largely white and
   upper-income, attempts to distance itself from another sub-group that is
   largely black, lower income, and considered a threat. The outcome is not
   only disinvestment and decline in the urban core, but also excessive
   suburbanization, as whites seek homogenous urban environments and use
   space to increase the distance between themselves and the black
   population. The study shows that the lack of cooperation and tolerance
   across ethnic/racial and class subgroups facilitates inefficient
   low-density and scattered developments, and excessive degradation of
   natural ecological systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The objective of this study was to assess environmental impact, economic
   viability, and social acceptability of 3 beef production systems with
   differing levels of efficiency. A deterministic model of U.S. beef
   production was used to predict the number of animals required to produce
   1 x 10(9) kg HCW beef. Three production treatments were compared, 1
   representing average U.S. production (control), 1 with a 15% increase in
   ADG, and 1 with a 15% increase in finishing weight (FW). For each
   treatment, various socioeconomic scenarios were compared to account for
   uncertainty in producer and consumer behavior. Environmental impact
   metrics included feed consumption, land use, water use, greenhouse gas
   emissions (GHGe), and N and P excretion. Feed cost, animal purchase
   cost, animal sales revenue, and income over costs (IOVC) were used as
   metrics of economic viability. Willingness to pay (WTP) was used to
   identify improvements or reductions in social acceptability. When ADG
   improved, feedstuff consumption, land use, and water use decreased by
   6.4%, 3.2%, and 12.3%, respectively, compared with the control. Carbon
   footprint decreased 11.7% and N and P excretion were reduced by 4% and
   13.8%, respectively. When FW improved, decreases were seen in feedstuff
   consumption (12.1%), water use (9.2%). and land use (15.5%); total GHGe
   decreased 14.7%; and N and P excretion decreased by 10.1% and 17.2%,
   compared with the control. Changes in IOVC were dependent on
   socioeconomic scenario. When the ADG scenario was compared with the
   control, changes in sector profitability ranged from 51 to 117%
   (cowcalf), -38 to 157% (stocker), and 37 to 134% (feedlot). When
   improved FW was compared, changes in cowcalf profit ranged from 67% to
   143%, stocker profit ranged from -41% to 155% and feedlot profit ranged
   from 37% to 136%. When WTP was based on marketing beef being more
   efficiently produced, WTP improved by 10%; thus, social acceptability
   increased. When marketing was based on production efficiency and
   consumer knowledge of growth-enhancing technology use, WTP decreased by
   12%-leading to a decrease in social acceptability. Results demonstrated
   that improved efficiency also improved environmental impact, but impacts
   on economic viability and social acceptability are highly dependent on
   consumer and producer behavioral responses to efficiency improvements.

AB OBJECTIVES: Health-care disparities exist for patients of minority race
   and low socioeconomic status (SES) in many chronic disease states, but
   little is known regarding health-care disparities for patients with
   inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using nationally representative data,
   we sought to determine whether use of immunomodulators and anti-tumor
   necrosis factor (TNF) agents differed by race/ethnicity and SES among
   ambulatory patients with IBD.
   METHODS: We used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
   and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1998 to
   2010. We identified visits associated with IBD and the medications
   associated with those visits. Race /ethnicity and SES were
   characterized. The frequency of immunomodulator and anti-TNF use over
   time was assessed. We performed analyses accounting for the survey's
   complex multistage probability sampling design. Associations between
   race/ethnicity, SES and IBD medication use were identified.
   RESULTS: A total of 26,400,000 visits for patients with IBD occurred in
   the United States 13-yearfrom 1998 to 2010. Seventy-six per cent of
   visits were for whites, 9 % were for blacks, 7 % were for Hispanics, and
   2 % were for Asians. Sixty-one per cent of visits were privately
   insured, whereas 7 % had Medicaid coverage. From 1998 to 2010, the
   proportion of visits associated with immunomodulators increased from 6
   to 13 %, whereas the proportion associated with anti-TNF agents
   increased from <1 to 14 %. In adjusted analyses, visits with Medicaid
   were three times more likely to be associated with immunomodulators than
   visits with private insurance, but there were no race/ethnicity-based
   differences in immunomodulator use. There were no race/ethnicity- or
   SES-based differences in anti-TNF therapy.
   CONCLUSIONS: Using nationally representative data over a 13-year time
   period, we found no evidence of disparities in medical therapy for IBD
   among visits with minority race /ethnicity or low SES.

AB Beginning with the premise that sovereignty may be most constructively
   contemplated not as a definable object or objective but instead as a
   process, this article examines counter-mapping as a way for contemporary
   indigenous citizens to "do" sovereignty. It surveys three
   Anishinaabe/Ojibwe communities' recent use of geographical techniques to
   communicate their own territorial claims and counter the competing
   claims of others. In a 21(st) century context characterized by urgent
   extractive-industrial threats to indigenous landbases and lifeways, the
   cases presented here demonstrate that counter-mapping can serve as a
   powerful positive tool. Yet because the prevailing methods available to
   safeguard land-based self-determination also have the potential to
   undermine it, I conclude by considering some of the pitfalls that
   complicate counter-mapping's ability to promote the sovereignty process.
   I suggest that indigenous people who choose to enact their sovereignty
   in this manner are indeed empowered, but only within an existing-and
   inequitable-socio-political system.

AB Amenity transition, a major socio demographic trend in areas rich in
   natural resources, is characterized by economic and population growth as
   a result of retirement in-migration, increased rates of second home
   ownership, and increases in the number of industries that do not need to
   be proximate to a specific geographic location. Amenity transition is
   also characterized by increased intra-community conflict between
   long-term residents and in-migrants. This research analyzes whether the
   population growth accompanying amenity transition is associated with
   variations in the structure and characteristics of intra-community
   informational networks, as sociological theory would suggest.
   Methodologically, this is accomplished through a comparative analysis of
   the structure and characteristics of informational networks in three
   communities undergoing amenity transition. The analyses suggest
   population density is not related to either the structure of
   informational networks or the concentration of trust/distrust within
   them. When considered in conjunction with previous empirical work, these
   findings suggest the conflicts associated with amenity transition are
   more likely to arise because of conflicting value systems and ideologies
   as opposed to social structural changes in the communities themselves.

   living (IADLs), and cognition assessed according to Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE) scores of older African-American and non-Hispanic
   white community-dwelling men and women.
   DesignCross-sectional study assessing associations between self-reported
   ADL and IADL difficulty and MMSE scores for race- and sex-specific
   groups.
   SettingHomes of community-dwelling older adults.
   ParticipantsA random sample of 974 African-American and non-Hispanic
   white Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older living in west-central
   Alabama and participating in the University of Alabama at Birmingham
   Study of Aging, excluding those with reported diagnoses of dementia or
   with missing data.
   MeasurementsFunction, based on self-reported difficulty in performing
   ADLs and IADLs, and cognition, using the MMSE. Multivariable linear
   regression models were used to test the association between function and
   cognition in race- and sex-specific groups after adjusting for
   covariates.
   ResultsMini-Mental State Examination scores were modestly correlated
   with ADL and IADL difficulty in all four race- and sex-specific groups,
   with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from -0.189 for
   non-Hispanic white women to -0.429 for African-American men.
   Correlations between MMSE and ADL or IADL difficulty in any of the race-
   and sex-specific groups were no longer significant after controlling for
   sociodemographic factors and comorbidities.
   ConclusionMini-Mental State Examination was not significantly associated
   with functional difficulty in older African-American and non-Hispanic
   white men and women after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and
   comorbidities, suggesting a mediating role in the relationship between
   cognition and function.

AB How did intellectuals' evolve from a class of subjects in Marxian
   thoughts to highly visible populations under communism? Such
   reifications of the intellectual' have deeply affected subjectivity,
   conflict and organization, but received little attention in the
   political sociology of communism. This essay draws on research on
   classifications and social boundaries to address the objective and
   subjective foundations of the reifications and their impact on communist
   rule. The intellectual is viewed as an identification formed and
   performed around multiple social axes (most notably family background,
   educational achievement, occupational history, institutional affiliation
   and revolutionary rank) that reflected broader patterns of communist
   political domination. I use the Chinese Communist movement to
   demonstrate that (1) interaction of political contests, ruling
   strategies and institutional developments turned a diversity of persons
   into intellectuals' who were allegedly imbued with reprehensible
   interests and habits linked to privileged economic classes; (2) constant
   competitions for power and organizational changes led to classificatory
   ambiguities and, in turn, allowed individuals some control over their
   identifications; and (3) the developments profoundly influenced
   identity, state and class formation. Focusing on the dynamics that
   produced a highly visible but fluid population of intellectuals' opens
   new pathways for comparative research on communism.

AB A value judgment says what is good or bad, and value-free social science
   simply means social science free of value judgments. Yet many
   sociologists regard value-free social science as undesirable or
   impossible and readily make value judgments in the name of sociology.
   Often they display confusion about such matters as the meaning of
   value-free social science, value judgments internal and external to
   social science, value judgments as a subject of social science, the
   relevance of objectivity for value-free social science, and the
   difference between the human significance of social science and
   value-free social science. But why so many sociologists are so
   value-involved - and generally so unscientific - is sociologically
   understandable: The closest and most distant subjects attract the least
   scientific ideas. And during the past century sociologists have become
   increasingly close to their human subject. The debate about value-free
   social science is also part of an epistemological counterrevolution of
   humanists (including many sociologists) against the more scientific
   social scientists who invaded and threatened to expropriate the human
   subject during the past century.

AB Background: Research explaining school effects on alcohol use is scare.
   This study examined the interactive effect between family support and
   school characteristics (size, poverty, and sector) on adolescents'
   alcohol use trajectories in Chicago.
   Methods: Longitudinal and multilevel data were from the Project of Human
   Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and the Common Core of Data
   (National Center for Educational Statistics). The sample consisted of
   2205 adolescents in 558 schools. A three-level hierarchical linear model
   was used to estimate multilevel growth curve models and school effects
   on alcohol trajectories.
   Results: In addition to the strong relationship between parental support
   and alcohol trajectories; the results also found school effects on the
   average baseline of alcohol use and the rates of change across time.
   Interestingly, high levels of parental support were more effective in
   preventing alcohol use in public schools, while adolescents attending
   private schools with low levels of parental support were more likely to
   consume alcohol. Similarly, students attending public schools with
   higher rates of poverty who enjoy higher levels of parental support were
   less likely to consume alcohol compared to students with lower parental
   support attending lower rates of schools poverty.
   Conclusion: Key findings highlight the importance of the interaction
   between parental support and school characteristics meaning that
   protective factors provided by parents could be reinforced or diminished
   by the school context. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Background: The racial/ethnic composition of the United States is
   shifting rapidly, with non-Hispanic Asian-Americans, Native
   Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders (NHs/PIs), and mixed-race individuals the
   fastest growing segments of the population. We determined new drug use
   estimates for these rising groups. Prevalences among Whites were
   included as a comparison.
   Methods: Data were from the 2005-2011 National Surveys on Drug Use and
   Health. Substance use among respondents aged >= 12 years was assessed by
   computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Respondents' self-reported
   race/ethnicity, age, gender, household income, government assistance,
   county type, residential stability, major depressive episode, history of
   being arrested, tobacco use, and alcohol use were examined as
   correlates. We stratified the analysis by race/ethnicity and used
   logistic regression to estimate odds of drug use.
   Results: Prevalence of past-year marijuana use among Whites increased
   from 10.7% in 2005 to 11.6-11.8% in 2009-2011 (P < 0.05). There were no
   significant yearly changes in drug use prevalences among
   Asian-Americans, NHs/PIs, and mixed-race people; but use of any drug,
   especially marijuana, was prevalent among NHs/PIs and mixed-race people
   (21.2% and 23.3%, respectively, in 2011). Compared with Asian-Americans,
   NHs/PIs had higher odds of marijuana use, and mixed-race individuals had
   higher odds of using marijuana, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants,
   sedatives, and tranquilizers. Compared with Whites, mixed-race
   individuals had greater odds of any drug use, mainly marijuana, and
   NHs/PIs resembled Whites in odds of any drug use.
   Conclusions: Findings reveal alarmingly prevalent drug use among NHs/PIs
   and mixed-race people. Research on drug use is needed in these rising
   populations to inform prevention and treatment efforts. (C) 2013

AB Objectives: This study conceptualized high unemployment rate as a
   stressor deriving from the social structure. It tracked American adults'
   heavy drinking rates 1997-2011, intending to examine (1) whether heavy
   drinking escalates with rising unemployment, and (2) whether racial
   minorities, who feel economic downturns more than the majority, engage
   in heavy drinking at a higher level than Whites in times of high
   unemployment.
   Methods: Research questions were answered using data from the Combined
   National Health Interview Survey. The present final sample included only
   respondents classified as heavy drinkers: those reporting that, on days
   (in the preceding year) on which they had consumed alcohol, they had
   regularly had at least 5 drinks.
   Results: The study, which considered individual-level social structural
   factors, overall found rising unemployment rate to be associated with
   high measures for heavy-drinking frequency but low measures for
   heavy-drinking quantity. It did not find race to moderate the
   unemployment-heavy-drinking relationship, although some empirical
   evidence has shown racial minorities to be relatively more responsive to
   fluctuating unemployment inherent in the economic cycle.
   Conclusions: Our results in general call for further research on roles
   of gender and race in heavy drinking, especially where Black females are
   concerned. Blacks' greater heavy-drinking frequency and greater
   heavy-drinking quantity (versus Whites) observed in this study may shed
   light on persistent racial disparities in Americans' health. (C) 2013

AB Individuals with lower social status have been reported to express more
   anger, but this evidence comes mostly from Western cultures. Here, we
   used representative samples of American and Japanese adults and tested
   the hypothesis that the association between social status and anger
   expression depends on whether anger serves primarily to vent
   frustration, as in the United States, or to display authority, as in
   Japan. Consistent with the assumption that lower social standing is
   associated with greater frustration stemming from life adversities and
   blocked goals, Americans with lower social status expressed more anger,
   with the relationship mediated by the extent of frustration. In
   contrast, consistent with the assumption that higher social standing
   affords a privilege to display anger, Japanese with higher social status
   expressed more anger, with the relationship mediated by decision-making
   authority. As expected, anger expression was predicted by subjective
   social status among Americans and by objective social status among
   Japanese. Implications for the dynamic construction of anger and anger
   expression are discussed.

AB Conservation strategies are increasingly driven by our understanding of
   the processes and patterns of gene flow across complex landscapes. The
   expansion of population genetic approaches into traditional agricultural
   systems requires understanding how social factors contribute to that
   landscape, and thus to gene flow. This study incorporates extensive
   farmer interviews and population genetic analysis of barley landraces
   (Hordeum vulgare) to build a holistic picture of farmer-mediated
   geneflow in an ancient, traditional agricultural system in the highlands
   of Ethiopia. We analyze barley samples at 14 microsatellite loci across
   sites at varying elevations and locations across a contiguous mountain
   range, and across farmer-identified barley types and management
   strategies. Genetic structure is analyzed using population-based and
   individual-based methods, including measures of population
   differentiation and genetic distance, multivariate Principal Coordinate
   Analysis, and Bayesian assignment tests. Phenotypic analysis links
   genetic patterns to traits identified by farmers. We find that
   differential farmer management strategies lead to markedly different
   patterns of population structure across elevation classes and barley
   types. The extent to which farmer seed management appears as a stronger
   determinant of spatial structure than the physical landscape highlights
   the need for incorporation of social, landscape, and genetic data for
   the design of conservation strategies in human-influenced landscapes.

AB Objective: Descending thoracic aortic diseases may be treated with
   either open thoracic aortic repair or thoracic endovascular aortic
   repair (TEVAR). Previous studies have demonstrated that race and
   socioeconomic status (SES) affect access to care and treatment
   allocation in vascular surgery. We hypothesized that racial minorities
   and lower SES patients have decreased propensity to have their thoracic
   aortic disease treated with TEVAR.
   Methods: Weighted discharge records for patients who underwent either
   open thoracic aortic repair or TEVAR between 2005 and 2008 were
   evaluated using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Patient records were
   stratified by therapeutic intervention (open repair vs TEVAR).
   Differences in baseline comorbidities, race, and SES were compared. To
   account for the effects of comorbidities and other factors, hierarchical
   logistic regression modeling was used to determine the likelihood for
   TEVAR performance based on differences in patients' race and SES.
   Results: A total of 60,784 thoracic repairs were analyzed, the majority
   (79.4%) of which were open repairs. The most common race was white
   (78.2%), followed by black (9.1%), Hispanic (5.7%), Asian or Pacific
   Islander (2.9%), and Native American (0.7%). Patients were divided into
   quartiles according to SES with 20.6% of patients in the lowest SES
   quartile, 24.3% in the second quartile, 26.4% in the third quartile, and
   28.8% in the highest SES quartile. Indications for treatment were
   similar for both treatment groups. After adjusting for multiple patient
   and hospital factors, race and SES were significantly associated with
   treatment modality for thoracic aortic disease. Black, Hispanic, and
   Native American populations had increased adjusted odds ratios of TEVAR
   performance compared with white patients. Similarly, lower SES
   correlated with increased use of TEVAR.
   Conclusions: Contrary to our initial hypothesis, racial minorities
   (Black, Hispanic, and Native American) and patients with lower median
   household incomes have a greater association with the performance for
   TEVAR after accounting for patient comorbid disease, indication for
   treatment, payer status, and hospital volume. These results indicate
   that traditional racial disparities do not persist in TEVAR allocation.

AB Decades of research has suggested that women are much more religious
   than men. Yet our survey of 107 women and 362 men who are alumni of the
   White House Fellows program finds that elite women are less likely than
   elite men to report religion as being important to their lives. When
   focusing on the fellows who are women, we find that obtaining a graduate
   degree from a top university, being highly committed to one's work, and
   being recognized for success are all associated with a lower likelihood
   of rating religion as important. We elucidate some of these findings
   with analyses of in-depth interviews. We suggest that aspiring women may
   not benefit from religion the same way men do and that religion often
   fails to provide similar levels of support for elite women as for elite
   men. We conclude by arguing for finer-grained measures of professional
   accomplishment and social standing to better understand gender
   differences in religion.

AB Conflicting study results with regards to racial/ethnic disparities in

   different sample populations, treatment data sources, and treatment
   eligibility definitions used. This study examined chemotherapy disparity
   in the context of changing treatment guidelines and explored factors
   that may help explain treatment differences observed. The data come from
   a population-based study that included interview and medical record data
   (including state cancer registry) from non-Hispanic (nH) White, nH
   Black, and Hispanic breast cancer patients diagnosed in 2005-2008.
   Logistic regression using model-based standardization was used to
   estimate age-adjusted risk differences and multivariate analysis was
   conducted to identify explanatory factors of the differences. Per the
   2005/2006 National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines,
   minority patients appeared more likely than nH White patients to receive
   a chemotherapy recommendation (0.87 vs 0.75, p = 0.003). When
   eligibility was determined per the 2007 guidelines, there was no
   disparity because under these guidelines, nH White patients were more
   likely than minority patients to have tumors that no longer required
   chemotherapy. There was evidence that chemotherapy advances for breast
   cancer patients are implemented in the clinical setting well ahead of
   NCCN guidelines. Finally, among eligible patients, chemotherapy
   recommendation was very high and virtually always accepted and received,
   with no disparities found at these points of clinical care. The findings
   suggest that an evaluation of guideline-adherent chemotherapy treatment
   patterns must carefully consider the definition of treatment
   eligibility, given ongoing changes in treatment guidelines and early
   uptake of new diagnostic tools and treatments.

AB Nearly one third of patients with epilepsy become medically intractable,
   and the likelihood of achieving seizure freedom decreases with each
   additional medication trial. For appropriately chosen patients, epilepsy
   surgery affords the opportunity to achieve seizure freedom and
   potentially wean off medications. Epilepsy surgery, as with medical
   management, is not without adverse effects; to counsel patients wisely,
   practitioners need to understand the advantages and disadvantages of
   both. Randomized controlled trials in temporal lobe epilepsy reveal that
   epilepsy surgery achieves superior outcome compared to continued medical
   management. Although seizure freedom is the ultimate goal of any
   therapy, it represents a single outcome measure among a variety of other
   domains that affect patient welfare. It is imperative that providers
   understand the patient variables that affect these outcome measures and
   how these measures impact each other. Because the data comparing
   surgical therapy versus medical management for refractory epilepsy are
   limited, we review the available evidence comparing outcomes beyond
   seizure freedom including quality of life, cognition, psychosocial
   function, mortality, and financial costs.

AB We describe stillbirth and unemployment rates by autonomous region in
   Spain and analyse whether women who gave birth in regions with high
   unemployment rates were more likely to have a stillborn. We designed a
   multilevel population-based observational study of births from 2007 to
   2010. We defined stillbirth as the outcome, individual maternal
   socioeconomic and pregnancy-related characteristics as covariates, and
   maternal autonomous region of residence as the contextual covariate. We
   used mixed-logistic regression models to account for differences across
   regions. In total, 1,920,235 singleton births and 5,560 stillbirths were
   included in the study. Women residing in autonomous regions with the
   highest rates of unemployment had a two-times-greater chance of
   delivering a stillborn (adjusted OR 2.60; 95 % CI 2.08-3.21). The region
   where women resided explained 14 % of the total individual differences
   in the risk of delivering a stillborn. The odds of stillbirth were 1.82
   (95 % CI 1.62-2.05) times higher for African-born women than for
   Spanish-born women and 1.90 (95 % CI 1.68-2.15) times higher for women
   with low educational attainment than for women with higher education. In
   conclusion, regional disparities in stillbirth rates in Spain in the
   period 2007-2010 were mainly associated with mothers who had low levels
   of education, were African-born, and lived in regions with higher
   unemployment.

   Similarly, Mexico has been presented as a noteworthy example of the

   points of departure to guide an investigation of the case of the
   restructuring of the Mexican poultry industry. Informed by a commodity
   systems analysis, archival data and key informant interviews are used to
   generate an overview of the history of the poultry industry in Mexico. A
   sociology of agrifood theoretical framework informed by regimes theory
   is employed to analyze the events of the case. We conclude that
   neoregulation related to the IMF and NAFTA restructuring in Mexico
   facilitated the diffusion of the US model of poultry production.

AB According to recent literature in the sociology of expectations,
   expectations about the future are "performative" in that they provide
   guidance for activities, attract attention, mobilize political and
   economic resources, coordinate between groups, link technical and social
   concerns, create visions, and enroll supporters. While this framework
   has blossomed over the past decade in science and technology studies, it
   has yet to be applied towards a more refined understanding of how the
   future of the modern agrofood system is being actively contested and
   understood. I seek to redress this gap by using the sociology of
   expectations to explain the discursive topography surrounding in vitro
   meat, a nascent agrofood technology whereby processed meat products are
   developed from stem cells as opposed to live animals. In discussing the
   obstacles and challenges which confront the proponents of this
   technology, I utilize three key concepts from the sociology of
   expectations: (1) hype, (2) retrospective prospects, and (3) the role of
   myth, metaphor, and ideology. I find that despite sluggish results and
   financial setbacks, the controversial legacy of previous agrofood
   technologies, and persistent cultural skepticism, the core ideological
   justifications for in vitro meat have proven to be resilient in buoying
   the technology through rough discursive waters.

AB Introduction or background: While social media interactions are

   outcomes are shared online, social media offers an increasingly clear
   picture of the dynamics of these processes.
   Sources of data: Social media is becoming an increasingly common
   platform among clinicians and public health officials to share
   information with the public, track or predict diseases.
   Areas of agreement: Social media can be used for engaging the public and
   communicating key public health interventions, while providing an
   important tool for public health surveillance.
   Areas of controversy: Social media has advantages over traditional
   public health surveillance, as well as limitations, such as poor
   specificity, that warrant additional study.
   Growing points: Social media can provide timely, relevant and
   transparent information of public health importance; such as tracking or
   predicting the spread or severity of influenza, west nile virus or
   meningitis as they propagate in the community, and, in identifying
   disease outbreaks or clusters of chronic illnesses.
   Areas timely for developing research: Further work is needed on social
   media as a valid data source for detecting or predicting diseases or
   conditions. Also, whether or not it is an effective tool for
   communicating key public health messages and engaging both, the general
   public and policy-makers.

AB Background: The few studies on post-Essure hysterosalpingogram (HSG)
   adherence rates show inconsistent results. This study examined
   associations between sociodemographic variables not examined in prior
   studies and HSG adherence among low-income women.
   Study Design: Medical records of 286 women who underwent sterilization
   between August 31, 2005, and September 30, 2011, were reviewed.
   chi-Square and Mann Whitney U tests were used to determine variable
   associations with HSG adherence.
   Results: The adherence rate for the first HSG was 85.0% (243/286).
   Variables associated with adherence were lower education level (p=.01),
   not working outside the home (p=.04), being married (p<.0001), lower
   gravidity (p=.03), fewer lifetime number of sexual partners (p<.0001),
   no sexually transmitted infection history (p<.01), Hispanic ethnicity
   (p<.0001), Spanish as a primary language (p<.0001) and living farther
   from the clinic (p<.01).
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that achieving high rates of
   adherence with the recommended HSG following Essure placement is
   feasible among low income populations. Furthermore, not speaking English
   or having to commute a far distance to the clinic do not appear to be
   barriers. This is encouraging considering the importance of this test to
   confirm tubal occlusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   which tracks permutations of specific land-use transitions over time. In
   a fixed-effects analysis, the area of cropland lost to the built
   environment is regressed on different measures of population and
   economic growth. Results indicate that natural increase and net
   migration differentially affect the loss of cropland at the local level
   across the continental United States, challenging the traditional focus
   in environmental sociology on overall population growth. This study also
   advances the concept of aristocratic conservation as a process by which

AB What does moderation mean in the twenty-first century? And what might a
   reasoned project of moderation look like, intellectually, politically
   and in practice? This paper argues for a sociological reappraisal of the
   historical origins, intellectual foundations and contemporary salience
   of moderation. Too often wrongly defined by a sense of what it is not -
   by its apparent absence of ideology - moderation has come, in recent
   years, to be associated with bland' and incoherent notions of centrism.
   However, moderation presents sociologists and other scholars with
   particular analytical and theoretical challenges and opportunities. In a
   post-secular liberal democracy like Britain, an exploration of what
   moderation might mean demands an interrogation of the often
   taken-for-granted assumptions of the social sciences and the ideological
   extremes more generally. Moderation is about the relations among publics
   and the possibilities of a deep pluralism that is respectful of
   difference. However, publics are under threat by markets and the future
   of sociology, tied to the future of publics, without revivified social
   and political practices of moderation, may be bleak.

AB The blogosphere is loathed and feared by the press, expert-opinion
   makers, and representatives of authority generally. Part of this is
   based on a social theory: that there are implicit and explicit social
   controls governing professional journalists and experts that make them
   responsible to the facts. These controls don't exist for bloggers or the
   people who comment on blogs. But blog commentary is good at performing a
   kind of sociology of knowledge that situates speakers and motives,
   especially in cases of complex professional and administrative
   decision-making, as well as providing specific factual material that
   qualifies claims of experts and authorities. In many contexts the
   commentaries are examples of Habermasian demands for justification, to
   which there is a response. A major topic in women's health, and on the
   blogs, is the effects of hysterectomy, especially accompanied by
   oophorectomy, the removal of (normally healthy) ovaries. Physicians make
   extreme claims on web pages about the lack of consequences, or their
   manageability through hormone therapy, which they claim is supported by
   research. Blog posters, and a blog opposed to hysterectomy generally,
   claim that there are numerous damaging effects, and deconstruct the
   claims of experts. Blog posters fill in the claims with personal
   experiences and analysis of the conduct of physicians and nurses, as
   well as the motives of women who deny symptoms. Physicians provide their
   own critique and analysis of the blogs, to which they attribute great
   influence. A later meta-analysis and new longitudinal research affirms
   the bloggers, and explains why much of the research cited by experts is
   wrong.

AB Despite preliminary evidence that individuals with higher social anxiety
   tend to avoid eye contact during at least some social encounters, the
   function of this behavior remains unknown. Cognitive theories of social
   anxiety suggest that gaze avoidance may function as an attempt to avoid
   signs of social threat. However, it is unclear whether this behavior is
   effective for reducing anxiety and, if it is effective, whether this
   benefit is only present in the short-term. The goal of the current study
   was to test whether gaze avoidance is effective in reducing anxiety for
   individuals with higher social anxiety during short social conversations
   among peers. Participants completed a short social interaction with
   another undergraduate participant in which eye contact was manipulated
   halfway through the interaction. Recordings of the interactions were
   later coded for amount of eye contact; this allowed us to obtain an
   objective measure of adherence to the manipulation instructions.
   Participants were instructed to make either more or less eye contact, or
   continue as before. Being asked to make less eye contact was the most
   anxiety-provoking condition for participants with higher social anxiety.
   We propose, in line with previous research on safety behaviors, that
   avoiding eye contact in an effort to regulate state anxiety is an
   ineffective strategy over time for individuals with higher social
   anxiety. Therefore gaze avoidance may be a particularly important safety
   behavior to target in treatment for social anxiety disorder.

AB Sampling is a key feature of every study in developmental science.
   Although sampling has far-reaching implications, too little attention is
   paid to sampling. Here, we describe, discuss, and evaluate four
   prominent sampling strategies in developmental science: population-based
   probability sampling, convenience sampling, quota sampling, and
   homogeneous sampling. We then judge these sampling strategies by five
   criteria: whether they yield representative and generalizable estimates
   of a study's target population, whether they yield representative and
   generalizable estimates of subsamples within a study's target
   population, the recruitment efforts and costs they entail, whether they
   yield sufficient power to detect subsample differences, and whether they
   introduce "noise" related to variation in subsamples and whether that
   "noise" can be accounted for statistically. We use sample composition of
   gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status to illustrate and assess the

   strategies in five prominent developmental science journals and make
   recommendations about best practices for sample selection and reporting.

AB Comparative methodology is controversial in biology and the related
   field of research on behavioral and psychological traits across human
   cultures. We critically examine this controversy. We argue that the
   widely held opinion of non-independence among historically-related
   cultures and species errs by not recognizing and incorporating into
   research the two distinct and complementary categories of causation that
   account for an extant trait-the phylogenetic origin of the trait
   (cultural or otherwise) and the maintenance of the trait after its
   phylogenetic origin. Phylogenetic correction for non-independence is
   required in the comparative study of a trait's phylogenetic origin, but
   is irrelevant for the comparative study of the causation of a trait's
   maintenance after its phylogenetic origin. Across cultures, even closely
   related cultures, causes that are specific to each culture act to
   maintain cultural similarities, which makes such similarities
   independent. Among species, even closely related species, similarities
   are maintained by lineage-specific, and hence independent, evolutionary
   causal processes. Comparative methodology has been criticized as being
   inferior to other types of scientific methodology (e.g.,
   experimentation), because it is based on correlational data. This
   criticism is erroneous because, all scientific findings are
   correlational, and in hypothesis testing, the ability of an empirical
   finding to address causation depends solely upon the control of
   confounding variables, not the type of scientific method itself.

AB Acculturating to the United States confers risk for cardiovascular
   disease, possibly through cardiovascular reactivity when communicating
   in a non-native language and interacting with individuals from a
   different ethnic background. Sixty-four women who immigrated to the
   United States from Mexico participated in the study. Cardiovascular
   responses were examined while participants communicated in both English
   and Spanish with a Caucasian or Mexican-American interaction partner
   presented via video-recording. Task-related emotional responses and
   perceptions of the interaction partner were also assessed. Speaking in
   English evoked greater increases in blood pressure and heart rate than
   communicating in Spanish, and larger increases in negative affect.
   English-speaking interaction partners were also viewed as less friendly
   and more dominant. Interaction partner ethnicity had no effect on
   cardiovascular reactivity. These findings suggest that health effects of
   acculturation for Mexican-Americans may involve the cardiovascular
   stress responses associated with communicating in a non-native language.

AB BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in opioid prescribing in the
   emergency department (ED) are well described, yet the influence of
   socioeconomic status (SES) remains unclear.
   (1) To examine the effect of neighborhood SES on the prescribing of
   opioids for moderate to severe pain; and (2) to determine if racial
   disparities in opioid prescribing persist after accounting for SES.
   We used cross-sectional data from the National Hospital Ambulatory
   Medical Care Survey between 2006 and 2009 to examine the prescribing of
   opioids to patients presenting with moderate to severe pain (184 million
   visits). We used logistic regression to examine the association between
   the prescribing of opioids, SES, and race. Models were adjusted for age,
   sex, pain-level, injury-status, frequency of emergency visits, hospital
   type, and region.
   Our primary outcome measure was whether an opioid was prescribed during
   a visit for moderate to severe pain. SES was determined based on income,
   percent poverty, and educational level within a patient's zip code.
   Opioids were prescribed more frequently at visits from patients of the
   highest SES quartile compared to patients in the lowest quartile,
   including percent poverty (49.0 % vs. 39.4 %, P < 0.001), household
   income (47.3 % vs. 40.7 %, P < 0.001), and educational level (46.3 % vs.
   42.5 %, P = 0.01). Black patients were prescribed opioids less
   frequently than white patients across all measures of SES. In adjusted
   models, black patients (AOR 0.73; 95 % CI 0.66-0.81) and patients from
   poorer areas (AOR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.68-0.86) were less likely to receive
   opioids after accounting for pain-level, age, injury-status, and other
   covariates.
   Patients presenting to emergency departments from lower SES regions were
   less likely to receive opioids for equivalent levels of pain than those
   from more affluent areas. Black and Hispanic patients were also less
   likely to receive opioids for equivalent levels of pain than whites,
   independent of SES.

AB Object. Pituitary apoplexy is associated with worse outcomes than are
   pituitary adenomas detected without acute clinical deterioration. The
   association between pituitary apoplexy and socioeconomic factors that
   may limit access to health care has not been examined in prior studies.
   Methods. This study involved retrospectively evaluating data obtained in
   all patients who underwent surgery for nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma
   causing visual symptoms between January 2003 and July 2012 at the
   University of California, San Francisco. Patients were grouped into
   those who presented with apoplexy and those who did not ("no apoplexy").
   The 2 groups were compared with respect to annual household income,
   employment status, health insurance status, and whether or not the
   patient had a primary health care provider. Associations between
   categorical variables were analyzed by chi-square test and continuous
   variables by Student t-test. Multivariate logistic regression was also
   performed.
   Results. One hundred thirty-five patients were identified, 18 of whom
   presented with apoplexy. There were significantly more unmarried
   patients and emergency room presentations in the apoplexy group than in
   the "no apoplexy" group. There was a nonsignificant trend toward lower
   mean household income in the apoplexy group. Lack of health insurance
   and lack of a primary health care provider were both highly
   significantly associated with apoplexy. In a multivariate analysis
   including marital status, emergency room presentation, income, insurance
   status, and primary health care provider status as variables, lack of
   insurance remained associated with apoplexy (OR 11.6; 95% CI 1.9-70.3; p
   = 0.008).
   Conclusions. The data suggest that patients with limited access to
   health care may be more likely to present with pituitary apoplexy than
   those with adequate access.

AB Background: There is limited data analyzing the pharmacokinetic (PK) and
   pharmacodynamic (PD) properties of everolimus (EVR) between African
   Americans and Caucasians. The purpose of this study was to determine and
   compare the EVR PKs and concentration-associated efficacy and toxicity
   in African American and Caucasian adult kidney transplant recipients.
   Methods: This was a retrospective PK and PD analysis of all patients who
   received EVR at the Medical University of South Carolina Transplant
   Center between 2006 and 2012.
   Results: Forty-three patients received EVR (22 African Americans, 21
   Caucasians). Baseline demographics, immunosuppression, and immunologic
   risk were similar between races, except for preexisting hypertension,
   deceased donor type, and cold ischemic time, which were higher in
   African American patients. PK analysis revealed that African American
   patients received higher initial EVR doses (2.1 +/- 0.8 versus 1.6 +/-
   0.6 mg/d, P = 0.036), leading to higher early EVR concentrations (EVR >6
   ng/mL during the first 60 days: 36% versus 10%, P = 0.037). Efficacy
   analysis demonstrated similar EVR effects on acute rejection rates (9%
   versus 10%, P = 0.961), chronic allograft changes (18% versus 14%, P =
   0.729), and renal function, with both groups having improved creatinine
   clearance with EVR therapy (Delta eGFR: 27 versus 12 mL.min(-1).1.73
   m(-2)). Toxicity analysis demonstrated that African American patients
   had a trend toward higher rates of EVR discontinuation (46% versus 19%,
   P = 0.065) and significantly more diarrhea/gastrointestinal intolerance
   (73% versus 38%, P = 0.022).
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate EVR therapy is effective at
   preventing rejection and improving graft function in both African
   American and Caucasian adult renal transplant patients. Conflicting with
   previous mammalian target of rapamycin PK/PD analyses in African
   American patients, this study cohort demonstrated higher early EVR
   levels in the African American patients.

AB Alcohol use among university students is a serious public health
   concern, particularly among minority students who may use alcohol to
   cope with experiences of racial discrimination. Although the impact of
   racial discrimination on alcohol use has been well-established,
   individual differences in factors that may act to either attenuate or
   exacerbate the negative effects of racial discrimination are largely
   unknown. One potentially fruitful individual differences trait that has
   repeatedly been found to predict alcohol problems is the
   multidimensional personality trait of impulsivity. Nonetheless, the ways
   in which various aspects of impulsivity interact with racial
   discrimination is yet unknown. The current study, therefore, examined
   the joint and interactive contribution of racial discrimination and
   impulsivity in the prediction of alcohol consumption among racial
   minority university students. Participants included 336
   Black/African-American and Asian/Asian-American university students.
   Results revealed both racial discrimination and impulsivity to be
   significantly associated with alcohol problems. Further, individuals'
   responses to racial discrimination were not uniform. Specifically, the
   association between racial discrimination and alcohol problems was
   moderated by lack of Premeditation; racial discrimination was most
   strongly predictive of alcohol problems for those who reported low level
   of premeditation. Findings from the present study highlight the
   importance of investigating risk factors for alcohol problems across
   multiple levels of the ecology as individual personality traits appear
   to relate to how one might respond to the experience of racial
   discrimination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with fibromyalgia (FM) experience pain as well as deficits in
   positive affect and social relations that are not explicitly addressed
   in most behavioral treatments.
   The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a 12-module
   online intervention targeting socioemotional regulation via mindful
   awareness/acceptance (MSER) with those of an attention-control
   treatment, healthy lifestyle tips (HT).
   Seventy-nine FM patients were randomly assigned to MSER or HT, with
   outcomes assessed via online diary reports of pain, coping efficacy,
   affect, and social relations. Multilevel analyses revealed greater
   improvements in social functioning, positive affect, and coping efficacy
   for pain and stress (all ps < .05) in MSER versus HT across the 6-week
   trial.
   FM patients experience increases in self-efficacy for coping with pain
   and positive engagement in relationships, marginal increases in positive
   affect, and decreases in relationship stress from an automated online
   intervention that targets socioemotional regulation skills. Findings
   highlight the potential utility of widely accessible, low-cost

AB HIV is highly stigmatized, compromising both treatment and prevention in
   resource-limited settings.
   We sought to study the relationship between internalized HIV-related
   stigma and serostatus disclosure and to determine the extent to which
   this association varies with the degree of social distance.
   We fit multivariable Poisson regression models, with cluster-correlated
   robust estimates of variance, to data from 259 persons with HIV enrolled
   in an ongoing cohort study in rural Uganda.
   Persons with more internalized stigma were less likely to disclose their
   seropositivity. The magnitude of association increased with social
   distance such that the largest association was observed for public
   disclosures and the smallest association was observed for disclosures to
   sexual partners.
   Among persons with HIV in rural Uganda, internalized stigma was
   negatively associated with serostatus disclosure. The inhibiting effect
   of stigma was greatest for the most socially distant ties.

AB Objectives Most global maternal deaths occur in Africa and Asia. In
   response, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG-5) calls for a 75%
   reduction in maternal mortality from 1990 to 2015. To assess the
   potential for progress in MDG-5 in Africa, we examined the
   cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of socioeconomic,
   demographic and population-health factors with maternal mortality rates
   in Africa.
   Methods We used data from global agencies and the published literature
   to identify socioeconomic, demographic and population-health explanatory
   factors that could be correlated with maternal mortality in 49 countries
   of Africa for the years 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005. We used correlation,
   negative binomial and mixed Poisson regression models to investigate
   whether there exist associations between potential explanatory factors
   and maternal mortality.
   Results Some African countries have made substantial progress towards
   achieving MDG-5 while others have fallen behind. Lower gross domestic
   product (GDP) and female enrolment in primary schools, but higher HIV
   prevalence, neonatal mortality rate and total fertility rate, were
   associated with higher maternal mortality.
   Conclusions Maternal mortality rates in African countries appear to be
   declining. The mean maternal mortality ratios in Africa decreased from
   695.82 in 1990 to 562.18 in 2005. Yet some countries are more likely
   than others to achieve MDG-5. Better socioeconomic, demographic and
   population health development appear to be conducive to better maternal
   health in Africa. Sustained efforts on all these fronts will be needed
   to close the gap in maternal survival and achieve MDG-5 in Africa.

AB Extending Bourdieu's work, this paper introduces the concept of location
   as a supplement to the concepts of position and disposition in
   understanding how strategies are enacted in cultural fields. To
   illustrate my argument, this paper is organized into four sections.
   First, the applicability and extension of Bourdieu's theory of cultural
   production is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating
   how the concept of location adopts an intersubjective understanding of
   reflexivity in order to address some of the limitations of Bourdieu's
   concepts of position, disposition and strategy. Second, two different
   strategies of legitimation (crowd pleasing and crowd commanding) adopted
   by DJs within the field are outlined. Third, the importance of location
   in the use of these strategies in the field of black popular
   music-making is illustrated. Finally, this paper concludes by
   summarizing the key dimensions of the concept of location and suggesting
   how the concept has broader applicability in other cultural fields.

   How does materiality affect people's experience of art in a museum

   agents-object and words-interact with human bodies to choreograph the
   art encounter. This process works through interactions between two

AB Social studies of agriculture tend to overlook the micro and symbolic
   interactions that structure relationships among agriculturalists, the
   environment, and animals raised as commodities. In this study, I use
   ethnographic methods and in-depth interviews with conventional beef
   producers to understand their perceptions of the environment and the
   nonhuman animals they raise. Central themes in this setting are the
   ethics of stewardship and husbandry. I seek to understand how these
   values are constructed and used interactionally. I argue that
   stewardship and husbandry help describe a process of co-constitution
   that binds together ranchers, cattle, and the natural environment. The
   analysis engages actor-network theory by emphasizing nonhuman activeness
   and draws from symbolic interaction and cultural sociology to show how
   people interpret the actions of nonhumans. The findings show that
   ranchers frame their relationships with cattle and the environment as
   symbiotic and work to understand the interests of the nonhuman as
   complementary to production. I introduce the term symbiotic ideology to
   show the way this approach mystifies power dynamics embedded in the
   ethic of dominion.

AB Research on the role of red meat and poultry consumption in breast
   carcinogenesis is inconclusive, but the evidence in African-American
   (AA) women is lacking. The association between consuming meat and breast
   cancer risk was examined in the Women's Circle of Health Study involving
   803 AA cases, 889 AA controls, 755 Caucasian cases, and 701 Caucasian
   controls.
   Dietary information was collected using a Food Frequency Questionnaire.
   Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from
   logistic regression models adjusting for potential covariates.
   Comparing the fourth versus the first quartiles, among Caucasian women,
   processed meat (OR = 1.48; 95 % CI 1.07-2.04), unprocessed red meat (OR
   = 1.40; 95 % CI 1.01-1.94), and poultry intakes (OR = 1.42; 95 % CI
   1.01-1.99) increased breast cancer risk. Risk associated with poultry
   intake was more dominant in premenopausal women (OR = 2.33; 95 % CI
   1.44-3.77) and for women with ER- tumors (OR = 2.55; 95 % CI 1.29-5.03)

   for a significant increased risk trend with processed meat consumption
   for ER+ tumors (OR = 1.36; 95 % CI 0.94-1.97, p trend = 0.04).
   Overall, associations between breast cancer risk and consumption of red
   meat and poultry were of different magnitude in AA and Caucasian women,
   with further differences noted by menopausal and hormone receptor status
   in Caucasian women. This is the first study to examine racial
   differences in meat and breast cancer risk and represents some of the
   first evidence in AA women.

AB The Las Vegas Valley metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing
   areas in the southwestern United States. The rapid urbanization has
   presented many environmental challenges. For instance, as population
   growth and urbanization continue, the supply of sufficient clean water
   will become a concern. In addition, the area is also experiencing the
   longest drought in history, and the volume of water storage in Lake
   Mead, the main fresh water supply for the entire region, has been
   reduced greatly. The water quality in the main stem of the Las Vegas
   Wash (LVW) and Lake Mead may also be significantly affected. In order to
   develop effective sustainable management plans, the very first step is
   to predict the plausible future urbanization and land use patterns. This
   paper presents an approach to predict the future land use pattern at the
   LVW watershed using a Markov cellular automata model. The multi-criteria
   evaluation was used to couple population density as a variable depicting
   the driving force of urbanization in the model. Moreover, landscape
   metrics were used to analyze land use changes in order to better
   understand the dynamics of urban development in the LVW watershed. The
   predicted future land use maps for the years 2030 and 2050 show
   substantial urban development in the area, much of which are located in
   areas sensitive to source water protections. The results of the analysis
   provide valuable information for local planners and policy makers,
   assisting their efforts in constructing alternative sustainable urban
   development schemes and environmental management strategies.

AB The article applies the Althusserian concept of overdetermination to a
   contemporary case of urban restructuring in the global South. Since the
   2001 invasion of Afghanistan, the international aid industry has been
   using its capital city, Kabul, as a laboratory and launch pad for
   liberal policies and programmes to demonstrate that security, economic
   growth and democracy are mutually reinforcing and can therefore be
   achieved in conjunction. These interventions have resulted in
   fundamental structural changes in Kabul's political economy that mimic
   processes of accumulation by dispossession in the urban global North.
   Formerly shaped by indigenous political activism and cautious democratic
   experimentation, Kabul today is a space of accelerated accumulation in
   the shadows of international peacebuilding.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is an important reserve variable which has
   been shown to benefit the aging brain's macrostructure. However, it
   remains unknown whether SES affects age-related changes in the brain's
   white matter (WM) microstructure. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging
   to explore the relationship between SES and three components of the
   diffusion tensor [fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, and
   radial diffusivity (DR)]. Participants were 40 (16 male) cognitively
   normal young adults (mean age = 33.3 years, SD = 4.27) and 44 (19 male)
   cognitively normal community dwelling seniors (mean age = 66.2 years, SD
   = 7.5). Age-related FA declines were observed across a large portion of
   the WM skeleton. However, seniors with high SES showed lower age-related
   WM integrity declines in three frontal tracts: the right anterior corona
   radiata and bilateral portions of WM underlying the superior frontal
   gyri (SFG-WM). Positive SES-FA correlations were primarily driven by
   negative DR-SES correlations, suggesting that SES may buffer age-related
   declines in myelin. The functional significance of high SES in these
   frontal tracts was demonstrated through positive correlations with
   working memory performance. Possible mechanisms through which SES may
   attenuate the effects of age on frontal WM integrity are discussed.

AB The objective of our article is straightforward. We seek to derive, and
   to confront with data, an empirical model of Robert K. Merton's
   macro-level, anomie theory of profit-motivated crime. We use Ordinary
   Least Squares (OLS) regression equations to estimate the joint effects
   of measures of the acceptance of material success goals and absolute and
   relative deprivation, respectively, on cross-national rates of drug
   trafficking. Consistent with the predictions derived from Mertonian
   anomie theory, the coefficients for the product terms (the acceptance of
   success goalsxabsolute deprivation and the acceptance of success
   goalsxrelative deprivation) are significant and positive. This
   investigation provides what we believe is the first evaluation of the
   Mertonian proposition that the cultural (goals) and structural (means)
   components of social systems operate together to increase the level of
   profit-motivated crime. What is missing, of course, is a measure of
   anomie. We are forced to infer that anomie is the causal mechanism that
   links the joint influence of culture and social structure on pecuniary
   crime. Admittedly, this is an unavoidable limitation of the current
   investigation.

AB Objective. To determine whether the association between SES and
   disability vary by age in African Americans.
   Methods. Logistic regression models were conducted to estimate the
   association between SES and. disability by age group in 395 African
   Americans participating in the Carolina African American Twin Study of
   Aging. Disability was defined as difficulty in performing at least one
   of seven basic activities of daily living. Education and family income
   were used as measures of SES. Age was categorized as individuals aged
   <49 years and aged >= 50 years.
   Results. After adjusting for demographic and health-related
   characteristics among older adults, a higher odds of disability was
   associated with no post-secondary education (OR=3.09, 95% CI:
   1.24-7.71), and with low-income (OR=2.74, 95% CI: 1.17-6.43) compared to
   more educated or affluent people, respectively. No association between
   SES and disability was observed in young adults. When considering the
   combined effect of no post-secondary education and low-income on
   disability, older adults with no post-secondary education had a greater
   odds of being disabled (OR=2.63, 95% CI: 1.03-6.73) relative to those
   with a post-secondary education controlling for covariates.
   Conclusions. The findings demonstrate the advantage of disentangling the
   confounding of race and SES as an initial step to understanding the
   relationship among age, SES and disability in African Americans. (Ethn

   Design: The current study is a cross-sectional, secondary data analysis
   of the Cooper Center Longitudinal Study.
   Setting: Patients with a medical examination from 1970-2010 at the
   Cooper Clinic.
   Participants: 762 African Americans and 40,051 Caucasians who met the
   criteria.
   Outcome Measures: Racial differences in cardiovascular risk
   factors/burden of disease between African Americans and Caucasians.
   Results: African Americans had higher prevalence of evaluated
   cardiovascular risk factors than did Caucasians after controlling for
   obesity, tobacco use, and physical fitness. Caucasians had greater
   likelihood of no risk factors while African Americans were more likely
   to have all three risk factors. Race was typically predictive of
   cardiovascular risk factors in African Americans compared to Caucasians.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that health differences persist despite
   greater socioeconomic status, and further investigations of
   biopsychosocial causes are warranted. (Ethn Dis. 2013;23[1]:35-42)

AB Although there is acknowledgment that the complexity of
   social-ecological systems governance demands representation from diverse
   perspectives, there is little agreement in the literature on how to
   cross both fiat (human-demarcated) and bona fide (physical) boundaries
   to address such complexities. As a cohort of interdisciplinary scholars,
   we navigate the boundary between science and practice to address the
   question of fit regarding the role of organizations in transcending
   boundaries. We found there is a need to rectify discrepancies between
   theories about boundaries and theories about organizations. To this end,
   we propose a conceptual framework to analyze transboundaty
   organizations, an umbrella term to group the literature on boundary
   organizations, intermediaries and bridging organizations; we introduce
   this term to illustrate they are not mutually exclusive and to
   facilitate interdisciplinary research. We first examine
   social-ecological systems (SES), a framework intended to improve
   understandings of boundaries and governance. We then continue to unpack
   the complexity of boundaries and organizations, specifically through
   important transboundary concepts such as scale and organizational
   learning. This helps frame our examination of the literature on: 1)
   boundary organizations; 2) bridging organizations (third-party
   entities); and 3) intermediaries (distinguished by their position
   between other actors). Our review identifies a number of discrepancies
   that pertain to the types of boundaries discussed and the roles assigned
   to organizations governing SES. Important characteristics have emerged
   from our review of transboundary organizations including legitimacy,
   saliency, urgency, and credibility. In developing a conceptual
   framework, we argue that transboundary organizations: 1) expand upon the
   boundary spectrum, 2) incorporate transboundary concepts, and 3)
   hybridize characteristics of boundary, bridging, and intermediary
   organizations. We conclude with a number of considerations for
   transboundary organizations and recommendations for further research.

AB Social support for individuals with psychosis is associated with
   decreased symptom severity, improved outcomes, and recovery. In
   adolescents, declining social support prior to the first hospitalization
   has been shown to predict time to relapse, which may have implications
   for early intervention. Data were collected on adolescents (n=84)
   following a first hospitalization for a psychotic episode in order to
   examine how change in social support relates to the duration and type of
   untreated symptoms. Most adolescents experienced a decline in social
   support (n=46) prior to index hospitalization. Chi-square analyses
   showed that declining social support was related to negative symptoms
   and longer duration of untreated psychosis, whereas stable social
   support was associated with manic symptoms and diagnosis of Bipolar
   disorder. When entered together into a logistic regression model, the
   decline in social support was primarily explained by the type of
   symptoms, rather than by the duration of untreated symptoms. Thee
   findings are relevant for targeting psychosocial treatments toward
   adolescents who may have particular deficits in social support during
   the prodromal phase and first episode of psychosis. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Religious coping is very common among individuals with psychosis,
   however its relevance to symptoms and treatment outcomes remains
   unclear. We conducted a prospective study in a clinical sample of n=47
   psychiatric patients with current/past psychosis receiving partial (day)
   treatment at McLean Hospital. Subjects completed measures of religious
   involvement, religious coping and suicidality prior to treatment, and we
   assessed for psychosis, depression, anxiety and psychological well-being
   over the course of treatment. Negative religious coping (spiritual
   struggle) was associated with substantially greater frequency and
   intensity of suicidal ideation, as well as greater depression, anxiety,
   and less well-being prior to treatment (accounting for 9.0-462% of the
   variance in these variables). Positive religious coping was associated
   with significantly greater reductions in depression and anxiety, and
   increases in well-being over the course of treatment (accounting for
   13.7-36.0% of the variance in change scores). Effects remained
   significant after controlling for significant covariates. Negative
   religious coping appears to be-a risk factor for suicidality and
   affective symptoms among psychotic patients. Positive religious coping
   is an important resource to this population, and its utilization appears
   to be associated with better treatment outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   onset. Approximately 7% of the entire sample had experienced MOD onset

AB Participating in social network websites entails voluntarily sharing
   private information, and the explosive growth of social network websites
   over the last decade suggests shifting views on privacy. Concurrently,
   new anti-terrorism laws, such as the USA Patriot Act, ask citizens to
   surrender substantial claim to privacy in the name of greater security.
   I address two important questions regarding individuals' views on
   privacy raised by these trends. First, how does prompting individuals to
   consider security concerns affect their views on government actions that
   jeopardize privacy? Second, does the use of social network websites
   alter the effect of prompted security concerns? I posit that prompting
   individuals to consider security concerns does lead to an increased
   willingness to accept government actions that jeopardize privacy, but
   that frequent users of websites like Facebook are less likely to be
   swayed by prompted security concerns. An embedded survey experiment
   provides support for both parts of my claim.

AB Approximately 30% of the cultivated rice area in India is prone to crop
   damage from prolonged flooding. We use a randomized field experiment in
   128 villages of Orissa India to show that Swarna-Sub1, a recently
   released submergence-tolerant rice variety, has significant positive
   impacts on rice yield when fields are submerged for 7 to 14 days with no
   yield penalty without flooding. We estimate that Swarna-Sub1 offers an
   approximate 45% increase in yields over the current popular variety when
   fields are submerged for 10 days. We show additionally that low-lying
   areas prone to flooding tend to be more heavily occupied by people
   belonging to lower caste social groups. Thus, a policy relevant
   implication of our findings is that flood-tolerant rice can deliver both
   efficiency gains, through reduced yield variability and higher expected
   yield, and equity gains in disproportionately benefiting the most
   marginal group of farmers.

AB Social relationships are tightly linked to health and well-being. Recent
   work suggests that social relationships can even serve vital emotion
   regulation functions by minimizing threat-related neural activity. But
   relationship distress remains a significant public health problem in
   North America and elsewhere. A promising approach to helping couples
   both resolve relationship distress and nurture effective interpersonal
   functioning is Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples (EFT), a
   manualized, empirically supported therapy that is strongly focused on
   repairing adult attachment bonds. We sought to examine a neural index of
   social emotion regulation as a potential mediator of the effects of EFT.
   Specifically, we examined the effectiveness of EFT for modifying the
   social regulation of neural threat responding using an fMRI-based
   handholding procedure. Results suggest that EFT altered the brain's
   representation of threat cues in the presence of a romantic partner.
   EFT-related changes during stranger handholding were also observed, but
   stranger effects were dependent upon self-reported relationship quality.
   EFT also appeared to increase threat-related brain activity in regions
   associated with self-regulation during the no-handholding condition.
   These findings provide a critical window into the regulatory mechanisms
   of close relationships in general and EFT in particular.

AB Survival for any organism, including people, is a matter of resource
   management. To ensure survival, people necessarily budget their
   resources. Spatial perceptions contribute to resource budgeting by
   scaling the environment to an individual's available resources.
   Effective budgeting requires setting a balance of income and
   expenditures around some baseline value. For social resources, this
   baseline assumes that the individuals are embedded in their social
   network. A review of the literature supports the proposal that our
   visual perceptions vary based on the implicit budgeting of physical and
   social resources, where social resources, as they fluctuate relative to
   a baseline, can directly alter our visual perceptions.

AB The racial segregation of romantic networks has been documented by
   social scientists for generations. However, because of limitations in
   available data, we still have a surprisingly basic idea of the extent to
   which this pattern is generated by actual interpersonal prejudice as
   opposed to structural constraints on meeting opportunities, how severe
   this prejudice is, and the circumstances under which it can be reduced.
   I analyzed a network of messages sent and received among 126,134 users
   of a popular online dating site over a 2.5-mo period. As in face-to-face
   interaction, online exchanges are structured heavily by race. Even when
   controlling for regional differences in meeting opportunities, site
   users-especially minority site users-disproportionately message other
   users from the same racial background. However, this high degree of
   self-segregation peaks at the first stage of contact. First, users from
   all racial backgrounds are equally likely or more likely to cross a
   racial boundary when reciprocating than when initiating romantic
   interest. Second, users who receive a cross-race message initiate more
   new interracial exchanges in the future than they would have otherwise.
   This effect varies by gender, racial background, and site experience; is
   specific to the racial background of the original sender; requires that
   the recipient replied to the original message; and diminishes after a
   week. In contrast to prior research on relationship outcomes, these
   findings shed light on the complex interactional dynamics that -under
   certain circumstances-may amplify the effects of racial boundary
   crossing and foster greater interracial mixing.

   hazards. We used baseline examination data (20002002) from the

   The modifying role of social and psychosocial factors on the association
   between exposure to air pollution comprising particulate matter less
   than 2.5 m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and blood pressure measures
   were examined using linear regression models. There was no evidence of
   synergistic effects of higher PM2.5 and adverse social/psychosocial
   factors on blood pressure. In contrast, there was weak evidence of
   stronger associations of PM2.5 with blood pressure in higher
   socioeconomic status groups. For example, those in the 10th percentile
   of the income distribution (i.e., low income) showed no association
   between PM2.5 and diastolic blood pressure (b 0.41 mmHg; 95 confidence
   interval: 1.40, 0.61), whereas those in the 90th percentile of the
   income distribution (i.e., high income) showed a 1.52-mmHg increase in
   diastolic blood pressure for each 10-g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 (95
   confidence interval: 0.22, 2.83). Our results are not consistent with
   the hypothesis that there are stronger associations between PM2.5
   exposures and blood pressure in persons of lower socioeconomic status or
   those with greater psychosocial adversity.

AB In the face of global deforestation, there is a challenge to balance the
   management of areas of high conservation concern and social interests.
   As a response to the growing human environment interface and the use of
   forests for subsistence, plantations became a management tool to provide
   for wood harvesting during the 1970s. Some plantations were subsequently
   protected from harvest as conservation of all forests increased.
   Plantations that are now illegal to harvest can cause local animosities
   toward forest protection to increase and may also result in concentrated
   harvesting impacts on surrounding natural forests. In this article, we
   analyzed case studies of plantations from El Salvador and Niger. By
   utilizing distinctly disparate case studies, commonalities between the
   two can illuminate possible management lessons. In the comparison of El
   Salvador and Niger forest plantations we found the following
   commonalities: utilizing plantations for sustainable harvest has the to
   potential to reduce animosity between managers and stakeholders;
   plantations can serve as a risk-averse testing ground for novel
   managerial practices; and the sustainable harvest of plantations can
   reduce deforestation and impacts on biodiversity in natural remnant
   forests. We argue that extant plantations currently under illegal
   harvesting legislation could become the epicenters of social and
   ecological conservation through a management shift to sustainable
   harvesting. By focusing on these relics, managers could work with
   stakeholders to change unduly burdening restrictions and promote
   cooperation between conservationists and local populations. (C) 2013

AB Rationale: The burden of asthma is highest among socioeconomically
   disadvantaged populations; however, its impact is differentially
   distributed among racial and ethnic groups.
   Objectives: To assess the collective effect of maternal educational
   attainment, annual household income, and insurance type on childhood
   asthma among minority, urban youth.
   Methods: We included Mexican American (n = 485), other Latino (n = 217),
   and African American (n = 1,141) children (aged 8-21 yr) with and
   without asthma from the San Francisco Bay Area. An index was derived
   from maternal educational attainment, annual household income, and
   insurance type to assess the collective effect of socioeconomic status
   on predicting asthma. Logistic regression stratified by racial and
   ethnic group was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and their
   95% confidence intervals (CI). We
   [GRAPHICS]
   further examined whether acculturation explained the
   socioeconomic-asthma association in our Latino population.
   Measurements and Main Results: In the adjusted analyses, African
   American children had 23% greater odds of asthma with each decrease in
   the socioeconomic index (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.38). Conversely,
   Mexican American children have 17% reduced odds of asthma with each
   decrease in the socioeconomic index (aOR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.96) and
   this relationship was not fully explained by acculturation. This
   association was not observed in the other Latino group.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status plays an important role in predicting
   asthma, but has different effects depending on race and ethnicity.
   Further steps are necessary to better understand the risk factors
   through which socioeconomic status could operate in these populations to
   prevent asthma.

AB Social exclusion and risk-taking are both common experiences of concern
   in adolescence, yet little is known about how the two may be related at
   behavioral or neural levels. In this fMRI study, adolescents (N = 27, 14
   male, 14-17 years-old) completed a series of tasks in the scanner
   assessing risky decision-making before and after an episode of social
   exclusion. In this particular context, exclusion was associated with
   greater behavioral risk-taking among adolescents with low self-reported
   resistance to peer influence (RN). When making risky decisions after
   social exclusion, adolescents who had lower RPI exhibited higher levels
   of activity in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), and this
   response in rTPJ was a significant mediator of the relationship between
   RPI and greater risk-taking after social exclusion. Lower RPI was also
   associated with lower levels of activity in IPFC during crashes
   following social exclusion, but unlike rTPJ this response in IPFC was
   not a significant mediator of the relationship between RPI and greater
   risk-taking after social exclusion. The results suggest that mentalizing
   and/or attentional mechanisms have a unique direct effect on
   adolescents' vulnerability to peer influence on risk-taking. (c) 2013

AB Background: Dengue fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease, is now the
   fastest spreading tropical disease globally. Previous studies indicate
   that climate and human behavior interact to influence dengue virus and
   vector (Aedes aegypti) population dynamics; however, the relative
   effects of these variables depends on local ecology and social context.
   We investigated the roles of climate and socio-ecological factors on Ae.
   aegypti population dynamics in Machala, a city in southern coastal
   Ecuador where dengue is hyper-endemic.
   Methods/Principal findings: We studied two proximate urban localities
   where we monitored weekly Ae. aegypti oviposition activity (Nov.
   2010-June 2011), conducted seasonal pupal surveys, and surveyed
   household to identify dengue risk factors. The results of this study
   provide evidence that Ae. aegypti population dynamics are influenced by
   social risk factors that vary by season and lagged climate variables
   that vary by locality. Best-fit models to predict the presence of Ae.
   aegypti pupae included parameters for household water storage practices,
   access to piped water, the number of households per property, condition
   of the house and patio, and knowledge and perceptions of dengue.
   Rainfall and minimum temperature were significant predictors of
   oviposition activity, although the effect of rainfall varied by locality
   due to differences in types of water storage containers.
   Conclusions: These results indicate the potential to reduce the burden
   of dengue in this region by conducting focused vector control
   interventions that target high-risk households and containers in each
   season and by developing predictive models using climate and non-climate
   information. These findings provide the region's public health sector
   with key information for conducting time and location-specific vector
   control campaigns, and highlight the importance of local
   socio-ecological studies to understand dengue dynamics. See Text S1 for
   an executive summary in Spanish.

AB This is the first study to examine how both structural and functional
   components of individuals' social networks may moderate the association
   between biological sex and experimental pain sensitivity. One hundred
   and fifty-two healthy adults (mean age = 22yrs., 53% males) were
   measured for cold pressor task (CPT) pain sensitivity (i.e., intensity
   ratings) and core aspects of social networks (e. g., proportion of
   friends vs. family, affection, affirmation, and aid). Results showed
   consistent sex differences in how social network structures and intimate
   relationship functioning modulated pain sensitivity. Females showed
   higher pain sensitivity when their social networks consisted of a higher
   proportion of intimate types of relationship partners (e. g., kin vs.
   non kin), when they had known their network partners for a longer period
   of time, and when they reported higher levels of logistical support from
   their significant other (e. g., romantic partner). Conversely, males
   showed distinct patterns in the opposite direction, including an
   association between higher levels of logistical support from one's
   significant other and lower CPT pain intensity. These findings show for
   the first time that the direction of sex differences in exogenous pain
   sensitivity is likely dependent on fundamental components of the
   individual's social environment. The utility of a social-signaling
   perspective of pain behaviors for examining, comparing, and interpreting
   individual and group differences in experimental and clinical pain
   reports is discussed.

   empirical question of what ethnographers actually do. Specifically, it
   investigates whether ethnographic articles make causal arguments and how
   these arguments are made. The authors draw on a content analysis of 48
   ethnographic articles sampled from four groups of sociological journals:
   contemporary generalist journals, contemporary specialist journals,
   mid-20th-century generalist journalsall in the United Statesand
   contemporary generalist journals in Mexico. They find that ethnographies
   in U.S. contemporary generalist journals are most likely to advance
   strong and central causal claims and to use logical and rhetorical
   devices comparable to those used in quantitative articles. They also
   find that most Mexican ethnographic articles undertake a different kind
   of project, which they call "shedding light" on social phenomena. In
   addition to offering one methodological and one substantive suggestion
   to account for these findings, the authors highlight their implications
   for the sociology of social science.

AB This study advances recent theorizing on causality and emergence by
   analyzing how new activist groups create a collective sense of plausible
   tactics. A comparative ethnographic approach is used to observe shifts
   in the discussions of four fledgling activist groups. In each group,
   implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events,
   authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge
   without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group's
   sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new
   understanding of the role of contingency in collective activism and a
   method for using ethnographic observation to locate subtle causal
   mechanisms in social life.

AB This article demonstrates that psychoanalysis and socially oriented
   psychiatry were crucial to the understanding and adoption of the first
   effective psychopharmaceuticals in North American psychiatry. In the
   1950s and the early 1960s, psychoanalysts, socially oriented
   psychiatrists, and biologists collaborated, debated, and organized
   interdisciplinary conferences to situate the biochemistry of new
   psychopharmaceuticals, such as chlorpromazine, in the broader
   psychosocial context of patients' lives. Psychoanalytical and
   sociological perspectives not only helped American psychiatrists explain
   the mechanism of drug action in research but also established the
   professional authority of psychiatrists over the new pharmaceuticals. As
   modern pharmacology narrows its focus to microscopic targets in the
   body, I argue that this early drug research illustrates the present-day
   need for holistic and interdisciplinary approaches to drug response that
   acknowledge the psychosocial significance of psychiatric medication in
   the lives of individuals.

AB Objectives. We explored the relationship between social isolation and
   mortality in a nationally representative US sample and compared the
   predictive power of social isolation with that of traditional clinical
   risk factors.
   Methods. We used data on 16 849 adults from the Third National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey and the National Death Index. Predictor
   variables were 4 social isolation factors and a composite index.
   Comparison predictors included smoking, obesity, elevated blood
   pressure, and high cholesterol. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier tables and Cox
   proportional hazards regression models controlling for sociodemographic
   characteristics were used to predict mortality.
   Results. Socially isolated men and women had worse unadjusted survival
   curves than less socially isolated individuals. Cox models revealed that
   social isolation predicted mortality for both genders, as did smoking
   and high blood pressure. Among men, individual social predictors
   included being unmarried, participating infrequently in religious
   activities, and lacking club or organization affiliations; among women,
   significant predictors were being unmarried, infrequent social contact,
   and participating infrequently in religious activities.
   Conclusions. The strength of social isolation as a predictor of
   mortality is similar to that of well-documented clinical risk factors.
   Our results suggest the importance of assessing patients' level of
   social isolation.

AB Objectives. We sought to determine if reported racial discrimination was
   associated with medication nonadherence among African Americans with
   hypertension and if distrust of physicians was a contributing factor.
   Methods. Data were obtained from the TRUST project conducted in
   Birmingham, Alabama, 2006 to 2008. All participants were African
   Americans diagnosed with hypertension and receiving care at an inner
   city, safety net setting. Three categories of increasing adherence were
   defined based on the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Trust in
   physicians was measured with the Hall General Trust Scale, and
   discrimination was measured with the Experiences of Discrimination
   Scale. Associations were quantified by ordinal logistic regression,
   adjusting for gender, age, education, and income.
   Results. The analytic sample consisted of 227 African American men and
   553 African American women, with a mean age of 53.7 +/- 9.9 years. Mean
   discrimination scores decreased monotonically across increasing category
   of medication adherence (4.1, 3.6, 2.9; P = .025), though the opposite
   was found for trust scores (36.5, 38.5, 40.8; P < .001). Trust mediated
   39% (95% confidence interval = 17%, 100%) of the association between
   discrimination and medication adherence.
   Conclusions. Within our sample of inner city African Americans with
   hypertension, racial discrimination was associated with lower medication
   adherence, and this association was partially mediated by trust in
   physicians. Patient, physician and system approaches to increase
   "earned" trust may enhance existing interventions for promoting
   medication adherence.

AB Objectives. We investigated how much the Human Development Index (HDI),
   a global measure of development, modifies the effect of education on
   self-reported health.
   Methods. We analyzed cross-sectional World Health Survey data on 217 642
   individuals from 49 countries, collected in 2002 to 2005, with
   random-intercept multilevel linear regression models.
   Results. We observed greater positive associations between educational
   levels and self-reported good health with increasing HDI. The magnitude
   of this effect modification of the education-health relation tended to
   increase with educational attainment. For example, before adjustment for
   effect modification, at comparable HDI, on average, finishing primary
   school was associated with better general health (b = 1.49; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.80). With adjustment for effect
   modification by HDI, the impact became 4.63 (95% CI = 3.63, 5.62) for
   every 0.1 increase in HDI. Among those who completed high school, these
   associations were, respectively, 5.59 (95% CI = 5.20, 5.98) and 9.95
   (95% CI = 8.89, 11.00).
   Conclusions. The health benefits of educational attainment are greater
   in countries with greater human development. Health inequalities
   attributable to education are, therefore, larger in more developed
   countries.

AB Background School closures were widely implemented in Argentina during
   the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic.
   Objectives To assess the economic impact of school closures on
   households, their effectiveness in preventing children from engaging in
   social group activities, and parental attitudes toward them.
   Methods Three schools that closed for 2 weeks in response to the
   pandemic were identified in two socioeconomically distinct cities in
   Argentina. All households with children enrolled in these schools were
   surveyed. Direct and indirect costs attributable to closures were
   estimated from the household perspective. Other information collected
   included children activities during the closures and parental attitudes
   toward the intervention.
   Results Completed questionnaires were returned by 45% of surveyed
   households. Direct and indirect costs due to closures represented 11% of
   imputed monthly household income in the city with lower socioeconomic
   status, and 3% in the other city (P=0.01). Non-childcare expenses and
   loss of workdays were more common in the city with lower socioeconomic
   status. Childcare expenses were less common and were experienced by a
   similar percentage of households in both cities. About three-quarters of
   respondents in both cities agreed with the closures. The main concern
   among those who disagreed with closures was their negative impact on
   education. Children in more than two-thirds of affected households left
   their home at least once during the closures to spend time in public
   places.
   Conclusion School closures may more significantly impact low-income
   households. Authorities should consider the range of economic impacts of
   school closures among families when planning their implementation.

AB Objectives: To examine the association between socioeconomic status
   (SES) and C-reactive protein (CRP) to understand how SES may increase
   the risk of cardiovascular disease and thus identify targets for
   prevention measures. Methods: Path models were used to examine direct
   and indirect associations of four indices of SES (objective early life
   built environment ratings, parental and participant education, and
   income) with CRP measured during early adulthood using data from the
   National Longitudinal Adolescent Health Study (n = 11,371; mean age = 29
   years, range = 24-32 years; 53.8% women, 28.0% black participants). The
   present study examined potential mediation of the association of SES
   with CRP by way of body mass index (HMI), smoking, and alcohol
   consumption within white and black men and women. Results: HMI was a
   mediator of the relation between parent education and CRP for white men
   (path coefficient [gamma] = -0.05, p < .001) and women (gamma = -0.05, p
   < .001). Smoking mediated the income-CRP (gamma = -0.01, p < .01) and
   the education-CRP (gamma = -0.07, p < .001) relation for white men. BMI
   mediated the relation between all measures of SES and CRP for white
   women (gamma values between -0.02 and -0.05; p values <.01). None of the
   risk factors mediated the SES-CRP relation in black participants.
   Conclusions: These findings indicate that the association of SES with
   CRP is influenced by both the timing and type of SES measure examined.
   In addition, race and sex play a role in how potential mediators are
   involved with the SES-CRP relationship, such that BMI and smoking were
   mediators in white men, whereas BMI was the sole mediator in white
   women.

AB ObjectivesPica has been studied in India and elsewhere for more than 100
   years, yet no compelling and empirically well-supported explanation for
   it has emerged. Amylophagy, sometimes considered a type of pica and
   sometimes studied separately, is less frequently investigated and also
   lacks a convincing explanation. This study used a biocultural approach
   to test three hypotheses of pica and amylophagy: protection,
   hunger/nutrition, and psychological distress.
   MethodsThe research took place in Tamil Nadu, India. In study 1, a
   cultural investigation was carried out among nonpregnant, adult women
   (n=54) to determine nonfood substances that are consumed in this region
   and perceptions of health consequences. Next, using the substances
   identified in Study 1, three hypotheses of pica and amylophagy were
   tested in a cross-sectional study of pregnant women (Study 2, n=95).
   Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the presence or absence
   of engaging in pica and amylophagy. A series of bivariate analyses were
   used to examine the variation in amount and frequency of consumption.
   ResultsStudy 1 revealed that cultural attitudes strongly shape the
   selection of nonfood substances. In Study 2, the presence or absence of
   pica was not predicted by any of the variables included in the study,
   whereas the frequency and amount of consumption of pica substances were
   primarily explained by the psychological distress and hunger/nutrition
   hypotheses. Both the presence or absence of amylophagy as well as the
   frequency and amount of consumption were best explained by the
   protection hypothesis.
   ConclusionsThis research provided partial support for the protection and
   hunger/nutrition hypotheses for amylophagy, and also provided some
   evidence for the role of psychological distress and hunger or nutrition
   in pica. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:803-813, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

AB ObjectivesPrevious research has shown that the extreme cold and short
   day lengths of polar winters promote increased production and uptake of
   thyroid hormones, resulting in marked declines in free triiodothyronine
   (fT3). However, this polar T3 syndrome has been documented almost
   exclusively on small samples of male sojourners and little is known
   about seasonal changes in thyroid function among indigenous circumpolar
   groups. The present study addresses this gap by examining seasonal
   changes in thyroid hormone levels among the indigenous Yakut (Sakha) of
   northeastern Siberia.
   MethodsAnthropometric dimensions and thyroid measures (fT3, free
   thyroxine [fT4], thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) were obtained on two
   occasions (July/August, 2009 and January 2011) on a sample of 134 Yakut
   adults (51 men, 83 women) from the village of Berdygestiakh, Sakha
   Republic/Yakutia, Russia.
   ResultsYakut men and women both displayed significant declines in fT3
   and fT4, and significant increases in TSH from summer to winter despite
   showing only modest seasonal changes in body mass and composition. Among
   men, gains in fat-free mass (FFM) were associated with larger reductions
   in fT3 and greater increases in TSH. Men living more traditional
   lifeways showed larger winter declines in fT4 and greater increases in
   TSH.
   ConclusionsThe Yakut exhibited significant winter declines in fT3 levels
   similar to other circumpolar groups studied. However, the magnitude of
   seasonal change was greater in the Yakut, perhaps reflecting their
   distinctive metabolic physiology. Lifestyle factors play a mediating
   role in thyroid responses, such that men with more traditional lifeways
   had more exaggerated seasonal changes. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:814-820,

AB Objective: To examine the impact of individual and community
   characteristics on access to specialized epilepsy care.
   Methods: This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed data from the
   California State Inpatient Sample, the State Ambulatory Surgery
   Database, and the State Emergency Department Database, that were linked
   with the 2009 Area Resource File and the location of the National
   Association of Epilepsy Center's epilepsy centers. The receipt of
   video-EEG monitoring was measured and used to indicate access to
   specialized epilepsy care in subjects with persistent seizures,
   identified as those who had frequent seizure-related hospital admissions
   and/or ER visits. A hierarchical logistic regression model was employed
   to assess barriers to high quality care at both individual and
   contextual levels.
   Results: Among 115,632 persons with persistent seizures, individuals who
   routinely received care in an area where epilepsy centers were located
   were more likely to have access to specialized epilepsy care (OR: 1.81,
   95% CI: 1.20, 2.72). Interestingly, the availability of epilepsy centers
   did not influence access to specialized epilepsy care in people who had
   private insurance. In contrast, uninsured individuals and those with
   public insurance programs including Medicaid and Medicare had
   significant gaps in access to specialized epilepsy care. Other
   individual characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and the presence
   of comorbid conditions were also associated with disparities in access
   to specialized care in PWE.
   Conclusion: Both individual and community characteristics play
   substantial roles in access to high quality epilepsy care. Policy
   interventions that incorporate strategies to address disparities at both
   levels are necessary to improve access to specialized care for PWE. (C)

   copayment was the primary outcome measure. Odds of attaining low-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) <100 mg/dL was the secondary outcome
   measure. Separate regression models for each income quintile were
   performed for each outcome measure, respectively. Results: A total of
   4748 patients were included in the analysis. Patients in quintiles two
   (-0.057, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.095 to -0.020) and three
   (-0.044, CI = -0.081 to -0.007) had statistically significant decreases
   in MPR associated with having a copayment versus not having a copayment.
   Quintiles two (odds ratio [OR] = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.47 to 0.98) and three
   (OR = 0.66; 95% CI = 0.45 to 0.96) also had lower odds of attaining LDL
   <100 mg/dL when having a copayment. Patients in higher earning quintiles
   (four and five) did not show any associations with copayment.
   Conclusion: In the veteran population studied, the association of statin
   copayment status with adherence varied by socioeconomic status.
   Middle-income and lower-middle-income patients were more likely to have
   adherence negatively influenced by having a copayment for statin
   therapy.

AB Cortisol's daytime rhythm is thought to be altered by aging and by
   exposure to chronic stress. However, measurement of an individual's
   usual cortisol rhythm is hampered by the effects of acute stressors, by
   differences between working days and weekends, by between-day variation
   in waking time and sleep duration, by variability in cortisol sampling
   times, and by possible variability in the timing of cortisol peak and
   nadir. Therefore, to determine differences in the usual daytime cortisol
   rhythm by age, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity, we measured
   salivary cortisol levels at four time-points, repeated over four days
   that included both weekdays and weekend days, in 1693 men and women from
   a national sample, and used three alternate growth curve specifications
   for the underlying cortisol rhythm (linear spline, quadratic spline,
   piece-wise linear-cubic) in order to minimize the impact of sample
   timing and other methodological issues. Model-predicted mean values of
   (and demographic and socioeconomic differences in) cortisol peak, nadir,
   and area under the curve (AUC) were nearly identical across model
   specifications. Older age and male gender were independently associated
   with higher cortisol peak, nadir, and AUC. Low education and minority
   race/ethnicity status were independently associated with lower cortisol
   peak and higher nadir, but were not associated with AUC. We also found
   significant cortisol peak and AUC associations with waking time, sleep
   duration, and workday vs. weekend day status, suggesting the importance
   of measuring these confounders and of collecting cortisol measurements
   over multiple days in research studies. We conclude that daytime
   cortisol levels are higher in older age and in men compared to women,
   and that the daytime cortisol rhythm is flatter (more blunted) in less
   privileged segments of society. Flattening of daytime cortisol rhythms
   may represent one mechanism by which social stressors lead to poor
   health outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In this article, we present results from a "cohort-longitudinal"
   analysis of sexual attitudes and behaviors based on a large sample of
   young adults (N = 7,777) obtained from a university setting over a
   23-year period. We investigated gender, ethnicity, and cohort
   differences in sexual permissiveness, endorsement of the double
   standard, and sociosexuality. Compared to women, men had more permissive
   attitudes, particularly about sex in casual relationships, endorsed the
   double standard to a greater degree, and had a more unrestricted
   sociosexuality. Black men were generally more permissive than White,
   Hispanic, and Asian men, whereas ethnic differences were not found among
   women. Participants from the 1995-1999 cohort were slightly less
   permissive than those from the 1990-1994 and 2005-2012 cohorts. Although
   prior meta-analytic studies (e.g., Petersen & Hyde, 2010) found reduced
   gender differences in sexuality over time, our cohort analyses suggest
   that gender differences in sexual permissiveness have not changed over
   the past two decades among college students.

AB Hooking up, or engaging in sexual interactions outside of committed
   relationships, has become increasingly common among college students.
   This study sought to identify predictors of sexual hookup behavior among
   first-year college women using a prospective longitudinal design. We
   used problem behavior theory (Jessor, 1991) as an organizing conceptual
   framework and examined risk and protective factors for hooking up from
   three domains: personality, behavior, and perceived environment.
   Participants (N = 483, 67 % White) completed an initial baseline survey
   that assessed risk and protective factors, and nine monthly follow-up
   surveys that assessed the number of hookups involving performing oral
   sex, receiving oral sex, and vaginal sex. Over the course of the school
   year, 20 % of women engaged in at least one hookup involving receiving
   oral sex, 25 % engaged in at least one hookup involving performing oral
   sex, and 25 % engaged in at least one hookup involving vaginal sex.
   Using two-part modeling with logistic and negative binomial regression,
   we identified predictors of hooking up. Risk factors for sexual hookups
   included hookup intentions, impulsivity, sensation-seeking, pre-college
   hookups, alcohol use, marijuana use, social comparison orientation, and
   situational triggers for hookups. Protective factors against sexual
   hookups included subjective religiosity, self-esteem, religious service
   attendance, and having married parents. Race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
   status, hookup attitudes, depression, cigarette smoking, academic
   achievement, injunctive norms, parental connectedness, and being in a
   romantic relationship were not consistent predictors of sexual hookups.
   Future research on hookups should consider the array of individual and
   social factors that influence this behavior.

AB Friends with benefits (FWB) relationships are formed by an integration
   of friendship and sexual intimacy, typically without the explicit
   commitments characteristic of an exclusive romantic relationship. The
   majority of these relationships do not transition into committed
   romantic relationships, raising questions about what happens to the
   relationship after the FWB ends. In a sample of 119 men and 189 women
   university students, with a median age of 19 years and the majority
   identified as Caucasian (63.6 %), we assessed relationship adjustment,
   feelings of deception, perception of the FWB relationship and
   friendship, social connectedness, psychological distress, and
   loneliness. Results demonstrated that the majority of FWB relationships
   continued as friendships after the sexual intimacy ceased and that about
   50 % of the participants reported feeling as close or closer to their
   FWB partner. Those who did not remain friends were more likely to report
   that their FWB relationship was more sex- than friendship-based; they
   also reported higher levels of feeling deceived by their FWB partner and
   higher levels of loneliness and psychological distress, but lower levels
   of mutual social connectedness. Higher levels of feeling deceived were
   related to feeling less close to the post-FWB friend; also, more
   sex-based FWB relationships were likely to result in post-FWB
   friendships that were either more or less close (as opposed to
   unchanged). FWB relationships, especially those that include more
   attention to friendship based intimacy, do not appear to negatively
   impact the quality of the friendship after the "with benefits" ends.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between
   homeless youths' HIV risk behaviors with strangers and risk and
   protective characteristics of their social networks. Data were from the
   Social Network and Homeless Youth Project. A total of 249 youth aged
   14-21 years were interviewed over 15 months in three Midwestern cities
   in the United States using a systematic sampling strategy. Multivariate
   results revealed that homeless youth with a greater average number of
   network members who engaged in more drug risk behaviors and who
   pressured them into precarious behaviors at least once were more likely
   to have participated in a greater number of HIV risk behaviors with
   strangers compared to homeless youth without such network
   characteristics. Additionally, 19-21 year olds, gay, lesbian, bisexual,
   and transgendered youth, and those who have run away from home more
   frequently, participated in more HIV risk behaviors with strangers than
   14-18 year olds, heterosexual youth, and those who have run away less
   often. The final model explained 43 % of the variance in homeless
   youths' HIV risk behaviors with strangers. It is important to identify
   network characteristics that are harmful to homeless youth because
   continued exposure to such networks and participation in dangerous
   behaviors may result in detrimental outcomes, including contraction of
   sexually transmitted infections and potentially HIV.

AB BACKGROUND: Although research has shown that low socio-economic status
   (SES) and minority communities have higher exposure to air pollution,
   few studies have simultaneously investigated the associations of
   individual and neighborhood SES with pollutants across multiple sites.
   OBJECTIVES: We characterized the distribution of ambient air pollution
   by both individual and neighborhood SES using spatial regression
   methods.
   METHODS: The study population comprised 6,140 participants from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Year 2000 annual average
   ambient PM2.5 and NOx concentrations were calculated for each study
   participant's home address at baseline examination. We investigated
   individual and neighborhood (2000 U. S. Census tract level) SES measures
   corresponding to the domains of income, wealth, education, and
   occupation. We used a spatial intrinsic conditional autoregressive model
   for multivariable analysis and examined pooled and metropolitan
   area-specific models.
   RESULTS: A 1-unit increase in the z-score for family income was
   associated with 0.03-mu g/m(3) lower PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.05, -0.01) and
   0.93% lower NOx (95% CI: -1.33, -0.53) after adjustment for covariates.
   A 1-SD-unit increase in the neighborhood's percentage of persons with at
   least a high school degree was associated with 0.47-mu g/m(3) lower mean
   PM2.5 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.40) and 9.61% lower NOx (95% CI: -10.85,
   -8.37). Metropolitan area-specific results exhibited considerable
   heterogeneity. For example, in New York, high-SES neighborhoods were
   associated with higher concentrations of pollution.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found statistically significant associations of SES
   measures with predicted air pollutant concentrations, demonstrating the
   importance of accounting for neighborhood-and individual-level SES in
   air pollution health effects research.

AB Recent studies suggest that allowing individuals to choose their
   partners can help to maintain cooperation in human social networks; this
   behaviour can supplement behavioural reciprocity, whereby humans are
   influenced to cooperate by peer pressure. However, it is unknown how the
   rate of forming and breaking social ties affects our capacity to
   cooperate. Here we use a series of online experiments involving 1,529
   unique participants embedded in 90 experimental networks, to show that
   there is a 'Goldilocks' effect of network dynamism on cooperation. When
   the rate of change in social ties is too low, subjects choose to have
   many ties, even if they attach to defectors. When the rate is too high,
   cooperators cannot detach from defectors as much as defectors re-attach
   and, hence, subjects resort to behavioural reciprocity and switch their
   behaviour to defection. Optimal levels of cooperation are achieved at
   intermediate levels of change in social ties.

AB Cities are implementing green infrastructure projects to provide
   ecosystem services such as storm water mitigation. The efficacy of these
   projects at providing services is rarely evaluated. Embedding research
   into project design provides a mechanism for both evaluation and
   development of the ecological knowledge needed to improve infrastructure
   for services provision. Ecologists must navigate the politics,
   economics, and social constraints of working in cities. Additional
   skills and practices are needed to develop new relationships and improve
   credibility, to define project roles, to identify new funding, and to
   integrate multidisciplinary knowledge. We examine a large-scale green
   infrastructure project that integrates hypothesis-driven experimental
   research and baseline monitoring with park design, implementation, and
   maintenance. Drawing on this case study, we recommend strategies to
   facilitate the inclusion of research ecologists in green infrastructure
   projects by enhancing the professional certification process,
   establishing research ecologists as consultants, and integrating ecology
   and design in graduate programs.

   Significant disparities exist in these environments, with profound and
   lasting impacts upon children's ultimate outcomes. Children from
   backgrounds of low socioeconomic status experience diminished language
   inputs and enter school at a disadvantage, with disparities persisting
   throughout their educational careers. Parents are positioned as powerful
   agents of change in their children's lives, however, and evidence
   indicates that parent-directed intervention is effective in improving
   child outcomes. This article explores the efficacy of parent-directed

AB In this article religion is viewed as a collectively produced good.
   Religious groups must, therefore, overcome collective action problems,
   namely, coordination. This problem is usually alleviated by entering
   into an agency relationship with an organizer whose job is to ensure
   efficient production of religious goods. This will lead to an increase
   in participation from congregants and an increase in quality of the
   religious goods. However, this relationship is open to the
   principal-agent problem. Using data from the American Congregational
   Giving Study this paper finds that the organizational structure of
   religious groups makes some groups more susceptible to principal-agent
   problems, which ultimately impacts participation levels.

   information about the social processes that may explain why neighborhood
   disadvantage affects college enrollment decisions. Drawing on William
   Wilson's (1987) framework and recent theorizing in urban sociology, we
   examine hypotheses about the explanatory role of neighborhood cultural
   heterogeneity in affecting college enrollment. We test three hypotheses
   derived from this literature using original data from a multilevel
   longitudinal sample of African American adolescents. Results revealed
   that cultural heterogeneity is an important neighborhood social process
   that affects adolescents' decisions about college, particularly in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods. We discuss the implications of the findings
   with regard to future empirical and theoretical research on neighborhood
   effects and youth attainment.

   and/or socioeconomic status (SES) are factors in treatment-seeking
   behavior.
   STUDY DESIGN: All data were collected from the National Institutes of
   Health-supported Boston Area Community Health Survey. SES was calculated
   by a 2-factor index that combined household income with years of
   education. Inferential statistics comprised 1-way analysis of variance,
   with a post hoc Scheffe test performed to evaluate whether there were
   differences between individual groups. A chi(2) test was used to
   evaluate whether distributions were equal among the various questions by
   race/ethnicity and SES category.
   RESULTS: A total of 3205 women were included in the analysis. Hispanic
   ethnicity and younger age were associated with POP (P < .002 and P <
   .001, respectively) as well as with seeking treatment for prolapse (P =
   .007 and P < .001, respectively). These factors were also associated
   with subsequent surgical repair (P = .027 and P = .019, respectively). A
   regression model showed that women were 4.9% more likely to seek
   treatment for every year younger they were, across the range of age.
   Although women of a higher SES were more likely to have POP, SES was
   neither associated with a higher likelihood of seeking treatment nor
   with the surgical management of prolapse.
   CONCLUSION: Hispanic ethnicity and younger age were associated with
   seeking treatment for POP. Hispanics were more likely than whites or
   blacks to proceed with surgical management. There was no correlation of
   SES with any of the above factors.

AB Social environmental conditions, particularly the experience of social
   adversity, have long been connected with health and mortality in humans
   and other social mammals. Efforts to identify the physiological basis
   for these effects have historically focused on their neurological,
   endocrinological, and immunological consequences. Recently, this search
   has been extended to understanding the role of gene regulation in
   sensing, mediating, and determining susceptibility to social
   environmental variation. Studies in laboratory rodents, captive
   primates, and human populations have revealed correlations between
   social conditions and the regulation of a large number of genes, some of
   which are likely causal. Gene expression responses to the social
   environment are, in turn, mediated by a set of underlying regulatory
   mechanisms, of which epigenetic marks are the best studied to date.
   Importantly, a number of genes involved in the response to the social
   environment are also associated with susceptibility to other external
   stressors, as well as certain diseases. Hence, gene regulatory studies
   are a promising avenue for understanding, and potentially developing
   strategies to address, the effects of social adversity on health.

AB Purpose of reviewIn 2010, an international consortium of researchers
   published a consensus agenda for research on psychosocial aspects of
   systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma). The present review summarizes
   recent research on SSc-related depression and anxiety, fatigue and
   sleep, pain, pruritus, body image distress, sexual function, work
   disability, healthcare needs, psychosocial interventions, and
   psychoneuroimmunology.Recent findingsResearchers have used structured
   interviews to establish prevalence rates for clinical mood disorders in
   SSc, although anxiety remains understudied and distress may be a useful
   outcome to consider. Longitudinal research has identified predictors of
   fatigue. Research on body image distress suggests the importance of
   changes in the facial skin and hands. Studies have identified sexual
   function problems in women and men with SSc. A prospective study found
   that breathing problems and fatigue predicted workplace disability. A
   randomized controlled trial evaluating multidisciplinary care showed
   benefits for health-related quality of life.SummaryThere has been a
   recent expansion in studies of psychosocial aspects of SSc, and in the
   validation of psychosocial measures that can be used in clinics to
   identify problems and track outcomes; however, prospective studies
   remain scarce. To better address the psychosocial needs of persons with
   SSc, interventions need to be developed and tested via randomized
   controlled trials with power to detect clinically meaningful changes.

AB This study examined adolescent coercive and prosocial resource control
   strategies in relation to various indices of peer-reported behaviors and
   peer regard (N = 384; 12-14 years). Coercive control was uniquely
   positively related to physical and relational aggression and peer
   disliking, and negatively to prosocial behaviors when controlling for
   prosocial control, which, in turn, was uniquely negatively related to
   physical aggression and social withdrawal, and positively to prosocial
   behaviors, peer liking, and popularity. Findings from person-centered
   analyses augmented these findings, indicating that bi-strategic,
   coercive, prosocial, typical, and non-controllers exhibit divergent
   patterns of social adjustment among peers. Implications for the study of
   adolescent social adjustment are discussed, including increased
   understanding of adolescent resource control and aggression among peers

AB Throughout the developing world, adolescents living in rural poverty

   data from the Gansu Survey of Children and Families, we adopt an
   approach grounded in resilience theory to investigate the relationship
   between cumulative adversity and internalizing problems among 1,659
   adolescents between the ages of 13 and 16 years in an interior Chinese
   province. We also investigate the compensatory roles of parental warmth
   and teacher support. Results of multivariate regression models suggest
   that internalizing problems increased in later adolescence in this
   sample. The rate of increase did not differ by gender, counter to most
   extant literature on sex differences in the developmental trajectory of
   internalizing problems. Along with parental warmth, teacher support
   emerged as an especially important compensatory factor, highlighting the
   significance of teachers as an often overlooked resource for poor rural
   adolescents.

AB Background: To characterize cross-cultural sleep patterns and sleep
   problems in a large sample of mothers of children (ages birth to 6
   years) in multiple predominantly Asian and predominantly Caucasian
   countries.
   Methods: Mothers of 10,085 young children (predominantly Asian
   countries/regions: China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Japan, Malaysia,
   Philippines, Singapore, Thailand; predominantly Caucasian countries:
   Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States) completed
   an internet-based expanded version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
   Index.
   Results: Mothers in predominantly Asian countries/regions had later
   bedtimes, decreased number and duration of night wakings, more nighttime
   sleep, and more total sleep than mothers from predominantly Caucasian
   countries, P < 0.001. More than half (54.7%) of mothers reported having
   poor sleep, ranging from 50.9% of mothers in Malaysia to 77.8% of
   mothers in Japan. Sleep disturbance symptoms were quite common,
   especially symptoms related to insomnia, and were more likely to be
   reported by mothers in predominantly Caucasian countries. However,
   psychosocial factors, including having children of a younger age, being
   unemployed, and having a lower education level were the best predictors
   of poor sleep, whereas culture was not a significant predictor.
   Conclusions: Overall, mothers in predominantly Asian countries/regions
   reported later bedtimes but sleeping better and longer than mothers from
   predominantly Caucasian countries, which is dissimilar to cross-cultural
   findings of young children. Psychosocial factors were found to be the
   best predictors of poor sleep, irrespective of culture. Further studies
   are needed to understand the impact of these findings.

   Using unobtrusive data, we test a series of hypotheses concerning the
   likelihood of attaining selected aspects of an ideal career including
   employment at a research-extensive institution, scholarly publications,
   tenure, grants, and disciplinary recognition. We find that having a
   white male instrumental advisor increases the likelihood of having an

   the advantage of having access to both types of mentoring when compared

   organizations and groups, creating new markets and new forms of economic
   enterprise that reshape the stratification order. A generation of
   research has estimated individual-level outcomes with income equations
   and mobility models, relying on broad assumptions about economic change.
   We redirect attention to the process of economic change that structures
   emerging markets. The process varies across market sectors, depending on
   the entity that is granted rights formerly exercised by state organs,
   and on the combination of rights they are granted. The transformation of
   three sectors in China-agriculture, steel manufacturing, and real
   estate-shows how different allocations of property rights alter the
   stratification order in strikingly different ways. Historical analysis
   of the evolution of markets and enterprises integrates insights from
   economic sociology into research on social stratification, providing a
   structural perspective on transitions from state socialism.

AB Background: Food environments may promote or undermine healthy
   behaviors, but questions remain regarding how individuals interact with
   their local food environments.
   Purpose: This study incorporated an urban food environment audit as well
   as an examination of residents' food shopping behaviors within that
   context.
   Methods: In 2010, the research team audited the variety and
   healthfulness of foods available in 373 Philadelphia stores, using the
   validated Nutrition Environment Measures Survey in Stores (NEMS-S);
   higher scores indicate more diverse and healthful food inventories. The
   team also surveyed urban residents (n=514) regarding their food
   shopping. Descriptive and multivariate analyses (conducted in 2012)
   assessed variation in retail food environments and in shoppers' store
   choices.
   Results: Corner and convenience stores were common (78.6% of food retail
   outlets) and had the lowest mean NEMS-S scores of any store type. Most
   participants (94.5%) did their primary food shopping at higher-scoring
   chain supermarkets, and the majority of participants did not shop at the
   supermarket closest to home. Supermarket offerings varied, with
   significantly fewer healthful foods at supermarkets closest to the homes
   of disadvantaged residents. In multivariate analyses, participants were
   significantly more likely to shop at supermarkets closest to home if
   those supermarkets had higher NEMS-S scores.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that, when possible, shoppers chose
   supermarkets that offered more variety and more healthful foods.
   Findings from this study also reinforce concern regarding unhealthy
   immediate food environments for disadvantaged residents, who
   disproportionately relied on nearby stores with more limited food items.
   Interventions to improve nutrition and health should address not only
   food store proximity but also diversity of healthful foods available.

AB Objective To identify the most influential factors on breastfeeding
   initiation in adolescent mothers in order to identify the highest risk
   population to focus education and support services.
   Study design Retrospective population-based cohort study of all
   non-anomalous live births in Ohio (2006-2007). Breastfeeding initiation
   rates were compared between adolescent mothers age <= 19 years and a
   reference group age >19 years. A multivariate logistic regression model
   assessed the association between breastfeeding initiation in adolescent
   mothers while adjusting for important concomitant risk factors including
   race, socioeconomic, demographic, prenatal, and delivery factors.
   Results Of 308 380 births during the study period, following exclusions
   there were 30 402 mothers <= 19 years of age (10.5% of study population)
   and 257 840 mothers age > 19 years. Of adolescent mothers, 44% initiated
   breastfeeding compared with 65% of older mothers, P <.001. Adolescents
   were 33% less likely to breastfeed after adjusting for important
   coexisting factors, adjusted relative risk 0.77 (95% CI 0.75-0.80).
   Socioeconomic factors had the most significant influence on
   breastfeeding initiation in adolescent mothers.
   Conclusion Adolescent mothers who have the least social support and are
   socioeconomically disadvantaged are the least likely to breastfeed their
   newborn infants. In addition, maternal perception, societal barriers,
   and a lack of prenatal intervention contribute unique barriers to
   breastfeeding in adolescence. Opportunities exist for school programs,
   baby-friendly hospitals, and postpartum education to improve
   breastfeeding rates in this population.

AB The importance of collective social action in current events is manifest
   in the Arab Spring and Occupy movements. Electronic social media have
   become a pervasive channel for social interactions, and a basis of
   collective social response to information. The study of social media can
   reveal how individual actions combine to become the collective dynamics
   of society. Characterizing the groups that form spontaneously may reveal
   both how individuals self-identify and how they will act together. Here
   we map the social, political, and geographical properties of
   news-sharing communities on Twitter, a popular microblogging platform.
   We track user-generated messages that contain links to New York Times
   online articles and we label users according to the topic of the links
   they share, their geographic location, and their self-descriptive
   keywords. When users are clustered based on who follows whom in Twitter,
   we find social groups separate by whether they are interested in local
   (NY), national (US) or global (cosmopolitan) issues. The national group
   subdivides into liberal, conservative and other, the latter being a
   diverse but mostly business oriented group with sports, arts, and other
   splinters. The national political groups are based across the US but are
   distinct from the national group that is broadly interested in a variety
   of topics. A person who is cosmopolitan associates with others who are
   cosmopolitan, and a US liberal/conservative associates with others who
   are US liberal/conservative, creating separated social groups with those
   identities. The existence of citizens of local, national, and
   cosmopolitan communities is a basis for dialog and action at each of
   these levels of societal organization. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Alcohol is usually consumed in social contexts. However, the drug has
   been studied mainly under socially isolated conditions, and our
   understanding of how social setting affects response to alcohol is
   limited.
   The current study compared the subjective, physiological, and behavioral
   effects of a moderate dose of alcohol in moderate social drinkers who
   were tested in either a social or an isolated context and in the
   presence of others who had or had not consumed alcohol.
   Healthy men and women were randomly assigned to either a social group
   tested in pairs (SOC; N = 24), or an isolated group tested individually
   (ISO; N = 20). They participated in four sessions, in which they
   received oral alcohol (0.8 g/kg) or placebo on two sessions each, in
   quasi-randomized order under double-blind conditions. In the SOC
   condition, the drug conditions of the co-participants were varied
   systematically: on two sessions, both participants received the same
   substance (placebo or alcohol) and on the other two sessions one
   received alcohol while the other received placebo. Cardiovascular
   measures, breath alcohol levels, and mood were assessed at regular
   intervals, and measures of social interaction were obtained in the SOC
   group.
   Alcohol produced greater effects on certain subjective measures in the
   SOC condition compared with the ISO condition, including feelings of
   intoxication and stimulation, but not on other measures such as feeling
   sedated or high, or on cardiovascular measures. Within the SOC
   condition, participants rated themselves as more intoxicated when their
   partner received alcohol, and paired subjects interacted more when at
   least one participant received alcohol.
   The presence of others enhances some of the subjective and behavioral
   effects of alcohol, especially the presence of another intoxicated
   individual. This enhancement of alcohol effects may explain, in part,
   why it is used in a social context.

AB Background and Purpose Socioeconomic status and acculturation may modify
   the association between ethnicity and hypertension treatment before
   stroke. We assessed prestroke treatment of hypertension by ethnicity,
   education (proxy for socioeconomic status), and English proficiency (EP;
   proxy for acculturation) in a population-based stroke surveillance
   project.
   Methods Among 763 patients with first-ever stroke aged 45 years in the
   Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi project from 2000 to 2006,
   we examined self-reported hypertension treatment at the time of the
   stroke by ethnicity (Mexican American [MA] versus non-Hispanic white
   [NHW]) in the overall sample, within education strata (<high school,
   high school, >high school), and after dichotomizing MAs by self-reported
   EP (limited versus proficient). Logistic regression adjusted
   associations for age, sex, education, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery
   disease, hypercholesterolemia, and health insurance.
   Results NHWs and MAs reported similar hypertension treatment (84% versus
   86%; P=0.53). Hypertension treatment was 84% for NHWs and 90% for MAs
   (P=0.18) in <high school stratum, 87% for NHWs and 75% for MAs (P=0.07)
   in high school stratum, and 81% for NHWs and 78% for MAs (P=0.73) in
   >high school stratum (ethnicity-by-education interaction, P=0.09).
   Hypertension treatment was 83% for NHWs, 87% for MAs with EP
   (P-vsNHWs=0.35), and 90% for MAs with limited EP (P-vsNHWs=0.13;
   ethnicity-by-EP interaction, P=0.22). Hypertension treatment was lower
   in uninsured patients (adjusted odds ratio, 0.13; 95% confidence
   interval, 0.03-0.60) or those with no physician visit 6 months (adjusted
   odds ratio, 0.09; 95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.24).
   Conclusions We found no evidence that socioeconomic status or
   acculturation modifies the association between ethnicity and
   hypertension treatment before stroke.

   globalized modernity, represented primarily by NGOs and the global human

   religions that are the most modernizing, as they directly counter the
   power of traditional kin obligations (and the overwhelming dangers of
   witchcraft), while the purportedly modern and secular NGOs practice a
   ritualized version of modernity, even as they are penetrated by the

   des obligations familiales traditionnelles (et aux immenses dangers que
   recele la sorcellerie), tandis que les ONG, pretendument modernes et

   Resumen Este articulo compara tres grandes tradiciones en conflicto que
   organizan los patrones de autoridad, comunidad y cooperacion en el
   africa contemporanea: las religiones axiales (Cristianismo e Islam); los
   sistemas caciquiles indigenas organizados en torno a la figura del jefe,
   el linaje y el clan; y la modernidad globalizada, representada
   principalmente por las ONGs y la agenda mundial de los derechos humanos.
   El articulo sostiene que, en muchos aspectos son las religiones axiales
   las mas modernizadoras, ya que contrapesan directamente el poder de las
   obligaciones de parentesco tradicionales (y los abrumadores peligros de
   la brujeria), mientras que las ONGs supuestamente modernas y seculares
   practican una version ritualizada de la modernidad, en la medida en que
   estan penetradas por las normas y practicas del sistema caciquil basado
   en el parentesco y su sistema afin de relaciones de clientelismo.

AB Background: Multivariate studies of specific suicide means are
   relatively rare, given the logistical challenges associated with the low
   base rate of suicide in the general population. Thus, information on
   individual characteristics associated with specific suicide means
   remains relatively wanting. The current study provided the largest
   examination to date of sociodemographic characteristics associated with
   different means of lethality among suicide decedents, using data from a
   multi-state population-based surveillance system.
   Methods: Multivariate logistic regression was used with data for 20,577
   suicide decedents in the National Violent Death Reporting System from
   2003 to 2005.
   Results: Firearm decedents were more likely male, elderly, non-Hispanic
   white, married, veterans, and born in the U.S. Hanging and suffocation
   decedents were more likely male, young, racial/ethnic minorities, never
   married, non-veterans, and foreign-born. Decedents that jumped from
   heights were more likely female, older, non-Hispanic black, never
   married, non-veterans, and foreign-born. Decedents who used sharp
   instruments were more likely older, never married, and foreign-born.
   Self-poisoned decedents were more likely female, middle-age,
   non-Hispanic white, and not married. Regarding specific poisons, alcohol
   was more likely to be used by middle-age decedents; gas by males,
   elderly, and married individuals; over-the-counter drugs by females,
   adolescents, and foreign-born decedents; prescription drugs by females,
   middle-aged, and U.S. born individuals; and street drugs by males and
   racial/ethnic minorities.
   Limitations: The data were drawn from 18 states and so cannot be
   regarded as nationally representative.
   Conclusions: Substantial sociodemographic variability exists across
   different suicide means. Recognition of this variability may help to
   tailor prevention efforts involving means restriction. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Patient navigator (PN) programs can improve breast cancer screening in
   low income, ethnic/racial minorities. Refugee women have low breast
   cancer screening rates, but it has not been shown that PN is similarly
   effective.
   Evaluate whether a PN program for refugee women decreases disparities in
   breast cancer screening.
   Retrospective program evaluation of an implemented intervention.
   Women who self-identified as speaking Somali, Arabic, or Serbo-Croatian
   (Bosnian) and were eligible for breast cancer screening at an urban
   community health center (HC). Comparison groups were English-speaking
   and Spanish-speaking women eligible for breast cancer screening in the
   same HC.
   Patient navigators educated women about breast cancer screening,
   explored barriers to screening, and tailored interventions individually
   to help complete screening.
   Adjusted 2-year mammography rates from logistic regression models for
   each calendar year accounting for clustering by primary care physician.
   Rates in refugee women were compared to English-speaking and
   Spanish-speaking women in the year before implementation of the PN
   program and over its first 3 years.
   There were 188 refugee (36 Somali, 48 Arabic, 104 Serbo-Croatian
   speaking), 2,072 English-speaking, and 2,014 Spanish-speaking women
   eligible for breast cancer screening over the 4-year study period. In
   the year prior to implementation of the program, adjusted mammography
   rates were lower among refugee women (64.1 %, 95 % CI: 49-77 %) compared
   to English-speaking (76.5 %, 95 % CI: 69 %-83 %) and Spanish-speaking
   (85.2 %, 95 % CI: 79 %-90 %) women. By the end of 2011, screening rates
   increased in refugee women (81.2 %, 95 % CI: 72 %-88 %), and were
   similar to the rates in English-speaking (80.0 %, 95 % CI: 73 %-86 %)
   and Spanish-speaking (87.6 %, 95 % CI: 82 %-91 %) women. PN increased
   screening rates in both younger and older refugee women.
   Linguistically and culturally tailored PN decreased disparities over
   time in breast cancer screening among female refugees from Somalia, the
   Middle East and Bosnia.

AB Ecoimmunologists strive to understand how ecology and evolution shape
   immunity in natural populations. To date, ecoimmunologists have
   sometimes struggled to find measures of immunity that can be easily
   performed in nonmodel systems. One exception is variation in rates of
   cutaneous wound healing, which is a functionally important, integrative
   measure of immunity that combines cell-mediated, inflammatory and even
   some Th2-mediated processes. Here I review what is known about sources
   of variation in wound healing in wild populations, focusing on two key
   ecoimmunological questions: How and when does the stress response
   influence immune function? And how do energetic trade-offs alter
   immunity? The results indicate that stress and energetic costs can
   suppress wound healing, but the effects depend on individuals' social
   and abiotic environments. I also discuss methods to measure wound
   healing in natural populations and useful directions for future
   research. Because wound healing has functional significance to
   organisms, can be measured in diverse species and integrates several
   immune processes, this measure of immunity is an especially valuable
   member of the ecoimmunological toolkit.

AB Many college students use alcohol, and most of these students experience
   problems related to their use. Emerging research indicates that socially
   anxious students face heightened risk of experiencing alcohol-related
   problems, although the extant research on alcohol use and social anxiety
   in this population has yielded inconsistent findings. This meta-analysis
   was conducted to examine the relationship between social anxiety and
   alcohol variables in college students. A literature search was used to
   identify studies on college students that included measures of social
   anxiety and at least one of the alcohol variables of interest. All
   analyses were conducted using random effects models. We found that
   social anxiety was negatively correlated with alcohol use variables
   (e.g., typical quantity and typical frequency), but significantly
   positively correlated with alcohol-related problems, coping, conformity,
   and social motives for alcohol use, and positive and negative alcohol
   outcome expectancies. Several moderators of effect sizes were found to
   be significant, including methodological factors such as sample
   ascertainment approach. Given that social anxiety was negatively related
   to alcohol use but positively related to alcohol-related problems,
   research is needed to address why individuals high in social anxiety
   experience more problems as a result of their alcohol use. Avoidance of
   social situations among socially anxious students should also be taken
   into account when measuring alcohol use. The primary limitation of this
   study is the small number of studies available for inclusion in some of
   the analyses. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Previous research has documented disparities in smoking
   cessation between African Americans and Caucasians. Many low-income
   African American smokers face a range of circumstances that may inhibit
   effective coping during quit attempts, yet previous research has not
   considered factors that influence coping in this population. This study
   examined (a) affect (positive and negative) and (b) perceived social
   support in association with coping strategies.
   Methods: The baseline assessment of African American smokers (N = 168)
   enrolled in a randomized controlled trial included the Positive and
   Negative Affect Schedule, the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social
   Support, and the Brief COPE. A factor analysis of the Brief COPE
   resulted in two factors, adaptive and maladaptive strategies.
   Results: Participants were mostly single (64%), women (61%), with >= 12
   years of education (68%), and low-income. They were middle aged (M =
   46.1, SD = 8.7), smoked 21.8 (SD = 133) cigarettes/day for 243 (SD = 11)
   years, and were moderately nicotine dependent. Results demonstrated that
   adaptive coping was positively correlated with positive affect and
   social support. Maladaptive coping was positively correlated with
   negative affect, and inversely related to positive affect and social
   support Multivariate analyses revealed that positive affect and social
   support were independently associated with adaptive coping strategies.
   In contrast, maladaptive coping was independently associated with
   negative affect, but not social support.
   Conclusions: Interventions that harness positive resources, such as
   social support and positive mood, may facilitate adaptive coping. Also,
   addressing negative affect among low-income African American smokers may
   be important to reduce maladaptive coping strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB The practice of waterpipe smoking (hookah) has rapidly increased in
   popularity among young adults yet burgeoning research suggests that its
   use is associated with nicotine dependence and other negative
   smoking-related health consequences. Moreover, descriptive studies
   indicate that consumers may hold the belief that hookah smoking is safer
   than smoking cigarettes. The current study extended previous work by
   conducting a comprehensive assessment of patterns and contexts of hookah
   use, psychological correlates of use, co-occurring substance use as well
   as social norms and health perceptions surrounding the practice.
   Participants were 143 ethnically diverse undergraduate students at a
   large urban US university. Approximately half of the sample (48%)
   reported life-time use of hookah and 22% reported use within the past 30
   days. Relative to cigarette smoking, hookah smoking was associated with
   less perceived harm and addiction potential and higher social approval.
   Participants who reported life-time hookah use, as compared to those who
   did not, perceived less associated harm, had a greater number of friends
   who had tried and approved of hookah, were more likely to use
   cigarettes, marijuana, and alcohol and in higher frequencies and
   quantities and were at higher risk for problem tobacco and alcohol use.
   Among participants who were not current smokers, those with hookah
   experience were more likely to endorse intent to try a cigarette soon.
   Hookah users did not differ from non-users on measures of trait anxiety,
   depression and impulsivity though they were more likely to drink alcohol
   for coping, social and enhancement purposes than non-users. Implications
   are discussed for public health initiatives to educate young adults
   about the potential consequences of hookah smoking. Published by

AB Malaria is a major cause of under-five mortality in Mali and many other
   developing countries. Malaria control programmes rely on households to
   identify sick children and either care for them in the home or seek
   treatment at a health facility in the case of severe illness. This study
   examines the involvement of mothers and other household members in
   identifying and treating severely ill children through case studies of
   25 rural Malian households. A wide range of intra-household responses to
   severe illness were observed among household members, both exemplifying
   and contravening stated social norms about household roles. Given their
   close contact with children, mothers were frequently the first to
   identify illness symptoms. However, decisions about care-seeking were
   often taken by fathers and senior members of the household. As stewards
   of the family resources, fathers usually paid for care and thus
   significantly determined when and where treatment was sought.
   Grandparents were frequently involved in diagnosing illnesses and
   directing care towards traditional healers or health facilities.
   Relationships between household members during the illness episode were
   found to vary from highly collaborative to highly conflictive, with
   critical effects on how quickly and from where treatment for sick
   children was sought. These findings have implications for the design and
   targeting of malaria and child survival programming in the greater West
   African region.

AB This paper investigates whether ethnic diversity at the Demographic and
   Health Surveys (DHS) cluster level predicts HIV serostatus in three
   sub-Saharan African countries (Kenya, Malawi and Zambia), using DHS
   household survey and HIV biomarker data for men and women aged 15-59
   collected since 2006. The analysis relates a binary dependent variable
   (HIV positive serostatus) and a weighted aggregate predictor variable
   representing the number of different ethnic groups within a DHS
   Statistical Enumeration Area (SEA) or cluster, which roughly corresponds
   to a neighbourhood. Multilevel logistic regression is used to predict
   HIV prevalence within each SEA, controlling for known demographic,
   social and behavioural predictors of HIV serostatus. The key finding was
   that the cluster-level ethnic diversity measure was a significant
   predictor of HIV serostatus in Malawi and Zambia but not in Kenya.
   Additional results reflected the heterogeneity of the epidemics: male
   gender, marriage (Kenya), number of extramarital partners in the past
   year (Kenya and Malawi, but probably confounded with younger age) and
   Muslim religion (Zambia) were associated with lower odds of positive HIV
   serostatus. Condom use at last intercourse (a spurious result probably
   reflecting endogeneity), STD in the past year, number of lifetime sexual
   partners, age (Malawi and Zambia), education (Zambia), urban residence
   (Malawi and Zambia) and employment (Kenya and Malawi) were associated
   with higher odds of positive serostatus. Future studies might continue
   to employ multilevel models and incorporate additional, more robust,
   controls for individual behavioural risk factors and for higher-level
   social and economic factors, in order to verify and further clarify the
   association between neighbourhood ethnic diversity and HIV serostatus.

AB Humans have a cross-cultural tendency to attach strong social meanings
   to visually prominent landforms. The ability to identify prominent
   landforms is thus important for understanding how people perceive and
   relate to a landscape. This is particularly true for historical
   landscapes, where the relationship between viewer location and view may
   be one of the few recoverable elements available to reconstruct
   landscape meaning. Quantifying prominence, however, is a methodological
   and conceptual challenge, especially if prominence is to be measured
   from particular ground locations rather than from a planar view. An
   approach is suggested using a line simplification technique borrowed
   from cartography that is repurposed to identify prominent points on a
   horizon line. By combining prominence values with information on the
   number of viewers present in different vantage points at different
   points in time, it is possible to reconstruct a visual prominence
   history for landforms in a region. This approach provides some
   quantitative rigor to phenomenological approaches that can be overly
   descriptive and insufficiently transparent. A case study from the
   American Southwest demonstrates the utility of the method. (C) 2013

   critique of the technical literature and application of fire safety in

   wildfire. Rather than focus on the success or failure of SIP, I am
   situating the SIP within the context of architecture, the history of
   fire safety, and the push of neoliberalism. The purpose of this approach
   is to make SIP and fire safe home design less about technology and

AB Despite the prevalence of poverty worldwide, little is known about how
   early socioeconomic adversity affects auditory brain function.
   Socioeconomically disadvantaged children are underexposed to
   linguistically and cognitively stimulating environments and overexposed
   to environmental toxins, including noise pollution. This kind of sensory
   impoverishment, we theorize, has extensive repercussions on how the
   brain processes sound. To characterize how this impoverishment affects
   auditory brain function, we compared two groups of normal-hearing human
   adolescents who attended the same schools and who were matched in age,
   sex, and ethnicity, but differed in their maternal education level, a
   correlate of socioeconomic status (SES). In addition to lower literacy
   levels and cognitive abilities, adolescents from lower maternal
   education backgrounds were found to have noisier neural activity than
   their classmates, as reflected by greater activity in the absence of
   auditory stimulation. Additionally, in the lower maternal education
   group, the neural response to speech was more erratic over repeated
   stimulation, with lower fidelity to the input signal. These weaker, more
   variable, and noisier responses are suggestive of an inefficient
   auditory system. By studying SES within a neuroscientific framework, we
   have the potential to expand our understanding of how experience molds
   the brain, in addition to informing intervention research aimed at
   closing the achievement gap between high-SES and low-SES children.

AB The last decades of neuroscience research have produced immense progress
   in the methods available to understand brain structure and function.
   Social, cognitive, clinical, affective, economic, communication, and
   developmental neurosciences have begun to map the relationships between
   neuro-psychological processes and behavioral outcomes, yielding a new
   understanding of human behavior and promising interventions. However, a
   limitation of this fast moving research is that most findings are based
   on small samples of convenience. Furthermore, our understanding of
   individual differences may be distorted by unrepresentative samples,
   undermining findings regarding brain-behavior mechanisms. These
   limitations are issues that social demographers, epidemiologists, and
   other population scientists have tackled, with solutions that can be
   applied to neuroscience. By contrast, nearly all social science
   disciplines, including social demography, sociology, political science,
   economics, communication science, and psychology, make assumptions about
   processes that involve the brain, but have incorporated neural measures
   to differing, and often limited, degrees; many still treat the brain as
   a black box. In this article, we describe and promote a
   perspective-population neuroscience-that leverages interdisciplinary
   expertise to (i) emphasize the importance of sampling to more clearly
   define the relevant populations and sampling strategies needed when
   using neuroscience methods to address such questions; and (ii) deepen
   understanding of mechanisms within population science by providing
   insight regarding underlying neural mechanisms. Doing so will increase
   our confidence in the generalizability of the findings. We provide
   examples to illustrate the population neuroscience approach for specific
   types of research questions and discuss the potential for theoretical
   and applied advances from this approach across areas.

AB In most professional sports, playing field structure is kept neutral so
   that scoring imbalances may be attributed to differences in team skill.
   It thus remains unknown what impact environmental heterogeneities can
   have on scoring dynamics or competitive advantages. Applying a novel
   generative model of scoring dynamics to roughly 10 million team
   competitions drawn from an online game, we quantify the relationship
   between the structure within a competition and its scoring dynamics,
   while controlling the impact of chance. Despite wide structural
   variations, we observe a common three-phase pattern in the tempo of
   events. Tempo and balance are highly predictable from a competition's
   structural features alone and teams exploit environmental
   heterogeneities for sustained competitive advantage. Surprisingly, the
   most balanced competitions are associated with specific environmental
   heterogeneities, not from equally skilled teams. These results shed new
   light on the design principles of balanced competition, and illustrate
   the potential of online game data for investigating social dynamics and
   competition.

AB Research has shown that individuals have an optimal walking speed-a
   speed which minimizes energy expenditure for a given distance. Because
   the optimal walking speed varies with mass and lower limb length, it
   also varies with sex, with males in any given population tending to have
   faster optimal walking speeds. This potentially creates an energetic
   dilemma for mixed-sex walking groups. Here we examine speed choices made
   by individuals of varying stature, mass, and sex walking together.
   Individuals (N = 22) walked around a track alone, with a significant
   other (with and without holding hands), and with friends of the same and
   opposite sex while their speeds were recorded every 100 m. Our findings
   show that males walk at a significantly slower pace to match the
   females' paces (p = 0.009), when the female is their romantic partner.
   The paces of friends of either same or mixed sex walking together did
   not significantly change (p > 0.05). Thus significant pace adjustment
   appears to be limited to romantic partners. These findings have
   implications for both mobility and reproductive strategies of groups.
   Because the male carries the energetic burden by adjusting his pace
   (slowing down 7%), the female is spared the potentially increased
   caloric cost required to walk together. In energetically demanding
   environments, we will expect to find gender segregation in group
   composition, particularly when travelling longer distances.

AB Aims: Central nervous system (CNS) malignancies and/or their treatment
   in pediatric cancer survivors are known to be associated with deficits
   in neuropsychological functions. We report findings from a nation-wide
   study of childhood cancer survivors to investigate intelligence and
   attention/concentration from a multi-dimensional perspective in a
   diverse sample from this population.
   Main methods: Four hundred forty-four pediatric cancer survivors between
   6 and 17 years of age, who had suffered CNS involvement associated with
   their malignancy, were evaluated. All patients completed a measure of
   general intelligence. Attention was measured by a continuous performance
   test (CPT) and by parental report using a standardized psychological
   inventory.
   Key findings: Social economic status (SES) was a significant predictor
   of intellectual functioning and scores on independent measures of
   attention. After controlling for SES, cranial radiation therapy (CRT)
   was strongly predictive of impairments in intellectual functioning.
   Patients who had completed a transplant procedure did not have
   significant impairments in intellectual functioning when compared to
   other participants. CPT performance was most clearly influenced by a
   younger age at diagnosis and the presence of a supratentorial brain
   tumor. Reaction time was lower in patients who had received CRT. Gender
   did not correlate with CPT performance, but caregiver reports of
   deficits in attentional functioning were more prevalent in girls
   compared to boys.
   Significance: These findings are important given the large,
   representative sample and multi-dimensional assessment of attentional
   functioning. The presence of a very strong SES effect on all dependent
   variables must be addressed in studies of this nature. (C) 2013

AB Men who have sex with men (MSM) accounted for 61% of new HIV diagnoses
   in the United States in 2010. Recent analyses indicate that
   socio-structural factors are important correlates of HIV infection.
   NYCM2M was a cross-sectional study designed to identify
   neighborhood-level characteristics within the urban environment that
   influence sexual risk behaviors, substance use and depression among MSM
   living in New York City. The sample was recruited using a modified
   venue-based time-space sampling methodology and through select websites
   and mobile applications. This paper describes novel methodological
   approaches used to improve the quality of data collected for analysis of
   the impact of neighborhoods on MSM health. Previous research has focused
   predominately on residential neighborhoods and used pre-determined
   administrative boundaries (e. g., census tracts) that often do not
   reflect authentic and meaningful neighborhoods. This study included the
   definition and assessment of multiple neighborhoods of influence
   including where men live (home neighborhood), socialize (social
   neighborhood) and have sex (sexual neighborhood). Furthermore, making
   use of technological advances in mapping, we collected geo-points of
   reference for each type of neighborhood and identified and constructed
   self-identified neighborhood boundary definitions. Finally, this study
   collected both perceived neighborhood characteristics and objective
   neighborhood conditions to create a comprehensive, flexible and rich
   neighborhood-level set of covariates. This research revealed that men
   perceived their home, social and sexual neighborhoods in different ways.
   Few men (15%) had the same home, social and sexual neighborhoods; for
   31%, none of the neighborhoods was the same. Of the three types of
   neighborhoods, the number of unique social neighborhoods was the lowest;
   the size of sexual neighborhoods was the smallest. The resultant dataset
   offers the opportunity to conduct analyses that will yield
   context-specific and nuanced understandings of the relations among
   neighborhood space, and the well-being and health of urban MSM.

AB Background: Early brain overgrowth (EBO) in autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) is among the best replicated biological associations in
   psychiatry. Most positive reports have compared head circumference (HC)
   in ASD (an excellent proxy for early brain size) with well-known
   reference norms. We sought to reappraise evidence for the EBO hypothesis
   given 1) the recent proliferation of longitudinal HC studies in ASD, and
   2) emerging reports that several of the reference norms used to define
   EBO in ASD may be biased toward detecting HC overgrowth in contemporary
   samples of healthy children.
   Methods: Systematic review of all published HC studies in children with
   ASD. Comparison of 330 longitudinally gathered HC measures between birth
   and 18 months from male children with autism (n = 35) and typically
   developing control subjects (n = 22).
   Results: In systematic review, comparisons with locally recruited
   control subjects were significantly less likely to identify EBO in ASD
   than norm-based studies (p < .001). Through systematic review and
   analysis of new data, we replicate seminal reports of EBO in ASD
   relative to classical HC norms but show that this overgrowth relative to
   norms is mimicked by patterns of HC growth age in a large contemporary
   community-based sample of US children (n similar to 75,000). Controlling
   for known HC norm biases leaves inconsistent support for a subtle, later
   emerging and subgroup specific pattern of EBO in clinically ascertained
   ASD versus community control subjects.
   Conclusions: The best-replicated aspects of EBO reflect generalizable HC
   norm biases rather than disease-specific biomarkers. The potential HC
   norm biases we detail are not specific to ASD research but apply
   throughout clinical and academic medicine.

AB Human body odors have important communicative functions regarding
   genetic identity, immune fitness and general health, but an expanding
   body of research suggests they can also communicate information about an
   individual's emotional state. In the current study, we tested whether
   axillary odors obtained from women experiencing psychosocial stress
   could negatively influence personality judgments of warmth and
   competence made about other women depicted in video scenarios. 44 female
   donors provided three types of sweat samples: untreated exercise sweat,
   untreated stress sweat and treated stress sweat. After a 'washout'
   period, a commercial unscented anti-perspirant product was applied to
   the left axilla only to evaluate whether 'blocking' the stress signal
   would improve the social evaluations. A separate group of male and
   female evaluators (n = 120) rated the women in the videos while smelling
   one of the three types of sweat samples. Women in the video scenes were
   rated as being more stressed by both men and women when smelling the
   untreated vs. treated stress sweat. For men only, the women in the
   videos were rated as less confident, trustworthy and competent when
   smelling both the untreated stress and exercise sweat in contrast to the
   treated stress sweat. Women's social judgments were unaffected by
   sniffing the pads. The results have implications for influencing
   multiple types of professional and personal social interactions and
   impression management and extend our understanding of the social
   communicative function of body odors.

AB The short ontogenetic time courses of conformity and stereotyping, both
   evident in the preschool years, point to the possibility that a central
   component of human social cognition is an early developing expectation
   that social group members will engage in common behaviors. Across a
   series of experiments, we show that by 7 months of age preverbal infants
   differentiate between actions by individuals that are and are not
   consistent with the actions of their social group members. Infants
   responded to group-inconsistent actions only in a social context: they
   failed to distinguish the same behavioral differences when presented
   with collections of nonsocial agents or inanimate objects. These results
   suggest that infants expect social group membership and behavior to
   covary, before extensive intergroup experience or linguistic input. This
   expectation is consistent with the socially motivated imitation and
   stereotyping evident in toddlers and preschoolers, and may play a role
   in the early emergence of one or both of these aspects of social
   behavior and cognition.

AB Background: As antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV becomes increasingly
   available in low and middle income countries (LMICs), understanding
   reasons for lack of adherence is critical to stemming the tide of
   infections and improving health. Understanding the effect of
   psychosocial experiences and mental health symptomatology on ART
   adherence can help maximize the benefit of expanded ART programs by
   indicating types of services, which could be offered in combination with
   HIV care.
   Methodology: The Coping with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania (CHAT) study is a
   longitudinal cohort study in the Kilimanjaro Region that included
   randomly selected HIV-infected (HIV+) participants from two local
   hospital-based HIV clinics and four freestanding voluntary HIV
   counselling and testing sites. Baseline data were collected in 2008 and
   2009; this paper used data from 36 month follow-up interviews (N = 468).
   Regression analyses were used to predict factors associated with
   incomplete self-reported adherence to ART.
   Results: Incomplete ART adherence was significantly more likely to be
   reported amongst participants who experienced a greater number of
   childhood traumatic events: sexual abuse prior to puberty and the death
   in childhood of an immediate family member not from suicide or homicide
   were significantly more likely in the non-adherent group and other
   negative childhood events trended toward being more likely. Those with
   incomplete adherence had higher depressive symptom severity and
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In multivariable analyses,
   childhood trauma, depression, and financial sacrifice remained
   associated with incomplete adherence.
   Discussion: This is the first study to examine the effect of childhood
   trauma, depression and PTSD on HIV medication adherence in a low income
   country facing a significant burden of HIV. Allocating spending on
   HIV/AIDS toward integrating mental health services with HIV care is
   essential to the creation of systems that enhance medication adherence
   and maximize the potential of expanded antiretroviral access to improve
   health and reduce new infections.

AB Researchers have identified environmental risks that predict subsequent
   psychological and medical problems. Based on these correlational
   findings, researchers have developed and tested complex developmental
   models and have examined biological moderating factors (e.g.,
   gene-environment interactions).
   In this context, we stress the critical need for researchers to use
   family-based, quasi-experimental designs when trying to integrate
   genetic and social science research involving environmental variables
   because these designs rigorously examine causal inferences by testing
   competing hypotheses.
   We argue that sibling comparison, offspring of twins or siblings, in
   vitro fertilization designs, and other genetically informed approaches
   play a unique role in bridging gaps between basic biological and social
   science research. We use studies on maternal smoking during pregnancy to
   exemplify these principles.

AB Advances in stress physiology and molecular dynamics can illuminate

   socially structured, repeated stress process activation can accumulate
   and increase disease vulnerability across the life course in

   (DOHaD) hypothesis focuses on youthful programming for later life
   disease via epigenetic modifications to limiting uterine or early
   environments. Weathering and DOHaD are overlapping biopsychosocial
   models; yet, their emphases and implications vary. Evidence for the
   primacy of early development over experiences in young through middle
   adulthood for explaining population health inequality is lacking. By
   considering weathering and DOHaD together, we call for biomedical
   researchers to be more cautious in their claims about the social world
   and for a broader range of social researchers-including qualitative
   ones-to collaborate with them.

AB Recent analyses have discovered broad alterations in the expression of
   human genes across different social environments. The emerging field of
   social genomics has begun to identify the types of genes sensitive to
   social regulation, the biological signaling pathways mediating these
   effects, and the genetic polymorphisms that modify their individual
   impact. The human genome appears to have evolved specific "social
   programs" to adapt molecular physiology to the changing patterns of
   threat and opportunity ancestrally associated with changing social
   conditions. In the context of the immune system, this programming now
   fosters many of the diseases that dominate public health. The embedding
   of individual genomes within a broader metagenomic network provides a

   gender incorporated into research on genetics and health? Second, how
   might social science understandings of sex and gender, and gender
   differences in health, become more integrated into scholarship in this
   area? We review articles on genetics and health published in selected
   peer-reviewed journals. Although sex is included frequently as a control
   or stratifying variable, few articles articulate a conceptual frame or
   methodological justification for conducting research in this way, and
   most are not motivated by sex or gender differences in health. Gender
   differences in health are persistent, unexplained, and shaped by
   multilevel social factors. Future scholarship on genetics and health
   needs to incorporate more systematic attention to sex and gender, gender
   as an environment, and the intertwining of social and biological
   variation over the life course. Such integration will advance
   understandings of gender differences in health, and may yield insight
   regarding the processes and circumstances that make genomic variation
   relevant for health and well-being.

AB Recent research has suggested that the social environment can moderate
   the expression of genetic influences on health and that genetic
   influences can shape an individual's sensitivity to the social
   environment. Evidence supports 4 major mechanisms: genes can influence
   an individual's response to environmental stress, genes may enhance an
   individual's sensitivity to both favorable and adverse environments,
   inherited characteristics may better fit with some environments than
   with others, and inherited capabilities may only become manifest in
   challenging or responsive environments. Further progress depends on
   better recognition of patterns of gene-environment interaction, improved
   methods of assessing the environment and its impact on genetic
   mechanisms, the use of appropriately designed laboratory studies,
   identification of heritable differences in an individual before
   environmental moderation occurs, and clarification of the timing of the
   impact of social and genetic moderation.

AB By 2050, nearly 1 in 5 Americans (19%) will be an immigrant, including
   Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians, compared to the 1 in 8 (12%) in 2005.
   They will vary in the extent to which they are at risk for mental health
   disorders. Given this increase in cultural diversity within the United
   States and costly population health disparities across cultural groups,
   it is essential to develop a more comprehensive understanding of how
   culture affects basic psychological and biological mechanisms. We
   examine these basic mechanisms that underlie population disparities in
   mental health through cultural neuroscience. We discuss the challenges
   to and opportunities for cultural neuroscience research to determine
   sociocultural and biological factors that confer risk for and resilience
   to mental health disorders across the globe.

AB Objectives. We examined depression within a multidimensional framework
   consisting of genetic, environmental, and sociobehavioral factors and,
   using machine learning algorithms, explored interactions among these
   factors that might better explain the etiology of depressive symptoms.
   Methods. We measured current depressive symptoms using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (n = 6378 participants in the
   Wisconsin Longitudinal Study). Genetic factors were 78 single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs); environmental factors-13 stressful life events
   (SLEs), plus a composite proportion of SLEs index; and sociobehavioral
   factors-18 personality, intelligence, and other health or behavioral
   measures. We performed traditional SNP associations via logistic
   regression likelihood ratio testing and explored interactions with
   support vector machines and Bayesian networks.
   Results. After correction for multiple testing, we found no significant
   single genotypic associations with depressive symptoms. Machine learning
   algorithms showed no evidence of interactions. Naive Bayes produced the
   best models in both subsets and included only environmental and
   sociobehavioral factors.
   Conclusions. We found no single or interactive associations with genetic
   factors and depressive symptoms. Various environmental and
   sociobehavioral factors were more predictive of depressive symptoms, yet
   their impacts were independent of one another. A genome-wide analysis of
   genetic alterations using machine learning methodologies will provide a
   framework for identifying genetic-environmental-sociobehavioral
   interactions in depressive symptoms.

AB Objectives. We tested 3 hypotheses-social causation, social drift, and
   common cause-regarding the origin of socioeconomic disparities in major
   depression and determined whether the relationship between socioeconomic
   status (SES) and major depression varied by genetic liability for major
   depression.
   Methods. Data were from a sample of female twins in the baseline
   Virginia Adult Twin Study of Psychiatric and Substance Use Disorders
   interviewed between 1987 and 1989 (n = 2153). We used logistic
   regression and structural equation twin models to evaluate these 3
   hypotheses.
   Results. Consistent with the social causation hypothesis, education
   (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.66, 0.93;
   P<.01) and income (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89, 0.98; P<.01) were
   significantly related to past-year major depression. Upward social
   mobility was associated with lower risk of depression. There was no
   evidence that childhood SES was related to development of major
   depression (OR = 0.98; 95% CI = 0.89, 1.09; P>.1). Consistent with a
   common genetic cause, there was a negative correlation between the
   genetic components of major depression and education (r(2) = -0.22).
   Co-twin control analyses indicated a protective effect of education and
   income on major depression even after accounting for genetic liability.
   Conclusions. This study utilized a genetically informed design to
   address how social position relates to major depression. Results
   generally supported the social causation model.

AB Objectives. We explain why traits of interest to behavioral scientists
   may have a genetic architecture featuring hundreds or thousands of loci
   with tiny individual effects rather than a few with large effects and
   why such an architecture makes it difficult to find robust associations
   between traits and genes.
   Methods. We conducted a genome-wide association study at 2 sites,
   Harvard University and Union College, measuring more than 100 physical
   and behavioral traits with a sample size typical of candidate gene
   studies. We evaluated predictions that alleles with large effect sizes
   would be rare and most traits of interest to social science are likely
   characterized by a lack of strong directional selection. We also carried
   out a theoretical analysis of the genetic architecture of traits based
   on R.A. Fisher's geometric model of natural selection and empirical
   analyses of the effects of selection bias and phenotype measurement
   stability on the results of genetic association studies.
   Results. Although we replicated several known genetic associations with
   physical traits, we found only 2 associations with behavioral traits
   that met the nominal genome-wide significance threshold, indicating that
   physical and behavioral traits are mainly affected by numerous genes
   with small effects.
   Conclusions. The challenge for social science genomics is the likelihood
   that genes are connected to behavioral variation by lengthy, nonlinear,
   interactive causal chains, and unraveling these chains requires allying
   with personal genomics to take advantage of the potential for large
   sample sizes as well as continuing with traditional epidemiological
   studies.

AB The invention of AIDS activism came soon after the AIDS epidemic emerged
   in gay communities in the United States in the early 1980s. AIDS
   activism by and for people with AIDS, distinct from gay activism
   responding to the threat of AIDS on the behalf of the whole community,
   started as a way of resisting the phenomenon of social death. Social
   death, in which people are considered "as good as dead" and denied roles
   in community life, posed a unique threat to people with AIDS. An
   organized political response to AIDS began among gay men with AIDS in
   San Francisco, California, and New York, New York, formalized in a
   foundational document later called the Denver Principles. The ideas and
   language of these first people with AIDS influenced later AIDS activism
   movements. They also help to illustrate the importance of considering an
   epidemic from the point of view of people with the disease.

AB Objectives. We examined relationships between social determinants of
   health and experiences of transgender-related discrimination reported by
   transgender people in Virginia.
   Methods. In 2005 through 2006, 387 self-identified transgender people
   completed a statewide health needs assessment; 350 who completed
   eligibility questions were included in this examination of factors
   associated with experiences of discrimination in health care,
   employment, or housing. We fit multivariate logistic regression models
   using generalized estimating equations to adjust for survey modality
   (online vs paper).
   Results. Of participants, 41% (n = 143) reported experiences of
   transgender-related discrimination. Factors associated with
   transgender-related discrimination were geographic context, gender
   (female-to male spectrum vs male-to-female spectrum), low socioeconomic
   status, being a racial/ethnic minority, not having health insurance,
   gender transition indicators (younger age at first transgender
   awareness), health care needed but unable to be obtained (hormone
   therapy and mental health services), history of violence (sexual and
   physical), substance use health behaviors (tobacco and alcohol), and
   interpersonal factors (family support and community connectedness).
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that transgender Virginians experience
   widespread discrimination in health care, employment, and housing.
   Multilevel interventions are needed for transgender populations,
   including legal protections and training for health care providers.

AB Objectives. We examined the social impact of the telemedicine
   intervention effects in lower-and higher-socioeconomic status (SES)
   participants in the Informatics for Diabetes Education and Telemedicine
   (IDEATel) study.
   Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing
   telemedicine case management with usual care, with blinded outcome
   evaluation, in 1665 Medicare recipients with diabetes, aged 55 years or
   older, residing in federally designated medically underserved areas of
   New York State. The primary trial endpoints were hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c),
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure levels.
   Results. HbA1c was higher in lower-income participants at the baseline
   examination. However, we found no evidence that the intervention
   increased disparities. A significant moderator effect was seen for HbA1c
   (P = .004) and systolic blood pressure (P = .023), with the
   lowest-income group showing greater intervention effects.
   Conclusions. Lower-SES participants in the IDEATel study benefited at
   least as much as higher-SES participants from telemedicine nurse case
   management for diabetes. Tailoring the intensity of the intervention
   based on clinical need may have led to greater improvements among those
   not at goal for diabetes control, a group that also had lower income,
   thereby avoiding the potential for an innovative intervention to widen
   socioeconomic disparities.

AB Objectives. We examined the relationship between genetic ancestry,
   socioeconomic status (SES), and lung cancer among African Americans and
   Latinos.
   Methods. We evaluated SES and genetic ancestry in a Northern California
   lung cancer case-control study (1998-2003) of African Americans and
   Latinos. Lung cancer case and control participants were frequency
   matched on age, gender, and race/ethnicity. We assessed case-control
   differences in individual admixture proportions using the 2-sample t
   test and analysis of covariance. Logistic regression models examined
   associations among genetic ancestry, socioeconomic characteristics, and
   lung cancer.
   Results. Decreased Amerindian ancestry was associated with higher
   education among Latino control participants and greater African ancestry
   was associated with decreased education among African lung cancer case
   participants. Education was associated with lung cancer among both
   Latinos and African Americans, independent of smoking, ancestry, age,
   and gender. Genetic ancestry was not associated with lung cancer among
   African Americans.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that socioeconomic factors may have a
   greater impact than genetic ancestry on lung cancer among African
   Americans. The genetic heterogeneity and recent dynamic migration and
   acculturation of Latinos complicate recruitment; thus, epidemiological
   analyses and findings should be interpreted cautiously.

   One key challenge is the implications of moving "outside the lab" and
   away from the experimental tools available for research with model
   organisms. Social science research methods used to examine human
   behavior in nonexperimental, real-world settings to date have not been
   fully taken advantage of during this disciplinary integration,
   especially in the form of gene-environment interaction research.
   This article outlines and provides examples of several prominent

AB Background Little is known about the neighbourhood characteristics of
   workplaces, the extent to which they are independently and
   synergistically correlated with residential environments, and their
   impact on health.
   Methods This study investigated cross-sectional relationships between
   home and workplace neighbourhood environments with body mass index (BMI)
   in 1503 working participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis with mean age 59.6 (SD=7.4). Neighbourhood features were
   socioeconomic status (SES), social environment (aesthetic quality,
   safety and social cohesion) and physical environment (walking
   environment, recreational facilities and food stores) derived from
   census data, locational data on businesses and survey data. Paired t
   tests and correlations compared environments overall and by distance
   between locations. Cross-classified multilevel models estimated
   associations with BMI.
   Results Home neighbourhoods had more favourable social environments
   while workplaces had more favourable SES and physical environments.
   Workplace and home measures were correlated (0.39-0.70), and differences
   between home and workplaces were larger as distance increased.
   Associations between BMI and neighbourhood SES and recreational
   facilities were stronger for home environment (p <= 0.05) but did not
   significantly differ for healthy food, safety or social cohesion.
   Healthy food availability at home and work appeared to act
   synergistically (interaction p=0.01).
   Conclusions Consideration of workplace environment may enhance our
   understanding of how place affects BMI.

AB Rapid urbanisation in the 20th century has been accompanied by the
   development of slums. Nearly one-third of the world's population and
   more than 60% of urban populations in the least developed countries live
   in slums, including hundreds of millions of children. Slums are areas of
   broad social and health disadvantage to children and their families due
   to extreme poverty, overcrowding, poor water and sanitation, substandard
   housing, limited access to basic health and education services, and
   other hardships (eg, high unemployment, violence). Despite the magnitude
   of this problem, very little is known about the potential impact of slum
   life on the health of children and adolescents. Statistics that show
   improved mortality and health outcomes in cities are based on aggregated
   data and may miss important intraurban disparities. Limited but
   consistent evidence suggests higher infant and under-five years
   mortality for children residing in slums compared with non-slum areas.
   Children suffer from higher rates of diarrhoeal and respiratory illness,
   malnutrition and have lower vaccination rates. Mothers residing in slums
   are more poorly educated and less likely to receive antenatal care and
   skilled birth assistance. Adolescents have earlier sexual debut and
   higher rates of HIV, and adopt risky behaviours influenced by their
   social environment. We also know little about the consequences of this
   form of early childhood on long-term health-related behaviour (eg, diet
   and exercise) and non-communicable disease outcomes, such as obesity,
   heart disease and mental illness. Further attention to understanding and
   addressing child health in slum settings is an important priority for
   paediatricians and those committed to child health worldwide.

AB We examines the influence of family processes and acculturation for
   gender differences in alcohol and drug use among a sample representative
   of the Hispanic population in Miami-Dade County, Florida (N = 734). We
   found that (a) increases in age at marriage and acculturation were
   associated with greater substance use, (b) the associations between age
   at marriage, acculturation, and substance use were found to be greater
   for Hispanic women than men, and (c) with each additional child born,
   Hispanic women are increasingly less likely to use substances than
   Hispanic men. Data reveal that family processes and acculturation
   jointly impact substance use.

AB Violence against individuals with non-normative gender presentation is
   an alarming public health problem in the USA. Based on ethnographic
   research in transgender communities in the American Midwest I
   demonstrate that the significance of multiple and simultaneous gendered
   victimization experiences of transgender individuals urges the need to
   rethink the equation of gender violence=violence against women. The
   findings reveal that: First, violence impedes the quality of transgender
   lives on a daily basis. Second, violent harassment occurs most if
   individuals visibly transgress gender norms. Third, the sampled
   transgender individuals respond to violence in diverse ways: Coping
   strategies range from resignation, depression, as well as constraints in
   mobility and gender presentation on one side of the spectrum to active
   resistance through community building, self-policing, and creative arts
   on the other.

AB There has been an increased focus on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in
   India, especially on cardiovascular diseases and associated risk
   factors. In this essay, we scrutinize the prevailing narrative that
   cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are
   no longer confined to the economically advantaged groups but are an
   increasing burden among the poor in India. We conducted a comprehensive
   review of studies reporting the association between socioeconomic status
   (SES) and CVRF, CVD, and CVD-related mortality in India. With the
   exception of smoking and low fruit and vegetable intake, the studies
   clearly suggest that CVRF/CVD is more prevalent among high SES groups in
   India than among the low SES groups. Although CVD-related mortality
   rates appear to be higher among the lower SES groups, the proportion of
   deaths from CVD-related causes was found to be greatest among higher SES
   groups. The studies on SES and CVRF/CVD also reveal a substantial
   discrepancy between the data presented and the authors' interpretations
   and conclusions, along with an unsubstantiated claim that a reversal in
   the positive SES-CVRF/CVD association has occurred or is occurring in
   India. We conclude our essay by emphasizing the need to prioritize
   public health policies that are focused on the health concerns of the
   majority of the Indian population. Resource allocation in the context of
   efforts to make health care in India free and universal should reflect
   the proportional burden of disease on different population groups if it
   is not to entrench inequity.

AB Background Household characteristics are important influences on the
   risk of child death. However, little is known about this influence in
   HIV-endemic areas. We describe the effects of household characteristics
   on children's risk of dying in rural South Africa.
   Methods We use data describing the mortality of children younger than 5
   years living in the Agincourt health and socio-demographic surveillance
   system study population in rural northeast South Africa during the
   period 1994-2008. Using discrete time event history analysis we estimate
   children's probability of dying by child characteristics and household
   composition (other children and adults other than parents) (N = 924 818
   child-months), and household socio-economic status (N = 501 732
   child-months).
   Results Children under 24 months of age whose subsequent sibling was
   born within 11 months experience increased odds of dying (OR 2.5; 95% CI
   1.1-5.7). Children also experience increased odds of dying in the period
   6 months (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2-3.6), 3-5 months (OR 3.0; 95% CI 1.5-5.9),
   and 2 months (OR 11.8; 95% CI 7.6-18.3) before another household child
   dies. The odds of dying remain high at the time of another child's death
   (OR 11.7; 95% CI 6.3-21.7) and for the 2 months following (OR 4.0; 95%
   CI 1.9-8.6). Having a related but non-parent adult aged 20-59 years in
   the household reduces the odds (OR 0.6; 95% CI 0.5-0.8). There is an
   inverse relationship between a child's odds of dying and household
   socio-economic status.
   Conclusions This detailed household profile from a poor rural setting
   where HIV infection is endemic indicates that children are at high risk
   of dying when another child is very ill or has recently died. Short
   birth intervals and additional children in the household are further
   risk factors. Presence of a related adult is protective, as is higher
   socio-economic status. Such evidence can inform primary health care
   practice and facilitate targeting of community health worker efforts,
   especially when covering defined catchment areas.

AB Background: Although studies suggest that exposure to pollutants is
   associated with race/ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES), many
   studies are limited to the geographic regions where monitoring stations
   are located.
   Objectives: This study uses modeled predictive surfaces to examine the
   relationship between air pollution exposure, race/ethnicity, and
   measures of SES across the entire State of North Carolina.
   Methods: The daily predictions of particulate matter <2.5 mu m in
   aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) were determined using a
   spatial model that fused data from two sources: point air monitoring
   data and gridded numerical output. These daily predicted pollution
   levels for 2002 were linked with Census data. We examine the
   relationship between the census-tract level predicted concentration
   measures, SES, and racial composition.
   Results: SES and race/ethnicity were related to predicted concentrations
   of both PM2.5 and O-3 for census tracts in North Carolina. Lower SES and
   higher proportion minority population were associated with higher levels
   of PM2.5. An interquartile range (IQR) increase of median household
   income reduced the predicted average PM2.5 level by 0.10 mu g/m(3). The
   opposite relationship was true for O-3. An IQR increase of median
   household income increased the predicted average O-3 measure by 0.11
   ppb.
   Conclusions: The analyses demonstrate that SES and race/ethnicity are
   related to predicted estimates of PM2.5 and O-3 for census tracts in
   North Carolina. These findings offer a baseline for future exposure
   modeling work involving SES and air pollution for the entire state and
   not just among the populations residing near monitoring networks.

AB The ketogenic diet is an effective therapy for childhood epilepsy, but
   its important impacts on families could affect successful treatment. We
   assessed medical and psychosocial factors associated with successful
   ketogenic diet treatment. A total of 23 families of patients treated
   with ketogenic diet completed questionnaires (30% response), including
   inquiries about challenges to successful dietary treatments and
   validated family functioning scales. Of these, 14 were considered
   successful (diet discontinued once the child was seizure-free or
   continued as clinically indicated). Family-identified challenges were
   food preparation time (n = 11) and that the diet was too restrictive (n
   = 9). Neither Medicaid insurance nor family functioning scale scores
   were significantly associated with successful treatment. Lower seizure
   frequency prior to ketogenic diet initiation (P = .02) and postdiet
   seizure improvement (P = .01) were associated with increased odds of
   success. Effective ketogenic diet treatment is dictated both by
   psychosocial and epilepsy-related influences. A focus on understanding
   the psychosocial issues may help to improve families' experiences and
   success with the ketogenic diet.

AB BackgroundInfluential work has explored the role of family socioeconomic
   status (SES) as an environmental moderator of genetic and environmental
   influences on cognitive outcomes. This work has provided evidence that
   socioeconomic circumstances differentially impact the heritability of
   cognitive abilities, generally supporting the bioecological model in
   that genetic influences are greater at higher levels of family SES. The
   present work expanded consideration of the environment, using
   school-level SES as a moderator of reading comprehension.
   MethodsThe sample included 577 pairs of twins from the Florida Twin
   Project on Reading, Behavior and Environment. Reading comprehension was
   measured by the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test (FCAT) Reading in
   third or fourth grade. School-level SES was measured by the mean Free
   and Reduced Lunch Status (FRLS) of the schoolmates of the twins.
   ResultsThe best-fitting univariate G x E moderation model indicated
   greater genetic influences on reading comprehension when fewer
   schoolmates qualified for FRLS (i.e., higher' school-level SES). There
   was also an indication of moderation of the shared environment; there
   were greater shared environmental influences on reading comprehension at
   higher school-level SES.
   ConclusionsThe results supported the bioecological model; greater
   genetic variance was found in school environments in which student
   populations experienced less poverty. In general, higher' school-level
   SES allowed genetic and probably shared environmental variance to
   contribute as sources of individual differences in reading comprehension
   outcomes. Poverty suppresses these influences.

AB In this longitudinal study we investigate the influence of childhood
   disadvantage on midlife hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
   regulation. Two mechanisms by which early life stress may affect later
   pathophysiology are through its influence on cognitive functioning or
   later socioeconomic (SES) disadvantage. We predicted that individual
   differences in young adult cognitive ability and midlife SES would
   mediate the influence of childhood disadvantage on midlife cortisol. On
   each of three nonconsecutive days, participants provided five salivary
   cortisol samples corresponding to their diurnal rhythm (N = 727 men;
   mean age 55, SD = 2.6). We calculated three measures of cortisol
   regulation (area-under-the curve cortisol reflecting total daytime
   cortisol output; cortisol-awakening-response; and wake-to-bed slope),
   averaging scores for each measure across multiple days. Childhood
   disadvantage combined four dichotomous indicators used previously by
   Rutter (1985): father low SES; mother education less than 12th grade;
   major family disruption/separation before age 18; and large family size
   (more than 5 siblings). The two mediators were a measure of general
   cognitive ability assessed at age 20 and highest achieved midlife SES.
   Men from more disadvantaged childhoods were significantly more likely to
   have dysregulated cortisol at midlife, with higher daytime cortisol
   levels decades after their childhood experience. Effects of childhood
   disadvantage were both direct and indirect. Cognitive ability and adult
   SES, however, only partially mediated the associations between early
   life stress and midlife cortisol. Specific indirect effects accounted
   for 33.8% of the total effect of childhood disadvantage [beta = 0.12
   (0.05; 0.18)] on total daytime cortisol. Associations remained
   significant after accounting for ethnicity, smoking status, and
   self-reported depressive symptoms. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Oxytocin has been shown to affect human social information processing
   including recognition memory for faces. Here we investigated the neural
   processes underlying the effect of oxytocin on memorizing own-race and
   other-race faces in men and women. In a placebo-controlled,
   double-blind, between-subject study, participants received either
   oxytocin or placebo before studying own-race and other-race faces. We
   recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) during both the study and
   recognition phase to investigate neural correlates of oxytocin's effect
   on memory encoding, memory retrieval, and perception. Oxytocin increased
   the accuracy of familiarity judgments in the recognition test. Neural
   correlates for this effect were found in ERPs related to memory encoding
   and retrieval but not perception. In contrast to its facilitating
   effects on familiarity, oxytocin impaired recollection judgments, but in
   men only. Oxytocin did not differentially affect own-race and other-race
   faces. This study shows that oxytocin influences memory, but not
   perceptual processes, in a face recognition task and is the first to
   reveal sex differences in the effect of oxytocin on face memory.
   Contrary to recent findings in oxytocin and moral decision making,
   oxytocin did not preferentially improve memory for own-race faces. (C)

AB Responding to a call for research on pornography and women's sexuality
   made by Weinberg, Williams, Kleiner, and Irizarry (2010), this study
   assessed pornography consumption, predictors, and correlates using
   nationally representative data gathered from U.S. women between 1973 and
   2010 (N = 18,225). Women who were younger, less religious, and non-White
   were more likely to consume pornography. Women who consumed pornography
   had more positive attitudes toward extramarital sex, adult premarital
   sex, and teenage sex. Women who consumed pornography also had more
   sexual partners in the prior year, prior 5 years, and were more likely
   to have engaged in extramarital sex and paid sex. Consistent with
   Wright's (2011a) acquisition, activation, application model of mass
   media sexual socialization and the theorizing of Linz and Malamuth
   (1993), liberal-conservative ideology moderated the association between
   pornography exposure and sexual behavior. Specifically, the positive
   association between pornography exposure and women's recent sexual
   behavior was strongest for the most liberal women and weakest for the
   most conservative women. Cultural commentators and some academics argue
   that technological advances have resulted in a steady increase in the
   percentage of individuals who consume pornography. Little support was
   found for this assertion among U.S. women.

AB For gay men in the United States, race/ethnicity has been demonstrated
   to factor importantly into sexual preferences, and race-based beliefs
   regarding certain racial groups are prevalent within the gay male
   community. For gay men of color, such beliefs may differentially
   influence their sexual preferences. Yet, little is known about the
   social-psychological factors underlying differences in sexual
   preferences among gay men of color. The present study examined how
   personal preferences for social hierarchy and dominance may explain
   variations in sexual positioning preferences, and how this relationship
   may be further qualified by their race-based sexual attraction among gay
   Asian/Pacific Islander (API) men. A total of 141 API gay men were
   recruited to participate in an online survey. Measures assessed
   participants' sexual positioning preferences, race-based sexual
   attraction, and preferences for social hierarchy or social dominance
   orientation (SDO). Self-identified tops scored higher on SDO than
   bottoms or versatiles. Participants attracted to non-API men scored
   higher on SDO compared to participants attracted to API men and
   participants who reported no race-based attraction. Finally, a
   significant two-way interaction indicated that tops attracted to non-API
   men scored the highest on SDO, and bottoms with no race-based attraction
   in men scored the lowest. Race/ethnicity is a prominent factor in sexual
   attraction and sexual positioning preferences among gay men, and one's
   proclivity for social hierarchy and dominance explains differences in
   sexual preferences among API gay men. By demonstrating how API gay men
   negotiate sexual preferences, present findings help elucidate existing
   race-based sexual dynamics within gay male culture.

   never treated). We used adjusted Poisson regression models to compare
   employment for those living in rural (n=297) v. urban (n=96) settings.
   Results
   Although rural and urban residents had similar impairments due to
   symptoms, rural residents were three times more likely to be employed
   (adjusted relative risk 3.27, 95% Cl 2.11-5.07, P<0.001).
   Conclusions
   People with schizophrenia have greater opportunities to use their
   capacities for productive work in rural than urban settings in China.
   Contextual mechanisms that may explain this result offer a useful focus
   for future research.

AB Background: This analysis assessed the acquisition (incidence) and
   persistence (clearance) of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection by
   self-reported race among men in The HPV in Men (HIM) Study, a
   multinational prospective study of the natural history of genital HPV
   infections.
   Methods: Self-reported race was categorized as White, Black,
   Asian/Pacific Islander (PI), or multiple and mixed race. Genital samples
   were combined for HPV DNA testing and categorized by any, oncogenic, and
   non-oncogenic HPV infections.
   Results: Asian/PI race had significantly the lowest incidence of any,
   oncogenic, and non-oncogenic HPV infection (P < 0.001). In multivariable
   analyses, Asian/PI race was associated with a lower probability of
   acquiring any [HR = 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.95] and
   non-oncogenic HPV infection (HR = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.93) when compared
   to Whites. No significant associations were evident for Asian/PI race
   for clearance. Multiple and mixed race was significantly associated with
   lower probability of acquiring non-oncogenic HPV infection (HR = 0.83;
   95% CI, 0.69-0.99) and borderline significant associations were observed
   for any HPV (HR = 0.91) and oncogenic infections (HR = 0.92). Multiple
   and mixed race was associated with a lower probability of clearing any
   (HR = 0.92; 95% CI, 0.84-1.00) and oncogenic HPV infections (HR = 0.85;
   95% CI, 0.75-0.95).
   Conclusion: Asian/PI race had the lowest incidence of HPV and exhibited
   a lower probability of acquiring new HPV infections. Multiple and mixed
   race had the second lowest incidence of infection and was associated
   with a lower probability of acquiring and clearing an HPV infection.
   Impact: Race-specific differences in HPV infection could be due to
   behavior, innate genetic differences, or circulating intratypic HPV
   variants. (C) 2013 AACR.

AB Quantifying the impact of different modifiable behavioral and biological
   risk factors on socioeconomic disparities in coronary heart disease
   (CHD) may help inform targeted, population-specific strategies to reduce
   the unequal distribution of the disease. Previous studies have used
   analytic approaches that limit our ability to disentangle the relative
   contributions of these risk factors to CHD disparities. The goal of this
   study was to assess mediation of the effect of low education on incident
   CHD by multiple risk factors simultaneously. Analyses are based on
   15,067 participants of the Dutch Monitoring Project on Risk Factors for
   Chronic Diseases aged 20-65 years examined 1994-1997 and followed for
   events until January 1, 2008. Path analysis was used to quantify and
   test mediation of the low education-CHD association by behavioral
   (current cigarette smoking, heavy alcohol use, poor diet, and physical
   inactivity) and biological (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and
   hypercholesterolemia) risk factors. Behavioral and biological risk
   factors accounted for 56.6 % (95 % CI 42.6-70.8 %) of the low
   education-incident CHD association. Smoking was the strongest mediator,
   accounting for 27.3 % (95 % CI 17.7-37.4 %) of the association, followed
   by obesity (10.2 %; 95 % CI 4.5-16.1 %), physical inactivity (6.3 %; 95
   % CI 2.7-10.0 %), and hypertension (5.3 %; 95 % CI: 2.8-8.0 %). In
   summary, in a Dutch cohort, the majority of the relationship between low
   education and incident CHD was mediated by traditional behavioral and
   biological risk factors. Addressing barriers to smoking cessation, blood
   pressure and weight management, and physical activity may be the most
   effective approaches to eliminating socioeconomic inequalities in CHD.

AB Latino older adults in the United States have disproportionately high
   rates of chronic and disabling medical conditions. Puerto Ricans have a
   higher prevalence of several chronic medical conditions and higher rates
   of functional disability than other Latinos. Earlier studies have
   documented that Puerto Rican older adults traditionally have relied
   mostly on family members for assistance with their functional needs,
   with low use of formal support services, but little is known about their
   functional help needs and caregiving practices. This study examined
   independent living and caregiving practices of community-dwelling Puerto
   Rican older adults in western New York using a mixed-methods approach
   with a sample of 49 individuals attending an inner-city primary care
   clinic. Standard instruments were used to obtain information on
   socioeconomic and health status and functional ability. Forty
   participants who needed help with any instrumental activities of daily
   living (IADLs) were probed qualitatively for how their needs were
   addressed. Participants averaged six chronic medical conditions, mean
   age was 76.2 +/- 5.3, most reported annual household income of $15,000
   or less and had low fluency in English, and all had healthcare
   insurance. For the most part, participants' children and spouses were
   primary caregivers, and few used formal support services. Nearly
   one-third reported having insufficient help. Qualitative findings
   elucidated how IADL needs were addressed. In this sample of indigent
   Puerto Rican older adults, most needed help with IADLs. Although family
   members most often helped, one-third had unmet or undermet needs.
   Linguistically and culturally congruent formal support services are
   still needed for Puerto Rican older adults and their family caregivers.

AB Some 600 years ago, Arab historian Ibn Khaldun wrote a theory of history
   in which he suggested a cyclical model of state formation and
   dissolution linked to 'asabiyah, translated as "group feeling."
   'Asabiyah is born out of shared desert hardship among the mobile
   bedouin, kinship relations, and catalyzed by charismatic leadership. Ibn
   Khaldun's theory emphasizes social relations over a material economic
   base rooted in environmental conditions and has been largely ignored by
   anthropology. This theory provides an appropriate model for the
   emergence of Arabian complex societies in the first millennium BC, an
   outcome little influenced by the social dynamics of state formation in
   surrounding regions like Egypt and Mesopotamia. Traditional materialist
   models of the development of highly complex societies rely on material
   sources of power and authority. These models anticipate an amplification
   of elites' network alliances through wealth exchanges (supported by
   surplus production) or competitive appropriation and redistribution of
   surplus. In the southern Arabian highlands, archaeological data provide
   little support for these models but instead suggest that the emergence
   of Arabian kingdoms is best explained as the appropriation of local
   institutions of social constitution by charismatic leaders to federalize
   social identities while transforming kinship relations into
   patron-client classes.

AB Background: The neighborhoods where people live can influence their
   drinking behavior. We hypothesized that living in a neighborhood with
   lower median income, higher alcohol outlet density, and only liquor
   stores and no grocery stores would be associated with higher alcohol
   consumption after adjusting for individual demographic and lifestyle
   factors.
   Methods: We used two self-report measures to assess alcohol consumption
   in a sample of 9959 adults living in a large Midwestern county: volume
   of alcohol consumed (count) and binge drinking (5 or more drinks vs. <5
   drinks). We measured census tract median annual household income based
   on U.S. Census data. Alcohol outlet density was measured using the
   number of liquor stores divided by the census tract roadway miles. The
   mix of liquor and food stores in census tracts was assessed using a
   categorical variable based on the number of liquor and number of food
   stores using data from InfoUSA. Weighted hierarchical linear and Poisson
   regression were used to test our study hypothesis.
   Results: Retail mix was associated with binge drinking. Individuals
   living in census tracts with only liquor stores had a 46% higher risk of
   binge drinking than individuals living in census tracts with food stores
   only after controlling for demographic and lifestyle factors.
   Conclusion: Census tract characteristics such as retail mix may partly
   explain variability in drinking behavior. Future research should explore
   the mix of stores, not just the over-concentration of liquor stores in
   census tracts. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Contemporary emotion regulation research emphasizes intrapersonal
   processes such as cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression, but
   people experiencing affect commonly choose not to go it alone. Instead,
   individuals often turn to others for help in shaping their affective
   lives. How and under what circumstances does such interpersonal
   regulation modulate emotional experience? Although scientists have
   examined allied phenomena such as social sharing, empathy, social
   support, and prosocial behavior for decades, there have been
   surprisingly few attempts to integrate these data into a single
   conceptual framework of interpersonal regulation. Here we propose such a
   framework. We first map a "space" differentiating classes of
   interpersonal regulation according to whether an individual uses an
   interpersonal regulatory episode to alter their own or another person's
   emotion. We then identify 2 types of processes-response-dependent and
   response-independent-that could support interpersonal regulation. This
   framework classifies an array of processes through which interpersonal
   contact fulfills regulatory goals. More broadly, it organizes diffuse,
   heretofore independent data on "pieces" of interpersonal regulation, and
   identifies growth points for this young and exciting research domain.

AB The present study explored early personality and environmental
   predictors of the development of young children's empathy, as well as
   relations of empathy to prosocial behavior with peers at a later age.
   How children manage their own emotions and behaviors when under
   stress-their ego-resiliency-would be expected to affect their responses
   to others' emotions. Also, socialization experiences, such as the
   quality of parenting behaviors, have been associated with individual
   differences in empathy-related responding. We examined whether mothers'
   emotion socialization practices and children's ego-resiliency at 18
   months predicted initial levels and change in empathy across five time
   points (24, 30, 42, 48, and 54 months; N = 242), and whether empathy in
   turn predicted prosocial behavior with peers at 72/84 months of age.
   Ego-resiliency and mothers' expressive encouragement both uniquely
   predicted the intercept of empathy. Boys' empathy was lower than girls'
   but improved more with age. Initial levels and growth of empathy
   positively predicted later prosocial behavior. Children's ego-resiliency
   predicted the slope of empathy at near significance (p = .054). We also
   found that the intercept of empathy mediated the relation between
   ego-resiliency and prosocial behavior as well as the relation between
   mothers' expressive encouragement and prosocial behavior. These findings
   suggest that both parenting and personality characteristics are relevant
   to the development of empathy during early childhood and might
   contribute to children's later prosocial behavior with peers.

AB In the Andean region of South America, understanding communities' water
   perceptions is particularly important for water management as many rural
   communities must decide by themselves if and how they will protect their
   micro-watersheds and distribute their water. In this study we examine
   how Water User Associations in the Eastern Andes of Colombia perceive
   water scarcity and the relationship between this perception and observed
   climate, land use, and demographic changes. Results demonstrate a
   complex relationship between perceptions and observed changes. On the
   one hand, observed changes in land cover match perceptions of
   deforestation as the primary cause of increasing water scarcity. On the
   other hand, perceptions of climate driven changes in water availability
   are not reflected in observed precipitation data. Furthermore, water
   scarcity was perceived in regions where seasonal rainfall variability is
   higher but not in regions where annual rainfall is lower. We discuss how
   these results contribute to our understanding of adaptation to climate
   change and the implications of possible mismatches between environmental
   changes and local perceptions.

AB Background: Atopy varies by ethnicity, even within Latino groups. This
   variation might be due to environmental, sociocultural, or genetic
   factors.
   Objective: We sought to examine risk factors for atopy within a
   nationwide study of US Latino children with and without asthma.
   Methods: Aeroallergen skin test responses were analyzed in 1830 US
   Latino subjects. Key determinants of atopy included country/region of
   origin, generation in the United States, acculturation, genetic
   ancestry, and site to which subjects migrated. Serial multivariate
   zero-inflated negative binomial regressions stratified by asthma status
   examined the association of each key determinant variable with the
   number of positive skin test responses. In addition, the independent
   effect of each key variable was determined by including all key
   variables in the final models.
   Results: In baseline analyses African ancestry was associated with 3
   times (95% CI, 1.62-5.57) as many positive skin test responses in
   asthmatic participants and 3.26 times (95% CI, 1.02-10.39) as many
   positive skin test responses in control participants. Generation and
   recruitment site were also associated with atopy in crude models. In
   final models adjusted for key variables, asthmatic patients of Puerto
   Rican (exp[beta] [95% CI], 1.31 [1.021.69]) and mixed (exp[beta] [95%
   CI], 1.27 [1.03-1.56]) ethnicity had a greater probability of positive
   skin test responses compared with Mexican asthmatic patients. Ancestry
   associations were abrogated by recruitment site but not region of
   origin.
   Conclusions: Puerto Rican ethnicity and mixed origin were associated
   with degree of atopy within US Latino children with asthma. African
   ancestry was not associated with degree of atopy after adjusting for
   recruitment site. Local environment variation, represented by site, was
   associated with degree of sensitization.

   This study generated population-based estimates of hospital use and cost
   to 3 years of age by race/ethnicity among children with DS in
   Massachusetts using birth certificates linked to birth defects registry
   and hospital discharge data from 1999 to 2004. Hospital use (>= 1
   post-birth hospitalization and median days hospitalized birth and
   post-birth) and reasons for hospitalization were compared across
   maternal race/ethnicity using relative risk (RR) and Wilcoxon rank sums
   tests, as appropriate. Costs were calculated in 2011 United States
   dollars. Greater hospital use was observed among children with DS with
   Hispanic vs. Non-Hispanic White (NHW) mothers (post-birth
   hospitalization: RR 1.4; median days hospitalized: 20.0 vs. 11.0,
   respectively). Children with DS and congenital heart defects of
   Non-Hispanic Black (NHB) mothers had significantly greater median days
   hospitalized than their NHW counterparts (24.0 vs. 16.0, respectively).
   Respiratory diagnoses were listed more often among children with
   Hispanic vs. NHW mothers (50.0% vs. 29.1%, respectively), and NHBs had
   more cardiac diagnoses (34.1% vs. 21.5%, respectively). The mean total
   hospital cost was nine times higher among children with DS ($40,075)
   than among children without DS ($4053), and total costs attributable to
   DS were almost $18 million. Median costs were $22,781 for Hispanics,
   $18,495 for NHBs, and $13,947 for NHWs. Public health interventions
   should address the higher rates of hospital use and hospitalizations for
   respiratory and cardiac diseases among racial/ethnic minority children

AB Introduction. Over the last 60 years, there has been a nationwide
   decrease in the number of operations performed for peptic ulcer disease
   (PUD). In contrast, the experience at our university-based safety net
   hospital (SNH) was that ulcer operations are still performed frequently.
   We hypothesized that differences in frequency of PUD operation may occur
   in hospitals that serve different patient populations. The purpose of
   this study was to evaluate our experience with PUD and compare it with
   national trends.
   Methods. We received institutional review board approval and performed
   this retrospective study of patients undergoing operation for PUD
   between January 2008 and December 2011. Patient records at 2 hospitals
   (a private community hospital and a university SNH) with similar
   admission numbers and geographic catchment were examined for PUD risk
   factors, Helicobacter pylori status, insurance/income status, type of
   operation, and surgical outcomes. A case-matched control group of
   medically treated patients were identified after primary diagnosis of
   PUD by endoscopy at the SNH. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
   performed.
   Results. The total number of operations for PUD performed at the SNH was
   greater than those performed at the private hospital from 2008 to 2011
   (142 vs 24; P < .001). The private hospital followed national trends
   over the same time period with a decrease in operations for PUD of
   approximately 93% between 1967 and 2008 (115 to 8 operations per year
   nationally and 119 to 6 at the private hospital). In contrast with the
   national and local private hospital experience, the number of operations
   for PUD at SNH increased from 27 per year in 1985 to 36 per year in
   2008. Additionally, 43% of patients at the SNH had no insurance, and 61%
   resided in the poorest quartile of zip codes compared with the 3%
   uninsured patient rate at the private hospital for a similar group of
   patients. At both hospitals, most operations were emergent (range,
   83-92%) and treated with omental patch (45%), gastric wedge resection
   (15%), vagotomy and antrectomy (19%), or vagotomy and pyloroplasty
   (14%). At the SNH, the H pylori infection rate was less (48% vs 83%; P <
   .001) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was greater
   (76% vs 63%; P < .01) in the 142 surgical patients compared with the 320
   medical controls. Adjusted risk ratios demonstrated insurance status,
   NSAID use, and lower socioeconomic class were all equally predictive of
   operative ulcer disease when compared with medical controls.
   Conclusion. Our study provides 2 observations. First, patients of lower
   socioeconomic standing may have increased rates of complicated PUD owing
   to multiple medical factors and other factors related to healthcare.
   Second, surgical care for PUD retains a clinically important role within
   this patient population.

AB The incidental detection of early-stage kidney tumors is increasing in
   the United States. Nephron-sparing approaches (NS) to managing these
   tumors are equivalent to radical nephrectomy (RN) in oncologic outcomes
   and have a decreased impact on renal function. Our objective was to
   evaluate trends in the use of NS over the past decade and the
   socioeconomic factors associated with its use.
   The National Cancer Database was queried to identify patients with stage
   I kidney cancer between 2000 and 2008. Patients were classified by the
   type of surgery as NS (local destruction and local excision) or RN.
   Patients were further categorized by age, race, insurance status, and
   income. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios
   (PR) for the proportion of NS to RN according to demographic and
   socioeconomic characteristics.
   From 2000 to 2008, there were 142,194 cases of kidney cancer reported to
   the NCDB. In these cases, 43,034 (30.3 %) patients had NS, and 86,431
   (60.78 %) patients had RN. The prevalence of NS increased 10 % per year
   (PR = 1.10, p < 0.0001)-from 20.0 % in 2000 to 45.1 % in 2008. Older
   age, lower income, Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and lack of health
   insurance were associated with a decreased prevalence of NS.
   NS as a treatment for stage I kidney cancer has increased steadily since
   2000. Age, racial, and socioeconomic differences may exist in the
   utilization of NS. Additional analyses, with patient level data, are
   required to address the independent significance of these variables in
   an effort to develop strategies to mitigate these potential disparities.

AB To test the association between family history of prostate cancer (FH)
   and prostate cancer (PCa) risk in a large screening program in Brazil,
   as no conclusive study has yet investigated this.
   Between 2004 and 2007, 17,569 men were screened in 231 small
   municipalities using mobile screening units. Positive FH was defined as
   any relative having PCa among screened men. Men were biopsied if they
   had digital rectal examination suggestive of PCa or PSA > 4.0 ng/mL or
   PSA of 2.5-4 ng/mL with percent free PSA a parts per thousand currency
   sign15 %. We analyzed the association between FH and PCa using
   multivariable logistic regression in the first screening round of the
   program.
   Positive FH was present in 735 men (4.2 % of total), and they were
   younger, better educated and more likely to have had previous PCa
   screening (41.5 vs. 28.5 %; P < 0.001) compared to men with negative FH.
   FH status did not affect compliance rates in men recommended to undergo
   biopsy (P = 0.94). In first round, PCa was detected in 3.1 % of screened
   men (n = 552). In multivariable analysis, positive FH was associated
   with increased PCa risk (OR = 1.79; 95 % CI, 1.21-2.65; P = 0.003).
   However, Gleason scores (P = 0.78) or percent of positive cores (P =
   0.32) among men with positive biopsies were similar, regardless of FH
   status.
   In Brazil, men with positive FH were at increased PCa risk, which could
   not be explained by differential biopsy rates. This finding suggests
   that FH is also a true PCa risk factor in Brazil, a country with highly
   diverse population in terms of race, ethnicity, culture and
   socioeconomic status.

AB Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of
   difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest
   these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the
   commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively
   shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and
   transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent
   State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and
   participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I
   theorize the existence of a third commemorative formthe integrated
   commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent
   narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while
   simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared
   meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or
   scientific inquiry.

AB Objective: Much debate exists regarding the role of culture versus
   socioeconomic position in shaping the health of Latino populations. We
   propose that both may matter for health and explicitly test their
   independent and joint effects on smoking and physical activity.
   Methods: We used the 2010 National Health Interview Survey, a
   population-based survey of the U.S. population, to estimate the
   prevalence of smoking and physical activity by language use (cultural
   proxy) and education among Latino adults (n = 4929). We fit log binomial
   regression models to estimate prevalence ratios and test for
   interaction.
   Results: English-language use and educational attainment were each
   independently associated with smoking and physical activity. Joint
   effect models showed that individuals with both greater use of the
   English language and low levels of education were nearly three times
   more likely to smoke (prevalence ratio, 2.59; 95% confidence interval,
   1.83-3.65) than those with low English language use and high education
   (referent group); high acculturation and high education were jointly
   associated with increased activity (prevalence ratio 2.24, 95%
   confidence interval, 1.79-2.81).
   Conclusions: Cultural proxies such as language use and educational
   attainment are both important determinants of health among Latinos.
   Their joint effect suggests the need to simultaneously consider Latinos'
   socioeconomic position and their increased risk of adopting
   health-damaging behaviors while addressing culturally-specific factors
   that may mitigate risk. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Extending prior work on social anxiety and positivity deficits, we
   examined whether individual differences in social anxiety alter the
   ability to share and respond to the good news of romantic partners
   (i.e., capitalization support) and how this influences romantic
   relationship satisfaction and commitment. In this study of 174
   heterosexual couples (average age of 21.5 with 58.3% identifying as
   Caucasian), greater social anxiety was associated with the provision and
   receipt of less supportive responses to shared positive events as
   measured by trait questionnaires, partner reports, and behavioral
   observations in the laboratory. In longitudinal analyses, individuals in
   romantic relationships with socially anxious partners who experienced
   inadequate capitalization support were more likely to terminate their
   relationship and report a decline in relationship quality six months
   later. As evidence of construct specificity, social anxiety effects were
   independent of depressive symptoms. Taken together, social anxiety
   influenced a person's ability to receive and provide support for shared
   positive events; these deficits had adverse romantic consequences.
   Researchers and clinicians may better understand social anxiety by
   exploring a wider range of interpersonal contexts and positive
   constructs. The addition of capitalization support to the social anxiety
   literature offers new insights into interpersonal approaches and
   treatments. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Youth with chronic tic disorders (CTD) experience social problems that
   have been associated with functional impairment and a diminished quality
   of life. Previous examinations have attributed social difficulties to
   either tic severity or the symptom severity of coexisting conditions,
   but have not directly explored performance deficits in social
   functioning. This report examined the presence and characteristics of
   social deficits in youth with CTD and explored the relationship between
   social deficits, social problems, and quality of life. Ninety-nine youth
   (8-17 years) and their parents completed a battery of assessments to
   determine diagnoses, tic severity, severity of coexisting conditions,
   social responsiveness, and quality of life. Parents reported that youth
   with CTD had increased social deficits, with 19% reported to have severe
   social deficits. The magnitude of social deficits was more strongly
   associated with inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositionality than
   with tic severity. Social deficits predicted internalizing and social
   problems, and quality of life above and beyond tic severity. Social
   deficits partially mediated the relationship between tic severity and
   social problems, as well as tic severity and quality of life. Findings
   suggest that youth with CTD have social deficits, which are greater in
   the presence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and obsessive
   compulsive disorder. These social deficits play an influential role in
   social problems and quality of life. Future research is needed to
   develop interventions to address social performance deficits among youth
   with CTD. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Previous studies performed outside of the US that examined
   contraceptive knowledge and beliefs in South Asian women identified
   significant barriers. Our study aimed to further understand these
   practices in this population residing in the US.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study surveyed women of all ethnicities
   receiving health care from either of two ambulatory practices in New
   Jersey from October 2011 to November 2012. Using chi-squared testing,
   the frequencies of contraceptive outcomes between South Asians and
   non-South Asians were compared.
   Study Design: There were 42 South Asian respondents and 143 non-South
   Asian respondents. Our results show that South Asians are statistically
   significantly less likely to routinely use contraception and that gaps
   in contraceptive knowledge appear to stem from multiple barriers,
   including family opposition and pressure from spouse or in-laws to have
   children, cultural prohibitions, fear of side effects and
   misinformation, lack of education/knowledge about contraceptives and
   difficulty in accessing contraception. These gaps in contraceptive
   knowledge were also found to be multigenerational, despite higher levels
   of education generally seen in the South Asian population.
   Conclusions: Clinicians caring for South Asian women should acknowledge
   both the barriers and the lack of contraceptive knowledge in this
   population and provide culturally competent family planning information
   to them during all women's health encounters. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Based on fieldwork at a transnational surrogacy clinic in India and
   analysis of assisted reproductive technology (ART) legislation under
   consideration in the Indian parliament, this paper examines how bodies
   become potentialized through a combination of technology and networks of
   social and economic inequality. In this process, the meaning that
   participants assign to bodies and social relationships mediated by
   bodies becomes destabilized in a way that allows some surrogates to
   imagine and work toward a connection to commissioning parents that will
   offer them long-term benefit. The politics that position the clinic to
   potentialize the bodies of surrogatesand as a result the relations
   between participants and their imagined outcomesoccur at a moment of
   global demand for ARTs. As such, they rely on differentiation of
   subjects culturally, geographically, and economically. This article
   examines how the potentializing of women''s bodies as surrogates occurs
   at the nexus of political, medical, and social influences in one ART
   clinic and how the resulting social relations are negotiated between
   participants in the clinic.

AB Conservation with a high level of community involvement is proving to be
   an effective way to conserve forests with benefits for livelihoods and
   biodiversity. However, people's motivations to participate in
   conservation in developing countries are not well studied or understood.
   One example of a highly successful community conservation program is the
   Golden Langur Conservation Project (GLCP) in the Manas Biosphere
   Reserve. The project was initiated in 1998 to protect the endangered
   golden langur (Trachypithecus geei) and its forested habitat. By 2005,
   community forest protection forces had been created and were
   successfully protecting the forest. They have been effective in stopping
   illegal poachers and confiscating illegally taken timber and wildlife.
   The objectives of this study are to describe the community forest
   guards' motivations to participate in the program, and their perceptions
   of the project. Results show that these community-based guardians are
   motivated to participate by multiple factors: conservation, social
   benefits, and economic opportunities. Conservation of forests and
   wildlife seem to play the primary role in motivating guards to
   participate in conserving the forest. However, economic benefits and
   social benefits also play important roles.

AB IMPORTANCE Medicaid is the largest payer of mental health (MH) care in
   the United States, and this role will increase among states that opt
   into the Medicaid expansion. However, owing to the dearth of MH care
   providers who accept Medicaid, expanded coverage may not increase access
   to services. Facilities that provide specialty outpatient MH services
   and accept Medicaid compose the backbone of the community-based
   treatment infrastructure for Medicaid enrollees. For states that opt
   into the expansion, it is important to understand which local
   communities may face the greatest barriers to access these facilities.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the availability of outpatient MH facilities that
   accept Medicaid across US counties and whether specific types of
   communities are more likely to lack this infrastructure.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from the 2008 National Survey of
   Mental Health Treatment Facilities and Area Resource File were merged. A
   generalized ordered logistic regression with state fixed effects was
   estimated to examine determinants of accessibility of these facilities.
   Covariates included the percentages of residents who are black,
   Hispanic, living in poverty, and living in a rural area.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES An ordered variable assessed whether a county
   had no access to outpatient MH facilities that accept Medicaid,
   intermediate access to these facilities (ie, >= 1 facility, but not top
   quintile of facility to Medicaid enrollee per capita ratio), or high
   access (ie, top quintile of facility to Medicaid enrollee per capita
   ratio).
   RESULTS More than one-third of counties do not have any outpatient MH
   facilities that accept Medicaid. Communities with a larger percentage of
   residents who are black (marginal effect [ME] = 3.9%; 95% CI,
   1.2%-6.6%), Hispanic (ME = 4.8%; 95% CI, 2.3%-7.4%), or living in a
   rural area (ME = 27.9%; 95% CI, 25.3%-30.4%) are more likely to lack
   these facilities.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many communities may face constraints on the
   MH safety-net system as Medicaid is expanded, especially rural
   communities and communities with a large percentage of black or Hispanic
   residents.

AB Objective. The aim of this study was to examine the association between
   religiosity and overweight or obese body mass index among a
   multi-religious group of Asian Indian immigrants residing in California.
   Methods. We examined cross-sectional survey data obtained from
   in-language telephone interviews with 3228 mostly immigrant Asian
   Indians in the 2004 California Asian Indian Tobacco Survey using
   multivariate logistic regression.
   Results. High self-identified religiosity was significantly associated
   with higher BMI after adjusting for socio-demographic and acculturation
   measures. Highly religious Asian Indians had 1.53 greater odds (95% CI:
   1.18, 2.00) of being overweight or obese than low religiosity
   immigrants, though this varied by religious affiliation. Religiosity was
   associated with greater odds of being overweight/obese for Hindus (OR
   1.54; 95% CI: 1.08, 2.22) and Sikhs (OR 1.88; 95% CI: 1.07, 3.30), but
   not for Muslims (OR 0.69; 95% CI: 0.28, 1.70).
   Conclusions. Religiosity in Hindus and Sikhs, but not immigrant Muslims,
   appears to be independently associated with greater body mass index

AB Objective: The sodium intake of participants of the Healthy Aging in
   Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span study who were in three
   of the special population groups identified by the Dietary Guidelines
   for Americans, 2010 (those with hypertension, African Americans, and
   those >= 51 years) was analyzed to determine if they met sodium
   recommendations.
   Methods: The sample included 2152 African American and White subjects,
   aged 30-64 years. Major dietary sources of sodium for each group were
   determined from two 24-hour dietary recalls, and dietary intakes were
   compared with sodium recommendations. Dietary potassium was also
   evaluated.
   Results: The intakes of the groups studied exceeded 1500 mg of sodium
   while their potassium intakes were lower than the Adequate Intake of
   4700 mg. The major contributors of sodium included "cold cuts, sausage,
   and franks," "protein foods," and yeast breads.
   Conclusions: Excessive sodium intake characterized the diet of an urban,
   socioeconomically diverse population who are hypertensive or at risk for
   having hypertension. These findings have implications for health
   professionals and the food industry. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Several studies identify racial identitythe significance and meaning
   that individuals attribute to raceas a mitigating factor in the
   association between racial discrimination and adjustment. In this study,
   we employed a visual imagery paradigm to examine whether racial identity
   would moderate autonomic responses to blatant and subtle racial
   discrimination analogues with Black and White perpetrators. We recruited
   105 African American young adults from a public, southeastern university
   in the United States. The personal significance of race as well as
   personal feelings about African Americans and feelings about how others
   view African Americans moderated autonomic responses to the vignettes.
   We use polyvagal theory and a stress, appraisal, and coping framework to
   interpret our results with an eye toward elucidating the ways in which
   racial identity may inform individual differences in physiological
   responses to racial discrimination.

AB Noting that the field of agro-food studies has undergone numerous turns'
   over the years, this article first seeks to make sense of this evolving
   literature by examining aspects of the metaphysical foreground upon
   which this turning' takes place. Doing this highlights a coalescing of
   sorts within the field; a movement the author describes as being less
   toward a specific theoretical framework as it is around a general way of
   doing agro-food scholarship. This style of scholarship embraces
   relationality, process, and multiplicity while emphasising the
   generative capacities of what agro-food scholars do for enacting novel
   political, ontological, and normative practices. The reminder of the
   article co-experiments with what it means to be open to these productive
   capacities as researchers, in terms of making the un-thought thinkable
   and un-doable routine. In doing this the article offers an account of
   agro-food imaginaries that is hopeful precisely because it is
   unsettling.

AB Simulation games can help overcome student resistance to thinking
   structurally about social class inequality, meritocracy, and mobility.
   Most inequality simulations focus solely on economic inequality and omit
   social and cultural capital, both of which contribute to social class
   reproduction. Using a pretest/posttest design, the current study
   evaluates a simulation game that incorporates economic, social, and
   cultural capital and is meant for introductory sociology classes
   containing between 15 and 70 students. Data come from a state research
   university and a liberal arts college. Results show that the simulation
   increased students' conceptual understanding of structural explanations
   for restricted mobility; cultural and social capital; and conceptual
   connections between stratification concepts. The simulation did not lead
   to changes in students' feelings about poor people. Results support the
   idea of using simulation games to overcome student resistance to the
   sociological perspective on stratification and suggest that some
   simulation games may be effective across institutional contexts.

AB A common source of frustration for college instructors is getting their
   students to read. Since the 1970s, studies have shown that no more than
   30 percent of students complete a reading assignment on any given day.
   But what can be done? What strategies can instructors use to make
   certain that their students read? Do pop or announced quizzes work
   better? Does it help to call on students randomly in class? To date,
   little systematic evidence exists concerning the relative utility of the
   many methods instructors use to encourage reading compliance. This study
   begins to address that lacuna. Specifically, using survey data collected
   in introductory sociology classes (N = 423), we examine how students
   evaluate seven commonly used methods ranging from announced quizzes to
   short writing assignments to being called on randomly in class. We find
   that students perceive mandatory and/or announced methods to be more
   effective in motivating them to complete reading assignments than
   unannounced or optional methods.

   passivity and anonymity; effectively gains, maintains, and utilizes
   students' attention; fosters a nonthreatening learning environment;
   raises students' awareness of personal perspectives and biases; and
   encourages integration of ideas and critical thinking. ARC can also be
   used for meaningful assessment between formal evaluations as well as to
   reward each student's preparation and reading of the class material. The
   principles, practice, benefits, and measures of success of ARC as an

   series of strategies: making the familiar strange, explaining
   McDonaldization, self-investigation and discovery, and exploring and
   implementing alternatives. Through assignments, class exercises, and
   films, students contextualize modernity and its unintended negative
   consequences by viewing McDonaldization though the lenses of work and

   This study aimed to assess the independent effects of race and family

   emotions, low positive resources, and unpleasant interactions during the
   day are also related.
   Healthy African American and Caucasian high school students (N = 239)
   wore an ambulatory BP monitor for 48 h, recorded quality of ongoing
   interpersonal interactions, and completed questionnaires.
   African Americans and those with lower family income had higher
   night/day BP ratios. African Americans reporting greater negative
   emotions, lower positive resources, and more unpleasant interactions had
   higher night/day BP ratios.
   Racial differences in night BP emerge by adolescence, independent of
   family income. African Americans, especially those high in negative
   emotions and low in positive resources, may be at higher relative risk
   for hypertension later in life in part due to elevated night BP.

AB American Indian and Alaska Native tribes are uniquely affected by
   climate change. Indigenous peoples have depended on a wide variety of
   native fungi, plant and animal species for food, medicine, ceremonies,
   community and economic health for countless generations. Climate change
   stands to impact the species and ecosystems that constitute tribal
   traditional foods that are vital to tribal culture, economy and
   traditional ways of life. This paper examines the impacts of climate
   change on tribal traditional foods by providing cultural context for the
   importance of traditional foods to tribal culture, recognizing that
   tribal access to traditional food resources is strongly influenced by
   the legal and regulatory relationship with the federal government, and
   examining the multi-faceted relationship that tribes have with places,
   ecological processes and species. Tribal participation in local,
   regional and national climate change adaption strategies, with a focus
   on food-based resources, can inform and strengthen the ability of both
   tribes and other governmental resource managers to address and adapt to
   climate change impacts.

AB This paper provides an overview of climate change impacts on tribal
   water resources and the subsequent cascading effects on the livelihoods
   and cultures of American Indians and Alaska Natives living on tribal
   lands in the U.S. A hazards and vulnerability framework for
   understanding these impacts is first presented followed by context on
   the framework components, including climate, hydrologic, and ecosystem
   changes (i.e. hazards) and tribe-specific vulnerability factors
   (socioeconomic, political, infrastructural, environmental, spiritual and
   cultural), which when combined with hazards lead to impacts. Next
   regional summaries of impacts around the U.S. are discussed. Although
   each tribal community experiences unique sets of impacts because of
   their individual history, culture, and geographic setting, many of the
   observed impacts are common among different groups and can be
   categorized as impacts on-1) water supply and management (including
   water sources and infrastructure), 2) aquatic species important for
   culture and subsistence, 3) ranching and agriculture particularly from
   climate extremes (e.g., droughts, floods), 4) tribal sovereignty and
   rights associated with water resources, fishing, hunting, and gathering,
   and 5) soil quality (e.g., from coastal and riverine erosion prompting
   tribal relocation or from drought-related land degradation). The paper
   finishes by highlighting potentially relevant research questions based
   on the five impact categories.

AB The case of the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe exemplifies tribal
   vulnerabilities as a result of climate change. Preliminary
   socio-economic data and analysis reveal that the tribe's vulnerability
   to climate change is related to cultural and economic dependence on
   Pyramid Lake, while external socio-economic vulnerability factors
   influence adaptive capacity and amplify potential impacts. Reduced water
   supplies as a consequence of climate change would result in a compounded
   reduction of inflows to Pyramid Lake, thus potentially impacting the
   spawning and sustenance of a cultural livelihood, the endangered cui-ui
   fish (Chasmistes cujus). Meanwhile, limited economic opportunities and
   dwindling federal support constrain tribal adaptive capacity. Factors
   that contribute to tribal adaptive capacity include:
   sustainability-based values, technical capacity for natural resource
   management, proactive initiatives for the control of invasive-species,
   strong external scientific networks, and remarkable tribal awareness of
   climate change.

AB Tribal communities in the United States, particularly in coastal areas,
   are being forced to relocate due to accelerated rates of sea level rise,
   land erosion, and/or permafrost thaw brought on by climate change.
   Forced relocation and inadequate governance mechanisms and budgets to
   address climate change and support adaptation strategies may cause loss
   of community and culture, health impacts, and economic decline, further
   exacerbating tribal impoverishment and injustice. Sovereign tribal
   communities around the US, however, are using creative strategies to
   counter these losses. Taking a human rights approach, this article looks
   at communities' advocacy efforts and strategies in dealing with climate
   change, displacement, and relocation. Case studies of Coastal Alaska and
   Louisiana are included to consider how communities are shaping their own
   relocation efforts in line with their cultural practices and values. The
   article concludes with recommendations on steps for moving forward
   toward community-led and government-supported resettlement programs.

AB Over the last 100 years, linear trends of tributary streamflow have
   changed on Columbia River Basin tribal reservations and historical lands
   ceded by tribes in treaties with the United States. Analysis of
   independent flow measures (Seasonal Flow Fraction, Center Timing, Spring
   Flow Onset, High Flow, Low Flow) using the Student t test and
   Mann-Kendall trend test suggests evidence for climate change trends for
   many of the 32 study basins. The trends exist despite interannual
   climate variability driven by the El Nio-Southern Oscillation and
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The average April-July flow volume declined
   by 16 %. The median runoff volume date has moved earlier by 5.8 days.
   The Spring Flow Onset date has shifted earlier by 5.7 days. The trend of
   the flow standard deviation (i.e., weather variability) increased 3 % to
   11 %. The 100-year November floods increased 49 %. The mid-Columbia 7Q10
   low flows have decreased by 5 % to 38 %. Continuation of these climatic
   and hydrological trends may seriously challenge the future of salmon,
   their critical habitats, and the tribal peoples who depend upon these
   resources for their traditional livelihood, subsistence, and ceremonial
   purposes.

AB This essay demonstrates how key concepts from ecology can be applied
   within historical analyses in order to gain insights regarding
   contemporary environmental change. We employ a coupled human and natural
   systems conceptual framework in a nascent historical analysis of rapid
   societal and environmental change in colonial New England, where
   European colonization led to stark and rapid transformations. Introduced
   diseases reduced indigenous communities to a fraction of their
   pre-contact levels. European agriculture and associated pest species,
   deforestation and overharvest of ecologically influential species were
   among key aspects of the rapid changes in colonial New England.
   Cross-continental biotic introductions initiated reinforcing feedback
   loops that accelerated the transition of human and natural systems into
   novel states. Integrating colonial history and ecology can help identify
   important interactions between human and natural systems useful for
   contemporary societies adjusting to environmental change.

   The current study sought to elucidate the association between self- and

   friendship similarity was evaluated, and the Actor-Partner
   Interdependence Model was used to test how both friends' BAP
   characteristics jointly and uniquely contribute to the experiences of
   friendships. Results suggest self-informant agreement about the BAP,

   for the BAP and friendship values, quality, conflict, and loneliness.
   Findings suggest that the BAP relates in meaningful ways to
   self-perceptions of friendship variables in the general population.

AB Optimal control strategies for controlling seasonal influenza
   transmission in the US are of high interest, because of the significant
   epidemiological and economic burden of influenza. To evaluate optimal
   strategies of vaccination and social distancing, we used an
   age-structured dynamic model of seasonal influenza. We applied optimal
   control theory to identify the best way of reducing morbidity and
   mortality at a minimal cost. In combination with the Pontryagins maximum
   principle, we calculated time-dependent optimal policies of vaccination
   and social distancing to minimize the epidemiological and economic
   burden associated with seasonal influenza. We computed optimal
   age-specific intervention strategies and analyze them under various
   costs of interventions and disease transmissibility. Our results show
   that combined strategies have a stronger impact on the reduction of the
   final epidemic size. Our results also suggest that the optimal
   vaccination can be achieved by allocating most vaccines to preschool-age
   children (age under five) followed by young adults (age 20-39) and
   school age children (age 6-19). We find that the optimal vaccination
   rates for all age groups are highest at the beginning of the outbreak,
   requiring intense effort at the early phase of an epidemic. On the other
   hand, optimal social distancing of clinical cases tends to last the
   entire duration of an outbreak, and its intensity is relatively equal
   for all age groups. Furthermore, with higher transmissibility of the
   influenza virus (i.e. higher R0), the optimal control strategy needs to
   include more efforts to increase vaccination rates rather than efforts
   to encourage social distancing. Taken together, public health agencies
   need to consider both the transmissibility of the virus and ways to
   encourage early vaccination as well as voluntary social distancing of
   symptomatic cases in order to determine optimal intervention strategies
   against seasonal influenza.

AB The flaws of the 20th century-type development 'mega-projects' in the
   circumpolar North prompt Arctic regions actively to search for
   alternative strategies of regional development that break away from
   resource-dependency and reconcile local (traditional) societies with the
   realities of post-Fordism and globalisation. This paper presents a study
   that focuses on the notion of creative capital (CC) and assesses its
   ability to foster economic development in Alaska. The findings suggest
   that some characteristics of the CC observed in Alaskan communities are
   similar to those found in southern regions, whereas others are distinct
   (but similar to those in the Canadian North). In Alaska, the synergy
   between cultural economy, entrepreneurship and leadership appear to be
   more important in characterising creative capacities than formal
   education. The geographical distribution of the CC is uneven and heavily
   clustered in economically, geographically and politically privileged
   northern urban centres. However, some remote regions also demonstrate
   considerable levels of creative potential, in particular associated with
   the aboriginal cultural capital (artists, crafters, etc.). A number of
   Alaskan regions, creative 'hot spots', could become places that can
   benefit from alternative strategies of regional development based on CC,
   knowledge-based and cultural economies.

AB Background
   Despite wide availability of treatment options for hepatocellular
   carcinoma (HCC), several studies have suggested underutilisation in
   clinical practice.
   Aims
   To quantify utilisation rates for HCC treatment among patients with HCC
   in the United States, and to summarise patterns of association between
   utilisation rates and patient socio-demographic characteristics.
   Methods
   We performed a systematic literature review using the Medline database
   from January 1989 to March 2013. Two investigators independently
   extracted data on patient populations, study methods and results using
   standardised forms. Pooled treatment rates for any treatment and
   curative treatment, with 95% confidence intervals, were calculated.
   Prespecified subgroup analysis was performed to identify patient-level
   correlates of treatment utilisation.
   Results
   We identified 24 studies that met inclusion criteria. The pooled rates
   of any treatment and curative treatment were 52.8% (95% CI 52.2-53.4%)
   and 21.8% (95% CI 21.4-22.1%) respectively. Among patients diagnosed at
   an early stage, the pooled curative treatment rate was 59.0% (95% CI
   58.159.9%). Elderly, non-Caucasians and patients of low socioeconomic
   status had lower treatment rates than their counterparts.
   Conclusions
   Rates of HCC treatment in the United States, including curative
   treatment rates among patients detected at an early stage, are
   disappointingly low. Future efforts should focus on identifying
   appropriate intervention targets to increase treatment rates and reduce
   socio-demographic disparities.

   a positive association between ringleader bullying and psychopathic
   narcissism, and a significant interaction effect between narcissism and
   theory of mind. More specifically, narcissism moderated the relationship
   between theory of mind and ringleader bullying such that theory of mind
   was positively associated with ringleader bullying when levels of
   narcissism were high, and theory of mind was negatively associated
   ringleader bullying when levels of narcissism were low. The discussion
   of these results focuses on the importance of developing effective

   Age Psychiatric Assessment, was administered to a parent at both time
   points to assess psychopathology. The peer functioning constructs
   examined at age 6 included child popularity, socially inappropriate
   behavior, and conflicted shyness. Simultaneous multiple regressions
   revealed that age 3 anxiety disorder diagnosis was the only unique
   diagnostic predictor of age 6 socially inappropriate behavior and
   conflicted shyness, with age 3 anxiety dimensional scores uniquely
   predicting all three peer constructs. Age 3 anxiety disorder had direct
   effects on both socially inappropriate behavior and conflicted shyness,
   which were not mediated by concurrent anxiety disorder at age 6. Thus,
   preschool anxiety disorders may have enduring effects on child peer
   relationships in the early school-age years. Possible explanations and

   to White survivors, differences that would be reduced but remain
   significant after controlling for sociodemographic and medical factors.
   Hypotheses were tested with data from the American Cancer Society's
   Study of Cancer Survivors-II. The FACIT-Sp subscale scores, Meaning,
   Peace, and Faith assessed SWB, and the SF-36 Physical Component Summary
   measured functional status. In general, bivariate models supported our
   initial hypotheses. After adjustment for sociodemographic and medical
   factors, however, Blacks had higher scores on both Meaning and Peace
   compared to Hispanics and Whites, and Hispanics' scores on Peace were
   higher than Whites' scores. In contrast, sociodemographic and medical
   factors had weak associations with Faith scores. The pattern with Faith
   in bivariate models persisted in the fully adjusted models.
   Racial/ethnic differences in Meaning and in Peace, important dimensions
   of SWB, were even stronger after controlling for sociodemographic and
   medical factors. However, racial/ethnic differences in Faith appeared to
   remain stable. Further research is needed to determine if racial/ethnic
   differences in SWB are related to variations in quality of life in
   survivors of cancer.

AB The ability to recognize when one is being imitated has been
   hypothesized to be an important developmental process related to the
   emergence of more advanced social-cognitive skills. While a series of
   behaviors indicating progressively more mature imitation recognition
   (IR) skills has been assessed in typically developing children,
   empirical work with children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) has
   largely focused on basic social responses to an imitative adult (e.g.
   increases in eye contact). Limited work has explored more mature IR
   behaviors in this population. This study compared the degree to which
   children with ASD engage in different behaviors thought to be indicative
   of IR during a naturalistic imitation task and the relationship between
   different types of IR behaviors and social-cognitive skills (i.e.
   imitation, language, social reciprocity, and joint attention). Thirty
   children with ASD were administered standardized measures of cognitive
   level, language, joint attention, social reciprocity, and imitation. IR
   behaviors were observed during periods of contingent imitation by an
   adult. Participants engaged more frequently in less mature (e.g. looking
   at the experimenter's toy or face) than more mature IR behaviors (e.g.
   testing the experimenter's intent to imitate). After controlling for
   developmental level, social reciprocity, object imitation, and gesture
   imitation were positively correlated with more mature IR. These findings
   suggest that the development of more mature IR skills is related to the
   development of other social-cognitive skills in children with ASD and
   provide additional empirical support for reports of more mature IR
   observed in this population. Autism Res 2013, ..: ..-... (c) 2013

   assess the public's perception of fair payment for a low-risk medicine
   trial and the association between requested payment and sociodemographic
   characteristics; to estimate the amount of payment for a medication
   trial to achieve proportional representation of minorities and different
   socioeconomic groups. This was a cross-sectional study with nationally
   representative data collected in 2011 by the C.S. Mott Children's

   relationship between perceived fair payment and individual-level
   characteristics, we used multivariable linear regression. With 60%
   participation rate, in a sample of 2,150 respondents 11% (n = 221) of
   the sample had previously participated in medical research. Requested
   payment differed significantly by racial/ethnic group with Hispanics
   requesting more payment than non-Hispanic whites (0.37 [95%CI 0.02,
   0.72]) In contrast to payment at $49, $149, and $249, payment at $349
   yielded proportional representation of racial/ethnic minority groups.
   Hispanics requested higher payment for research participation,
   suggesting a possible explanation for their underenrollment.

AB Institutional racism, also known as structural racism, can be defined as
   differential access to resources and opportunities by race as well as
   policies, laws, and practices that reinforce racial inequity. This study
   examines how institutional racism in the form of residential redlining
   (neighbourhood-level racial inequities in mortgage lending) and
   segregation (geographic separation of groups by race) is associated with
   self-reported stress among a diverse cohort of pregnant women.
   Institutional racism was measured by a residential redlining index using
   Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data and residential segregation using 2000
   US Census data. These redlining and segregation indices were linked with
   data from a pregnancy cohort study (n=4652), which included individual
   measures of reported stress. We ran multilevel linear regression models
   to examine the association between redlining, segregation and reported
   stress. Hispanic women compared with all other women were slightly more
   likely to report stress. There was no significant relationship between
   redlining and stress among this population. However, higher
   neighbourhood percentage black was inversely associated with stress.
   This study suggests that some forms of segregation may be associated
   with reported stress. Future studies should consider how redlining and
   segregation may provide an understanding of how institutional racism and
   the neighbourhood context may influence stress and health of
   populations. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Purpose: Bone acquisition in childhood impacts adult bone mass, and can
   be influenced by childhood socioeconomic conditions. Socioeconomic
   status is also associated with body weight which affects the load that
   bone is exposed to in a fall. We hypothesized that socioeconomic
   advantage in childhood is associated with greater bone strength relative
   to load in adulthood.
   Methods: Hip dual x-ray absorptiometry scans from 722 participants in
   the Midlife in the United States Study were used to measure femoral neck
   size and bone mineral density, and combined with body weight and height
   to create composite indices of femoral neck strength relative to load in
   different failure modes: compression, bending, and impact. A childhood
   socioeconomic advantage score was created for the same participants from
   parental education, self-rated financial status relative to others, and
   not being on welfare. Multiple linear regression was used to determine
   the association of childhood socioeconomic advantage with femoral neck
   composite strength indices, stratified by gender and race
   (white/non-white), and adjusted for study site, age, menopause status in
   women; education, and current financial advantage.
   Results: Childhood socioeconomic advantage was independently associated
   with higher indices of all three composite strength indices in white men
   (adjusted standardized effect sizes, 0.19 to 0.27, all p values < 0.01),
   but not in the other three race/gender groups. Additional adjustment for
   adult obesity, physical activity in different life stages, smoking, and
   heavy drinking over the life-course significantly attenuated the
   associations in white men.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with
   lower hip strength relative to load in white men, and these influences
   are dampened by healthy lifestyle choices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Parental monitoring has been described as a protective factor and useful
   strategy to prevent substance misuse among youths. The aim of this study
   was to examine whether perceived parental monitoring influences
   frequency of alcohol use, age of drinking onset and risky drinking among
   entering public high school and university students in Mexico City. The
   study is a cross-sectional survey of entering first year students in the
   high school and university school system of a large public university in
   Mexico City conducted during registration at the beginning of the school
   year. In 2008, of 34,840 students accepted to the affiliated high
   schools, 28,996 students (51.8% female) completed the alcohol survey and
   of 37,683 students accepted into university 30,084 students (51.5%
   female) completed the alcohol survey. The findings suggest that compared
   to students with higher perceived parental monitoring those reporting
   lower perceived parental monitoring were more likely to report risky
   behavior. They were more likely to be ever drinkers, frequent drinkers,
   have earlier age of onset and high AUDIT scores. Overall, higher
   parental monitoring was strongly associated with being female and lower
   parental monitoring with being male. Our findings suggest that more
   research on parental monitoring as a protective strategy against alcohol
   misuse is needed. Research focusing on cultural factors including gender
   and age-related norms and familismo would increase knowledge of the
   association of parental monitoring and alcohol use among Mexican youths,
   Mexican American youths and potentially youths from other Hispanic
   backgrounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research over the past several decades shows that those who act in ways
   inconsistent with desired identities often account for (i.e., excuse or
   justify) their actions to save face and maintain social identities.
   While the bulk of research on the use of accounts examines how people
   make sense of behaviors that go against conventional values, recent
   research suggests that those who do not adhere to subcultural norms
   engage in similar talk. The current study builds on the sociology of
   accounts by exploring whether inmates articulate a convict code; whether
   they provide accounts for code violations that are comparable to those
   given by active offenders; and whether incarceration shapes inmates' use
   of these accounts. Interviews with 40 inmates residing in a maximum
   security prison suggest that they rely on linguistic devices to align
   their actions with subcultural beliefs and that the prison environment
   structures the pattern of these accounts.

   generation and the relationship between novelty and individual hedonic
   value have long been subjects of study in social psychology. However,
   few studies have utilized large-scale datasets to quantitatively
   investigate these issues. Here we consider the domain of American cinema
   and explore these questions using a database of films spanning a 70 year
   period. We use crowdsourced keywords from the Internet Movie Database as
   a window into the contents of films, and prescribe novelty scores for
   each film based on occurrence probabilities of individual keywords and
   keyword-pairs. These scores provide revealing insights into the dynamics
   of novelty in cinema. We investigate how novelty influences the revenue
   generated by a film, and find a relationship that resembles the
   Wundt-Berlyne curve. We also study the statistics of keyword occurrence
   and the aggregate distribution of keywords over a 100 year period.

   research conducted on a university campus in Beijing China, between 2007

   surveys over the past five years. According to the Strain Theory of
   suicide we hypothesized that the stronger the relative deprivation, the
   higher the level of depression for the students and the higher the
   degree of suicidal ideation the students would experience. Findings
   indicated that relative deprivation is significantly correlated with
   suicidal ideation, positively related with depression and negatively
   related to social support. It is proposed that reduction of

AB Objectives: Zoster vaccine is recommended for prevention of herpes
   zoster among adults aged 60 years and older. We examined the zoster
   vaccination rates during 2007-2011 and assessed association with age,
   sex, race/ethnicity, neighborhood income and education attainment in
   eligible adults at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, a managed care
   organization in the US.
   Methods: We calculated annual zoster vaccination rate among members >=
   60 years without documented contraindications. Multivariable logistic
   regression was performed to examine factors associated with zoster
   vaccine uptake in an open cohort of 819,466 adults.
   Results: The zoster vaccination rates increased annually in all groups
   and the overall rate reached 21.7% in 2011 (P-trend <0.001). Coverage
   was highest among individuals aged 65-74 years, who were female and
   non-Hispanic White. In the adjusted analysis, odds of vaccination
   decreased by age. Females (odds ratio [OR] = 1.19, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 1.17-1.20) and those who lived in neighborhoods with
   higher education attainment were more likely to be vaccinated (>75% vs.
   <50% adults with some college education: OR=1.76, 95% CI = 1.73-1.80).
   Compared to Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics were less likely
   to receive the vaccine (non-Hispanic Blacks: OR=0.56,95% CI = 0.55-0.58;
   Hispanics: OR=0.59, 95% CI = 0.58-0.60).
   Conclusion: The zoster vaccine coverage is higher in this insured
   population than previously reported in the US general population, but it
   remains low. Significant racial/ethnic disparity was observed and
   worsened even among individuals with relatively equal access to zoster
   vaccination. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Initiatives to address the unmet needs of those facing both poverty and
   serious illness have expanded signifi cantly over the past decade. But
   many of them are designed in an ad-hoc manner to address one health
   problem among many; they are too rarely assessed; best practices spread
   slowly. When assessments of delivery do occur, they are often narrow
   studies of the cost-eff ectiveness of a single intervention rather than
   the complex set of them required to deliver value to patients and their
   families. We propose a framework for global health-care delivery and
   evaluation by considering eff orts to introduce HIV/AIDS care to
   resource-poor settings. The framework introduces the notion of care
   delivery value chains that apply a systems-level analysis to the complex
   processes and interventions that must occur, across a health-care system
   and over time, to deliver high-value care for patients with HIV/AIDS and
   cooccurring conditions, from tuberculosis to malnutrition. To deliver
   value, vertical or stand-alone projects must be integrated into shared
   delivery infrastructure so that personnel and facilities are used wisely
   and economies of scale reaped. Two other integrative processes are
   necessary for delivering and assessing value in global health: one is
   the alignment of delivery with local context by incorporating knowledge
   of both barriers to good outcomes (from poor nutrition to a lack of
   water and sanitation) and broader social and economic determinants of
   health and wellbeing (jobs, housing, physical infrastructure). The
   second is the use of eff ective investments in care delivery to promote
   equitable economic development, especially for those struggling against
   poverty and high burdens of disease. We close by reporting our own
   shared experience of seeking to move towards a science of delivery by
   harnessing research and training to understand and improve care
   delivery.

   a study of household electricity use. We found evidence for a Hawthorne
   (study participation) effect, seen in a reduction of their electricity
   use-even though they received no information, instruction, or incentives
   to change. Responses to a follow-up survey suggested that the effect
   reflected heightened awareness of energy consumption. Consistent with
   that interpretation, the treatment effect vanished when the intervention

AB Objective: To determine whether the known higher prevalence of migraine
   in lower household (HH) income groups is explained by a higher incidence
   rate or a lower remission rate.
   Methods: We used data from the American Migraine Prevalence and
   Prevention Study, a US national sample of 132,674 females (with a 64.3%
   response rate) and 124,665 males (with a 62.0% response rate) 12 years
   of age and older. Data were previously collected on migraine symptoms,
   onset age, and demographics. Previously validated methods applied to the
   American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study data were used to
   simulate a cohort study. Incidence and remission rates were estimated
   within 3 sex-specific HH income groups (<$22,500, $22,500-$59,999, and
   >=$60,000). The chi(2) test was used to determine whether the incidence
   or remission rates differed by HH income group as an explanation for
   differences in migraine prevalence by HH income.
   Results: Migraine prevalence increased as HH income decreased for
   females (chi(2), p < 0.01) and males (chi(2), p < 0.01). Differences
   were not explained by race and other known confounders. Variation in
   prevalence was explained, in large part, by a higher incidence rate in
   the lower HH income groups for both females (chi(2), p < 0.01) and males
   (chi(2), p < 0.01). Migraine remission rates did not differ by HH
   income.
   Conclusions: The higher incidence of migraine in lower HH income groups
   is compatible with the social causation hypothesis. Once initiated,
   migraine remission is independent of HH income. Onset and remission may
   have etiologically distinct causes.

AB Among terrestrial environments, forests are not only the largest
   long-term sink of atmospheric carbon (C), but are also susceptible to
   global change themselves, with potential consequences including
   alterations of C cycles and potential C emission. To inform global
   change risk assessment of forest C across large spatial/temporal scales,
   this study constructed and evaluated a basic risk framework which
   combined the magnitude of C stocks and their associated probability of
   stock change in the context of global change across the US. For the
   purposes of this analysis, forest C was divided into five pools, two
   live (aboveground and belowground biomass) and three dead (dead wood,
   soil organic matter, and forest floor) with a risk framework
   parameterized using the US's national greenhouse gas inventory and
   associated forest inventory data across current and projected future
   Koppen-Geiger climate zones (A1F1 scenario). Results suggest that an
   initial forest C risk matrix may be constructed to focus attention on
   short-and long-term risks to forest C stocks (as opposed to
   implementation in decision making) using inventory-based estimates of
   total stocks and associated estimates of variability (i.e., coefficient
   of variation) among climate zones. The empirical parameterization of
   such a risk matrix highlighted numerous knowledge gaps: 1) robust
   measures of the likelihood of forest C stock change under climate change
   scenarios, 2) projections of forest C stocks given unforeseen
   socioeconomic conditions (i.e., land-use change), and 3) appropriate
   social responses to global change events for which there is no
   contemporary climate/disturbance analog (e. g., severe droughts in the
   Lake States). Coupling these current technical/social limits of
   developing a risk matrix to the biological processes of forest
   ecosystems (i.e., disturbance events and interaction among diverse
   forest C pools, potential positive feedbacks, and forest
   resiliency/recovery) suggests an operational forest C risk matrix
   remains elusive.

   network of occupational specializations, an examination of this
   important network is absent from the considerable body of work on the
   determinants of urban economic performance. Here we develop a
   structure-based analysis addressing how the network of interdependencies
   among occupational specializations affects the ease with which urban
   economies can transform themselves. While most occupational
   specializations exhibit positive relationships between one another, many
   exhibit negative ones, and the balance between the two partially
   explains the productivity of an urban economy. The current set of
   occupational specializations of an urban economy and its location in the
   occupation space constrain its future development paths. Important
   tradeoffs exist between different alternatives for altering an
   occupational specialization pattern, both at a single occupation and an
   entire occupational portfolio levels.

AB Background: Compared to whites, U. S. Hispanics have higher obesity
   rates; U. S. Asians have lower rates. However Hispanics and Asians are
   each comprised of several ethnic subgroups that differ with respect to
   country of origin, immigration history, and geographic distribution
   across the U. S. Among adolescents, ethnic differences in obesity have
   been previously reported, but no studies have examined longitudinal
   change in body mass index (BMI) by Hispanic and Asian subgroup category
   to understand when and why these disparities emerge, especially during
   the critical transition between adolescence and adulthood.
   Methods: Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from 1355
   Hispanics (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central/South American, Other
   Hispanic), 520 Asians (Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian), and 5061whites
   from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves II-IV:
   1996-2009), we used linear mixed spline models to examine whether
   Hispanic and Asian adolescent subgroups shared the same BMI trajectories
   as whites as they aged into adulthood. We also investigated the role of
   social and behavioral factors in explaining race/ethnic differences.
   Results: Among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals
   exhibited faster increases in BMI both in adolescence and in adulthood
   and these patterns were not attributable to the measured social and
   behavioral factors. There was also evidence of emerging disparities in
   Cuban males, and in Central/South Americans relative to whites. In
   contrast, Chinese, Filipino, and Other Asian adolescents had
   significantly lower BMI and slower BMI increases in adulthood compared
   to whites. In models adjusted for social and behavioral factors,
   Chinese-white and Other Asian-white differentials remained unexplained.
   Conclusions: Aggregate estimates of Hispanics and Asians mask important
   heterogeneity in BMI. A better understanding of weight dynamics early in
   the life course can inform how and when disparities emerge to better
   target prevention efforts.

VL 8
IS 9
AR e74691
DI 10.1371/journal.pone.0074691
PD SEP 5 2013
PY 2013
AB Background: Prenatal socioeconomic adversity as an intrauterine exposure
   is associated with a range of perinatal outcomes although the
   explanatory mechanisms are not well understood. The development of the
   fetus can be shaped by the intrauterine environment through alterations
   in the function of the placenta. In the placenta, the HSD11B2 gene
   encodes the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, which is
   responsible for the inactivation of maternal cortisol thereby protecting
   the developing fetus from this exposure. This gene is regulated by DNA
   methylation, and this methylation and the expression it controls has
   been shown to be susceptible to a variety of stressors from the maternal
   environment. The association of prenatal socioeconomic adversity and
   placental HSD11B2 methylation has not been examined. Following a
   developmental origins of disease framework, prenatal socioeconomic
   adversity may alter fetal response to the postnatal environment through
   functional epigenetic alterations in the placenta. Therefore, we
   hypothesized that prenatal socioeconomic adversity would be associated
   with less HSD11B2 methylation.
   Methods and Findings: We examined the association between DNA
   methylation of the HSD11B2 promoter region in the placenta of 444
   healthy term newborn infants and several markers of prenatal
   socioeconomic adversity: maternal education, poverty, dwelling crowding,
   tobacco use and cumulative risk. We also examined whether such
   associations were sex-specific. We found that infants whose mothers
   experienced the greatest levels of socioeconomic adversity during
   pregnancy had the lowest extent of placental HSD11B2 methylation,
   particularly for males. Associations were maintained for maternal
   education when adjusting for confounders (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Patterns of HSD11B2 methylation suggest that environmental
   cues transmitted from the mother during gestation may program the
   developing fetus's response to an adverse postnatal environment,
   potentially via less exposure to cortisol during development. Less
   methylation of placental HSD11B2 may therefore be adaptive and promote
   the effective management of stress associated with social adversity in a
   postnatal environment.

AB Background: Suicide is a problem of worldwide concern and research on
   possible protective factors is needed. We explored the role of social
   support as one such factor. Specifically, we hypothesized that increased
   social support would be associated with decreased likelihood of a
   lifetime suicide attempt in two nationally representative samples as
   well as a high-risk subsample.
   Methods: We analyzed the relationship between social support and
   lifetime history of a suicide attempt, controlling for a variety of
   related psychopathology and demographic variables, in the National
   Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R), a United States sample and the
   Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Study (APMS), an English sample.
   Results: Results indicate that social support is associated with
   decreased likelihood of a lifetime suicide attempt controlling for a
   variety of related predictors in both the full US sample (OR=0.68, p <
   .001) and the full English sample (OR=0.93, p < .01).
   Limitations: The cross-sectional data do not allow true cause and effect
   analyses.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest social support is associated with
   decreased likelihood of a lifetime suicide attempt. Social support is a
   highly modifiable factor that can be used to improve existing suicide
   prevention programs worldwide. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Background: Misdiagnosis of African-U.S. persons is argued to be a
   built-in characteristic of Western-based assessment requiring
   augmentation with culture-focused input where possible. Regarding
   depression, materialistic depression is explained as an African-centered
   African-U.S. culture-focused construct of masked depression.
   Materialistic depression symptomatology is presented. Materialism
   orientation is postulated to necessarily be associated with
   materialistic depression.
   Method: 144 undergraduates, 37 male (25.7%) and 107 female (74.3%),
   average age of 21 completed the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the
   depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90-R, the materialism
   subscale of the Cultural Misorientation Scale, and the Materialistic
   Depression Quiz.
   Results: Contrasting high versus lower scoring MDQ groups on both
   depression scores produced reliable t-tests (p<.017). One-way ANOVA on
   materialism scores with high, medium, low MDQ groups was reliable
   (p<.017).
   Limitation: The sample precluded generalization to clinically depressed
   and non-college African-US. populations.
   Conclusions: Using the Materialistic Depression Quiz, high scorers
   versus medium and low scorers had greater depression scores on two
   depression measures and greater materialism scores. Materialistic
   depression appears a masked form of depression not to be overlooked. (C)

AB Background: In the United States, Latino men who have sex with men (MSM)
   are disproportionately affected by HIV. Latino MSM are a diverse group
   who differ culturally based on their countries or regions of birth and
   their time in the United States. We assessed differences in HIV
   prevalence and testing among Latino MSM by location of birth, time since
   arrival, and other social determinants of health.
   Methods: For the 2008 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System, a
   cross-sectional survey conducted in large US cities, MSM were
   interviewed and tested for HIV infection. We used generalized estimating
   equations to test associations between various factors and 1) prevalent
   HIV infection and 2) being tested for HIV infection in the past 12
   months.
   Results: Among 1734 Latino MSM, HIV prevalence was 19%. In multivariable
   analysis, increasing age, low income, and gay identity were associated
   with HIV infection. Moreover, men who were U.S.-born or who arrived >= 5
   years ago had significantly higher HIV prevalence than recent
   immigrants. Among men not reporting a previous positive HIV test, 63%
   had been tested for HIV infection in the past 12 months; recent testing
   was most strongly associated with having seen a health care provider and
   disclosing male-male attraction/sexual behavior to a health care
   provider.
   Conclusions: We identified several social determinants of health
   associated with HIV infection and testing among Latino MSM. Lower HIV
   prevalence among recent immigrants contrasts with higher prevalence
   among established immigrants and suggests a critical window of
   opportunity for HIV prevention, which should prioritize those with low
   income, who are at particular risk for HIV infection. Expanding health
   care utilization and encouraging communication with health care
   providers about sexual orientation may increase testing.

AB Cross-sectional studies suggest that cognitive deficits contribute to
   psychosocial impairment among individuals with mood disorders. However,
   studies examining whether cognition prospectively predicts psychosocial
   outcome are few, have used short follow-up periods, and have not
   demonstrated incremental validity (i.e., that cognition predicts future
   functioning even when controlling for baseline functioning). In a sample
   of 51 individuals with unipolar depression or bipolar disorder, we
   investigated whether attention/processing speed (APS) performance
   predicted social functioning 18 years later. Baseline APS predicted
   18-year social functioning even after controlling for baseline social
   functioning and depressive symptoms, demonstrating incremental validity.
   Individuals with high baseline APS had stable social functioning over 18
   years, whereas functioning deteriorated among those with low APS. This
   finding helps clarify the temporal order of cognitive and psychosocial
   deficits associated with mood disorders and suggests the clinical
   utility of cognitive measures in identifying those at risk of
   deterioration in social functioning.

AB Objectives. We examined the association between regular cigarette
   smoking and new onset of mood and anxiety disorders.
   Methods. We used logistic regression analysis to detect associations
   between regular smoking and new-onset disorders during the 3-year
   follow-up among 34 653 participants in the longitudinal US National
   Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (2001-2005). We
   used instrumental variable methods to assess the appropriateness of
   these models.
   Results. Regular smoking was associated with an increased risk of new
   onset of mood and anxiety disorders in multivariable analyses
   (F-df=5,F-61= 11.73; P < .001). Participants who smoked a larger number
   of cigarettes daily displayed a trend toward greater likelihood of
   new-onset disorders. Age moderated the association of smoking with most
   new-onset disorders. The association was mostly statistically
   significant and generally stronger in participants aged 18 to 49 years
   but was smaller and mostly nonsignificant in older adults.
   Conclusions. Our finding of a stronger association between regular
   cigarette smoking and increased risk of new-onset mood and anxiety
   disorders among younger adults suggest the need for vigorous antismoking
   campaigns and policy initiatives targeting this age group.

AB Objectives. We sought to quantify how socioeconomic, health care,
   demographic, and geographic effects explain racial disparities in low
   birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB) rates in Brazil.
   Methods. We employed a sample of 8949 infants born between 1995 and 2009
   in 15 cities and 7 provinces in Brazil. We focused on disparities in LBW
   (< 2500 g) and PTB (< 37 gestational weeks) prevalence between infants
   of African ancestry alone or African mixed with other ancestries, and
   European ancestry alone. We used a decomposition model to quantify the
   contributions of conceptually relevant factors to these disparities.
   Results. The model explained 45% to 94% of LBW and 64% to 94% of PTB
   disparities between the African ancestry groups and European ancestry.
   Differences in prenatal care use and geographic location were the most
   important contributors, followed by socioeconomic differences. The model
   explained the majority of the disparities for mixed African ancestry and
   part of the disparity for African ancestry alone.
   Conclusions. Public policies to improve children's health should target
   prenatal care and geographic location differences to reduce health
   disparities between infants of African and European ancestries in
   Brazil.

AB Objectives. We examined whether characteristics of local health
   departments (LHD) and their geographic region were associated with using
   Facebook and Twitter. We also examined the number of tweets per month
   for Twitter accounts as an indicator of social media use by LHDs.
   Methods. In 2012, we searched for Facebook and Twitter accounts for 2565
   LHDs nationwide, and collected adoption date and number of connections
   for each account. Number of tweets sent indicated LHD use of social
   media. LHDs were classified as innovators, early adopters, or
   nonadopters. Characteristics of LHDs were compared across adoption
   categories, and we examined geographic characteristics, connections, and
   use.
   Results. Twenty-four percent of LHDs had Facebook, 8% had Twitter, and
   7% had both. LHDs serving larger populations were more likely to be
   innovators, tweeted more often, and had more social media connections.
   Frequency of tweeting was not associated with adoption category. There
   were differences in adoption across geographic regions, with western
   states more likely to be innovators. Innovation was also higher in
   states where the state health department adopted social media.
   Conclusions. Social media has the potential to aid LHDs in disseminating
   information across the public health system. More evidence is needed to
   develop best practices for this emerging tool.

PY 2013
AB Low- and medium-resource countries are facing a significant increase in
   the incidence of noncommunicable diseases such as cancer. Unfortunately,
   the majority of patients with cancer present with advanced disease, and
   disease-directed treatment may be unlikely to be effective and/or not
   available. Globally, there will be a growing need for palliative care
   services.
   There has been significant progress in the provision and integration of
   palliative care into the health care policy and systems. Nonetheless,
   palliative care services vary significantly between regions of the world
   and also between countries in the same region. Some common barriers to
   care include the lack of a trained workforce to provide palliative care,
   lack of availability of opioids or the restriction of their use,
   cultural attitudes of physicians and patients, and also funding. Despite
   these challenges, there are examples of low-and medium-resource
   countries that are providing excellent palliative care that is being
   integrated into the health care system and the cancer care continuum.
   This article provides an overview of the progress in providing
   palliative care in low-and medium-resource countries. In addition, more
   specific information is provided on palliative care in low-resource
   countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa. Finally, a more personal

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between child marriage (before 18
   years of age) and maternal health care services use in Pakistan.
   METHODS: We limited the data from Pakistan Demographic and Health
   Survey, 2006-2007, to ever-married females aged 15-24 years with at
   least one childbirth (n=1,404) to identify differences in prenatal care
   provision (skilled or unskilled medical care provider), antenatal care
   (antenatal visits; care at home or a hospital), care at delivery
   (assistance by unskilled medical care provider), and place of birth by
   early (younger than 18 years) compared with adult (18 years or older)
   age at marriage. Associations between child marriage and health care
   services use were assessed by calculating adjusted odds ratios (OR)
   using logistic regression models after controlling for demographics,
   social equity indicators (education, wealth index, rural residence),
   employment status, and partners' education.
   RESULTS: Overall, 66.1% of ever-married respondents aged 15-24 years in
   Pakistan with at least one childbirth were married before the age of 18
   years. More than half (61.9%) of females married as children had no
   formal education, and the majority (71.0%) resided in rural areas. Child
   marriage was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of any
   prenatal care (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI]
   0.534-0.993) and prenatal care by skilled medical care providers
   (adjusted OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.476-0.871) and increased likelihood of
   delivery assistance by unskilled medical providers (adjusted OR 1.90,
   95% CI 1.435-2.518) and delivery at home (adjusted OR 2.17, 95% CI
   1.617-2.915).
   CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to increase the age of marriage and delay
   childbearing may have population-level effects on reducing disparities
   between females married as children and adults and improving maternal
   and child health in Pakistan.

AB Objective: Childhood deprivation is inimical to health throughout the
   life course. Early experiences of stress could play a role in health
   inequalities. An important aspect of childhood poverty that has not
   received much attention is cardiovascular reactivity to and recovery
   from acute stressors. Methods: Piecewise, multilevel growth curve
   regression was used to examine blood pressure reactivity to and recovery
   from a mental arithmetic task among late adolescents (mean [standard
   deviation] = 17.3 [1.0] years, n = 185) as a function of early childhood
   poverty (9 years). We also tested whether exposure to family conflict at
   age 13 years mediated expected linkages between childhood poverty and
   adolescent blood pressure reactivity and recovery to an acute stressor.
   Results: Blood pressure reactivity was unaffected by household income
   during childhood, but late adolescents with lower household income
   during childhood showed slower systolic (b = -0.29, p =.004) and
   diastolic (b = -0.19, p =.002) recovery. These results include age and
   sex as statistical covariates. The significant poverty impact on
   systolic but not on diastolic blood pressure recovery was mediated by
   exposure to family conflict (95% confidence interval = - 0.1400 to -
   0.0012). Conclusions: We show that late adolescents who grew up in
   poverty have delayed blood pressure recovery from an acute stressor.
   Furthermore, childhood exposure to family conflict, a well-documented
   component of early childhood deprivation, accounted for some of the
   adverse effects of childhood poverty on stressor recovery among these
   adolescents. We discuss the importance of considering physiological
   stress accompanying early experiences of deprivation in thinking about
   health inequalities.

AB Instrumental social support, or aid in the form of labor or money, may
   exert a positive influence on economic welfare and food security.
   Several investigators have found a positive relationship between social
   support and nutritional status, while others have found a negative
   association between social support and central adiposity. In the rural
   Andes, extra-household economic cooperation has long been an important
   adaptive strategy, and the breakdown of these relationships is one
   reason for high rates of rural-to-urban migration, including to the
   Bolivian city of El Alto. This research investigates the influence of
   instrumental support on women's body composition. Information was
   collected on individual perception of instrumental support and
   anthropometric indicators of nutritional status including percent body
   fat (bioelectrical impedance analysis BIA)), BMI, and distribution of
   fat on trunk relative to limbs (Ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold
   (STR)), and multiple linear regression analysis used to test the
   prediction that instrumental social support is positively related to
   body fat stores. Controlling for age and household socioeconomic status,
   perceived access to one or more sources of instrumental support was
   positively and significantly related to overall levels of adiposity.
   There is no evidence that STR mediates the relationship between
   instrumental social support and body composition. This analysis offers
   support for the prediction that economic social support has direct
   effects on women's energy stores. The interpretation of these results is
   somewhat ambiguous given the high levels of overweight and obesity in
   this population. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB This article draws on the conceptual link between power and causality to
   develop an account of the relational, discursive, and performative
   dimensions of power. Each proposed dimension of power is grounded in a
   different understanding of social causes: relational-realist,
   discursive-hermeneutic, and performative-pragmatic. For the purposes of
   empirical analysis, this dimensional schema crosscuts the classic
   sources of power typology developed by Michael Mann and others, thus
   rendering the conceptual apparatus for pursuing sociological research on
   power more complex and explanatorily effective. The schema is
   illustrated by an example from comparative-historical sociology:
   explaining the storming of the Bastille and its effects. A series of
   research questions for investigating the relative autonomy of
   performative power is proposed. Finally, the current schema is situated
   vis-a-vis classic sociological theories of power, including the
   arguments of Steven Lukes, Michel Foucault, and Pierre Bourdieu, among
   others.

AB Social network research is widely considered atheoretical. In contrast,
   in this article I argue that network analysis often mixes two distinct
   theoretical frameworks, creating a logically inconsistent foundation.
   Relationalism rejects essentialism and a priori categories and insists
   upon the intersubjectivity of experience and meaning as well as the
   importance of the content of interactions and their historical setting.
   Formalism is based on a structuralist interpretation of the theoretical
   works of Georg Simmel. Simmel laid out a neo-Kantian program of
   identifying a priori categories of relational types and patterns that
   operate independently of cultural content or historical setting.
   Formalism and relationalism are internally consistent theoretical
   perspectives, but there are tensions between them. To pave the way for
   stronger middle-range theoretical development, I disaggregate the two
   approaches and highlight the contradictions that must be addressed or
   resolved for the construction of any general and inclusive theory.

AB Objective: A quantitative evaluation of self-care behaviors,
   psychosocial stressors, and patient relationships to health care to
   better understand racial disparities in these domains.
   Research Design and Methods: A cross-sectional study of adult patients
   with type 2 diabetes in University of Pennsylvania Healthcare System who
   had a HbA1c test within one month of survey administration. The survey
   instrument included among other items, the Dieter's Inventory of Eating
   Temptations Self-Efficacy instrument (DIET-SE), the Jalowiec Coping
   Scale (JCS), and the Trust in Physician (TIP) scale.
   Results: 332 individuals completed the survey. Poor glucose control was
   significantly associated with Black race, lower income level, other
   demographic variables, non-perfect medication adherence, and poorer diet
   quality. It was also associated with lower self-efficacy to resist
   social dietary temptations, and among White patients it was associated
   was decreased use of a confrontive coping style. However, these factors
   did not explain the racial differences in glucose control between Blacks
   and Whites.
   Conclusions: Interventions aimed at dietary temptations, coping styles,
   or trust in physicians may not reduce racial disparities in glucose
   control. However, interventions that focus on dietary temptations may
   positively affect all diabetic patients.

   controlling for covariates.
   Methods: Seventy-seven Black and White women with type 2 diabetes
   completed the Experiences of Discrimination Scale, which assesses
   self-reported lifetime frequency of racially motivated discrimination.
   Participants provided fasting blood samples for assessment of glucose
   and insulin for determination of IR and A1c. Covariates included age,
   education, waist circumference, diabetes distress, and stressful life
   events.
   Results: In unadjusted regression analysis discrimination was
   significantly associated with IR. There was a trend for a race by
   discrimination interaction, with a weaker effect for Blacks than Whites.
   Follow up analysis showed that discrimination was significantly
   associated with IR in both Blacks and Whites, even after adjustment, as
   was waist circumference. In unadjusted regression analysis,
   discrimination was significantly associated with A1c. There was a
   significant race by discrimination interaction. Follow up analysis
   showed that discrimination was not significantly associated with A1c
   among Blacks, but was among Whites, even after adjustment, as was
   diabetes distress and insulin use.
   Conclusions: Racial discrimination is associated with insulin resistance
   in Black and White women with diabetes, and with A1c in White women with

   with diabetes.
   Design: Quantitative and qualitative methods.
   Setting: Community health centers in central and western Massachusetts.
   Participants: Low-income Latinos (N=252) enrolled in a randomized
   diabetes self-management intervention trial. Measures: Construct
   validity, internal consistency, sensitivity to change over time.
   Results: The LSESLD demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's

AB Our evaluation study identifies facilitators and barriers to
   participation among families participating in the treatment arm of
   Stanford ECHALE. This culturally tailored obesity prevention trial
   consisted of a combined intervention with two main treatment components:
   1) a folkloric dance program; and 2) a screen time reduction curriculum
   designed for 7-11 year old Latinas and their families. We conducted 83
   interviews (40 parents and 43 girls) in participant homes after 6 months
   of enrollment in the ECHALE trial. The Spradley ethnographic method and
   NVivo 8.0 were used to code and analyze narrative data. Three domains
   emerged for understanding participation: 1) family cohesiveness; 2)
   perceived gains; and 3) culturally relevant program structure. Two
   domains emerged for non-participation: program requirements and
   perceived discomforts. Non-parametric, Spearman's rank correlation
   coefficients were calculated to assess the relationships with
   participant attendance data. Sustained participation was most strongly
   influenced by the domain perceived gains when parents reported better
   self-esteem, confidence, improved attitude, improved grades, etc.
   (Spearman r=.45, P=.003). Alternatively, under the domain, perceived
   discomforts, with subthemes such as child bullying, participation in the
   combined intervention was inversely associated with attendance (Spearman
   r=.38, P=.02). Family-centered, school-based, community obesity
   prevention programs that focus on tangible short-term gains for girls
   may generate greater participation rates, enhance social capital, and
   promote community empowerment. These factors can be emphasized in future
   obesity prevention program design and implementation.

AB Using the National Survey of American Life, a nationally representative

   whether the endorsement of racial/ethnic stereotypes was associated with
   excess body fat composition among African Americans (n= 3,265) and Black
   Caribbeans (n=1,332) living in the United States. We used ordinary least
   squares and multinomial logistic regression analyses controlling for

   the endorsement of racial/ethnic stereotypes was associated with
   increased body mass index and weight among African American males
   (b=.57, P <.05) and females (b=.50 P <.05). Further, results from the
   adjusted multinomial logistic regression suggested that African American
   males who endorsed racial/ethnic stereotypes were more likely to be
   obese (odds ratio =1.33, P <.05), than African American males who did
   not endorse racial/ethnic stereotypes. Surprising, a positive
   relationship was not found among Black Caribbeans. Future studies should
   examine the relationship between internalized discrimination and
   endorsements of negative racial/ethnic stereotypes and excess fat
   accumulation among ethnically heterogeneous samples of Blacks.

AB Objective: The purpose was to gain an indepth understanding of the
   factors influencing hypertension medication compliance among
   hypertensive older African Americans.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive. In depth semi-structured interviews
   were conducted with 28 patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed,
   and analyzed by the Colaizzi-style method.
   Setting: Patients at a cardiovascular clinic in the Southeast.
   Patients: 28 African American males and females aged with controlled and
   uncontrolled hypertension were recruited and interviewed.
   Results: Stroke Heart Attack and Prevention Program (SHAPP) patients
   reported self-efficacy, patient-provider communication, and social
   support contributed to their hypertension regimen compliance. Patients
   reported higher self-efficacy contributed to their hypertension control.
   Patients also reported that open communication with the SHAPP nurses and
   social support from their family, friends, and coworkers provided
   emotional support, information and guidance to assist them in being
   compliant with their hypertension management regimen.
   Conclusions: Our results can inform SHAPP providers and staff about
   patients' hypertension medication compliance, can improve
   patient-provider communication in other SHAPP clinics, and can aid in
   future patient hypertension management. Our results also suggest the
   importance of self-efficacy, patient-provider communication, and social

AB Objective: Hypertension (HTN) contributes to vascular disease, and is
   increasingly common in non-western, rural contexts, such as the Yup'ik
   people of Southwestern Alaska. While much is known regarding HTN risk
   factors in western contexts, little is known about their relevance to
   non-western populations. We explore an American Heart Association risk
   factor model for HTN in predicting risk and protection from HTN among
   Yup'ik people.
   Methods: Using data from 1015 Yup'ik individuals residing in remote
   Southwestern Alaska, we explore age, sex, education, waist
   circumference, physical activity, tobacco, social support, and cultural
   identification in multinomial logistic regressions comparing
   pre-hypertension (pre-HTN; systolic 120 to 129 mm Hg), and hypertension
   (HTN; systolic >= 130 mm Hg) to optimal blood pressure (opt-BP; systolic
   < 120 mm Hg).
   Results: We find positive associations between age (2%, 5% greater odds
   respectively), waist circumference (3%, 5% greater odds respectively)
   and hypertension medication usage (60%, 85% greater odds respectively)
   with both pre-HTN and HTN. We also find men have 86% greater odds of
   pre-HTN, people with fasting blood glucose >= 110 mg/dL have 52%
   increased odds of pre-HTN, and married persons have 19% lower odds of
   having pre-HTN compared to having opt-BP. Bicultural identification
   mitigates age related increases in BP and deleterious effects of low
   formal education.
   Conclusions: While model continuities are noted in our Yup'ik study,
   important points of divergence are also noted. Future research on
   cultural identification and social support has promising implications
   for guiding responsive interventions.

AB Objectives: Sleep problems appear to differentially affect racial
   minorities and people of lower socioeconomic status (SES). These
   population subgroups also have higher rates of many debilitating
   diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension,
   coronary heart disease, stroke, and mortality. Considering the presence
   of social disparities in sleep and chronic disease, this research aims
   to assess the role of sleep disparities in the incidence of obesity,
   T2DM, hypertension, and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Design: The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey is a
   population-based random-sample cohort of 5502 participants aged 30 79.
   Sleep restriction (<= 5 hours/night) and restless sleep were assessed at
   baseline. Health status was ascertained at baseline and approximately 5
   years later among 1610 men and 2535 women who completed follow-up.
   Setting: Participants completed an in-person, home visit, interview at
   baseline (2002-2005) and follow-up (2006-2010).
   Participants: Boston, Massachusetts residents (2301 men, 3201 women)
   aged 30-79 years from three racial groups (1767 Black, 1876 Hispanic,
   1859 White) participated in the BACH Survey.
   Results: There were significant differences in the prevalence of
   sleep-related problems at baseline by both race and SES as well as
   significant disparities in the incidence of T2DM, high blood pressure
   and cardiovascular disease at follow-up. Restless sleep was associated
   with an increased risk of obesity, T2DM, and CVD. However, we found that
   sleep does not mediate social disparities in health outcomes.
   Conclusions: Results from the BACH Survey confirm large social
   disparities in health outcomes as well as large social disparities in
   short sleep duration and restless sleep. However, sleep did not appear
   to mediate the relationship between race, SES, and health disparities.

AB Background: The Communities Putting Prevention to Work: Chronic Disease
   Self-Management Program (CDSMP) Initiative funded. grantees in 45
   states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to implement and expand
   delivery of CDSMP to older adults. We examine whether there are
   differences in the enrollment and completion rates of members of racial
   and ethnic minority groups and what sites have done to enhance their
   delivery of the CDSMP to such groups.
   Method: This study used a multi-method approach including: site visits
   to 6 states, telephone interviews with the 47 program grantees and
   delivery sites, review of program reports, and analysis of
   administrative data on participants, completers, workshops and leaders.
   Results: Grantees served 89,861 participants, including 56.3% who
   self-identified as White, 17.3% as Black, 5.0% as other/multi-racial,
   3.2% as Asian/Asian Americans, 1.4% as American Indian/Alaskans,.8% as
   Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders, and 16.0% individuals of unknown
   race. Overall, completion rates averaged 74.5%, with Native
   Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders completing workshops at a higher rate (90.6%)
   than other groups. Completion rates for participants aged were higher
   than for younger participants. Senior centers, health care
   organizations, and residential facilities served 63.1% of the
   participants.
   Conclusions: Grantees have successfully delivered CDSMP to racially and
   ethnically diverse participants in a. range of settings. As the
   Administration for Community Living/Administration on Aging (ACL/AoA)
   grantees have demonstrated, CDSMP can be brought to scale by community
   organizations, partnerships and networks to reach diverse populations in
   diverse settings. The program can be a significant tool for addressing
   health disparities and empowering racial/ethnic minorities to take
   charge, promote better health and self-management of chronic conditions.

   concept ((1)) offers a new framework for theorizing and better

   consumption units have organizational logics, preferences, strengths,
   and vulnerabilities that are consequentially distinct from market logic
   of production and profit, and ((3)) focuses attention on social
   processes and features enabling theorization of general social patterns

AB Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together
   increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation
   faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to
   be established disproportionately between those sharing significant
   social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author
   explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup
   relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar
   others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on
   interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S.
   dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on
   educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on
   marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for
   the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a
   two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its
   empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the
   homophily hurdle.

   intensive treatment aimed to improve child-initiated social
   communication in children with autism. Six children between the ages of
   47 and 78 months were provided with 40 h of SRP, with preto
   post-treatment behavioral changes tested using a novel passive
   interaction probe task. Results showed an increase in the frequency of
   spontaneous social orienting and gestural communication for the
   experimental children, compared to six age- and behaviorallymatched
   control children with autism. In addition, for the children who received
   treatment, the duration of social dyadic interactions and total time
   spent engaged in social interaction increased from pre- to
   post-treatment. These findings suggest that intensive intervention
   focused on fostering child-initiated interaction increases
   social-communicative behaviors in children with autism.
   Learning outcomes: Readers will be able to describe the principles
   underlying the Son-Rise Program, a developmental approach to treatment
   for autism. Readers will be able to explain the methods of the
   investigation of a 5-day intensive Son-Rise Program and the results that
   report change in social communication in children with autism. (C) 2013

AB Despite the international controversies surrounding religious
   restrictions and freedoms, the topic has only recently received
   substantial research attention. Drawing on this new body of research,
   and multiple research projects in progress, this address explores both
   the origins and consequences of religious restrictions in the global
   arena. To understand the motives for restrictions, I propose hypotheses
   in three areas: the relationship or lack of relationship between
   institutional religion and the state, the willingness and capacity of
   the state to ensure freedoms, and the larger social and cultural
   pressures restricting freedoms, including social and political movements
   targeting minority religions. Turning to the consequences of religious
   restrictions, I explore how and why restrictions alter the religious
   economy (i.e., formation, supply, and operation of religions) and are
   associated with higher levels of religious persecution, religious
   violence, and intrastate conflict in general. Finally, I review
   additional areas where research is needed.

AB The emergence of recovery as an organizing construct for behavioral
   health public policy and the resulting push to increase the recovery
   orientation of addiction treatment have sparked renewed questions about
   the prevalence of substance use disorder (SUD) remission/recovery within
   the general population. The present study reports findings on
   recovery-related questions imbedded within a public health survey
   conducted in Philadelphia and four adjacent counties in Southeastern
   Pennsylvania. The results reveal an adult recovery prevalence rate
   (9.4%) comparable to rates found in national surveys, but key measures
   of physical, emotional, and social health of adults in recovery suggest
   the need for assertive, sustained, and community-based approaches to
   recovery management that transcend brief episodes of professional
   intervention.

AB Objective: Intravenous drug use (IDU) remains a prominent pathway of HIV
   transmission in the United States, though little is known about
   modifiable factors influencing quality of life among IDUs. The goal of
   this study was to evaluate the influence of psychological variables (e.
   g., depression and anxiety) on health-related quality of life among
   HIV-positive individuals with a history of IDU who were enrolled in
   outpatient treatment for opioid dependence. Method: 108 HIV-positive
   individuals with a history of IDU and participating in current
   outpatient treatment for opiate dependence who were screened for
   participation in a depression and adherence study reported
   sociodemographic data, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and
   health-related quality of life (HRQoL; Multidimensional Health
   Assessment using the ACTG-SF 21). Results: Multiple regression models
   controlling for disease stage and background characteristics identified
   significant negative relationships between General Health Perception and
   Functioning without Pain for anxiety and depression, and between Role
   Functioning and Physical Functioning for anxiety. CD4 cell count was
   significantly related to Physical Functioning only. Conclusions: Results
   indicate that distress (both depression and anxiety) contribute
   significantly to variation in HRQoL over and above the effects of
   disease variables. Effective depression and anxiety treatment may result
   in improved overall functioning.

AB Critical interventionist ethnography has recently come into vogue within
   the Sociology of Sport. More specifically, many in our field believe
   that merely studying and writing up studies on physical culture is not
   enough, and that work within the field needs to be more impactful,
   meaningful, and exact various forms of social justice. As such, in this
   paper Twill discuss how the turn to social justice has had a profound
   effect on my research agenda. In so doing, I will outline the
   difficulties and challenges inherent in such a political project by
   critically reflecting on my first ethnographic research project on the
   Little League World Series an admittedly failed attempt at critical
   intervention. I hope to help foster better and more successful research
   projects within the field by looking back at some of the key mistakes I
   made at this site while simultaneously encouraging others to be public
   pedagogues.

AB When Charles Darwin set out to relate his theory of evolution by natural
   selection to humans he discovered that a complementary explanation was
   needed to properly understand the great variation seen in human
   behavior. The resulting work, The Descent of Man and Selection in
   Relation to Sex, laid out the defining principles and evidence of sexual
   selection. In brief, this work is best known for illuminating the
   typically male strategy of intrasexual competition and the typically
   female response of intersexual choice. While these sexual stereotypes
   were first laid out by Darwin, they grew in importance when, years
   later, A. J. Bateman, in a careful study of Drosophila mating
   strategies, noted that multiple mating appeared to provide great benefit
   to male reproductive success, but to have no such effect on females. As
   a result, female choice soon became synonymous with being coy, and only
   males were thought to gain from promiscuous behavior. However, the last
   thirty years of research have served to question much of the traditional
   wisdom about sex differences proposed by Darwin and Bateman,
   illuminating the many ways that women (and females more generally) can
   and do engage in multiple mating.

AB IMPORTANCE Individuals with age-related eye disease (ARED) need to use
   eye care services for detection, assessment, and care at regular
   intervals.
   OBJECTIVE To explore the association between socioeconomic position
   (SEP) and use of eye care services among US adults with self-reported
   ARED during 2002 and 2008.
   DESIGN Data were from the National Health Interview Survey 2002 and
   2008. We used multiple logistic regression to estimate predictive
   margins, controlling for other factors, and we used the slope index of
   inequality to measure the relationship between SEP and use of eye care
   services across the entire distributions of poverty-income ratio (PIR)
   and educational attainment.
   SETTING A cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of adults,
   with prevalence estimates weighted to represent the civilian,
   noninstitutionalized US population.
   PARTICIPANTS The sample included US participants in the 2002 (n = 3586)
   and the 2008 (n = 3104) National Health Interview Survey who were at
   least 40 years old and reported any ARED (age-related macular
   degeneration, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, or glaucoma).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Use of eye care services; SEP was measured by
   the PIR and educational attainment.
   RESULTS In 2002, persons with ARED and a PIR of less than 1.50 were
   significantly less likely than those with a PIR of at least 5 to report
   visiting an eye care provider (62.7% vs 80.1%; P < .001) or undergoing a
   dilated eye examination in the past 12 months (64.3% vs 80.4%; P <
   .001), after adjustment for other factors. Similarly, persons with less
   than a high school education were less likely than those with at least a
   college education to report a visit to an eye care provider (62.9% vs
   80.8%; P < .001) or dilated eye examination (64.8% vs 81.4%; P < .001).
   In 2002, the slope index of inequality showed statistically significant
   differences for eye care provider visits across the levels of education
   (24.4; P = .006), and in 2008, it showed a significant difference for
   eye care provider visits across the levels of educational attainment
   (25.2; P = .049) and PIR (21.8; P = .01).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Significant differences in the use of eye care
   services by SEP persist among US adults with eye diseases.

AB Agricultural crops are investments that can be exploited by others.
   Farmer clones of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum carry
   bacteria to seed out new food populations but they also carry other
   non-food bacteria such as Burkholderia spp. Here we demonstrate that
   these farmer-carried Burkholderia inhibit the growth of non-farmer D.
   discoideum clones that could exploit the farmers' crops. Using
   supernatants, we show that inhibition is due to molecules secreted by
   Burkholderia. When farmer and non-farmer amoebae are mixed together at
   various frequencies and allowed to complete the social stage, the
   ability of non-farmers to produce spores falls off rapidly with an
   increase in the percentage of farmers and their defensive symbionts.
   Conversely, farmer spore production is unaffected by the frequency of
   non-farmers. Our results suggest that successful farming is a complex
   evolutionary adaptation because it requires additional strategies, such
   as recruiting third parties, to effectively defend and privatize crops.

AB Background: Disasters occur randomly and can severely tax the health
   care delivery system of affected and surrounding regions. A significant
   proportion of disaster survivors are children, who have unique medical,
   psychosocial, and logistical needs after a mass casualty event. Children
   are often transported to specialty centers after disasters for a higher
   level of pediatric care, but this can also lead to separation of these
   survivors from their families. In a recent theoretical article, we
   showed that the availability of a pediatric trauma center after a mass
   casualty event would decrease the time needed to definitively treat the
   pediatric survivor cohort and decrease pediatric mortality. However, we
   also found that if the pediatric center was too slow in admitting and
   discharging patients, these benefits were at risk of being lost as
   children became "trapped" in the slow center. We hypothesized that this
   effect could result in further increased mortality and greater costs.
   Methods: Here, we expand on these ideas to test this hypothesis via
   mathematical simulation. We examine how a delay in discharge of part of
   the pediatric cohort is predicted to affect mortality and the cost of
   inpatient care in the setting of our model.
   Results: We find that mortality would increase slightly (from
   14.2%-16.1%), and the cost of inpatient care increases dramatically (by
   a factor of 21) if children are discharged at rates consistent with
   reported delays to reunification after a disaster from the literature.
   Conclusions: Our results argue for the ongoing improvement of
   identification technology and logistics for rapid reunification of
   pediatric survivors with their families after mass casualty events. (C-)

AB Background: The number of black trauma deaths attributable to racial
   disparities is unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the
   excess mortality experienced by black patients given disparities in the
   risk of mortality.
   Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients
   aged 16-65 y with blunt and penetrating injuries, who were included in
   the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007-2010. Generalized linear
   modeling estimated the relative risk of death for black patients versus
   white patients, adjusting for known confounders. This analysis
   determined the difference in the observed number of black trauma deaths
   at Level I and II centers and the expected number of deaths if the risk
   of mortality for black patients had been equivalent to that of white
   patients.
   Results: A total of 1.06 million patients were included. Among patients
   with blunt and penetrating injuries at Level I trauma centers, white
   males and females had a relative risk of death of 0.82 (95% confidence
   interval [CI], 0.80-0.85) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.74-0.83), respectively,
   compared with black patients. Similarly, at Level II trauma centers,
   white males and females had a relative risk of death of 0.84 (95% CI,
   0.80-0.88) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.91). Overall, of the estimated
   41,613 deaths that occurred at Level I and II centers, 2206 (5.3%) were
   excess deaths among black patients.
   Conclusions: Over a 4-y period, approximately 5% of trauma center deaths
   could be attributed to racial disparities in trauma outcomes. These data
   underscore the need to better understand and intervene against the
   mechanisms that lead to trauma outcomes disparities. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB Racial and ethnic health disparities in reproductive medicine exist
   across the life span and are costly and burdensome to our healthcare
   system. Reduction and ultimate elimination of health disparities is a
   priority of the National Institutes of Health who requires reporting of
   race and ethnicity for all clinical research it supports. Given the
   increasing rates of admixture in our population, the definition and
   subsequent genetic significance of self-reported race and ethnicity used
   in health disparity research is not straightforward. Some groups have
   advocated using self-reported ancestry or carefully selected
   single-nucleotide polymorphisms, also known as ancestry informative
   markers, to sort individuals into populations. Despite the limitations
   in our current definitions of race and ethnicity in research, there are
   several clear examples of health inequalities in reproductive medicine
   extending from puberty and infertility to obstetric outcomes. We
   acknowledge that socioeconomic status, education, insurance status, and
   overall access to care likely contribute to the differences, but these
   factors do not fully explain the disparities. Epigenetics may provide
   the biologic link between these environmental factors and the
   transgenerational disparities that are observed. We propose an
   integrated view of health disparities across the life span and
   generations focusing on the metabolic aspects of fetal programming and
   the effects of environmental exposures. Interventions aimed at improving
   nutrition and minimizing adverse environmental exposures may act
   synergistically to reverse the effects of these epigenetic marks and
   improve the outcome of our future generations.

AB The question of whether or not children, particularly girls, are
   entering puberty earlier than they did in the past has been a concern in
   both the medical community and the general population. A secular trend
   analysis of the current data on pubertal timing in boys and girls is
   limited by variations in the study design, the population assessed, and
   the methods used to determine pubertal development. These differences
   present a challenge when interpreting the available data, especially
   when comparing multiple studies. The influence of race on pubertal
   timing and development had not been assessed before the 1970s. The
   purpose of this article is to review the reported variations in pubertal
   timing among different racial/ethnic groups. Data suggest African
   American girls enter puberty earlier and reach menarche earlier than
   Caucasian and Hispanic girls. In addition, the trend toward earlier
   timing of puberty seems to be occurring faster in African American girls
   compared with Caucasian girls over the past 25 years. While the
   mechanism and understanding of the cause of racial disparities in
   pubertal development remain to be discerned, genetic and/or
   environmental factors may play a role and require further investigation.

AB Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine
   disorders and affects approximately 5 to 10% of women of reproductive
   age. There exists substantial variation of physical stigmata and
   clinical symptoms among women, but PCOS has been known to be associated
   with irregular periods, infertility, increased pregnancy complications,
   as well as nonreproductive health problems arising from its association
   with the metabolic syndrome. Over the years, there have been various
   consensus statements regarding the diagnostic criteria, but the varying
   pronouncements suggest that the underlying cause is still not well
   understood and may be multifaceted. Importantly, the interaction of
   genetic predisposition and local environment is possibly responsible for
   the heterogeneity of phenotypes seen; it has been demonstrated that
   there is substantial ethnic and racial variation in the clinical
   presentations among PCOS patients and related individuals may vary in
   appearance based on nutritional and other aspects of locale. The
   differences in phenotype and clinical symptoms of PCOS related to the
   clinical, hormonal, and metabolic characteristics among various ethnic
   backgrounds, including Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and
   Indians, need to be considered when assessing and treating these
   individuals. Future research must address the importance of interactions
   between genotype and the environment.

AB Uterine leiomyomas are the most common benign gynecologic condition. The
   prevalence is three times more common among women of African ethnicity.
   Disparity in this disease is evidenced by earlier age of onset, greater
   severity of symptoms, and different response to treatment. Although the
   pathogenesis of disease development is not completely known, growing
   evidence focuses on investigating the molecular mechanisms in disease
   development and the influence of ethnicity. Variation in the expression
   levels or function of estrogen and progesterone receptors, polymorphism
   of genes involved in estrogen synthesis and/or metabolism (COMT, CYP17),
   retinoic acid nuclear receptors (retinoid acid receptor-, retinoid X
   receptor-), and aberrant expression of micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are some of
   the molecular mechanisms that may be involved. Nutritional factors, such
   as vitamin D deficiency, might also contribute to the higher incidence
   in dark skinned populations who are also commonly suffer from
   hypovitaminosis D. Culture and environmental difference might have a
   role in disease development. Further analysis and better understanding
   of these mechanisms will provide insight into the molecular basis of
   racial disparities in leiomyoma formation and will help to develop new
   innovations in leiomyoma treatment.

AB More than 4 million menopausal women are from ethnic minority groups.
   Over the past 25 years, recognition of the importance of social,
   emotional, and physical changes of midlife to women's long-term health
   and well-being has emerged. Multiple factors influence how a woman
   perceives menopausal changes and what she addresses as associated
   symptoms. Factors such as educational level to socioeconomic status,
   health-related factors, stress, and marital status influence these
   choices. Increasingly, researchers are reporting on the impact of race
   and ethnicity on menopausal symptoms. Understanding similarities and
   differences among women's perceptions, attitudes, and expectations
   surrounding menopause improves delivery of culturally appropriate care
   and promotes lifestyles that may decrease symptoms and increase quality
   of life. Historically, the majority of the research in this area has
   been conducted in Western countries with clinical samples of women
   predominantly from European backgrounds. Thus, this population has
   shaped the emerging clinical picture of the midlife menopausal
   transition. Recently, studies of non-European women, both in the United
   States and internationally, indicate significant variations in their
   experiences during this transition, but these cultural differences have
   not broadened the understanding of the meaning of this universal
   experience. To date, there are still large knowledge gaps in race,
   ethnic, and cultural differences in menopausal health. The content of
   this review summarizes the current body of knowledge on racial
   differences in the menopause experience.

AB Recent studies of postcolonial science and technology have emphasized
   relationships competitive, collaborative or otherwise - between
   scientists and other kinds of knowledge producers or stakeholders. This
   article explores the transnational connections and debates of scientists
   who are themselves positioned differently in the world. Combining
   methods from intellectual history and multi-sited ethnography, the
   article documents the case of a team of exercise physiologists working
   in South Africa. The South Africans must balance, on the one hand,
   standardizing laboratory practice to produce credible scientific claims
   with, on the other hand, innovating new techniques to deal with the
   everyday circumstances of experiment. Although a tension between
   standardization and innovation is to be expected in laboratory practice,
   the 'technical tightrope' scientists from the global South must walk is
   both more fragile and more politicized than in the North. Interestingly,
   these acts of standardization and innovation are designed to intervene
   in a century-old debate over the causes of human fatigue: whether or not
   fatigue begins in 'the center', the mind, or 'the periphery', the
   muscles. In exercise physiology, then, a 'center-periphery dynamic'
   emerges in two entangled registers: one in terms of the geopolitical
   landscape of science and the other in terms of models of human
   physiology.

AB Genome sequencing technology is the basis of personalized genomic
   medicine and expansion of this technology will likely lead to widespread
   personalized medicine. Innovation in the highly competitive
   biotechnology industry is leading to a substantial decline in the price
   of whole genome sequencing, which will increase access to this
   technology. Also, the US National Institutes of Health recently invested
   $25 million in newborn genome sequencing, which will substantially
   increase the number of newborns and thereby parents with genome sequence
   data, albeit in research studies. These concurrent events are likely to
   stimulate an era of personalized medicine that begins at birth. This era
   has come faster than expected by scientists, policymakers, ethicists,
   and clinicians. In order for newborn genome sequencing to proceed in a
   manner that maximizes its benefits, countries need to consider key
   ethical, social, and legal implications of this technology, which are
   likely to affect its uptake and impact on their societies - namely
   patent protection of DNA, reimbursement, genetic discrimination, and
   equitable distribution of the technology. In this article, the authors
   review these challenges and assess whether countries are prepared to
   address them. With an adequate understanding of these issues,
   policymakers worldwide-advised by experts and their citizenry-can
   develop well-designed policies that increase the societal benefits of
   newborn genome sequencing and limit any potential harm to their
   societies.

AB Background: College drinking is embedded in a social context, drawing
   attention to the effects of social network composition on consumption.
   The presence of heavy drinking friends in social networks predicts later
   alcohol misuse, but little is known about how the composition of one's
   social network composition changes over time. This study identified
   changes in social network composition in a sample of at-risk students
   and examined the relationship among network trajectories, alcohol
   consumption, and descriptive norms.
   Methods: Participants were 503 students (64% male) mandated to
   participate in an alcohol prevention intervention for residence hall
   alcohol policy violations. At baseline, students provided self-report
   data about alcohol consumption, perceived peer drinking norms, and peer
   alcohol involvement. Parallel assessments were completed at 6- and
   12-months post-baseline.
   Results: Growth-mixture models identified four groups of individuals
   with similar levels of heavy drinkers in their social networks. The
   majority of students had stable or decreasing numbers of heavy drinkers
   in their networks across the study, whereas two groups reported
   relatively stable densities of heavy drinkers from baseline to 6-months
   and increasing densities from 6- to 12-months. At baseline, the four
   groups were generally equivalent on consumption and normative
   perceptions. At 6- and 12-months, however, the groups differed
   significantly on consumption and norms.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that changes in the number of heavy
   drinkers in college students' social networks may have significant
   implications for at-risk drinking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

AB Race and ethnicity affect children's risk of secondhand smoke exposure.
   However, little is known about how race and language preference impact
   parents' self-reported smoking and stopping smoking rates. We analyzed
   data for 16,523 children aged 0-11 years from a pediatric computer
   decision support system (Child Health Improvement through Computer
   Automation [CHICA]). CHICA asks families in the waiting room about
   household smokers. We examined associations between race, insurance,
   language preference, and household smoking and reported stopping smoking
   rates using logistic regression. Almost a quarter (23%) of the
   children's families reported a smoker at home. Hispanic children are
   least likely (odds ratio [OR]: 0.17, confidence interval [CI]:
   0.12-0.24) to have secondhand smoke exposure when compared to African
   American and white children, as were those with private insurance (OR:
   0.52, CI: 0.43-0.64) or no insurance (OR: 0.79, CI: 0.71-0.88) compared
   to publicly insured. Children from English speaking families were more
   likely (OR: 1.55, CI: 1.24-1.95) to have secondhand smoke exposure
   compared to Spanish speaking families. Among smoking families, 30%
   reported stopping smoking subsequently. Stopping rates were higher in
   Hispanic (OR: 3.25, CI: 2.06-5.13) and African American (OR: 1.39, CI:
   1.01-1.91) families compared to white children's families. Uninsured
   families were less likely than publicly insured families to report
   stopping smoking (OR: 0.76, CI: 0.63-0.92). English speaking families
   were less likely (OR: 0.56, CI: 0.41-0.75) to report stopping smoking
   compared to Spanish speaking even in a subgroup analyses of Hispanic
   families (OR: 0.55, CI: 0.39-0.76). In our safety net practices serving
   children predominantly on public insurance, Spanish speaking families
   reported the lowest risk of secondhand smoke exposure in children and
   the highest rate of stopping smoking in the household. Hispanic families
   may have increasing secondhand exposure and decreasing rates of stopping
   smoking as they acculturate.

AB Human populations vary demographically with population sizes ranging
   from small groups of hunter-gatherers with less than fifty individuals
   to vast cities containing many millions. Here we investigate how the
   cultural transmission of traits affecting survival, fertility, or both
   can influence the birth rate, age structure, and asymptotic growth rate
   of a population. We show that the strong spread of such a trait can lead
   to a demographic transition, similar to that experienced in Europe in
   the late 19th and early 20th centuries, without using ecological or
   economic optimizing models. We also show that the spread of a cultural
   trait that increases fertility, but not survival, can cause demographic
   change similar to the 'Neolithic demographic transition': a period of
   increased population growth that is thought to have accompanied the
   transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural lifestyles. We
   investigate the roles of vertical, oblique, and horizontal learning of
   such a trait in this transition and find that compared to vertical
   learning alone, horizontal and oblique learning can accelerate the
   trait's spread, lead to faster population growth, and increase its
   equilibrium frequency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   of health contribute significantly to health disparities beyond effects
   associated with work. Guided by a theory-driven model, we identified
   pathways by which social determinants shape immigrant worker health.
   Method Associations between known social determinants of mental health
   problems and substance use (social discrimination, job and employment
   concerns, and social support) were examined using structural equation
   modeling in a sample of 1,397 immigrants from the Filipino American
   Community Epidemiological Study.
   Results Social discrimination and low social support were associated

AB An important and potentially underused source of biomass that could be
   utilized in energy production is from nonindustrial private woodlands.
   We employ the Theory of Planned Behavior to estimate the social
   availability of woody biomass as a function of landowner behavior
   intent, landowner characteristics, forest land characteristics, and
   biomass price on stated willingness to harvest biomass in conjunction
   with a commercial timber harvest. A mail survey was administered to 1109
   nonindustrial private woodland owners in a 26-county region in northeast
   Minnesota and northwest Wisconsin during the fall of 2009. Using binary
   logistic regression, we found payment level offered to harvest biomass
   plays a significant role in landowners' decisions, but that non-monetary
   factors are also important. Landowner attitudes and opinions regarding
   soil impacts, aesthetics, and energy independence were important
   predictors of stated willingness to harvest. Social norms as manifested
   through the influence of neighbors were also significant. These findings
   expand existing research and are useful for profiling nonindustrial
   private woodland owners to identify sustainable sources of biomass to
   supply a burgeoning bioenergy sector in the Lake States. (C) 2013

AB Two contrasting visions of heroism and democracy have evolved side by
   side. An "exclusive" vision presents democracy as involving heroic
   leadership by exceptional individuals along with relatively limited
   volunteer participation by ordinary citizens. This "exclusive" vision
   has been supported by the personalization of politics, as well as the
   increased importance of elite leaders in an era of candidate-centered
   democracy. In contrast, an "inclusive" vision depicts heroism as
   integral to everyday life for ordinary people, and widespread volunteer
   participation in social life as normative in all democracies. In a study
   we conducted that involved a nationally representative sample of 4,000
   adults in the United States, about a third reported considerable
   volunteering, and one out of five reported having carried out a heroic
   act. A detailed analysis of types of volunteering and heroism supports
   an inclusive vision of heroism and democracy. However, a number of
   trends associated with globalization and technology suggest increasing
   challenges to this inclusive vision.

AB Purpose: Advanced maternal age and altered recombination are known risk
   factors for Down syndrome cases due to maternal nondisjunction of
   chromosome 21, whereas the impact of other environmental and genetic
   factors is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate an
   association between low maternal socioeconomic status and chromosome 21
   nondisjunction.
   Methods: Data from 714 case and 977 control families were used to assess
   chromosome 21 meiosis I and meiosis II nondisjunction errors in the
   presence of three low socioeconomic status factors: (i) both parents had
   not completed high school, (ii) both maternal grandparents had not
   completed high school, and (iii) an annual household income of <$25,000.
   We applied logistic regression models and adjusted for covariates,
   including maternal age and race/ethnicity.
   Results: As compared with mothers of controls (n = 977), mothers with
   meiosis II chromosome 21 nondisjunction (n = 182) were more likely to
   have a history of one low socioeconomic status factor (odds ratio =
   1.81; 95% confidence interval = 1.07-3.05) and >= 2 low socioeconomic
   status factors (odds ratio = 2.17; 95% confidence interval = 1.02-4.63).
   This association was driven primarily by having a low household income
   (odds ratio = 1.79; 95% confidence interval = 1.14-2.73). The same
   statistically significant association was not detected among maternal
   meiosis I errors (odds ratio = 1.31; 95% confidence interval =
   0.81-2.10), in spite of having a larger sample size (n = 532).
   Conclusion: We detected a significant association between low maternal
   socioeconomic status and meiosis II chromosome 21 nondisjunction.
   Further studies are warranted to explore which aspects of low maternal
   socioeconomic status, such as environmental exposures or poor nutrition,
   may account for these results.

   whether young patients have worse outcomes than older patients; the
   roles of tumor biology and access to care are critical to answering this
   question. Our objectives were to explore how gastric cancer rates,
   receipt of care, and outcomes are affected by age, poverty, and
   acculturation.
   Methods. A total of 42,187 patients were identified from the 1980-2009
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. We compared trends
   in incidence rates between patients <40, 40-64, and >= 65 years using
   ordinary least-squares regression. Separate multivariate regression
   models were used to evaluate-the impact of age, poverty, and
   acculturation on receipt of cancer-directed therapy and hazard of
   mortality.
   Results. Patients <40 years had stable incidence rates over the 3-decade
   period compared with decreases for patients 40-64 and >= 65 years. They
   are also more likely to present with aggressive, advanced disease
   (P<.0001 for both). On unadjusted and adjusted analyses, patients <40
   years were more likely to receive cancer-directed therapies and have
   better survival than those >= 65 years. Residing in high poverty areas
   was associated with not receiving appropriate cancer-directed therapy;
   the adjusted hazard ratio of mortality for surgically resected patients
   was, however, not affected by poverty. Residing in high immigration
   areas was associated with a low hazard ratio (HR, 0.74; 95% confidence
   interval [CI], 0.7-0.79) of mortality. Foreign-born patients also had a
   low hazard ratio (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83-0.91) of mortality.
   Conclusion. Although trends in incidence rates for patients <40 years
   remain unchanged and their disease is aggressive and advanced at
   presentation, they do not experience disparities in gastric
   cancer-directed therapies and survival after resection. For patients
   residing in impoverished areas or high immigration communities,
   operative resection and adjustment for appropriate aftercare is,
   associated with comparable or better survival when compared with those
   living in low poverty or low immigration areas. Disparities remain in
   receipt of appropriate cancer-directed therapies, and future efforts
   should focus on decreasing structural variations in care and unconscious
   biases regarding patients from these vulnerable communities.

AB Background. Prior studies have demonstrated that race and insurance
   status predict inpatient trauma mortality, but have been limited by
   their inability to adjust for direct measures of socioeconomic status
   (SES) and comorbidities. Our study aimed to identify whether a
   relationship exists between SES and inpatient trauma mortality after
   adjusting for known confounders.
   Methods. Trauma patients aged 18-65 years with an Injury Severity Scores
   (ISS) of >= 9 were identified using the 2003-2009 Nationwide Inpatient
   Sample. Median household income (MHI) by zip code, available by
   quartiles, was used to measure SES. Multiple logistic regression
   analyses were performed to determine odds of inpatient mortality by MHI
   quartile, adjusting for ISS, type of injury, comorbidities, and patient
   demographics.
   Results. In all, 267,621 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients in
   lower wealth quartiles had significantly greater unadjusted inpatient
   mortality compared with the wealthiest quartile. Adjusted odds of death
   were also higher compared with the wealthiest quartile for Q1 (odds
   ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.20), Q2 (OR,
   1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.17), and Q3 (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.19).
   Conclusion. MHI predicts inpatient mortality after adult trauma, even
   after adjusting for race, insurance status, and comorbidities. Efforts
   to mitigate trauma disparities should address SES as an independent
   predictor of outcomes.

AB Gender-moderated gene-environment interactions are rarely explored,
   raising concerns about inaccurate specification of etiological models
   and inferential errors. The current study examined the influence of
   gender, negative and positive daily life events, and GABRA2 genotype
   (SNP rs279871) on alcohol dependence, testing two- and three-way
   interactions between these variables using multi-level regression models
   fit to data from 2,281 White participants in the Collaborative Study on
   the Genetics of Alcoholism. Significant direct effects of variables of
   interest were identified, as well as gender-specific moderation of
   genetic risk on this SNP by social experiences. Higher levels of
   positive life events were protective for men with the high-risk
   genotype, but not among men with the low-risk genotype or women,
   regardless of genotype. Our findings support the disinhibition theory of
   alcohol dependence, suggesting that gender differences in social norms,
   constraints and opportunities, and behavioral undercontrol may explain
   men and women's distinct patterns of association.

AB BACKGROUND Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer are often counseled
   about treatment options with the use of terms that are part of the core
   vocabulary of prostate cancer. It is hypothesized that predominantly
   lower literacy patients would demonstrate a severe lack of comprehension
   of prostate cancer terms, thus validating the findings of a previous
   single-institution study.
   METHODS A previously developed survey was used to evaluate understanding
   of terms related to urinary, bowel, and sexual function. The survey was
   administered by trained evaluators at 2 safety net clinics that provide
   care for low-income, predominantly African American patients.
   Comprehension was assessed using semiqualitative methods coded by 2
   independent investigators. Literacy and numeracy were also evaluated.
   RESULTS Among 109 patients who completed the study, only 5% understood
   the function of the prostate, and 15%, 29%, and 32% understood the terms
   incontinence, urinary function, and bowel habits, respectively. Lower
   levels of comprehension were observed for compound words, such as
   vaginal intercourse (58%), versus single words such as intercourse
   (95%), validating previous work. Median school level was 13 years, yet
   median literacy level was only ninth grade, and reading level was
   significantly correlated with comprehension. Only 30% of patients
   correctly calculated both a fraction and a percent.
   CONCLUSIONS Lack of comprehension of prostate health terminology is
   pronounced in this patient population and may be widespread. This lack
   of comprehension potentially limits the ability of patients to
   participate in informed decision-making. These results validate the
   findings of previous studies and supports a continued need for refined
   methods of prostate cancer education. Cancer 2013;119:3204-3211. (c)

AB Background: Independently, both prematurity and low socioeconomic status
   (SES) compromise language outcome but less is known regarding the
   effects of low SES on outcome of prior preterm infants at toddler age.
   Aim: To assess SES effects on the language outcome of prior preterm
   infants at toddler age.
   Study design: Retrospective chart review of infants born at <= 32 weeks,
   matched for gestational age (GA), birth weight (BW), chronic lung
   disease (CLD), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), right and left
   intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH-R, L), and age at Bayley Scales of
   Infant Development III (BSID-III) testing.
   Subjects: Using insurance status as a proxy for SES, 65 children with
   private insurance (P-Ins) were matched with 65 children with
   Medicaid-type insurance (M-Ins).
   Outcome measures: Bayley Scales of Infant Development-III Language
   Composite.
   Results: M-Ins vs. P-Ins were similar in GA, BW, and age at BSID-III
   testing (mean 22.6 months adjusted), as well as other matched
   characteristics (all p >= 0.16). BSID-III Language Composite scores were
   lower in M-Ins than P-Ins (87.9 +/- 11.3 vs. 101.9 +/- 13.6) with a
   clinically significant effect size of 0.93 (p < 0.001). Overall, 45% of
   M-Ins exhibited mild to moderate language delay compared to 8% of P-Ins.
   Receptive and Expressive subscale scores also were lower in M-Ins than
   in P-Ins (both p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: In this preterm cohort, by toddler age, M-Ins was
   associated with lower scores on measures of overall language as well as
   receptive and expressive language skills. Our findings, showing such an
   early influence of SES on language outcome in a cohort matched for
   biomedical risk, suggest that very early language interventions may be
   especially important for low SES preterm toddlers. (C) 2013 Elsevier

AB In this paper, we argue that the Anthropocene is an epoch characterized
   not only by the anthropogenic dominance of the Earth's ecosystems but
   also by new forms of environmental governance and institutions. Echoing
   the literature in political ecology, we call these new forms of
   environmental governance "global assemblages". Socioecological changes
   associated with global assemblages disproportionately impact poorer
   nations and communities along the development continuum, or the "Global
   South", and others who depend on natural resources for subsistence.
   Although global assemblages are powerful mechanisms of socioecological
   change, we show how transnational networks of grassroots organizations
   are able to resist their negative social and environmental impacts, and
   thus foster socioecological resilience.

AB Rangelands encompass 30-40% of Earth's land surface and support 1 to 2
   billion people. Their predominant use is extensive livestock production
   by pastoralists and ranchers. But rangelands are characterized by
   ecological, economic, and political marginality, and higher value, more
   intensive land uses are impinging on rangelands around the world. Earth
   Stewardship of rangelands must address both livestock management and the
   broader socioecological dynamics that promote land-use changes,
   fragmentation, and degradation. We identify specific gradients on which
   human-rangeland systems can be arrayed, including issues of variability,
   adaptation to disturbance, commercialization, land-use change,
   land-tenure security, and effective governance, and we illustrate the
   gradients' interactions and effects in sites worldwide. The result is a
   synthetic framework to help in understanding how rangeland Earth
   Stewardship can be achieved in the face of marginality, globalization,
   and climate change.

AB Objective: This study examined relations between children's
   susceptibility to alcohol use initiation and parents' alcohol-specific
   beliefs, attitudes, and practices and whether these relations vary by
   parental alcohol use. Method: The sample comprised 1,050 pairs of
   mothers or mother surrogates and their third-grade children (51.8%
   female) recruited for a 4-year intervention trial. Families were
   recruited from school districts located primarily in North Carolina; the
   school districts provided permission for study recruitment materials to
   be distributed to families but were not otherwise involved in the
   research. Data are from the baseline cross-sectional telephone
   interviews conducted with the mothers and children. Children's
   susceptibility to alcohol use initiation is based on child reports, and
   parental alcohol-specific beliefs, attitudes, and practices are based on
   maternal reports. Results: All parental alcohol socialization attributes
   were statistically significantly associated as hypothesized with child
   susceptibility to alcohol use initiation. In the final full model, the
   mother's disapproving attitude about child sipping and the interaction
   between mother child communication and parental alcohol use frequency
   were uniquely significantly associated with child susceptibility.
   Talking with the child about harmful consequences of alcohol use was
   associated with reduced child susceptibility in families where parents
   drank alcohol more frequently but had no relationship with child
   susceptibility in families where parents drank infrequently.
   Conclusions: The normative interactions that parents have with their
   elementary school children may inhibit or facilitate children's
   susceptibility to alcohol use. To the extent that child susceptibility
   leads to early onset of use, prevention programs directed at parents to
   reduce child susceptibility are indicated.

PD SEP 2013

AB Objective: Given that the majority of college cannabis use occurs in
   social situations, descriptive norms (beliefs about others' use) and
   injunctive norms (others' approval of risky use) may be particularly
   relevant to cannabis-related behaviors. Yet, little research has
   examined the unique impact of these norms on one's own behaviors when
   accounting for the variance attributable to other relevant cognitive
   factors. The current study is the first known investigation of the
   unique impact of social norms, cannabis use motives, and cannabis effect
   expectancies on cannabis use. Method: Data came from 223 (64.1% female)
   current cannabis-using undergraduates who completed an online
   questionnaire in exchange for psychology-course research credit.
   Results: Descriptive norms regarding friends (not students in general)
   and injunctive norms (friends and parents) were related to cannabis use
   frequency. Descriptive norms (friends, not students in general) and
   injunctive norms (friends, not parents) were related to cannabis
   problems. Relevant norms, expectancies, and motives accounted for 66.8%
   of the variance in cannabis use frequency and 28.7% of the variance in
   cannabis problems. In multivariate analyses, descriptive norms (friends)
   accounted for the greatest amount of unique variance in cannabis use
   frequency, whereas coping motives accounted for the greatest amount of
   unique variance in cannabis-related problems. Conclusions: Descriptive
   norms (friends) and coping motives may be two cognitive vulnerability
   factors that could be particularly important targets for interventions.

AB Indian men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HIV
   compared to the general Indian population. Psychosocial factors may be
   uniquely associated with HIV risk among Indian MSM and may moderate the
   beneficial impact of standard HIV prevention approaches. Psychiatric
   diagnostic interviews and psychosocial and sexual risk assessments were
   conducted among 150 MSM in Mumbai, India. Logistic regression was
   employed to examine the association of psychiatric disorders and
   psychosocial problems to recent sexual risk behavior. Twenty-five
   percent of participants reported engaging in unprotected anal sex (UAS)
   during their last sexual contact with a man. Men who were married to a
   woman were more likely to have engaged in UAS during their last sexual
   contact with a man (35% vs. 17%, p=0.018). In multivariable models,
   significant predictors of engaging in UAS were current major depression
   (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.61; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07,
   6.39) and number of stressful life events (AOR=0.91; 95% CI 0.83, 0.99).
   Alcohol dependence, anxiety, and self-esteem were not associated with
   engaging in UAS. Indian MSM with depression are at higher odds of
   engaging in UAS compared to MSM without depression. HIV prevention
   programs for Indian MSM may benefit from incorporating treatment or
   triage for mental health problems.

AB Most studies of cultural competence in healthcare examine healthcare

   unique in that it examines the relationship between African-American
   patients' perceptions of the cultural competence of their HIV healthcare
   providers and the adherence of these patients to medical self-care and
   antiretroviral therapy (ART). This cross-sectional, exploratory,
   descriptive study was conducted at the Ruth Rothstein CORE Center in
   Chicago, Illinois. The sample consisted of 202 HIV-positive
   African-Americans who completed surveys during clinic visits. Multiple
   measures were used, including the Patient Assessments of Cultural
   Competency survey instrument developed by the Department of Health and
   Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Medical
   self-care was measured using the advice and instructions scale and the
   self-care symptom management for people living with HIV/AIDS categorical
   scale. ART adherence was measured using the Adherence Behaviors
   Self-Report and Adherence Self-Report scales. The data revealed many
   significant correlations between variables. The more patients believed
   that providers should integrate culture in HIV treatment; the better
   their reported health (F-1,F-138=0.151, P=0.05) and the more they
   followed their provider's advice and instructions (medical self-care;
   F-1,F-138=0.029, P=0.05). Participants who trusted their providers
   engaged in more medical self-care (F-1,F-138=0.280, P=0.01). More shared
   treatment decisions were reported among participants who had higher
   levels of education (F-1,F-127=0.337, P=0.05). Findings of this study
   indicate the need for increased attention to the role of cultural
   competence in HIV/AIDS care. Understanding patient perceptions of
   provider cultural competence has the potential to improve HIV treatment
   adherence and health outcomes.

AB Optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential for
   reducing mortality and morbidity in persons living with HIV/AIDS
   (PLWHA), as well as for reducing the risk of further HIV transmission.
   While studies have identified psychosocial factors such as lack of
   social support and poor mental health status as important barriers to
   optimal ART adherence, few studies have explored the potential of a
   mediation effect of psychosocial factors on the relationship between
   social support and optimal ART adherence. This paper assessed whether
   mental health status mediated the relationship between social support
   and optimal ART adherence among a cross-sectional sample of 202 persons
   living with HIV who were recruited from HIV clinical care sites and
   community-based organizations in Los Angeles County (LAC). Participants
   completed a survey that included social support items from the Medical
   Outcome Study: Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) Instrument, mental health
   measures from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form (SF-12), and ART
   adherence based on self-report. Among those currently taking ART, 61.7%
   reported having optimal adherence. Social support was significantly
   associated with a high score on the mental health status scale (AOR
   =2.90; 95% CI=1.14-5.78) and optimal ART adherence (AOR=1.81; 95%
   CI=1.81; 95% CI=1.18-2.79). When mental health status was introduced
   into the model, the association between social support and optimal ART
   adherence was no longer significant. Our findings suggest the HIV
   interventions targeting social support to improve ART adherence will
   likely be most successful if the support bolsters the mental health of
   the participants. Clearly, better understanding the relationships among
   social support, mental health, and ART adherence will be critical for
   development and implementation of future ART adherence interventions.

AB Background. Cancers of the head and neck are associated with detriments
   in health-related quality of life (HRQOL); however, little is known
   about different experiences between African Americans and non-Hispanic
   whites.
   Methods. HRQOL was measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer
   Therapy - Head and Neck (FACT-H&N) approximately 5 months postdiagnosis
   among 222 patients with cancer from North Carolina. Higher scores
   represent better HRQOL. Regression models included sociodemographic
   characteristics and clinical factors.
   Results. African Americans reported higher physical well-being than
   whites (adjusted means, 23.1 vs 20.9). African Americans with incomes <$
   20,000 reported higher emotional well-being (21.4) and fewer head and
   neck symptoms (22.0). Non-Hispanic whites making <$20,000 reported the
   poorest emotional well-being (17.3), whereas African Americans making
   >$20,000 reported the most head and neck symptoms (18.7).
   Conclusions. Further investigation is needed to explore variation in
   HRQOL experiences among different race and socioeconomic groups that may
   inform resource allocation to improve cancer care. (C) 2012 Wiley

AB Although chronic pain has been linked to poorer psychosocial well-being
   in the spouse, the extent to which patient pain affects spouse sleep is
   unknown. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that
   greater daily knee pain would be associated with poorer sleep for the
   spouse that evening. We also tested the hypothesis that this pain
   contagion is exacerbated in couples who have a close relationship. A
   total of 138 knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients and their spouses
   completed baseline interviews and a 22-day diary assessment. Multilevel
   lagged models indicated that greater knee OA pain at the end of the day
   was associated with spouses' poorer overall sleep quality that night and
   feeling less refreshed after sleep. In contrast, there was no evidence
   that spouse sleep was related to greater patient pain the next day. The
   effects of patient pain on spouse sleep were not due to disturbances in
   patient sleep and were also independent of spouse sex, depressive
   symptoms, and physical comorbidities; both partners' negative affect;
   and the quality of marital interactions throughout the day. As
   predicted, we also found that patient pain was more strongly related to
   less refreshing sleep for spouses who were in a close relationship.
   Findings illustrate that chronic pain may place the spouse's health at
   risk and suggest an important target for couple-oriented interventions.

AB Recent research exposing environmental and social externalities of
   biofuels has undermined the earlier national consensus that they would
   provide climate mitigation and rural development benefits, but support
   for ethanol remains strong in Iowa. The objective of this paper is to
   understand how stakeholder groups in Iowa have framed the benefits and
   risks associated with ethanol's impact on the local economy and
   environment. Our case study draws on in-depth, semi-structured
   interviews conducted with key informants from agricultural
   organizations, environmental organizations, and government departments
   in the state. We find that in Iowa, widespread support for ethanol
   production exists among government, energy, and farm groups, and that
   they frame ethanol production as economically beneficial to rural
   communities and agriculture, while minimizing the possibility of
   associated environmental risks. Although participants from environmental
   organizations in Iowa express apprehension about the environmental
   impacts of expanded corn ethanol production, their unease is muted in
   relation to economic benefits and in relation to other environmental
   issues, and few have publicly voiced their concerns. To understand these
   findings, we draw from the environmental sociology literature that
   examines the role of powerful natural resource interests in framing the
   importance of resource extraction and commodity production to community
   identity and economy and in delegitimizing and naturalizing associated
   environmental issues and problems. We argue that powerful natural
   resource interests in Iowa both naturalize environmental problems
   related to ethanol production and engage in diversionary reframing to
   emphasize the economic benefits while minimizing or rejecting the
   potential environmental risks.

   social conversation often lacking in children with autism. Building on
   research showing that single questions can be taught in isolation, this
   study used a multiple baseline design to investigate whether a
   self-management intervention was effective for teaching concurrent
   acquisition and discrimination of three social questions in the context
   of conversation. Following intervention, participants rapidly increased
   their appropriate use of all three questions in a conversational context
   and maintained these gains over time. The participants also used
   questions appropriately with partners uninvolved in treatment.
   Additionally, the occasional presence of appropriate questions during
   baseline coupled with rapid improvement during intervention support
   theories that a lack of question-asking may be motivation-based rather
   than ability-based.

   improve their socialization with typical peers. Within the context of a
   multiple baseline across participants design, we implemented lunchtime
   activities incorporating the adolescent with ASD's preferred interests
   that were similar to ongoing activities already available at the
   schools. Results showed this increased both level of engagement and
   their rate of initiations made to typical peers. Social validation
   measures suggest that both adolescents with ASD and typical peers

AB Why do individuals with more autistic traits experience social

   stem in part from a challenge in understanding social acting, the
   prosocial pretense that adults routinely produce to maintain positive
   relationships with their ingroup. In Study 1, we developed a
   self-administered test of social-acting understanding: participants read
   stories in which a character engaged in social acting and rated the
   appropriateness of the character's response. Adults who scored 26 or
   higher on the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) questionnaire gave
   significantly lower ratings than comparison participants (AQ < 26).
   Study 2 found that difficulty in understanding social acting, but not
   false beliefs, mediated the link between autistic traits and perceived
   ingroup relationships.

AB Convergent evidence shows that alcohol exerts its effects on social
   behavior via modulation of amygdala reactivity to affective stimuli.
   Given that affective processing involves dynamic interactions between
   the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC), alcohol's effects are
   likely to extend beyond regional changes in brain activity to changes
   that manifest on a broader functional circuit level.
   The current study examines alcohol's effects on functional connectivity
   (i.e., "coupling") between the amygdala and the PFC during the
   processing of socio-emotional stimuli using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI).
   In a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects
   cross-over design, 12 heavy, social drinkers performed an fMRI task
   designed to probe amygdala response to socio-emotional stimuli (angry,
   fearful, and happy faces) following acute ingestion of alcohol or
   placebo. Functional connectivity between the amygdala and PFC was
   examined and compared between alcohol and placebo sessions using a
   conventional generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI)
   analysis.
   Relative to placebo, alcohol reduced functional coupling between the
   amygdala and the right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) during processing of
   both angry and fearful faces. Alcohol also reduced functional coupling
   between the amygdala and left OFC during processing of happy faces.
   These preliminary findings suggest that alcohol's effects on social
   behavior may be mediated by alternations in functional connectivity
   between the amygdala and OFC during processing of emotional faces.

AB Using the 1957-2011 data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, I
   integrate the gender relations theory, a life course perspective, and a

   authority in 1975 (at age 36) and 1993 (at age 54) on breast cancer
   incidence up to 2011. Findings indicate that women with the authority to
   hire, fire, and influence others' pay had a significantly higher risk of
   a breast cancer diagnosis over the next thirty years compared to
   housewives and employed women with no job authority. Because job
   authority conferred the highest risk of breast cancer for women who also
   spent more hours dealing with people at work in 1975,1 suggest that the
   assertion of job authority by women in the 1970 s involved stressful
   interpersonal experiences, such as social isolation and negative social
   interactions, that may have increased the risk of breast cancer via
   prolonged dysregulation of the glucocorticoid system and exposure of
   breast tissue to the adverse effects of chronically elevated cortisol.
   This study contributes to sociology by emphasizing gendered biosocial
   pathways through which women's occupational experiences become embodied
   and drive forward physiological repercussions.

   that factions and status should have non-linear effects on social
   influence, and yet these theories have been evaluated using standard
   linear statistical models. Our formal model of influence includes these
   non-linearities, as specified by the theories. We evaluate the fit of
   the formal model using experimental data. Our results indicate that a
   one-parameter mathematical model fits the experimental data. We conclude
   with the implications of our research and a discussion of how it may be

AB American sociology as a field tends to marginalize psychoanalytic
   perspectives despite scholars Cavalletto and Silver showing that this
   was not the case during Talcott Parson's intellectual heyday in the
   1940s. From the 1970s on, though, constructionists emphasized the
   conservative rather than liberatory side of the Freudian tradition and
   symbolic interactionism took the place of psychoanalysis as the
   legitimized framework for understanding individuals. Marginalization has
   occurred for at least three reasons: (1) the legacies of positivism
   created a bias toward empirically observable rather than relatively
   unmeasurable concepts like the Freudian unconscious; (2) psychoanalysis
   uses internal data whereas sociologists look externally rather than
   inward; (3) because psychoanalysis focuses on individuals and sociology
   on groups, it is argued that the two are incommensurate. Nevertheless,
   even in the face of marginalization, some scholars have combined
   psychoanalytic and sociological perspectives in myriad ways conceiving
   of multi dimensional rather than rationalistic individuals within social
   and cultural settings; exploring interactional dynamics that are at once
   psychic-and-social; and, as in the work of Wilfred Bion, studying the
   psychoanalytic mechanisms of groups themselves. I posit that the ongoing
   marginalization of psychoanalysis deprives the discipline of an
   innovative tool of analysis, an especially salient one at times when the
   emotional and psychological dimensions of social life are glaringly
   evident.

AB Science on emerging environmental health threats involves numerous
   ethical concerns related to scientific uncertainty about conducting,
   interpreting, communicating, and acting upon research findings, but the
   connections between ethical decision making and scientific uncertainty
   are under-studied in sociology. Under conditions of scientific
   uncertainty, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed by formal
   ethical codes of conduct, increasing the importance of ethical
   reflection by researchers, conflicts over research conduct, and reliance
   on informal ethical standards. This article draws on in-depth interviews
   with scientists, regulators, activists, industry representatives, and
   fire safety experts to explore ethical considerations of moments of
   uncertainty using a case study of flame retardants, chemicals widely
   used in consumer products with potential negative health and
   environmental impacts. We focus on the uncertainty that arises in
   measuring people's exposure to these chemicals through testing of their
   personal environments or bodies. We identify four sources of ethical
   concerns relevant to scientific uncertainty: 1) choosing research
   questions or methods, 2) interpreting scientific results, 3)
   communicating results to multiple publics, and 4) applying results for
   policy making. This research offers lessons about professional conduct
   under conditions of uncertainty, ethical research practice,
   democratization of scientific knowledge, and science's impact on policy.

AB This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting
   for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners'
   narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on
   narrative identity and drawing on 15months of fieldwork and 25 in-depth
   interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities
   in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative
   conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative:
   what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the
   process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally
   continuous and essentialized Pagan self. I suggest that while all
   conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different
   faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress
   self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the
   rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1)
   perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to
   legitimacy and social acceptance; and (3) understanding of the nature of
   religious truth.

   located within a wide spectrum of social sites, ranging from the
   feelings of individuals to the practices of states. I suggest that we
   must first clarify what we are talking about when we talk about

AB Socioeconomic disadvantage confers risk for aspects of ill health that

   socioeconomic disadvantage related to the structural integrity of white
   matter tracts connecting brain regions of distributed networks, and
   whether such a relationship would be mediated by anthropometric,
   behavioral, and molecular risk factors associated with systemic
   inflammation. Otherwise healthy adults (N 155, aged 3050 years, 78 men)
   completed protocols assessing multilevel indicators of socioeconomic
   position (SEP), anthropometric and behavioral measures of adiposity and
   cigarette smoking, circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and
   white matter integrity by diffusion tensor imaging. Mediation modeling
   was used to test associations between SEP indicators and measures of
   white matter tract integrity, as well as indirect mediating paths.
   Measures of tract integrity followed a socioeconomic gradient:
   individuals completing more schooling, earning higher incomes, and
   residing in advantaged neighborhoods exhibited increases in white matter
   fractional anisotropy and decreases in radial diffusivity, relative to
   disadvantaged individuals. Moreover, analysis of indirect paths showed
   that adiposity, cigarette smoking, and CRP partially mediated these
   effects. Socioeconomic inequalities may relate to diverse health
   disparities via inflammatory pathways impacting the structural integrity
   of brain networks.

   years, maternal age and indicators of socioeconomic status (SES;
   maternal education, family income) were evaluated in relation to score
   discrepancies between the Child Behavior Checklist and Teacher Report
   Form for Total, Externalizing and Internalizing Problems. Family income
   < $35,000 was independently associated with discrepancies in which
   mothers rated more clinically significant child behavior problems than
   teachers for Total, Externalizing and Internalizing Problems [odds ratio
   (OR) = 3.26, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1.19-8.96, OR = 2.76, 95 %
   CI 1.03-7.34 and OR = 3.07, 95 % CI 1.30-7.26, respectively]. Maternal
   education was not associated with discrepancies, but younger mothers
   were less likely to rate child's behavior in the clinical range for
   Externalizing Problems than teachers (OR per year of age = 0.88, 95 % CI
   0.81-0.96). These results suggest that studies that utilize only
   maternal or teacher report of child behavior may have misclassification
   of outcomes that is dependent on SES and could produce biased results.

AB Public open spaces (POSs) are important destinations and settings for
   walking in neighborhoods and different aspects of POSs can influence
   walking. Proximity to POSs is a key urban design issue that should be
   considered in distributing such resources within neighborhoods and it is
   worthwhile to examine how PUS proximity may influence residents'
   walking. However, little research has explored how different measures of
   proximity to POSs might influence PUS-related walking.
   This study examined both metric and topological proximity measures to
   examine associations with amount of walking to and within POSs.
   Residents (n = 320) of three neighborhoods in Melbourne, Australia
   completed a questionnaire reporting their level of walking to and within
   PUS and perceptions of their neighborhoods. GIS and space syntax were
   used to extract four proximity measures: distance to the closest PUS,
   number of POSs, total area of POSs within 1 km, and PUS integration.
   None of the proximity measures were associated with walking (versus not
   walking) to or within POSs. Distance to the nearest POS and the number
   of POSs within 1 km was negatively associated with the absolute amount
   of walking to POSs. Residents who lived in areas in which POSs were
   located on less integrated streets reported more walking to and within
   POSs. Future landscape and urban design research should consider not
   only proximity to POSs, but also how factors such as characteristics of
   the routes that people traverse to reach PUS influence use of, and the
   likelihood of walking to and within, these important neighborhood
   destinations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Facing shrinking budgets and increasing urban development pressures,
   natural resource professionals are challenged to ensure urban green
   spaces remain a planning priority for decision makers. Urban green
   spaces like nature parks contribute to quality of life by providing
   physical and psychological benefits, as well as ecosystem services.
   Urban nature parks that are responsive to public needs will be valued by
   the public, who will ultimately express their interests through voting.
   In order for management to be responsive to the public, park
   professionals need to understand public attitudes about urban nature
   spaces.
   This case study used an attitude model developed in social psychology to
   examine Portland, Oregon users' and nonusers' attitudes about city
   nature parks. Few studies have attempted to capture information from
   nonusers and users simultaneously. Results from our sample, obtained
   from a randomly distributed mailback questionnaire, revealed significant
   attitude differences between users and nonusers.
   Urban park professionals in Portland can use our results to
   differentially guide management and outreach for each group. Watching
   urban wildlife influenced nonuser attitudes, for example, so targeted
   outreach to nonusers might highlight this activity. Nonusers are
   especially important to reach given that they represent potential growth
   in constituency and advocacy. To ensure continued positive experiences
   among users, management and outreach could appeal to their
   biocentricism. If Portland's park professionals demonstrate that they
   are responding to public attitudes, Portland's citizens will feel that
   they matter to park managers, and can be expected to respond in kind.

AB Gender performativity has had significant influences in cultural studies
   and sociology, yet empirical cases of the theory remain scarce. While
   some analysis examines performativity in work, the focus is on
   organizations and how gender gets done and undone' within them with
   little attention paid to bodies outside organizations. Based on two
   empirical studies of freelancing fashion models, we extend Butler's
   gender performativity to analyse the routine bodily practices and gender
   performances of men and women in fashion, investigating what happens
   when men and women perform the same work but under different gendered
   expectations. Fashion modelling presents a case that reproduces
   heteronormative definitions of femininity while potentially challenging
   traditional notions of masculinity and work. Observing everyday
   transgressions', we evidence how gender performativity, while largely
   reiterative of normative heterosexuality, may subtly confound the
   conventions. Observing how models do and undo' gender extends the
   analysis of gender at work to non-organizational bodies that tend to be
   under-represented within the literature.

AB Theorizing the social influence of racism and race has long been a
   concern of sociologists. Theories have addressed how racism, race and
   race inequality are organized and changed. Yet they have not addressed
   why racism and race are persistent despite social change. A social
   process theory of racism and race is proposed that analyzes their
   flexibility and persistence. It posits that racism is a social process
   where the meanings of race identities are traded across macro, meso, and
   micro levels of society. These trades legitimate social policies, are
   used to define a society as moral, and inform experiences. Black and
   white identities in light of the civil rights movement and its
   retrenchment, and the post-9/11 identity of Muslim Americans provide
   examples for applying the theory. I discuss the implications of the
   social process theory of racism and race for the future of race
   inequality in American society and sociological research.

   difficult for students at historically white colleges and universities

   enter HWCUs surrounded by these walls - protecting them from attacks on
   white supremacy - that have multiple layers and therefore are even more
   difficult to penetrate; yet they must be penetrated. With a few
   exceptions, the institution of American higher education does not
   threaten those walls. Instead, college education often bolsters them
   through curricular and extracurricular experiences, residential and
   disciplinary isolation, institutional symbols, cultural reproduction,
   and everyday practices such as grading and classroom interactions. We
   identify these walls in this article and make suggestions regarding
   strategies to begin their dismantling.

   article is that the critique of the covering-law model (i.e. the
   Hempel-Oppenheim scheme) submitted by proponents of AS is problematic.
   The rejection of rational choice theory in AS is criticized as well. It
   is argued that the alleged alternative general theory applied by
   proponents of AS, namely DBO theory (claiming that Desires, Beliefs and
   Opportunities determine behavior), is equivalent to a wide version of
   rational choice theory. Furthermore, the focus on theories of the middle
   range in AS and the neglect of general theories is considered
   problematic. Finally, it is argued that the goals of AS can better be
   achieved if it is supplemented by a research program of empirical theory
   comparison.

   theories intermediaires et neglige les theories generales est percu
   comme problematique. Finalement, l'auteur defend la these que l'AS

AB In 1996, Forehand and Kotchick concluded that parent-training (PT)
   interventions largely ignored cultural influences on parenting behavior.
   They reasoned that the failure to integrate the influence of ethnicity
   into theories of parenting behavior could result in culturally biased
   and less effective interventions. The present article addresses whether
   their "wake-up call" went unheard. We review research on PT treatment
   studies and examine (a) the rate of inclusion of ethnic minority parents
   in PT research, (b) the effectiveness of PT across ethnic groups, and
   (c) the effectiveness of culturally adapted PT interventions. Results
   show that there has been an increase in the ethnic diversity of PT
   treatment studies over the past three decades, yet only one
   methodologically sound study directly examined ethnicity as a moderator
   of PT treatment outcome. Despite the paucity of evidence that ethnicity
   is a moderator of parent-training outcomes, a number of culturally
   adapted PT treatments have been developed. These adapted interventions
   have rarely been tested against the unadapted interventions on which
   they are based. The results fail to support the current emphasis on
   ethnicity in efforts to improve the effectiveness of PT. We present
   methodological and conceptual limitations in the existing literature and
   provide recommendations for researchers studying the effects of
   ethnicity on PT outcomes.

AB Peer victimization leads to negative outcomes such as increased anxiety
   and depression. The prospective relationship between peer victimization
   and social anxiety in children and adolescents is well established, and
   adults with social anxiety disorder (SAD) are more likely than
   individuals with other anxiety disorders to report a history of teasing.
   However, a crucial bridge between these findings (peer victimization in
   young adults) is missing. We manipulated perceptions of peer exclusion
   in a young adult sample (N = 108) using the Cyberball Ostracism Task.
   Reactivity to exclusion prospectively predicted social anxiety symptoms
   at a 2-month follow-up, whereas self-reported teasing during high school
   and current relational victimization did not. This research suggests
   that reactions to peer victimization may be a worthwhile target for
   clinical interventions in young adults. Targeting how young adults react
   to stressful social interactions such as exclusion may help prevent the
   development of SAD. Future research should test if reactivity to
   exclusion plays a role in the relationship between other disorders
   (e.g., depression) and peer victimization.

   deviant behavior have emerged. I analyzed the administration of the MMMA
   using a case study method and interpret the initial social issues
   developing from this law by focusing on legitimacy. Due to a
   contradictory system where the MMMA is at odds with the Schedule I
   categorization of marijuana at the federal and state levels, the
   legitimacy of both the administration of the MMMA and the administration
   of marijuana law more generally are threatened. This lack of legitimacy
   in turn leads to a situation of Pyrrhic Defeat where failure to gain
   legal compliance maintains the inertia of marijuana prohibition.

AB Both cognitive and social-cognitive deficits impact functional outcome
   in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation studies indicate that targeted
   cognitive and/or social-cognitive training improves behavioral
   performance on trained skills. However, the neural effects of training
   in schizophrenia and their relation to behavioral gains are largely
   unknown. This study tested whether a 50-h intervention which included
   both cognitive and social-cognitive training would influence neural
   mechanisms that support social ccognition. Schizophrenia participants
   completed a computer-based intervention of either auditory-based
   cognitive training (AT) plus social-cognition training (SCT) (N=11) or
   non-specific computer games (CG) (N=11). Assessments included a
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task of facial emotion
   recognition, and behavioral measures of cognition, social cognition, and
   functional outcome. The fMRI results showed the predicted group-by-time
   interaction. Results were strongest for emotion recognition of happy,
   surprise and fear: relative to CG participants, AT+SCT participants
   showed a neural activity increase in bilateral amygdala, right putamen
   and right medial prefrontal cortex. Across all participants, pre-to-post
   intervention neural activity increase in these regions predicted
   behavioral improvement on an independent emotion perception measure
   (MSCEIT: Perceiving Emotions). Among AT+SCT participants alone, neural
   activity increase in right amygdala predicted behavioral improvement in
   emotion perception. The findings indicate that combined cognition and
   social-cognition training improves neural systems that support
   social-cognition skills. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB How does network structure affect diffusion? Recent studies suggest that
   the answer depends on the type of contagion. Complex contagions, unlike
   infectious diseases (simple contagions), are affected by social
   reinforcement and homophily. Hence, the spread within highly clustered
   communities is enhanced, while diffusion across communities is hampered.
   A common hypothesis is that memes and behaviors are complex contagions.
   We show that, while most memes indeed spread like complex contagions, a
   few viral memes spread across many communities, like diseases. We
   demonstrate that the future popularity of a meme can be predicted by
   quantifying its early spreading pattern in terms of community
   concentration. The more communities a meme permeates, the more viral it
   is. We present a practical method to translate data about community
   structure into predictive knowledge about what information will spread
   widely. This connection contributes to our understanding in
   computational social science, social media analytics, and marketing
   applications.

   that affirm cultural belonging. Terror management theory explains this
   phenomenon with the symbolic immortality provided by collective meaning
   in culture. This coping has also been explained with the motive of
   maintaining a meaningful representation of the world. Here we show that
   neural patterns of activations corresponding to cultural worldview
   defense processes differed when images that affirmed participants'
   cultural heritage were preceded by death-related verbal primes versus
   verbal primes threatening meaning. Cultural content was drawn upon
   distinctly on a neural basis when facing death-related cognitions. The

   more than 100000 living HIV-infected persons. Novel public health
   approaches are needed to control the epidemic. The NYC Department of
   Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) analysed community viral load (CVL)
   for a baseline to monitor the population-level impact of HIV control
   interventions.Design:A cross-sectional study using routinely collected
   surveillance data.Methods:All HIV-infected persons reported to the NYC
   HIV Registry who were at least 13 years of age, with at least one viral
   load test result in 2008, and alive at the end of 31 December 2008 were
   included. CVL was defined as the mean of individual viral load means
   reported between January and December 2008. Detectable viral load was
   defined as an individual mean of more than 400copies/ml. Differences in
   CVL and proportion undetectable were computed by socio-demographic
   characteristics and summary measures were mapped.Results:New York City
   CVL was 21318copies/ml overall (N=62550) and 44749copies/ml (N=28366)
   among persons with detectable mean viral loads. CVL varied by
   demographic and clinical characteristics, with statistically significant
   differences (P<0.001) in all groups except race/ethnicity (P=0.16). Men,
   persons aged 20-49 years, MSM, persons with AIDS, those with a CD4(+)
   cell count of 200cells/l or less and persons diagnosed after 2006 had
   higher mean viral load. Overall, 54.7% of HIV-infected persons had a
   suppressed mean viral load, with individual and neighbourhood variations
   (P<0.0001).Conclusion:This analysis showed strong disparities in
   reported CVL by individual characteristics and neighbourhoods. CVL
   patterns can be utilized to target interventions and track their impact.

AB Objectives: Although the quality of one's own social relationships has
   been related to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, whether a
   partner's social network quality can similarly influence one's
   cardiovascular risk is unknown. In this study we tested whether the
   quality of a partner's social networks influenced one's own ambulatory
   blood pressure (ABP).
   Methods: The quality of 94 couples' social networks was determined using
   a comprehensive model of relationships that separates out social ties
   that are sources of positivity(supportive), negativity (aversive), and
   both positivity and negativity (ambivalent). We then utilized
   statistical models (actor-partner analyses) that allowed us to separate
   out the links between one's own social network quality on ABP (actor
   influences), a partner's social network quality on ABP (partner
   influences), and a couple's network quality combined on ABP (actor X
   partner interactions).
   Results: Independent of one's own relationship quality, results showed
   that an individual's ABP was lower if their spouse had more supportive
   ties, and higher if a spouse had more aversive and ambivalent ties. In
   addition, couples' networks in combination were associated with higher
   ABP but only if both had a low number of supportive ties, or a high
   number of aversive or ambivalent ties.
   Conclusions: These data suggest that the social ties of those we have
   close relationships with may influence our cardiovascular risk and opens
   new opportunities to capitalize on untapped social resources or to
   mitigate hidden sources of social strain.

AB The ways in which natural selection can allow the proliferation of
   cooperative behavior have long been seen as a central problem in
   evolutionary biology. Most of the literature has focused on interactions
   between pairs of individuals and on linear public goods games. This
   emphasis has led to the conclusion that even modest levels of migration
   would pose a serious problem to the spread of altruism through
   population viscosity in group structured populations. Here we challenge
   this conclusion, by analyzing evolution in a framework which allows for
   complex group interactions and random migration among groups. We
   conclude that contingent forms of strong altruism that benefits equally
   all group members, regardless of kinship and without greenbeard effects,
   can spread when rare under realistic group sizes and levels of
   migration, due to the assortment of genes resulting only from population
   viscosity. Our analysis combines group-centric and gene-centric
   perspectives, allows for arbitrary strength of selection, and leads to
   extensions of Hamilton's rule for the spread of altruistic alleles,
   applicable under broad conditions.

TI Costs of Inaction on Maternal Mortality: Qualitative Evidence of the

AB Background: Little is known about the interconnectedness of maternal
   deaths and impacts on children, beyond infants, or the mechanisms
   through which this interconnectedness is established. A study was
   conducted in rural Tanzania to provide qualitative insight regarding how
   maternal mortality affects index as well as other living children and to
   identify shared structural and social factors that foster high levels of
   maternal mortality and child vulnerabilities.
   Methods and Findings: Adult family members of women who died due to
   maternal causes (N = 45) and key stakeholders (N = 35) participated in
   in-depth interviews. Twelve focus group discussions were also conducted
   (N = 83) among community leaders in three rural regions of Tanzania.
   Findings highlight the widespread impact of a woman's death on her
   children's health, education, and economic status, and, by inference,
   the roles that women play within their families in rural Tanzanian
   communities.
   Conclusions: The full costs of failing to address preventable maternal
   mortality include intergenerational impacts on the nutritional status,
   health, and education of children, as well as the economic capacity of
   families. When setting priorities in a resource-poor, high maternal
   mortality country, such as Tanzania, the far-reaching effects that
   reducing maternal deaths can have on families and communities, as well
   as women's own lives, should be considered.

AB BACKGROUND: Geographic barriers and limited availability of cancer
   specialists may influence early prostate cancer treatment options for
   rural men. This study compares receipt of different early prostate
   cancer treatments between rural and urban patients. METHODS: Using
   2004-2006 SEER Limited-Use Data, 51,982 early prostate cancer patients
   were identified (T1c, T2a, T2b, T2c, T2NOS; no metastases) who were most
   likely to benefit from definitive treatment (<75 years old, Gleason
   score<8, PSA <= 20). Definitive treatment included radical
   prostatectomy, daily external beam radiation for 5 to 8 weeks,
   brachytherapy, or combination external beam radiation/brachytherapy.
   Adjusted definitive treatment rates were calculated by rural-urban
   residence overall, and for different sociodemographic and cancer
   characteristics, and different states based on logistic regression
   analyses, using general estimating equation methods to account for
   clustering by county. RESULTS: Adjusted definitive treatment rates were
   lower for rural (83.7%) than urban (87.1%) patients with early-stage
   prostate cancer (P <= .01). Rural men were more likely than urban men to
   receive non-definitive surgical treatment and no initial treatment. The
   lowest definitive treatment rates were among rural subgroups: 70 to 74
   years (73.9%), African Americans (75.6%), American Indians/Alaska
   Natives (77.8%), single/separated/divorced (76.8%), living in New Mexico
   (69.3%), and living in counties with persistent poverty (79.6%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Between 2004 and 2006, this adjusted analysis found that
   men who were living in rural areas were less likely to receive
   definitive treatment for their early-stage prostate cancer than those
   living in urban areas. Certain rural patient groups with prostate cancer
   need particular attention to ensure their access to appropriate
   treatment. Rural providerss, rural health care systems, and cancer
   advocacy and support organizations should ensure resources are in place
   so that the most vulnerable rural groups (men between 60 and 74 years of
   age; African American men; men who are single, separated, or divorced;
   and men living in rural New Mexico) can make informed prostate cancer
   treatment choices based on their preferences. Cancer 2013; 119: 3067-75.

AB In the current study, we investigated how complete infant deprivation to
   out-group race impacts behavioral and neural sensitivity to race.
   Although monkey models have successfully achieved complete face
   deprivation in early life, this is typically impossible in human
   studies. We overcame this barrier by examining youths with exclusively
   homogenous racial experience in early postnatal development. These were
   youths raised in orphanage care in either East Asia or Eastern Europe as
   infants and later adopted by American families. The use of international
   adoption bolsters confidence of infant exposure to race (e.g., to solely
   Asian faces or European faces). Participants completed an emotional
   matching task during functional MRI. Our findings show that deprivation
   to other-race faces in infancy disrupts recognition of emotion and
   results in heightened amygdala response to out-group faces. Greater
   early deprivation (i.e., later age of adoption) is associated with
   greater biases to race. These data demonstrate how early social
   deprivation to race shapes amygdala function later in life and provides
   support that early postnatal development may represent a sensitive
   period for race perception.

TI Charting a Moral Life: The Influence of Stigma and Filial Duties on
   Marital Decisions among Chinese Men who Have Sex with Men

AB Introduction: Stigma constitutes a critical challenge to the rising
   rates of HIV among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). It reduces
   willingness to disclose one's sexual orientation and can lead to
   concurrent sexual partnerships. Disclosure decisions are also affected
   by cultural norms that place pressures on sons to marry. In this
   manuscript, we characterize how stigma and cultural factors influenced
   Chinese MSM's decisions around disclosure and marriage. We seek to show
   that MSM's actions were motivated by moral considerations, even when
   those choices posed HIV transmission risks.
   Methods: We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 MSM in Beijing,
   China. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into
   English for analysis. Transcripts were coded using a procedure that
   allowed for themes to emerge organically.
   Results: Participants struggled with feelings of shame and believed that
   others possessed stigmatizing attitudes about homosexuality. They had
   experienced relatively little discrimination because they infrequently
   disclosed their MSM status. In response to marital pressures,
   participant had to reconcile same-sex attractions with filial
   expectations. Their choices included: not being involved with women;
   putting on the appearance of a heterosexual relationship by marrying a
   lesbian; or fulfilling family expectations by marrying a heterosexual
   woman. Regardless of the decision, many rooted the justifications for
   their choices in the considerations they had given to others' needs.
   Conclusion: The growing epidemic among MSM in China requires action from
   the public health community. As programs are scaled up to serve these
   men, it is critical to remember that MSM, who often fear social sanction
   if they were to reveal their sexual orientation, continue to face the
   same pressures from culturally normative social duties as heterosexual
   men. Interventions must find ways to help men navigate a balance between
   their own needs and the responsibilities they feel toward their parents
   and others.

AB Background Babies with low birthweight (<2500 g) are at increased risk
   of early mortality. However, low birthweight includes babies born
   preterm and with fetal growth restriction, and not all these infants
   have a birthweight less than 2500 g. We estimated the neonatal and
   infant mortality associated with these two characteristics in low-income
   and middle-income countries.
   Methods For this pooled analysis, we searched all available studies and
   identified 20 cohorts (providing data for 2 015 019 livebirths) from
   Asia, Africa, and Latin America that recorded data for birthweight,
   gestational age, and vital statistics through 28 days of life. Study
   dates ranged from 1982 through to 2010. We calculated relative risks
   (RR) and risk differences (RD) for mortality associated with preterm
   birth (<32 weeks, 32 weeks to <34 weeks, 34 weeks to <37 weeks),
   small-for-gestational-age (SGA; babies with birthweight in the lowest
   third percentile and between the third and tenth percentile of a US
   reference population), and preterm and SGA combinations.
   Findings Pooled overall RRs for preterm were 6.82 (95% CI 3.56-13.07)
   for neonatal mortality and 2.50 (1.48-4.22) for post-neonatal mortality.
   Pooled RRs for babies who were SGA (with birthweight in the lowest tenth
   percentile of the reference population) were 1.83 (95% CI 1.34-2.50) for
   neonatal mortality and 1.90 (1.32-2.73) for post-neonatal mortality. The
   neonatal mortality risk of babies who were both preterm and SGA was
   higher than that of babies with either characteristic alone (15.42;
   9.11-26.12).
   Interpretation Many babies in low-income and middle-income countries are
   SGA. Preterm birth affects a smaller number of neonates than does SGA,
   but is associated with a higher mortality risk. The mortality risks
   associated with both characteristics extend beyond the neonatal period.
   Differentiation of the burden and risk of babies born preterm and SGA
   rather than with low birthweight could guide prevention and management
   strategies to speed progress towards Millennium Development Goal 4-the
   reduction of child mortality.

AB Maternal and child malnutrition in low-income and middle-income
   countries encompasses both under nutrition and a growing problem with
   overweight and obesity. Low body-mass index, indicative of maternal
   undernutrition, has declined somewhat in the past two decades but
   continues to be prevalent in Asia and Africa. Prevalence of maternal
   overweight has had a steady increase since 1980 and exceeds that of
   underweight in all regions. Prevalence of stunting of linear growth of
   children younger than 5 years has decreased during the past two decades,
   but is higher in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa than elsewhere and
   globally affected at least 165 million children in 2011; wasting
   affected at least 52 million children. Deficiencies of vitamin A and
   zinc result in deaths; deficiencies of iodine and iron, together with
   stunting, can contribute to children not reaching their developmental
   potential. Maternal undernutrition contributes to fetal growth
   restriction, which increases the risk of neonatal deaths and, for
   survivors, of stunting by 2 years of age. Suboptimum breastfeeding
   results in an increased risk for mortality in the first 2 years of life.
   We estimate that undernutrition in the aggregate-including fetal growth
   restriction, stunting, wasting, and deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc
   along with suboptimum breastfeeding-is a cause of 3.1 million child
   deaths annually or 45% of all child deaths in 2011. Maternal overweight
   and obesity result in increased maternal morbidity and infant mortality.
   Childhood overweight is becoming an increasingly important contributor
   to adult obesity, diabetes, and non-communicable diseases. The high
   present and future disease burden caused by mal nutrition in women of
   reproductive age, pregnancy, and children in the first 2 years of life
   should lead to interventions focused on these groups.

AB Until the 1930s, malaria was endemic throughout large swaths of the
   American South. We used a Poisson mixture model to analyze the decline
   of malaria at the county level in Alabama (an archetypical Deep South
   cotton state) during the 1930s. Employing a novel data set, we argue
   that, contrary to a leading theory, the decline of malaria in the
   American South was not caused by population movement away from malarial
   areas or the decline of Southern tenant farming. We elaborate and
   provide evidence for an alternate explanation that emphasizes the role
   of targeted New Deal-era public health interventions and the development
   of local-level public health infrastructure. We show that, rather than
   disappearing as a consequence of social change or economic improvements,
   malaria was eliminated in the Southern United States in the face of
   economic dislocation and widespread and deep-seated poverty.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the extent to which women received contraceptive
   services within 90 days after birth at their first or subsequent visits
   and whether contraceptive provision was associated with optimal
   interpregnancy intervals.
   METHOD: We linked California's 2008 Birth Statistical Master File with
   Medicaid databases to build a cohort of women aged 15-44 years who had
   given birth in 2008 and received publicly-funded health care services in
   the 18 months after their previous live birth (N=117,644). We determined
   whether provision of contraception within 90 days after birth was
   associated with optimal interpregnancy intervals when controlling for
   covariates.
   RESULT: Only 41% (n=48,775) of women had a contraceptive claim within 90
   days after birth. To avoid short interpregnancy intervals, 6 women would
   need to receive contraception to avoid one additional short interval
   (number needed to treat=6.38). Receipt of a contraceptive method,
   receiving contraception at the first clinic visit, and being seen by
   Medi-Cal and its family planning expansion program were significantly
   associated with avoidance of short interpregnancy intervals. Receiving
   contraception at the first postpartum clinic visit had an additional
   independent effect on avoiding short interpregnancy intervals when
   controlling for the other variables. Although foreign-born women had 47%
   higher odds of avoiding short interpregnancy intervals than U. S.-born
   women, women of Asian and Pacific Islander ethnicity had 24% lower odds
   of avoiding short interpregnancy intervals than white women.
   CONCLUSION: Findings of this study suggest that closer attention to
   provision of postpartum contraception in publicly-funded programs has
   the potential to improve optimal interpregnancy intervals among
   low-income women.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the prevalence of sterilization among women aged
   20-34 years in rural and urban areas in the United States.
   METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family
   Growth, a cross-sectional survey conducted by the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention. The study population included the 4,685 female
   respondents who did not want to become pregnant at the time of the
   survey. Women who were not sexually active with men or were infertile
   for reasons other than contraception were excluded. We performed
   bivariate and stratified analysis and multivariable logistic regression
   modeling to determine the associations between place of residence and
   sterilization after considering other demographic characteristics.
   RESULTS: Rural women were at increased odds of undergoing sterilization
   compared with urban and suburban women (22.75% compared with 12.69%,
   respectively; crude odds ratio [OR] 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]
   1.44-2.86; risk difference 0.10, 95% CI 0.05-0.16). Education level was
   found to be a significant effect modifier of the relationship between
   location of residence and sterilization. In adjusted analysis,
   controlling for age, parity, race and ethnicity, income, insurance
   status, history of unintended pregnancy, and relationship status, rural
   women without a high school degree were more likely to have undergone
   sterilization compared with urban and rural women with greater than a
   high school education (OR 8.34, 95% CI 4.45-15.61).
   CONCLUSIONS: Rural women with low education levels have a high
   prevalence of sterilization. Future studies need to address the reasons
   for this interaction between education and geography and its influence
   on contraceptive method choice.

AB Objectives: Overweight and obesity in young children are increasing
   concerns for medical professionals. Lack of sufficient physical activity
   may be the primary cause; therefore, the development and testing of a
   theory-based intervention for preschoolers is a priority.
   Methods: A 30-minutes/day preschool-based intervention (Start For Life),
   with a foundation in social cognitive theory that emphasizes the use of
   self-regulation skills and feelings of mastery (self-efficacy), was
   administered for 9 months to 4- and 5-year-old African American
   children.
   Results: Findings indicated a significant increase in
   accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous physical
   activity during the 7-hour school day. Reductions in body mass index
   (BMI; kg/m(2)) were significant, with greater effects found in
   participants with an initially higher BMI. Further analyses indicated
   that the kilocalories expended through physical activity explained
   approximately 87% of the weight lost. Participants' sex did not affect
   the identified changes in BMI.
   Conclusions: A brief theory-based physical activity intervention (Start
   For Life) was associated with increased moderate-to-vigorous and
   vigorous physical activity and reduced overweight/obesity in 4- to
   5-year-old preschoolers. Because of its practical format, opportunities
   for widespread dissemination may be possible.

AB Year-round human habitation of environments with highly seasonal regimes
   of ultraviolet B radiation (UVB) depended on adaptive complexes of
   biological and cultural traits to ensure adequacy of vitamin D.
   Perturbations of such adaptive complexes resulting from changes in the
   physical environment, human behavior and culture, or both have had
   unexpected and untoward consequences for health. Scotland is an
   excellent case study of the changing nature of human biocultural
   adaptation to low-UVB environments. Occupation of Scotland after the
   last Pleistocene glaciation event about 14,000 YBP was made possible by
   maximally depigmented skin, which facilitated cutaneous biosynthesis of
   vitamin D-3, and by a diet that emphasized foods rich in vitamin D.
   Changes in human subsistence and diet began with the introduction of
   agriculture and grazing about 5,000 YBP and accelerated greatly in the
   last 200 years through industrialization and urbanization. The resulting
   changes in domiciles, patterns of daily activity and behavior, and diet
   have led to reduced exposure to UVB and reduced consumption of vitamin
   D-rich foods. This has perturbed the "vitamin D compromise," an adaptive
   complex established in Scotland during the Mesolithic and Neolithic. We
   describe the UVB environment of Scotland from remotely sensed data and
   combine these data with information from the archaeological record to
   describe the vitamin D compromise in Scotland. Changes in human exposure
   to UVB and vitamin D consumption, which occurred as the result of
   urbanization and the dietary shift away from the consumption of oily
   fish, are traced. Vitamin D deficiency contributes to increased disease
   prevalence in Scotland, including that of the autoimmune disease
   multiple sclerosis, a debilitating neurodegenerative disease caused by
   demyelination of the central nervous system. These conditions have
   created an "imperfect storm" of poor health that should command the
   attention of public health experts and policy makers.

AB BackgroundAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives experience poor overall
   survival. Data are limited on American Indians/Alaska Natives with head
   and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
   MethodsWe identified all cases of HNSCC among American Indians/Alaska
   Natives, and white patients from 1996 to 2007 using the Surveillance,
   Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate, multivariate,
   and Cox models were fit to analyze racial differences in sex, age,
   stage, treatment, and survival.
   ResultsAmerican Indians/Alaska Natives experienced decreased survival
   for oropharyngeal cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.4; p = .008). After
   adjusting for demographic factors, survival was decreased for oral
   cavity cancer (HR = 1.3; p = .05) and hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancer
   (HR = 1.6; p = .04). These disparities were eliminated after adjusting
   for treatment for oral cavity cancer (HR = 1.2; p = .17) and stage for
   hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancer (HR = 1.4; p = .12). American
   Indians/Alaska Natives received less surgery for oral cavity cancer (78%
   vs 85%; p = .02).
   ConclusionDisparities in survival exist among American Indians/Alaska
   Natives patients with HNSCC. They are related to stage and differential
   treatment patterns. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Head Neck, 2013

AB While vaccine acceptance remains high in general, fear of vaccines has
   grown dramatically in the past several years in many developed
   countries. In some communities, this fear has led to significantly
   increased rates of vaccine refusal which are associated with increases
   in illness and death from vaccine-preventable diseases, and large
   economic costs for health care and society. Despite overwhelming
   evidence supporting the safety and benefits of vaccination, this fear
   has proven resistant to information campaigns, a phenomenon
   well-explained by psychological research which has established that risk
   perception is subjective, a product of both the facts and how those
   facts feel. Given the innately emotional and instinctive nature of risk
   perception, and the risks to public health these perceptions produce,
   and consistent with well-established legal principles supporting
   government action to protect the common good, society has the right and
   responsibility to establish laws, regulations, and choice frameworks
   that discourage vaccine refusal.

AB Objective To describe the contemporary trends in urinary diversion among
   patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) for bladder cancer; and
   elucidate whether socioeconomic disparities persist in the type of
   diversion performed in the USA from a population-based cohort.
   Patients and Methods Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we
   identified patients who underwent RC for bladder cancer between 2001 and
   2008. Multivariable regression models were used to identify patient and
   hospital covariates associated with continent urinary diversion and
   enumerate predicted probabilities for statistically significant
   variables over time.
   Results Overall, 55635 (92%) patients undergoing RC for bladder cancer
   received incontinent urinary diversion, while 4552 (8%) patients
   received continent diversion from 2001 to 2008. Receipt of continent
   urinary diversion increased from 6.6% in 2001-2002 to 9.4% in 2007-2008
   (P < 0.001 for trend). Patients who were older (odds ratio [OR] 0.93; P
   < 0.001), female (OR 0.52; P < 0.001) and insured by Medicaid (OR 0.54;
   P = 0.002) were less likely to receive continent urinary diversion.
   However, patients treated at teaching (OR 2.14; P < 0.001) and
   high-volume hospitals (OR 2.39; P = 0.04) had higher odds of continent
   urinary diversion. Predicted probabilities of continent diversion
   remained lower for female patients, Medicaid insurance status, and
   non-teaching and medium/low-volume hospitals over time.
   Conclusions In this nationally representative sample of hospitals from
   2001 to 2008, the use of continent diversion in RC gradually increased.
   Although variations in urinary diversion exist by hospital teaching
   status, case volume, patient gender and primary health insurance,
   increased attention in expanding the use of continent diversions may
   help reduce these disparities for patients undergoing RC for bladder
   cancer.

AB Background. - The objective of this study is to outline a capabilities
   approach to the social determinants of population health and to compare
   its explanatory power and implications for public policy-making with
   psychosocial approaches.
   Methods. - A model linking the structures of economic and social
   relations to health outcomes is developed and logistic methods used to
   confirm its base validity for a representative sample of 16,488 citizens
   in 19 developed democracies drawn from the World Values Surveys of 1990
   and 2005. Self-reported health is the dependent variable. Age, gender,
   education, employment status, self-mastery, income, autonomy at work,
   ties to family and friends, subjective social status, associational
   memberships and sense of national belonging are considered.
   Results. - At baseline, risk ratios reflecting movement from the 25th to
   75th percentile in the distribution of the variable indicate that
   increases in income reduce the likelihood of poor health (0.78;
   0.73-0.82) as does higher autonomy at work (0.90; 0.85-0.94) but so does
   access to social resources reflected in ties to family and friends
   (0.89; 0.86-0.92), associational memberships (0.93; 0.89-0.98),
   subjective social status (0.77; 0.54-0.90) while the absence of feelings
   of national belonging increases the likelihood of poor health (1.14;
   1.06-1.23).
   Conclusion. - The results suggest that population health is dependent on
   the distribution of social as well as economic resources along the
   dimensions predicted by a capabilities model. Governments should be
   attentive to the impact of policy on the distribution of social, as well
   as economic, resources. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

AB Objective To determine whether individuals with primary ciliary
   dyskinesia (PCD) from unrelated Amish and Mennonite families harbor a
   single and unique founder mutation.
   Study design Subjects from Amish and Mennonite communities in several
   states were enrolled in the study. All subjects were clinically
   characterized, and nasal nitric oxide levels were measured. Nasal
   epithelial scrapings were collected from several subjects for ciliary
   ultrastructural analyses. DNA was isolated from patients with PCD and
   their unaffected first-and second-degree relatives. Genome-wide
   homozygosity mapping, linkage analyses, targeted mutation analyses, and
   exome sequencing were performed.
   Results All subjects from Old-Order Amish communities from Pennsylvania
   were homozygous for a nonsense mutant DNAH5 allele, c. 4348C>T
   (p.Q1450X). Two affected siblings from an unrelated Mennonite family in
   Arkansas were homozygous for the same nonsense DNAH5 mutation. Children
   with PCD from an Amish family from Wisconsin had biallelic DNAH5
   mutations, c. 4348C>T (p.Q1450X) and c.10815delT (p.P3606HfsX23), and
   mutations in other genes associated with PCD were also identified in
   this community.
   Conclusion The Amish and Mennonite subjects from geographically
   dispersed and socially isolated communities had the same founder DNAH5
   mutation, owing to the common heritage of these populations. However,
   disease-causing mutations in other PCD-associated genes were also found
   in affected individuals in these communities, illustrating the genetic
   heterogeneity in this consanguineous population.

AB Objectives To characterize variation and inequalities in neighborhood
   child asthma admission rates and to identify associated community
   factors within one US county.
   Study design This population-based prospective, observational cohort
   study consisted of 862 sequential child asthma admissions among 167 653
   eligible children ages 1-16 years in Hamilton County, Ohio. Admissions
   occurred at a tertiary-care pediatric hospital and accounted for nearly
   95% of in-county asthma admissions. Neighborhood admission rates were
   assessed by geocoding addresses to city-and county-defined
   neighborhoods. The 2010 US Census provided denominator data.
   Neighborhood admission distribution inequality was assessed by the use
   of Gini and Robin Hood indices. Associations between neighborhood rates
   and socioeconomic and environmental factors were assessed using ANOVA
   and linear regression.
   Results The county admission rate was 5.1 per 1000 children.
   Neighborhood rates varied significantly by quintile: 17.6, 7.7, 4.9,
   2.2, and 0.2 admissions per 1000 children (P < .0001). Fifteen
   neighborhoods containing 8% of the population had zero admissions. The
   Gini index of 0.52 and Robin Hood index of 0.38 indicated significant
   inequality. Neighborhood-level educational attainment, car access, and
   population density best explained variation in neighborhood admission
   rates (R-2 = 0.55).
   Conclusion In a single year, asthma admission rates varied 88-fold
   across neighborhood quintiles in one county; a reduction of the
   county-wide admission rate to that of the bottom quintile would decrease
   annual admissions from 862 to 34. A rate of zero was present in 15
   neighborhoods, which is evidence of what may be attainable.

AB Objective: Longer duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is associated
   with poorer early-course and long-term outcomes, and is a target of
   early detection and intervention efforts. Given the paucity of research
   on childhood and adolescent stressors (e. g., maltreatment and
   neighborhood disorder) as potential predictors of DUP, limited research
   on premorbid substance use as a determinant of DUP, and inconclusive
   findings on the association between DUP and neurocognition, we conducted
   three sets of analyses to address these issues. Mode of onset of
   psychosis was also considered, given its established role as an
   illness-level correlate of DUP.
   Methods: We rigorously assessed DUP and other pertinent variables in 180
   predominantly African American, low-income, and socially disadvantaged
   first-episode psychosis patients hospitalized in five psychiatric units.
   Results: Mode of onset of psychosis, prior incarceration, and the level
   of childhood/adolescent maltreatment were all significant independent
   predictors of DUP. Regarding premorbid substance use, having ever used
   cannabis and the amount of premorbid alcohol use were significantly
   associated with DUP. None of the seven neurocognitive domains assessed
   were even modestly, or clinically meaningfully, associated with DUP.
   Conclusions: These and other findings on DUP may be informative for
   early detection and intervention services. For example, such services
   might benefit from special outreach to criminal justice settings and
   disadvantaged neighborhoods, and to young people likely to have a
   history of childhood/adolescent maltreatment and gradually developing
   psychotic symptoms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE Research has shown that preschool-aged children spend
   considerable time with media, and risks and benefits for cognitive and
   behavioral outcomes exist depending on what is watched and how it is
   watched.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the associations among child race/ethnicity,
   parental beliefs/attitudes about television (TV) and child development,
   and TV viewing habits of young children, and to assess reasons for
   existing racial/ethnic disparities in children's media use.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Parents completed demographic
   questionnaires, reported on attitudes regarding media's risks and
   benefits to their children, and completed 1-week media diaries where
   they recorded all of the programs their children watched. Enrollment was
   from March 13, 2009, to April 12, 2010. The study was conducted at 2
   metropolitan Seattle pediatric clinics and an academic practice network,
   each serving a diverse population of patients, and involved a
   community-based sample of 596 parents of children aged 3 to 5 years.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Parental beliefs/attitudes regarding screen
   time and TV viewing habits of young children.
   RESULTS Overall, children watched an average (SD) of 462.0 (315.5)
   minutes of TV per week. African American children watched more TV per
   week than non-Hispanic white children (mean [SD], 638.0 [450.9] vs 431.0
   [282.6] minutes; P < .01); however, these differences were no longer
   statistically significant after controlling for attitudes and
   demographic covariates (eg, family socioeconomic status). It is
   important to note that socioeconomic status confounded the results for
   race/ethnicity, and the association between race/ethnicity and media
   time across the sample was no longer statistically significant after
   adjusting for family socioeconomic status. However, significant
   differences were found between parents of ethnically/racially diverse
   children and parents of non-Hispanic white children regarding the
   perceived positive effects of TV viewing, even when parental education
   and family income were taken into account.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Differences in parental beliefs/attitudes
   regarding the effects of media on early childhood development may help
   explain growing racial/ethnic disparities in child media viewing/habits,
   but more research is needed to understand the cultural nuances of the
   observed differences.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Firearm violence is a leading cause of death
   among youth. The objectives of this study were (1) determine firearm
   possession rates and associated correlates among youth seeking care for
   assault in an emergency department (ED); (2) understand differences in
   risk factors for youth with firearm possession; and (3) identify firearm
   possession characteristics in this population: type, reason for
   possession, and source of firearms.
   METHODS: Youth (14 to 24 years old) presenting to a Level 1 ED with
   assault were administered a computerized screening survey. Validated
   instruments were administered, measuring demographics, firearm rates and
   characteristics, attitudes toward aggression, substance use, and
   previous violence history.
   RESULTS: Among 689 assault-injured youth, 23% reported firearm
   possession in the past 6 months. Only 17% of those reporting firearm
   possession obtained the gun from a legal source; 22% reported ownership
   of highly lethal automatic/semiautomatic weapons and 37.1% reported
   having a firearm for protection. Logistic regression analysis identified
   significant correlates of firearm possession, including male gender,
   higher socioeconomic status, illicit drug use, recent serious fight, and
   retaliatory attitudes.
   CONCLUSIONS: ED assault-injured youth had high rates of firearm
   possession (23.1%), most of which were not obtained from legal sources.
   Youth with firearm possession were more likely to have been in a recent
   serious fight, and to endorse aggressive attitudes that increase their
   risk for retaliatory violence. Future prevention efforts should focus on
   minimizing illegal firearm access among high-risk youth, nonviolent
   alternatives to retaliatory violence, and substance use prevention.

AB BACKGROUND: This is the first peer-reviewed study to quantify diaper
   need, propose a method to measure diaper need, and explore psychosocial
   variables associated with diaper need in a large sample of urban,
   low-income families.
   METHODS: Data were derived from a cross-sectional study in 877 pregnant
   and parenting women. Mothers completed surveys on topics related to
   mental health, basic needs, and health care use. Logistic regression was
   used to estimate the relationship between diaper need and psychosocial
   correlates.
   RESULTS: Almost 30% of mothers reported diaper need. Hispanic women were
   significantly more likely to report diaper need than African American
   women (odds ratio [OR]: 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-3.33),
   and women >= 45 years of age were significantly more likely than women
   between the ages of 20 and 44 years to report diaper need (OR: 2.53; 95%
   CI: 1.21-5.28). Women who reported mental health need were significantly
   more likely than women who did not report mental health need to report
   diaper need (OR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.16-3.09).
   CONCLUSIONS: Although a majority of studies have examined family
   socioeconomic status as income and educational and employment status,
   emerging research suggests that indicators of material hardship are
   increasingly important to child health. This study supports this premise
   with the suggestion that an adequate supply of diapers may prove a
   tangible way of reducing parenting stress, a critical factor influencing
   child health and development. There is potential for pediatric providers
   to inquire about diaper need and refer families to a local diaper
   distribution service as 1 method to reduce parenting stress.

AB The Inter-Oceanic Highway is among the first wave of large
   infrastructure projects under the auspices of the Initiative for the
   Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America, which proposes
   regional integration as a means of economic development. Such projects
   have reignited debates over infrastructure impacts, which in many ways
   center on the ramifications for natural resource management. We pursue
   an analysis of the implications of highway paving for local livelihoods
   by focusing on the effects of market connectivity on livelihood
   diversity. Given that infrastructure brings shocks to affected regions,
   we argue that livelihood diversity is usefully interpreted in terms of
   household resilience to such shocks. We draw on rural household surveys
   from the tri-national frontier where Bolivia, Brazil and Peru meet in
   the southwestern Amazon, where the Inter-Oceanic Highway has recently
   been paved. The findings show that households more connected to markets
   in terms of travel time and road paving have less diverse livelihoods.
   This confirms concerns about regional integration and rural household
   vulnerability.
