AB This article analyzes the results of a survey designed to assess
   self-reported oral health status, perceptions, and access to care
   between the Hispanic population and the general population of the United
   States. A nationally representative telephone survey was conducted with
   randomly selected participants: 1000 each from the Hispanic and the
   general populations. Responses of both groups were compared and
   statistically analyzed at a 95% confidence level (alpha = 0.05). The
   results showed significant differences between the Hispanic and the
   general populations.Hispanics were less likely to believe in the need
   for regular professional dental care, more likely to have misperceptions
   about oral health and conditions, and less likely to have access to care
   than the general population. Hispanics were less likely to have visited
   a dentist in the last 2 years, and significantly more Hispanics than
   general population participants cited cost of care and lack of dental
   insurance as key reasons for not seeing a dentist. More information on
   good oral health habits, Spanish-language information, and where to
   access care were identified as helpful tools by majorities of Hispanics.
   These data indicate disparities do exist between the Hispanic and the
   general populations. They highlight the need for new policies and
   programs-from organized dentistry to individual practices-that address
   the needs of the growing Hispanic population.

AB Several archaeological studies in the Central Andes have pointed at the
   temporal coincidence of climatic fluctuations (both long- and
   short-term) and episodes of cultural transition and changes of
   socioeconomic structures throughout the pre-Columbian period. Although
   most scholars explain the connection between environmental and cultural
   changes by the impact of climatic alterations on the capacities of the
   ecosystems inhabited by pre-Columbian cultures, direct evidence for
   assumed demographic consequences is missing so far. In this study, we
   address directly the impact of climatic changes on the spatial
   population dynamics of the Central Andes. We use a large dataset of
   pre-Columbian mitochondrial DNA sequences from the northern Rio Grande
   de Nasca drainage (RGND) in southern Peru, dating from similar to 840 BC
   to 1450 AD. Alternative demographic scenarios are tested using Bayesian
   serial coalescent simulations in an approximate Bayesian computational
   framework. Our results indicate migrations from the lower coastal
   valleys of southern Peru into the Andean highlands coincident with
   increasing climate variability at the end of the Nasca culture at
   similar to 640 AD. We also find support for a back-migration from the
   highlands to the coast coincident with droughts in the southeastern
   Andean highlands and improvement of climatic conditions on the coast
   after the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku empires (similar to 1200 AD),
   leading to a genetic homogenization in the RGND and probably southern
   Peru as a whole.

AB Background: In schizophrenia, social cognition is strongly linked to
   functional outcome and is increasingly seen as a viable treatment
   target. The goal of the Social Cognition Psychometric Evaluation (SCOPE)
   study is to identify and improve the best existing measures of social
   cognition so they can be suitably applied in large-scale treatment
   studies. Initial phases of this project sought to (1) develop consensus
   on critical domains of social cognition and (2) identify the best
   existing measures of social cognition for use in treatment studies.
   Methods: Experts in social cognition were invited to nominate key
   domains of social cognition and the best measures of those domains.
   Nominations for measures were reduced according to set criteria, and all
   available psychometric information about these measures was summarized
   and provided to RAND panelists. Panelists rated the quality of each
   measure on multiple criteria, and diverging ratings were discussed at
   the in-person meeting to obtain consensus. Results: Expert surveys
   identified 4 core domains of social cognition-emotion processing, social
   perception, theory of mind/mental state attribution, and attributional
   style/bias. Using RAND panel consensus ratings, the following measures
   were selected for further evaluation: Ambiguous Intentions Hostility
   Questionnaire, Bell Lysaker Emotion Recognition Task, Penn Emotion
   Recognition Test, Relationships Across Domains, Reading the Mind in the
   Eyes Test, The Awareness of Social Inferences Test, Hinting Task, and
   Trustworthiness Task. Discussion: While it was possible to establish
   consensus, only a limited amount of psychometric information is
   currently available for the candidate measures, which underscores the
   need for well-validated and standardized measures in this area.

AB Aims To examine the associations between alcohol control policies in
   four regulatory domains with alcohol consumption in low- and
   middle-income countries (LAMICs), controlling for country-level living
   standards and drinking patterns. Design Cross-sectional analyses of
   individual-level alcohol consumption survey data and country-level
   alcohol policies using multi-level modeling. Setting Data from 15 LAMICs
   collected in the Gender, Alcohol, and Culture: an International Study
   (GENACIS) data set. Participants Individuals aged 18-65years.
   Measurements Alcohol policy data compiled by the World Health
   Organization; individual-level current drinking status, usual quantity
   and frequency of drinking, binge drinking frequency and total drinking
   volume; gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity
   (GDP-PPP) per capita; detrimental drinking pattern scale; and age and
   gender as individual-level covariates. Findings Alcohol policies
   regulating the physical availability of alcohol, particularly those
   concerning business hours or involving a licensing system for
   off-premises alcohol retail sales, as well as minimum legal drinking
   age, were the most consistent predictors of alcohol consumption.
   Aggregate relative alcohol price levels were associated inversely with
   all drinking variables (P<0.05) except drinking volume. Greater
   restrictions on alcohol advertising, particularly beer advertising, were
   associated inversely with alcohol consumption (P<0.05). Policies that
   set legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits for drivers and
   random breath testing to enforce BAC limits were not associated
   significantly with alcohol consumption. Conclusions Alcohol policies
   that regulate the physical availability of alcohol are associated with
   lower alcohol consumption in low- and middle-income countries.

   inhibitory control. Children's respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was
   assessed during a resting baseline, two joint challenge tasks with
   mother, and an individual frustration task. RSA assessed during each of
   the joint parent-child challenge tasks moderated the effects of child
   maltreatment (CM) status on children's independently-assessed inhibitory
   control. No moderation effect was found for RSA assessed at baseline or
   in the child-alone challenge task. Among CM-exposed children, lower RSA
   levels during the joint task predicted the lowest inhibitory control,
   whereas higher joint task RSA was linked to higher inhibitory control
   scores that were indistinguishable from those of non-CM children.
   Results are discussed with regard to the importance of considering
   context specificity (i.e., individual and caregiver contexts) in how
   biomarkers inform our understanding of individual differences in

AB Following a variety of stressors, prepubertal animals display
   significantly longer hormonal stress responses than adults. Although the
   mechanisms that mediate this pubertal-related difference in stress
   reactivity are unclear, previous studies have shown that social
   interactions are differentially affected by stress in animals before and
   after puberty. Given the influence of social factors on stress
   reactivity, we hypothesize the protracted stress-induced hormonal
   response in prepubertal animals may be in part mediated by aspects of
   their poststress social environment. We explored this hypothesis by
   measuring plasma ACTH and corticosterone in prepubertal male rats 15,
   30, and 45 min after a 30 min session of restraint stress exposed to one
   of three social conditions: recovering in the presence of a stressed
   cage mate; recovering in the presence of a nonstressed cage mate; and
   recovering in the absence of a cage mate. We report here that although
   prepubertal and adult animals display different hormonal responses
   following restraint, the presence or absence of stressed cage mates has
   little impact on the poststress hormonal response in prepubertal males.
   We do, however, show that social factors can alter HPA reactivity in
   prepubertal animals, in that significant hormonal responses are evoked
   in nonstressed animals exposed to a stressed cage mate, an effect not
   found in adults. Collectively, these data indicate that although the
   poststress social environment does not play a role in mediating the
   protracted hormonal response in prepubertal animals, the social context
   can significantly influence HPA activation in otherwise unstressed
   animals prior to puberty. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Background Adverse socioeconomic position (SEP) in childhood and
   adulthood is associated with a proinflammatory phenotype, and therefore
   an important exposure to consider for multiple sclerosis (MS), a complex
   neuroinflammatory autoimmune disease. The objective was to determine
   whether SEP over the life course confers increased susceptibility to MS.
   Methods 1643 white, non-Hispanic MS case and control members recruited
   from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Plan, Northern California
   Region, for which comprehensive genetic, clinical and environmental
   exposure data have been collected were studied. Logistic regression
   models investigated measures of childhood and adulthood SEP, and
   accounted for effects due to established MS risk factors, including
   HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele carrier status, smoking history, history of
   infectious mononucleosis, family history of MS and body size.
   Results Multiple measures of childhood and adulthood SEP were
   significantly associated with risk of MS, including parents renting
   versus owning a home at age 10: OR=1.48, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.02, p=0.013;
   less than a college education versus at least a college education based
   on parental household: OR=1.28, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.63, p=0.041; low versus
   high life course SEP: OR=1.50, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.05, p=0.012; and low
   versus high social mobility: OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.39, p=5.7x10(-4).
   Conclusions Results derived from a populationrepresentative case-control
   study provide support for the role of adverse SEP in MS susceptibility
   and add to the growing evidence linking lower SEP to poorer health
   outcomes. Both genetic and environmental contributions to chronic
   conditions are important and must be characterised to fully understand
   MS aetiology.

AB Aim To assess trends in caesarean sections in Brazil, identify

   Methods Nationally representative data from the 1996 Demographic and
   Health Survey (n=4918) and the 2006 Brazilian National Survey (n=6125)
   were analysed using binomial logistic regression to assess variations in
   caesarean sections. Univariate logistic regression and multivariate
   analysis were used to select variables for predicting caesarean sections
   and assess potential factors associated with them. Results Caesarean
   sections increased from 33% in 1991 to 40% in 2006 and were
   significantly more common among older, highly educated, wealthy women
   living in the South, who had received antenatal care and been delivered
   by private caregivers. Wealthy, educated women were significantly less
   likely to have a caesarean section in 2006 than in 1991. Women living in
   urban areas and in the South had higher odds of caesarean sections in
   1991, but not in 2006. Conclusion Caesarean section rates in Brazil
   increased by seven percentage points from 1991 to 2006, but factors
   associated with high rates changed over time. The odds of caesarean
   sections decreased for wealthy, educated women over time. By 2006,
   region and urban versus rural residence were no longer significantly
   associated with caesarean sections.

AB Objective: We examined the effect of partner approval of contraception
   on intention to use contraception among women obtaining post-abortion
   care in Zanzibar.
   Study design: Our data source was a 2010 survey of 193 women obtaining
   post-abortion care at a large public hospital in Zanzibar. We used
   multivariable logistic regression analysis to assess associations
   between partner approval and intention to use contraception.
   Results: Overall, 23% of participants had used a contraceptive method in
   the past, and 66% reported intending to use contraception in the future.
   We found that partner approval of contraception and ever having used
   contraception in the past were each associated with intending to use
   contraception in the future. In the multivariable model, adjusting for
   past contraception use, partner approval of contraception was associated
   with 20 times the odds of intending to use contraception (odds ratio,
   20.25; 95% confidence interval, 8.45-48.56).
   Conclusions: We found a strong association between partner approval and
   intention to use contraception. Efforts to support contraceptive use
   must include both male and female partners.
   Implications: Public health and educational efforts to increase
   contraceptive use must include men and be targeted to both male and
   female partners. Given that male partners are often not present when
   women obtain health care, creative efforts will be required to meet men
   in community settings. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   the opportunity and challenge of defining the core knowledge and skills
   to be taught across course sections with a variety of themes. This study
   of students (N = 280) enrolled in 12 sections of a thematically-focused
   Introductory Sociology course presents our attempt to both define and
   assess a core set of concepts and skills through a pretest-posttest
   questionnaire to measure student learning gains relative to: (1) a
   sociological perspective, (2) sociological theory, (3) research methods,
   and (4) key concepts in sociology. Results show significant learning
   gains on all four dimensions, with the greatest gains coming in
   sociological theory. There were no significant differences in pretest
   scores by gender or by whether students had taken a sociology course in
   high school. Seniors scored significantly higher on both the pretest and
   the posttest, but after we controlled for pretest scores seniors did
   significantly better only on the subset of questions related to
   sociological theory. Students who took a sociology course in high school
   scored lower on the methods subscale of the posttest and had lower
   overall total posttest scores than their counterparts.

   pretests can establish students' prior knowledge at the beginning of the
   semester, while posttests measure learning at the end of the course.
   Namely, pretest-posttest knowledge gain was influenced more by the
   content and presentation of the social statistics course than by
   students' statistical ability and/or test-taking skills prior to the
   class. Recommendations on the use of pretest-posttest data to inform
   pedagogy in social statistics are included in the discussion.

AB This research is concerned with explaining consumer preference for
   Vermont artisan cheese and the relationship between that preference and
   sensory experience. Artisan cheesemaking is increasingly an important
   part of Vermont's dairy sector, and this tracks a growing trend of
   artisan agricultural practice in the United States. In popular discourse
   and academic research into products like artisan cheese, consumers
   explain their preferences in terms of intrinsic sensory and extrinsic -
   supposedly nonsensory food qualities. In laboratory sensory studies,
   however, the relationship between preference, intrinsic, and extrinsic
   qualities changes or disappears. In contrast, this study explains this
   relationship by adopting a social theory of sensory perception as a
   practice in everyday life. This theory is applied to a series of focus
   group interviews with Vermont artisan cheese consumers about their
   everyday perceptions. Based on the data, a conceptual framework for the
   sensory perception of Vermont artisan cheese is suggested: consumers
   combine information about producer practice, social context, and the
   materiality of the product through an active, learned practice of
   sensory perception. Particular qualities that drive consumer sensory
   experience and preference are identified from the interview data. Many
   of these qualities are difficult to categorize as entirely intrinsic or
   extrinsic, highlighting the need for developing new approaches of
   sensory evaluation in order to fully capture everyday consumer sensory
   perception. Thus, this research demonstrates that social theory provides
   new and valuable insights into consumer sensory preference for Vermont
   artisan cheese. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The concept of culture is now widely used by those who conduct research
   on safety and work-related injury outcomes. We argue that as the term
   has been applied by an increasingly diverse set of disciplines, its
   scope has broadened beyond how it was defined and intended for use by
   sociologists and anthropologists. As a result, this more inclusive
   concept has lost some of its precision and analytic power. We suggest
   that the utility of this "new" understanding of culture could be
   improved if researchers more clearly delineated the ideological - the
   socially constructed abstract systems of meaning, norms, beliefs and
   values (which we refer to as culture) - from concrete behaviors, social
   relations and other properties of workplaces (e.g., organizational
   structures) and of society itself. This may help researchers investigate
   how culture and social structures can affect safety and injury outcomes
   with increased analytic rigor. In addition, maintaining an analytical
   distinction between culture and other social factors can help
   intervention efforts better understand the target of the intervention
   and therefore may improve chances of both scientific and instrumental
   success. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Dogs play an important role in infectious disease transmission as
   reservoir hosts of many zoonotic and wildlife pathogens. Nevertheless,
   unlike wildlife species involved in the life cycle of pathogens, whose
   health status might be a direct reflection of their fitness and
   competitive abilities, dog health condition could be sensitive to
   socio-economic factors impacting the well-being of their owners. Here,
   we compare several dog health indicators in three rural communities of
   Panama with different degrees of socioeconomic deprivation. From a total
   of 78 individuals, we collected blood and fecal samples, and assessed
   their body condition. With the blood samples, we performed routine
   hematologic evaluation (complete blood counts) and measured cytokine
   levels (Interferon-gamma and Interleukin-10) through enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assays. With the fecal samples we diagnosed helminthiases.
   Dogs were also serologically tested for exposure to Trypanosoma cruzi
   and canine distemper virus, and molecular tests were done to assess T.
   cruzi infection status. We found significant differences between dog
   health measurements, pathogen prevalence, parasite richness, and
   economic status of the human communities where the dogs lived. We found
   dogs that were less healthy, more likely to be infected with zoonotic
   pathogens, and more likely to be seropositive to canine distemper virus
   in the communities with lower economic status. This study concludes that
   isolated communities of lower economic status in Panama may have less
   healthy dogs that could become major reservoirs in the transmission of
   diseases to humans and sympatric wildlife. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Introduction: The HIV pandemic disproportionately impacts young women.
   Worldwide, young women aged 15-24 are infected with HIV at rates twice
   that of young men, and young women alone account for nearly a quarter of
   all new HIV infections. The incommensurate HIV incidence in young -
   often poor - women underscores how social and economic inequalities
   shape the HIV epidemic. Confluent social forces, including political and
   gender violence, poverty, racism, and sexism impede equal access to
   therapies and effective care, but most of all constrain the agency of
   women.
   Methods: HIV prevalence data was compiled from the 2010 UNAIDS Global
   Report. Gender inequality was assessed using the 2011 United Nations
   Human Development Report Gender Inequality Index (GII). Logistic
   regression models were created with predominant mode of transmission
   (heterosexual vs. MSM/IDU) as the dependent variable and GII, Muslim vs.
   non-Muslim, Democracy Index, male circumcision rate, log gross national
   income (GNI) per capita at purchasing power parity (PPP), and region as
   independent variables.
   Results and discussion: There is a significant correlation between
   having a predominantly heterosexual epidemic and high gender inequality
   across all models. There is not a significant association between
   whether a country is predominantly Muslim, has a high/low GNI at PPP,
   has a high/low circumcision rate, and its primary mode of transmission.
   In addition, there are only three countries that have had a generalized
   epidemic in the past but no longer have one: Cambodia, Honduras, and
   Eritrea. GII data are available only for Cambodia and Honduras, and
   these countries showed a 37 and 34% improvement, respectively, in their
   Gender Inequality Indices between 1995 and 2011. During the same period,
   both countries reduced their HIV prevalence below the 1% threshold of a
   generalized epidemic. This represents limited but compelling evidence
   that improvements in gender inequality can lead to the abatement of
   generalized epidemics.
   Conclusions: Gender inequality is an important factor in the maintenance
   - and possibly in the establishment of - generalized HIV epidemics. We
   should view improvements in gender inequality as part of a broader
   public health strategy.

TI Widow cleansing and inheritance among the Luo in Kenya: the need for

AB Introduction: The customs of widow cleansing and widow inheritance are
   practiced in several communities throughout sub-Saharan Africa. In the
   Nyanza Province of Kenya, according to tradition, Luo widows are
   expected to engage in sexual intercourse with a "cleanser,'' without the
   use of a condom, in order to remove the impurity ascribed to her after
   her husband's death. Luo couples, including widows, are also expected to
   engage in sex preceding specific agricultural activities, building
   homes, funerals, weddings, and other significant cultural and social
   events. Widows who are inherited for the purpose of fulfilling cultural
   obligation have a higher prevalence of HIV than those who remain
   un-inherited or are inherited for the purpose of companionship.
   Methods: As part of a larger descriptive qualitative study to inform
   study procedures for FEM-PrEP, an HIV prevention pre-exposure
   prophylaxis clinical trial, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews
   (SSIs) with widows, 15 SSIs with inheritors, and four focus group
   discussions with widows in the Bondo and Rarieda districts in Nyanza
   Province to explore the HIV risk context within widow cleansing and
   inheritance practices. Thematic qualitative analysis was used to analyze
   the data.
   Results: The majority of widows reported in the demographic
   questionnaire being inherited, and most widows in the SSIs described
   participating in the cleansing ritual. We identified two main themes
   related to HIV prevention within the context of widow cleansing and
   inheritance: 1) widows must balance limiting their risk for HIV
   infection with meeting cultural expectations and ensuring that their
   livelihood needs are met, and 2) sexual abstinence undermines cultural
   expectations in widowhood while the use of condoms is deemed
   inappropriate in fulfilling culturally prescribed sexual rituals, and is
   often beyond the widow's ability to negotiate.
   Conclusions: Women-controlled HIV prevention methods such as
   antiretroviral-based oral pre-exposure prophylaxis, vaginal gels, and
   vaginal rings are needed for HIV-negative widows who engage in sexual
   rituals related to widowhood.

AB Affiliative social relationships (e.g., among spouses, family members,
   and friends) play an essential role in human society. These
   relationships affect psychological, physiological, and behavioral
   functions. As positive and enduring bonds are critical for the overall
   well-being of humans, it is not surprising that considerable effort has
   been made to study the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie social
   bonding behaviors. The present review details the involvement of the
   nonapeptides, oxytocin (OT), and arginine vasopressin (AVP), in the
   regulation of social bonding in mammals including humans. In particular,
   we will discuss the role of OT and AVP in the formation of social bonds
   between partners of a mating pair as well as between parents and their
   offspring. Furthermore, the role of OT and AVP in the formation of
   interpersonal bonding involving trust is also discussed.

AB Previous research suggests that social exclusion both acute and chronic
   may be associated with a pattern of blunted cardiovascular responding.
   But it is unknown to what extent acute and chronic exclusion interact.
   That is, what happens when victims of long-term social rejection
   encounter an instance of exclusion later in life? The goal of the
   present study was to test whether prior experience being bullied would
   alter cardiovascular responses to an acute experience of social
   exclusion. Participants took part in a short online chat, during which
   they were either included or excluded from the conversation. Consistent
   with hypotheses, all participants showed an increase in sympathetic
   activity in the exclusion condition, but this response was significantly
   blunted among those with more chronic history of bullying victimization.
   No differences were observed for parasympathetic activity. This pattern
   suggests that a history of chronic victimization magnifies the
   cardiovascular "blunting" shown previously among victims of ostracism.
   This line of work suggests that bullying victims may develop regulatory
   mechanisms in response to social threats, and this may ultimately
   provide valuable information for helping victims become more resilient.

AB Objective: Our objective was to use longitudinal data from a US birth
   cohort to test whether the probability of overweight or obesity during
   the first 6 years of life varied according to socioeconomic status.
   Design and Methods: Using six waves of longitudinal data from full-term
   children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort
   (2001-2007; n approximate to 4,950), we examined the prevalence of
   overweight or obesity (Body Mass Index (BMI)>2 standard deviations above
   age- and sex- specific WHO Childhood Growth Standard reference mean;
   henceforth, "overweight/obesity") according to age, socioeconomic
   status, and race/ethnicity using generalized estimating equation models.
   Results: The association between socioeconomic status and
   overweight/obesity varied significantly by race/ethnicity, but not by
   sex. Overweight/obesity was significantly associated with socioeconomic
   status among whites, Hispanics and Asians; the adjusted odds of
   overweight/obesity began to diverge according to SES after the first 9
   months of life. By approximately 4 years, children with the highest SES
   had a significantly lower odds of overweight/obesity. SES was not
   significantly related to overweight/obesity among African Americans and
   American Indians during early childhood.
   Conclusions: Few studies have assessed the associations between SES and
   overweight/obesity within racial/ethnic groups in the US. We find that
   in contemporary, US-born children, SES was inversely associated with
   overweight/obesity among more racial/ethnic groups (whites, Hispanics,
   and Asians) than previously reported.

AB Background Insured adults receive invasive cardiovascular procedures
   more frequently than uninsured adults. We examined the impact of
   healthcare reform in Massachusetts on use of coronary revascularization
   procedures and in-hospital and 1-year mortality by race/ethnicity,
   education, and sex.
   Methods and Results Using hospital claims data, we compared differences
   in coronary revascularization rates (coronary artery bypass grafting or
   percutaneous coronary intervention) and in-hospital mortality by
   race/ethnicity, education, and sex among Massachusetts residents aged 21
   to 64 years hospitalized with a principal discharge diagnosis of
   ischemic heart disease before (November 1, 2004, to July 31, 2006) and
   after (December 1, 2006, to September 30, 2008) reform; 1-year mortality
   was calculated for those undergoing revascularization. Adjusted logistic
   regression assessed 24 216 discharges before reform and 20 721
   discharges after reform. Blacks had 30% lower odds of receiving coronary
   revascularization than whites in the prereform period. Compared with
   whites in the postreform period, blacks (odds ratio=0.73; 95% confidence
   interval, 0.63-0.84) and Hispanics (odds ratio= 0.84; 95% confidence
   interval, 0.74-0.97) were less likely and Asians (odds ratio=1.29; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.01-1.65) were more likely to receive coronary
   revascularization. Patients living in more educated communities, men,
   and persons with private insurance were more likely to receive coronary
   revascularization before and after reform. Compared with the prereform
   period, the adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality were higher in
   patients living in less-educated communities in the postreform period.
   No differences in 1-year mortality by race/ethnicity, education, or sex
   for revascularized patients were observed before or after reform.
   Conclusions Reducing insurance barriers to receipt of coronary
   revascularization procedures has not yet eliminated preexisting
   demographic and educational disparities in access to these procedures.

AB Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion,
   leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness.
   Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with
   people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from
   a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests
   that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be
   transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ
   337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment
   with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs
   outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the
   amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions
   were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative
   posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern
   occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on
   Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence
   for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests
   that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and
   nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and
   that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a
   positive experience for people.

AB Objectives: To examine the independent influence of school economic
   deprivation, social fragmentation, and social cohesion on the likelihood
   of participating in no physical activity among students.
   Methods: Data are from a large-scale longitudinal study of schools based
   in disadvantaged communities in Quebec, Canada. Questionnaires were
   administered every year between 2002 and 2008 among n = 14,924 students
   aged 12 to 18 from a sample of 70 schools. Cross-sectional and
   longitudinal analyses were conducted. Multilevel modeling was utilized
   to account for the clustering of students within schools. Schools were
   categorized as being low, moderate or high economic deprivation, social
   fragmentation and social cohesion. Those who indicated that they do no
   participate in any physical activity during the week were identified as
   being physically inactive.
   Results: In baseline multilevel cross-sectional analyses, adolescents
   attending schools in the highest (compared to the lowest) levels of
   socioeconomic deprivation and social fragmentation were more likely to
   be physically inactive (OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.72; and OR = 1.24,
   95% CI = 0.98, 1.56, respectively). Conversely, students attending
   schools with the highest cohesion were less likely to be physically
   inactive (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.61, 0.99). In longitudinal analysis,
   physically active students who attended schools with the highest social
   fragmentation were more likely to become physically inactive over two
   years (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.09, 2.51).
   Conclusion: The school socioeconomic environment appears to be an
   important contextual influence on participation in no physical activity
   among adolescents. Following adolescents beyond two years is necessary
   to determine if these environments have a lasting effect on physical
   activity behavior.

TI National Economic Development and Disparities in Body Mass Index: A

AB Background: Increases in body mass index (BMI) and the prevalence of
   overweight in low- and middle income countries (LMICs) are often
   ascribed to changes in global trade patterns or increases in national
   income. These changes are likely to affect populations within LMICs
   differently based on their place of residence or socioeconomic status
   (SES).
   Objective: Using nationally representative survey data from 38 countries
   and national economic indicators from the World Bank and other
   international organizations, we estimated ecological and multilevel
   models to assess the association between national levels of gross
   domestic product (GDP), foreign direct investment (FDI), and mean
   tariffs and BMI.
   Design: We used linear regression to estimate the ecological association
   between average annual change in economic indicators and BMI, and
   multilevel linear or ordered multinomial models to estimate associations
   between national economic indicators and individual BMI or over- and
   underweight. We also included cross-level interaction terms to highlight
   differences in the association of BMI with national economic indicators
   by type of residence or socioeconomic status (SES).
   Results: There was a positive but non-significant association of GDP and
   mean BMI. This positive association of GDP and BMI was greater among
   rural residents and the poor. There were no significant ecological
   associations between measures of trade openness and mean BMI, but FDI
   was positively associated with BMI among the poorest respondents and in
   rural areas and tariff levels were negatively associated with BMI among
   poor and rural respondents.
   Conclusion: Measures of national income and trade openness have
   different associations with the BMI across populations within developing
   countries. These divergent findings underscore the complexity of the
   effects of development on health and the importance of considering how
   the health effects of "globalizing" economic and cultural trends are
   modified by individual-level wealth and residence.

AB Toxocariasis is increasingly recognized as an important neglected
   infection of poverty (NIP) in developed countries, and may constitute
   the most important NIP in the United States (US) given its association
   with chronic sequelae such as asthma and poor cognitive development. Its
   potential public health burden notwithstanding, toxocariasis
   surveillance is minimal throughout the US and so the true burden of
   disease remains uncertain in many areas. The Third National Health and
   Nutrition Examination Survey conducted a representative serologic survey
   of toxocariasis to estimate the prevalence of infection in diverse US
   subpopulations across different regions of the country. Using the NHANES
   III surveillance data, the current study applied the predicted
   probabilities of toxocariasis to the sociodemographic composition of New
   York census tracts to estimate the local probability of infection across
   the city. The predicted probability of toxocariasis ranged from 6% among
   US-born Latino women with a university education to 57% among immigrant
   men with less than a high school education. The predicted probability of
   toxocariasis exhibited marked spatial variation across the city, with
   particularly high infection probabilities in large sections of Queens,
   and smaller, more concentrated areas of Brooklyn and northern Manhattan.
   This investigation is the first attempt at small-area estimation of the
   probability surface of toxocariasis in a major US city. While this study
   does not define toxocariasis risk directly, it does provide a much
   needed tool to aid the development of toxocariasis surveillance in New
   York City.

AB The superior academic achievement of Asian Americans is a
   well-documented phenomenon that lacks a widely accepted explanation.
   Asian Americans' advantage in this respect has been attributed to three
   groups of factors: (i) socio-demographic characteristics, (ii) cognitive
   ability, and (iii) academic effort as measured by characteristics such
   as attentiveness and work ethic. We combine data from two nationally
   representative cohort longitudinal surveys to compare Asian-American and
   white students in their educational trajectories from kindergarten
   through high school. We find that the Asian-American educational
   advantage is attributable mainly to Asian students exerting greater
   academic effort and not to advantages in tested cognitive abilities or
   socio-demographics. We test explanations for the Asian-white gap in
   academic effort and find that the gap can be further attributed to (i)
   cultural differences in beliefs regarding the connection between effort
   and achievement and (ii) immigration status. Finally, we highlight the
   potential psychological and social costs associated with Asian-American
   achievement success.

AB Recent advances in the science and technology of global supply chain
   management offer near-real-time demand-response systems for
   decision-makers across production networks. Technology is helping propel
   "fast fashion" and "lean manufacturing," so that companies are better
   able to deliver products consumers want most. Yet companies know much
   less about the environmental and social impacts of their production
   networks. The failure to measure and manage these impacts can be
   explained in part by limitations in the science of sustainability
   measurement, as well as by weaknesses in systems to translate data into
   information that can be used by decision-makers inside corporations and
   government agencies. There also remain continued disincentives for firms
   to measure and pay the full costs of their supply chain impacts. I
   discuss the current state of monitoring, measuring, and analyzing
   information related to supply chain sustainability, as well as progress
   that has been made in translating this information into systems to
   advance more sustainable practices by corporations and consumers. Better
   data, decision-support tools, and incentives will be needed to move from
   simply managing supply chains for costs, compliance, and risk reduction
   to predicting and preventing unsustainable practices.

AB Despite advances intreatment, including the introductionof rituximab,
   survival after diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains
   heterogeneous. However, no studies have considered the association
   between neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity on
   DLBCL mortality before (1988-2000) and after (2001-2009) the
   introduction of rituximab. We studied all 33 032DLBCL patients diagnosed
   between 1988-2009 in California for vital status through December 31,
   2010. Patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2009 vs 1988 to 2000 had
   significantly decreased overall and DLBCL-specific mortality. However,
   those living in lower SES neighborhoods had 34% (95% confidence interval
   [CI], 27%-40%) and 24% (95% CI, 16%-32%) higher mortality rate from all
   causes and lymphoma, respectively, than patients in higher SES
   neighborhoods. The magnitude of mortality disparities by neighborhood
   SES was more marked in younger (<65 years) than in older patients (>= 65
   years), in married than nonmarried patients, and after 2000. We
   concluded that patients living in low SES neighborhoods had
   substantially worse survival after DLBCL, and this disparity was
   striking in younger (ie, not eligible for Medicare-aged) patients,
   married patients, and after the introduction of rituximab. These
   disparities suggest there are barriers, including inadequate insurance
   coverage with additional financial burden, to effective treatment among
   socioeconomically disadvantaged patients.

AB Background: In Tamil Nadu, India, bacille Calmette-Guerin,
   diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, and
   measles vaccines are part of the routine immunization schedule and are
   available free from government health centers. All other vaccines are
   optional and available in the private sector at a cost to families. This
   study assesses immunization rates of routine and optional vaccines and
   examines parental attitudes toward vaccines in Pallavapuram, Tamil Nadu.
   Methods: The cluster sampling method was used to estimate immunization
   coverage. Seven children 18 to 36 months old were selected from 30
   clusters for a total sample of 210 children. Demographics and
   vaccination data were collected from interviews and immunization
   records. Predictors of vaccination status were identified with logistic
   regression models. In addition, 21 parents participated in
   semi-structured interviews regarding their attitudes toward vaccination.
   Interviews were analyzed qualitatively for themes.
   Results: Eighty one percent of children were fully immunized with
   routine vaccines. However, only 21% received all "major" optional
   vaccines, defined as 3 doses of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine,
   one dose of measles, mumps, rubella vaccine, and one dose of varicella
   zoster virus vaccine. Birth in a private hospital (OR 5.6, 95% CI 1.3 to
   22.9, P < 0.01), higher income (P = 0.03), and maternal completion of
   high school (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.5 to 27.6, P < 0.01) were significant
   predictors of receiving all major optional vaccines. Elucidated themes
   from interviews included (1) strong parental support for immunizations,
   (2) low concern for side effects, and (3) low uptake of optional
   vaccines due to high cost and lack of awareness.
   Conclusions: Coverage of optional vaccines is low despite positive
   attitudes toward immunizations. Efforts to reduce cost and increase
   awareness of these vaccines particularly among low-income families or to
   include these vaccines in the routine schedule may increase uptake and
   reduce morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases. (C)

AB Background: A vast literature has associated height with numerous
   factors, including biological, psychological, socioeconomic,
   anthropologic, genetic, environmental, and ecologic, among others. The
   aim of this study is to examine, among U.S. women, height factors
   focusing on health, income, education, occupation, social activities,
   religiosity and subjective well-being.
   Methods/Findings: Data are from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
   Observational Study. Participants are 93,676 relatively healthy women
   ages 49-79; 83% of whom are White, 17% Non-White. Statistical analyses
   included descriptive statistics, chi-square and multivariable covariance
   analyses. The mean height of the total sample is 63.67 inches. White
   women are significantly taller than Non-White women, mean heights 63.68
   vs. 63.63 inches (p = 0.0333). Among both Non-White and White women
   height is associated with social behavior, i.e. attendance at
   clubs/lodges/groups. Women who reported attendance 'once a week or more
   often' were taller than those who reported 'none' and 'once to 3 times a
   month'. Means in inches are respectively for: White women-63.73 vs.
   63.67 and 63.73 vs. 63.67, p = 0.0027. p = 0.0298; Non-White women:
   63.77 vs. 63.61 and 63.77 vs. 63.60, p = 0.0050, P = 0.0094. In both
   White and Non-White women, income, education and subjective well-being
   were not associated with height. However, other factors differed by
   race/ethnicity. Taller White women hold or have held
   managerial/professional jobs-yes vs. no-63.70 vs. 63.66 inches; P =
   0.036; and given 'a little' strength and comfort from religion' compared
   to 'none' and 'a great deal', 63.73 vs. 63.66 P = 0.0418 and 63.73 vs.
   63.67, P = 0.0130. Taller Non-White women had better health-excellent or
   very good vs. good, fair or poor-63.70 vs. 63.59, P = 0.0116.
   Conclusions: Further research in diverse populations is suggested by the
   new findings: being taller is associated with social activities
   -frequent attendance clubs/lodges/groups'', and with 'a little' vs.
   'none' or 'great deal' of strength and comfort from religion.

AB In this paper, I investigate the role of the non-Amish midwife in Amish
   society. Conventional research on the Amish has overlooked the role the
   midwife plays in the structure of the Amish community, given that
   midwives who serve the Amish are not members of the community they serve
   and are not themselves Amish. Despite their status as outsiders to Amish
   society, I draw on ethnographic data collected during a two-year study
   with a non-Amish midwife to argue that the non-Amish midwife provides
   Amish women and men access to knowledge about sex and sexuality,
   provides them resources such as books and condoms, and shapes the
   structure of Amish society through these channels. Her power is clearly
   demonstrated in her ability to broker access between the Amish and
   non-Amish worlds, and her fingerprints on the community she serves exist
   long after she has caught a baby. So while the non-Amish midwife has
   largely remained invisible when viewed from conventional analyses of
   Amish society, I suggest that her position on the margin between Amish
   and non-Amish society is worth considering. As an analytic category,
   this position 'neither fully part of Amish society nor fully extricated
   from it has something to offer studies of community power within the
   field of Sociology and augment future studies of Amish society.

AB This article takes a brief look at the manner in which African American
   females in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math
   (STEM) have been studied over the years. Noting that this group faces
   challenges due to gender and race, research has not always presented
   their struggles and successes from both a sociological and psychological
   view. Socialization theory has yielded a great deal of information
   despite the socialization process being driven by those in charge of the
   structure by which a person progresses through the STEM fields.
   Acculturation theory provides a glimpse of how African American females
   in these aforementioned fields progress from their perspective.
   Acculturation framework is of value because it parallels the emotional,
   cognitive, and behavior patterns students take as they progress through
   graduate school in order to become colleagues of the very professors
   that taught them. The framework considers the effects of the person's
   previous background and experiences, their coping skills and tactics,
   which are important to the success of African American females. Another
   common dynamic across the theory of acculturation and the experiences of
   these women is choice and the freedom to choose their own acculturation
   patterns.

   Objective: To examine the prevalence of discrimination experiences in
   urban Latina Immigrants and identify socio-cultural and healthcare
   factors that predict discrimination experiences.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey of 166 Latino immigrants.,
   Measurements: Socio-cultural: region of origin, Primary language, and
   education. Healthcare factors: insurance, place of care,
   patient-provider communication, trust in provider, and satisfaction with
   care. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine factors that
   predicted discrimination.
   Results: 42% had at least one discrimination experienOe. Communication
   with providers was the factor most strongly' associated with reporting
   having a discrimination experience while controlling for other variables
   (p<. 01). Women with good communication with their provider were 71%
   less likely to report discrimination.
   Conclusion: Better communication with providers may recluce Latinas'
   perceptions of discrimination and thereby improve healthcare access and

AB Purpose: This study examined institutional strategies.among pediatric
   residency programs for recruitment and retention of underrepresented
   minorities (URM) housestaff. Procedures: A questionnaire developed by
   the authors in a 1992 study was modified and then mailed to 185
   pediatric chief residents at non-military pediatric training programs in
   the United States. Descriptive statistics (means and frequency) were
   calculated for each question. There were three rounds' of mailings and a
   telephone follow-up. Main Finding: The response rate was 39% (n=73).
   Thirty-eight percent reported that URM housestaff recruitment and
   retention was a priority for their program directors, 37% reported that
   it was a priority for themselves. 25% reported it was a priority for the
   hospital administration, and 36% reported that they were riot sure about
   the priority of URM housestaff recruitment and retention within their
   organization. Sixty-seven percent stated that their housestaff selection
   committees do not have defined recruitment goals, 6% indicated that
   their committees have specifically defined recruitment goals, and 27%
   were not sure. Conclusions: Despite numerous initiatives from government
   agencies:: medical institutions, and institutions of higher education, a
   critical gap remains among institutions in their recruitment efforts for
   URM at the level of residency training. Our study suggests that
   pediatric chief residents may not be adequately educated or primed
   regarding the importance of recruitment and retention of URM. As
   individuals involved with both medical training,and hospital hierarchy,
   they are uniquely positioned to influence and carry out program goals
   and objectives.

   ethnographic research of one affiliate of Voice of the Faithful, a group
   of Catholics that formed in the wake of the clergy sexual abuse crisis.
   The abiding faith of the group and their commitment to change the church
   created a dilemma that encapsulates the central question of this
   article: how do challengers pursuing change of an institution balance
   commitment and critique, mainstream membership and otherness? Internal
   challengers manage these dilemmas by rescripting existing stories and
   telling novel ones to navigate group boundaries and formulate new
   understandings of their individual and collective pasts, presents, and
   futures. We trace the ways in which challengers work through
   contradictions and ambiguity in their emergent identities. This provides
   an opportunity to explore the existential dimensions of collective
   identity and focus on the processual nature of storytelling.

   year-round and seasonal dietary patterns of women in the Terai of Nepal
   by sociodemographic status, using a novel, weekly single-visit and usual
   food frequency questionnaire that links recall to the agricultural
   season. The study was conducted across seasons in 2006-2008 among 15,899
   women of reproductive age in Sarlahi district. Intakes were tabulated
   for all foods, overall and by socioeconomic status (SES), and in and out
   of season, as appropriate. Foods consumed regularly [ median
   (interquartile range) weekly frequency] were rice [13 (7-13)], potatoes
   [10 (5-13)], legumes [6 (2-9)], and vegetable oil [13 (13-13)]. Animal
   products were infrequently consumed [1 (0-2) time per week] as were
   fruits and vegetables, most with a median weekly intake frequency of 0.
   Higher SES was associated with more frequent consumption of most
   food-groups, including in-season fruits and vegetables. Diets of women
   in the Terai of Nepal lack diversity and, likely, nutrient adequacy,
   which may pose health risks.

AB I use the collection of carnal ethnographies of martial arts and combat
   sports assembled by Raul Sanchez and Dale Spencer under the title
   Fighting Scholars to spotlight the fruitfulness of deploying habitus as
   both empirical object (explanandum) and method of inquiry (modus
   cognitionis). The incarnate study of incarnation supports five
   propositions that clear up tenacious misconceptions about habitus and
   bolster Bourdieu's dispositional theory of action: (1) far from being a
   black box, habitus is fully amenable to empirical inquiry; (2) the
   distinction between primary (generic) and secondary (specific) habitus
   enables us to capture the malleability of dispositions; (3) habitus is
   composed of cognitive, conative and affective elements: categories,
   skills, and desires; (4) habitus allows us to turn carnality from
   problem to resource for the production of sociological knowledge; and
   (5) thus to realize that all social agents are, like martial artists,
   suffering beings collectively engaged in embodied activities staged
   inside circles of shared commitments.

AB Work in body studies and theories of affect challenge the mind/body
   dualism where human action/behavior is shown to be an embodied, lived
   event. More specifically, bodily practices not only inform/shape human
   subjectivity but convey what languagewordsoften cannot. BDSM is one such
   practice that illuminates embodied subjectivities, where the flesh
   proves pivotal to one's orientation to/with the world. In this article I
   explore women BDSMers who, as survivors of sexual violence, engage in
   BDSM rape play. BDSM rape play foregrounds the flesh, exemplifying quite
   powerfully bodily capacity, one where bodily disintegration that
   occurred with the sexual assault is disrupted through bodily
   recuperation. This felt experiencethe body as the source of
   insightcarries considerable weight, and should inform our thinking when
   it comes to feminist explorations of sexuality and those contentious and
   controversial practices such as BDSM.

AB In this response to my critics, I amplify the conceptual clarification
   and methodological stipulation of habitus begun in Homines in extremis'
   to help us move from a sociology of the body as socially construc-ted
   object to a sociology from the body as socially construc-ting vector of
   knowledge, power, and practice. The specification of habitus by
   membership in collectives, attachment to institutions, and analytic
   purpose makes it a flexible multi-scalar notion with which to construct
   the epistemic individual and account for both reproduction and change,
   conformity and creativity, as well as self-revision. For this, we must
   reject theological interpretations that rigidly lock habitus into
   Bourdieu's framework; avoid conflating the formal properties of the
   notion with its concrete features in specific settings and cases; and
   distinguish between the rhetorical invocation of his concepts (speaking
   Bourdieuese') and their effective deployment in the construction of the
   empirical object. As embodied and embedded capacity, habitus brings
   temporality, depth, and desire to the analytic epicenter. It reminds us
   that the social world is not transparent, open-ended, and instantaneous,
   but endowed with gravity, opacity, and asymmetry. Treating the sentient
   and skilled organism as fount of both social intelligence and
   sociological acumen can help historical social science connect with
   enactive psychology and recover the carnality of action that
   conventional accounts of social life routinely erase.

AB Ethnography is often described as the translation of culture, yet there
   has been little discussion of actual linguistic translation in
   ethnography. Many ethnographers engage in research across divides of
   language that require them to make decisions about how to represent the
   language of their informants. The privileging of academic Standard
   English creates dilemmas for ethnographers whose subjects speak
   stigmatized languages. Based on an analysis of 32 book-length
   ethnographies about African Americans (reviewed in the American Journal
   of Sociology between 1999 and 2009), this article answers the questions
   of how ethnographers typically deal with language difference in their
   texts, particularly when research takes place across dialects of the
   same language, and why language matters in the production of
   ethnographic texts.

AB Theorized as a Bourdieusian field, this article examines changes inside
   the tattoo world resulting in the valuation of certain tattoo practices
   as art and some actors taking 'fine art' positions within it. The
   category of tattoo art is distinct from tattoo because it positions the
   practice away from its traditional historic moorings as a lowbrow craft
   and occupation requiring a rudimentary level of technical skill. In
   contrast, tattoo art is created and evaluated within academic discourses
   and traditional fine art ideologies that stress innovation, creativity,
   and exclusivity. In addition to mastery of the medium, that is, applying
   the tattoo to skin, tattoo artists create original works that qualify as
   artistic by art world conventions. This process of artification has
   changed the symbolic meanings and valuation of a practice, imbuing
   tattoo art with cultural legitimacy from the inside.

AB Objectives. I examined community risk factors that explained variation
   in suicide rates among young rural Alaska Native men, evaluating the
   effectiveness of local alcohol control as a public health policy to
   reduce this population's historically high vulnerability.
   Methods. I compiled suicide data, alcohol control status, and
   community-level social, cultural, and economic characteristics for
   Alaska Native men aged 15 to 34 years in 178 small Alaska communities
   from 1980 to 2007. Poisson regression equations explained variation in
   suicide rates as a function of endogenous alcohol control and community
   characteristics.
   Results. Suicide rates were higher in communities prohibiting alcohol
   importation under state law, but the effect was not significant after
   controlling for other community characteristics. More remote
   communities, those with fewer non-Natives, and those with evidence of
   cultural divides had higher suicide risks. Communities with higher
   incomes, more married couples, and traditional elders had lower risks.
   Conclusions. Alcohol control is ineffective in preventing suicide among
   Alaska Natives; suicide instead appears related to particular complex
   community characteristics that are either protective or increase risk.
   Communities have limited means to pursue economic and cultural
   development strategies that might offer more protection.

AB American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) death rates declined over most

   responsible for health care in 1956. Since then, rates have declined
   further, although they have stagnated since the 1980s. These overall
   patterns obscure substantial regional differences. Most significant,
   rates in the Northern and Southern Plains have declined far less since
   1949 to 1953 than those in the East, Southwest, or Pacific Coast. Data
   for Alaska are not available for the earlier period, so its trajectory
   of mortality cannot be ascertained. Socioeconomic measures do not
   adequately explain the differences and rates of change, but migration,
   changes in self-identification as an AI/AN person, interracial marriage,
   and variations in health care effectiveness all appear to be implicated.

AB The integration of public health practices with federal health care for
   American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) largely derives from three
   major factors: the sovereign nature of AI/AN tribes, the sociocultural
   characteristics exhibited by the tribes, and that AI/ANs are distinct
   populations residing in defined geographic areas. The earliest services
   consisted of smallpox vaccination to a few AI/AN groups, a purely public
   health endeavor. Later, emphasis on public health was codified in the
   Snyder Act of 1921, which provided for, among other things, conservation
   of the health of AI/AN persons. Attention to the community was greatly
   expanded with the 1955 transfer of the Indian Health Service from the US
   Department of the Interior to the Public Health Service and has
   continued with the assumption of program operations by many tribes
   themselves. We trace developments in integration of community and public
   health practices in the provision of federal health care services for
   AI/AN persons and discuss recent trends.

AB In this article, I explicate an organizational theory that links global

   manufacturing specialization. To subject the theory to empirical
   scrutiny, I derive cross-nationally comparable measurements of the
   average network position of resident firms in two industries with
   ideal-typical forms of network governance-garments and transportation
   equipment. Analytical results suggest that manufacturing specialization
   varies by network position in both industries, even when controlling for
   time-invariant country-specific organizational unobservables and
   conventional thinking on international specialization. Moreover, these
   networks matter only during the period after which the two types of
   governance are alleged to have become the predominant organizational
   logic of the two industries, and are more important for manufacturing
   specialization in the transport-equipment industry. The article
   concludes by implicating these findings in discussions of the
   distribution of the gains from networked forms of economic organization.

AB This paper develops a theoretical integration and estimates an
   associated structural equation model of the ecological footprints of
   nations. The ecological footprint is an approximation of environmental
   pressure on natural resources that stems from production, consumption,
   and the resultant disposal of waste. We use structural equation modeling
   techniques to test an integrative perspective based on direct and
   indirect effects, taken from human ecology, ecological economics,
   modernization, and political economy approaches, as well as from the
   natural sciences. We find evidence for the conjuncture of many of the
   theories investigated and for contextualizing the footprint in a global
   network of causes. The model raises questions about conclusions reached
   in prior analyses based on direct effects only. The significant roles
   played by natural and economic forces suggest a need to attend to
   multidisciplinary dynamics. With the exception of " weak
   sustainability," the indirect and direct impacts suggest ever-escalating
   levels of the footprints of nations.

AB This address is a contribution to the study of "lived religion," that
   is, the embodied and enacted forms of spirituality that occur in
   everyday life. Like the children's books that ask "where's Waldo,"
   sociologists are invited to think about the many ways in which we need
   to refocus our work in order to see the religion that often appears in
   unexpected places. As the discipline has broadened its geographical and
   cultural vision, it also must broaden its understanding of what religion
   is. Religion is neither an all-or-nothing category nor a phenomenon that
   is confined to a single institutional sphere. Understanding the
   multilayered nature of everyday reality and the permeability of all
   social boundaries makes a more nuanced study of religion possible. Using
   data from the "Spiritual Narratives in Everyday Life" project, it is
   suggested that religion can be found in the conversational spaces-both
   in religious organizations and beyond-where sacred and mundane
   dimensions of life are produced and negotiated.

AB Research in the sociology of work has long considered the importance of
   individual worker values but has not considered one of the central
   sources of those values: the congregation. In this study, we examine
   this understudied relationship and propose greater theoretical
   specification on religious capital. We argue that religious capital,
   like social capital, may have bridging characteristics. We introduce the
   concept of workplace-bridging religious capital (WBRC) and describe its
   cultivation within congregations. Using data from a survey of 1,000
   fulltime workers, we test the relationship of WBRC (measured with a
   15-item Congregational Faith at Work Scale, CFWS) to workplace
   commitment, job satisfaction, and entrepreneurial behavior. While CFWS
   alone is not significantly related to workplace commitment or job
   satisfaction, the interaction of CFWS and church attendance is
   significant for all three workplace outcomes. Thus, the influence of
   congregational beliefs on work attitudes and practices is contingent
   upon an individual's level of involvement in the congregation. This
   study builds on the growing body of literature that identifies religious
   influences in nonreligious domains of everyday life.

AB Objective. Revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) is associated with
   increased cost, morbidity, and technical challenge compared to primary
   THA. A better understanding of the risk factors for early revision is
   needed to inform strategies to optimize patient outcomes.
   Methods. A total of 207,256 patients who underwent primary THA between
   1997-2005 in California and New York were identified from statewide
   databases. Unique patient identifiers were used to identify early
   revision THA (<10 years from index procedure). Patient characteristics
   (demographics, comorbidities, insurance type, and preoperative
   diagnosis), community characteristics (education level, poverty, and
   population density), and hospital characteristics (annual THA volume,
   bed size, and teaching status) were evaluated using multivariable
   regression to determine risk factors for early revision.
   Results. The probabilities of undergoing early aseptic revision and
   early septic revision were 4% and <1% at 5 years, respectively. Women
   were 29% less likely than men to undergo early septic revision (P <
   0.001). Patients with Medicaid and Medicare were 91% and 24%,
   respectively, more likely to undergo early septic revision than
   privately insured patients (P = 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively).
   Hospitals performing < 200 THAs annually had a 34% increased risk of
   early aseptic revision compared to hospitals performing >400 THAs
   annually (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion. A number of identifiable factors, including younger age,
   Medicaid, and low hospital volume, increase the risk of undergoing early
   revision THA. Patient-level characteristics distinctly affect the risk
   of revision within 10 years, particularly if due to infection. Our
   findings reinforce the need for continued investigation of the
   predictors of early failure following THA.

AB Many of the most important properties of human groups - including
   properties that may give one group an evolutionary advantage over
   another - are properly defined only at the level of group organization.
   Yet at present, most work on the evolution of culture has focused solely
   on the transmission of individual-level traits. I propose a conceptual
   extension of the theory of cultural evolution, particularly related to
   the evolutionary competition between cultural groups. The key concept in
   this extension is the emergent group-level trait. This type of trait is
   characterized by the structured organization of differentiated
   individuals and constitutes a unit of selection that is qualitatively
   different from selection on groups as defined by traditional multilevel
   selection (MLS) theory. As a corollary, I argue that the traditional
   focus on cooperation as the defining feature of human societies has
   missed an essential feature of cooperative groups. Traditional models of
   cooperation assume that interacting with one cooperator is equivalent to
   interacting with any other. However, human groups involve differential
   roles, meaning that receiving aid from one individual is often preferred
   to receiving aid from another. In this target article, I discuss the
   emergence and evolution of group-level traits and the implications for
   the theory of cultural evolution, including ramifications for the
   evolution of human cooperation, technology, and cultural institutions,
   and for the equivalency of multilevel selection and inclusive fitness
   approaches.

AB In a new theory of conflict escalation, Randall Collins engages critical
   issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible
   theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He
   also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of
   social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative
   concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no
   mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his
   variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a
   computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of
   Collins's theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an
   agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With
   greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my
   alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory
   development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not
   found in Collins's model.

AB Sociologists have yet to theorize interactions with sonic materiality.
   In this article I introduce an analytical concept for the observation of
   interactions with sound. Sound has material effects in all situations.
   But the audibility of sonic objects is a relation of situated actors to
   material arrangements. Sonic object settings are dynamic material
   arrangements in which sonic qualities emerge for interpretation. The
   concept synthesizes research on sonic materiality, audibility, and
   interaction. After outlining the concept, I present an empirical
   illustration from an audio firm's R&D laboratory arranged to support a
   new technology called object-based audio. I observed engineers
   conducting two concurrent but contrasting experiments; results indicate
   how settings both enable and constrain the interpretation of sound.

AB This article proposes a model of cultural mechanisms based on the
   premises of structuralist cultural sociology and symbolic
   interactionism. I argue that the models of cultural mechanisms provided
   by the developing analytical sociology movement are inadequate, while
   the dominant theories of culture in action from cultural sociology are
   limited by their adoption of the individual as the primordial unit of
   analysis. I instead propose a model of culture in action that takes
   social situations as its primordial unit and that understands culture as
   a system of meanings that actors laminate into the situations they face
   through interactive processes of interpretation and performance. I then
   illustrate and develop the model through an analysis of the Great Stink
   of London in 1858, a sewerage crisis that triggered significant
   institutional transformations.

AB Objectives To assess the influence of subjective word-finding difficulty
   on degree of engagement in social leisure activities among individuals
   with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Design Analysis of data collected from
   the second cohort of the Multicenter Study of Predictors of Disease
   Course in Alzheimer's disease. Setting Four study sites in the United
   States and France. Participants Individuals diagnosed with mild to
   moderate AD (N=236). Measurements On separate questionnaires,
   participants were asked to 1) report whether they had trouble finding
   the right word when speaking (subjective word-finding difficulty) and 2)
   rate their frequency and enjoyment of social and nonsocial leisure
   activities. Objective language measures included object naming and
   verbal fluency. Measures of dependence, depression, cognitive status,
   age, sex, and education were also included as covariates in regression
   analyses. Results Fifty-two percent of the sample reported word-finding
   difficulty, and subjective complaints were correlated with poorer verbal
   fluency scores. Subjective word-finding difficulty was selectively
   related to social but not nonsocial activity measures. Endorsers of
   word-finding difficulty reported less frequency and enjoyment of social
   leisure activities, controlling for effects of covariates and objective
   word-finding ability. In contrast, lower engagement in nonsocial
   activities was associated with older age and higher depression scores
   but not with word-finding complaints. Caregivers' reports of study
   participants' activities corroborated these results. Conclusion
   Individuals with AD who are aware of increasing word-finding failures
   are less likely to participate in and enjoy socially oriented leisure
   activities. This finding may have significant implications for clinical
   and health outcomes in AD. Failure to evaluate subjective language
   complaints could result in social withdrawal symptoms, threatening the
   individual's quality of life and increasing caregiver burden. Reduced
   social interaction may ultimately exacerbate language symptoms over
   time.

AB Nursing homes can be grim, frightening places to many who encounter them
   for the first time. Part of this reaction may come from the way nursing
   homes remind us of our own frailty, the limits of our hopes of
   never-ending independence and self-determination. This essay details one
   physician's struggle to find value in the lives of his nursing home
   residents, working against a cultural insistence that life's meaning and
   value depend upon one's actions and achievements. Searching for and
   finding meaning that transcends the accomplishments and failures of
   life, that out-survives a failing mind and body is what allowed this
   physician to find the courage to resist his prejudices against the
   elderly and infirm. This courage to insist that life is of sufficient
   value as is, regardless of human ability, is what theologian Paul
   Tillich calls the courage to be.

AB This study assesses whether the growth in economic inequality since the
   late 1960s produced enhanced support for conservative policies in the
   U.S. House of Representatives. Tests of the effects of inequality and
   tests of hypotheses derived from minority threat theory are conducted
   using a pooled time-series, fixed-effects design. The political
   influence of the most menacing street crime the public blames on
   underclass minorities is captured as well. Analyses based on 1.488
   state-years show that income inequality, minority presence, and the
   murder rates reduce liberal roll-call votes. Interactions that assess
   period contrasts in the strength of relationships show that increases in
   inequality led to greater congressional support for conservative
   measures particularly in the later years of the post civil rights era.
   Such tests also support racial threat theory because they show that a
   strong negative relationship between African American presence and
   liberal roll-call votes persisted throughout this period. Such results
   corroborate claims (Bartels, 2008; Krugman, 2006) that the expansion in
   economic inequality since the late 1960s helped increase support for
   conservative legislation. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the geographic concentration of adult obesity
   prevalence by census tract (CT) in King County, WA, in relation to
   social and economic factors.
   METHODS AND DESIGN: Measured heights and weights from 59 767 adult men
   and women enrolled in the Group Health (GH) healthcare system were used
   to estimate obesity prevalence at the CT level. CT-level measures of
   socioeconomic status (SES) were median home values of owner-occupied
   housing units, percent of residents with a college degree and median
   household incomes, all drawn from the 2000 Census. Spatial regression
   models were used to assess the relation between CT-level obesity
   prevalence and socioeconomic variables.
   RESULTS: Smoothed CT obesity prevalence, obtained using an Empirical
   Bayes tool, ranged from 16.2-43.7% (a 2.7-fold difference). The spatial
   pattern of obesity was non-random, showing a concentration in south and
   southeast King County. In spatial regression models, CT-level home
   values and college education were more strongly associated with obesity
   than household incomes. For each additional $100 000 in median home
   values, CT obesity prevalence was 2.3% lower. The three SES factors
   together explained 70% of the variance in CT obesity prevalence after
   accounting for population density, race/ethnicity, age and spatial
   dependence.
   CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report to show major
   social disparities in adult obesity prevalence at the CT scale that is
   based, moreover, on measured heights and weights. Analyses of data at
   sufficiently fine geographic scale are needed to guide targeted local
   interventions to stem the obesity epidemic.

AB Study design: Longitudinal survey.
   Objectives: To determine in adults with pediatric-onset spinal cord
   injury (SCI) employment outcomes, longitudinal changes in employment
   over time and changes in psychosocial outcomes associated with
   employment status.
   Setting: Community setting.
   Methods: Adults who had sustained a SCI before 19 years of age and had
   completed at least three consecutive annual interviews were included in
   the study. Generalized estimating equation models were formulated to
   obtain odds ratio (OR) of change in employment status and outcomes over
   time.
   Results: Total 1691 interviews were conducted in 283 participants, 182
   men and 101 women (88% Caucasian; age at baseline, 27.3 +/- 3.7 years;
   duration at baseline, 12.7 +/- 5.0 years). At the last interview (age,
   34.4 +/- 5.2 years; duration, 19.9 +/- 6.1 years), 49.5% were employed
   and 47.0% had a baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degree. There was no
   significant change in employment status over time (OR 1.01, confidence
   interval (CI) 0.98-1.04). Odds of employment increased over time in
   participants who were women (1.04, CI 1.00-1.08), married (1.05, CI
   1.02-1.08) and attained baccalaureate (1.03, CI 1.00-1.07) or
   post-baccalaureate (1.05, CI 1.02-1.08) degree. Employment odds
   decreased with occurrence of autonomic dysreflexia (0.80, CI 0.65-0.99),
   spasticity (0.80, CI 0.59-0.99) or chronic medical condition (0.83, CI
   0.71-0.98). Life satisfaction scores increased over time in those who
   remained employed (1.11, CI 1.01-1.22); odds of depression increased
   over time in those who remained unemployed (1.13, CI 1.04-1.23).
   Conclusion: Employment status remained relatively stable in adults with
   pediatric-onset SCI; however, changes in employment were associated with
   education, secondary health conditions and psychosocial well-being.

AB In the ritual theories of Durkheim and Collins, collective effervescence
   is the engine that drives social solidarity. I use data from religious
   organizations to perform a rare test of this hypothesis. In addition,
   four other hypotheses from Collins's interaction ritual theory are
   tested regarding ritual dynamics that are expected to promote
   effervescence and solidarity. Congregational data from the 2001 United
   States Congregational Life Survey reveal the following: (1)
   organizational attendance rates strongly correlate with the dependent
   variables; (2) longer rituals tend to be more emotionally rewarding,
   although there appear to be diminishing returns for symbolic solidarity;
   (3) crowded rituals are more rewarding, although socioeconomic status is
   a crucial intervening variable; (4) barriers to outsiders in the form of
   behavioral proscriptions correlate with symbolic solidarity; and (5)
   most important, there is a consistent and robust relationship between
   effervescence and solidarity. Interaction ritual theory provides a
   valuable framework for understanding how some religious organizations
   become more effective than others at providing emotional and symbolic
   rewards for their members.

AB This article examines the influence of three dimensions of
   religionbelonging (faith tradition membership), behaving (frequency of
   service attendance), and context (one's relationship to aggregate
   population characteristics)on attitudes toward multiple forms of
   state-provided social protection, or welfare attitudes. To do so, this
   article uses data from 17 countries surveyed in the 2006 Role of
   Government wave of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP).
   Results from mixed effects regression show that contextual effects are
   highly predictive of welfare attitudes. Nations that are more
   religiously heterogeneous are less supportive of state protection, while
   nations that are more homogeneous, particularly Catholic nations, are
   more supportive. Results hold net of fractionalization, political
   institutional measures, and economic characteristics. At the individual
   level, all three dimensions of religiosity are predictive of welfare
   attitudes. These patterns suggest that in rich Western democracies,
   religion continues to play an important role in structuring the moral
   economies.

AB Objective: Cross-sectional studies have found that low-income and
   racial/ethnic minority women are more likely to use female sterilization
   and less likely to rely on a partner's vasectomy than women with higher
   incomes and whites. However, studies of pregnant and postpartum women
   report that racial/ethnic minorities, particularly low-income minority
   women, face greater barriers in obtaining a sterilization than do whites
   and those with higher incomes. In this paper, we address this apparent
   contradiction by examining the likelihood a woman gets a sterilization
   following each delivery, which removes from the comparison any
   difference in the number of births she has experienced.
   Study Design: Using the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth, we
   fit multivariable-adjusted logistic and Cox regression models to
   estimate odds ratios and hazard ratios for getting a postpartum or
   interval sterilization, respectively, according to race/ethnicity and
   insurance status.
   Results: Women's chances of obtaining a sterilization varied by both
   race/ethnicity and insurance. Among women with Medicaid, whites were
   more likely to use female sterilization than African Americans and
   Latinas. Privately insured whites were more likely to rely on vasectomy
   than African Americans and Latinas, but among women with Medicaid-paid
   deliveries reliance on vasectomy was low for all racial/ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: Low-income racial/ethnic minority women are less likely to
   undergo sterilization following delivery compared to low-income whites
   and privately insured women of similar parities. This could result from
   unique barriers to obtaining permanent contraception and could expose
   women to the risk of future unintended pregnancies.
   Implications: Low-income minorities are less likely to undergo
   sterilization than low-income whites and privately insured minorities,
   which may result from barriers to obtaining permanent contraception, and
   exposes women to unintended pregnancies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Scholars have suggested that the current era of indigenous citizenship
   in Latin America is characterized by a postmulticultural political order
   that effectively reverses the historical marginality of native
   populations in the region. This conception, however, minimizes the
   established insight that the social apertures of neoliberal culturalism
   depend on the creation of new exclusionary regimes based on the very
   same mechanisms of celebrating cultural difference. Drawing on a decade
   of field-based inquiries into indigenous experiences of marginality in
   South America's Gran Chaco, this article identifies how the widespread
   political empowerment of an indigenous majority is structurally
   predicated upon the hypermarginality of a stigmatized few. I describe
   the general features of hypermarginality as lived experience and
   emergent political regime, in relation to three properties of the
   stratifying craft of the neoliberal state: the contraction of authorized
   culture, the culturalization of legitimate indigenous life, and the
   state management of a global economy of cultural preservation. This
   essay illustrates how hypermarginality is a concrete political quandary
   that holds significant implications for social analysis and policy,
   including the need to rethink the relationships between the neoliberal
   and the indigenous in Latin America.

AB The tension between the values of economic equality and diversity can be

   partly because it deals with the sensitive area of culture and poverty.
   This article will focus on where this tension comes from, how and where
   it is expressed both worldwide and in the United States, and why
   anthropologists and sociologists neglect it. The tension expresses
   itself in predicaments in contexts ranging from government policy (e.
   g., on indigenous groups) to the workings of local antipoverty
   nonprofits, often confounding attempts to deal with the issue of
   inequality. The issue is neglected for a number of reasons, including
   the preferred narratives of poverty scholars and their assumptions about
   human aspiration and fault. Instead, I argue for better attention to the
   complexities of human action, culture, and agency in order to understand
   poverty and inequality.

AB Jiuzhaigou National Park (JNP) is a site of global conservation
   significance. Conservation policies in JNP include the implementation of
   two national reforestation programs to increase forest cover and the
   exclusion of local land-use. We use archaeological excavation,
   ethnographic interviews, remote sensing and vegetation surveys to
   examine the implications of these policies for non-forest, montane
   meadows. We find that Amdo Tibetan people cultivated the valley for >
   2,000 years, creating and maintaining meadows through land clearing,
   burning and grazing. Meadows served as sites for gathering plants and
   mushrooms and over 40 % of contemporary species are ethnobotanically
   useful. Remote sensing analyses indicate a substantial (69.6 %) decline
   in meadow area between 1974 and 2004. Respondents report a loss of their
   "true history" and connections to the past associated with loss of
   meadows. Conservation policies intended to preserve biodiversity are
   unintentionally contributing to the loss of these ecologically and
   culturally significant meadow habitats.

AB Contemporary perceivers encounter highly gendered imagery in media,
   social networks, and the workplace. Perceivers also express strong
   interpersonal biases related to targets' gendered appearances after mere
   glimpses at their faces. In the current studies, we explored adaptation
   to gendered facial features as a perceptual mechanism underlying these
   biases. In Study 1, brief visual exposure to highly gendered exemplars
   shifted perceptual norms for men's and women's faces. Studies 2-4
   revealed that changes in perceptual norms were accompanied by notable
   shifts in social evaluations. Specifically, exposure to feminine
   phenotypes exacerbated biases against hypermasculine faces, whereas
   exposure to masculine phenotypes mitigated them. These findings
   replicated across multiple independent samples with diverse stimulus
   sets and outcome measures, revealing that perceptual gender norms are
   calibrated on the basis of recent visual encounters, with notable
   implications for downstream evaluations of others. As such, visual
   adaptation is a useful tool for understanding and altering social biases
   related to gendered facial features.

AB To estimate the odds of breast cancer subtypes in minority populations
   versus non-Hispanic (NH) whites stratified by socioeconomic status (SES)
   [a composite of individual-level SES (insurance status) and area-level
   SES (median household income quartile from 2000 U.S. Census data)] using
   a large nationwide cancer database. We used the National Cancer Data
   Base to identify breast cancer cases diagnosed in 2010 and 2011, the
   only 2 years since U.S. cancer registries uniformly began collecting
   HER2 results. Breast cancer cases were classified into five subtypes
   based on hormone receptor (HR) and HER2 status: HR+/HER2-, HR+/HER2+,
   HR-/HER2+ (HER2-overexpressing), HR-/HER2- (TN), and unknown. A
   polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs)
   comparing the odds of non-HR+/HER2-subtypes to HR+/HER2- for
   racial/ethnic groups controlling for and stratifying by SES, using a
   composite of insurance status and area-level income. Compared with NH
   whites, NH blacks and Hispanics were 84 % (OR = 1.84; 95 % CI 1.77-1.92)
   and 17 % (OR = 1.17; 95 % CI 1.11-1.24) more likely to have TN subtype
   versus HR+/HER2-, respectively. Asian/Pacific Islanders (API) had 1.45
   times greater odds of being diagnosed with HER2-overexpressing subtype
   versus HR+/HER2- compared with NH whites (OR = 1.45; 95 % CI 1.31-1.61).
   We found similar ORs for race in high and low strata of SES. In a large
   nationwide hospital-based dataset, we found higher odds of having TN
   breast cancer in black women and of HER2-overexpressing in API compared
   with white women in every level of SES.

AB Discrimination has been found to be detrimental to health, but less is
   known about the influence of discrimination in health care. To address
   this, the current study (1) compared levels of racial/ethnic
   discrimination in health care among four race/ethnic groups; (2)
   determined associations between this type of discrimination and health
   care outcomes; and (3) assessed potential mediators and moderators as
   suggested by previous studies. Multivariate logistic regression models
   were used within a population-based sample of 1,699 White, African
   American, Mexican, and Puerto Rican respondents. Overall, 23 % of the
   sample reported discrimination in health care, with levels varying
   substantially by race/ethnicity. In adjusted models, this type of
   discrimination was associated with an increased likelihood of having
   unmet health care needs (OR = 2.48, CI = 1.57-3.90) and lower odds of
   perceiving excellent quality of care (OR = 0.43, CI = 0.28-0.66), but
   not with the use of a physician when not sick or use of alternative
   medicine. The mediating role of mental health factors was inconsistently
   observed and the relationships were not moderated by race/ethnicity.
   These findings expand the literature and provide preliminary evidence
   that can eventually inform the development of interventions and the
   training of health care providers.

   holding voluntary lay leadership positions in a church, regular church
   attenders who were not leaders, and those not regularly attending
   church. Functional status was tracked longitudinally over a 4-year
   period in a national sample of 1,152 Black and White older adults whose
   religious backgrounds were either Christian or unaffiliated. Leaders had
   significantly slower trajectories of increase in both the number of
   physical impairments and the severity of those impairments. Although
   regular church attenders who were not leaders had lower mean levels of
   impairment on both measures, compared with those not regularly attending
   church, the two groups of non-leaders did not differ from one another in
   their rates of impairment increase. Leadership roles may contribute to
   longer maintenance of physical ability in late life, and opportunities
   for voluntary leadership may help account for some of the health
   benefits of religious participation.

AB Objective. To determine the association between race, region and
   pre-diabetes.
   Method. The study used 2003-2007 United States baseline data from the
   Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study
   for this cross-sectional analysis. Participants in this study were 45
   years or older at recruitment. Logistic regression was used to assess
   whether race and region are associated with pre-diabetes independent of
   demographics, socioeconomic factors and risk factors.
   Results. Twenty-four percent of the study participants (n = 19,889) had
   pre-diabetes. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for having
   pre-diabetes was 1.28 (1.19-1.36) for blacks relative to whites and 1.18
   (1.10-1.26) for people living in the Stroke Belt region relative to the
   other parts of the United States. The odds of having pre-diabetes for
   Stroke Belt participants changed minimally after additional adjustment
   for race (OR = 1.20; 1.13-1.28), age and sex (OR = 1.24; 1.16-1.32),
   socioeconomic status (OR = 1.22; 1.15-1.31) and risk factors (OR = 1.26;
   1.17-1.35). In the adjusted model, being black was independently
   associated with pre-diabetes (OR = 1.19; 1.10-128).
   Conclusion. The prevalence of pre-diabetes was higher for both blacks
   and whites living in the Stroke Belt relative to living outside the
   Stroke Belt, and the prevalence of pre-diabetes was higher for blacks
   independent of region. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Recent availability of "big data" might be used to study
   whether and how sexual risk behaviors are communicated on real-time
   social networking sites and how data might inform HIV prevention and
   detection. This study seeks to establish methods of using real-time
   social networking data for HIV prevention by assessing I) whether
   geolocated conversations about HIV risk behaviors can be extracted from
   social networking data, 2) the prevalence and content of these
   conversations, and 3) the feasibility of using HIV risk-related
   real-time social media conversations as a method to detect HIV outcomes.
   Methods. In 2012, tweets (N = 553,186,061) were collected online and
   filtered to include those with HIV risk-related keywords (e.g., sexual
   behaviors and drug use). Data were merged with AIDSVU data on HIV cases.
   Negative binomial regressions assessed the relationship between HIV risk
   tweeting and prevalence by county, controlling for socioeconomic status
   measures.
   Results. Over 9800 geolocated tweets were extracted and used to create a
   map displaying the geographical location of HIV-related tweets. There
   was a significant positive relationship (p < .01) between HIV-related
   tweets and HIV cases.
   Conclusion. Results suggest the feasibility of using social networking
   data as a method for evaluating and detecting Human immunodeficiency
   virus (HIV) risk behaviors and outcomes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

AB With the intent of improving agricultural revenues and solidifying her
   place as an ecotourism destination, it has been proposed that the island
   nation of The Commonwealth of Dominica convert all agriculture to
   organic production. This study explores Dominica's current and potential
   domestic demand for organic and/or "locally grown" produce. Surveys were
   conducted with Dominican consumers to assess their opinions and
   willingness to pay for these products, and evaluated using a maximum
   likelihood estimation procedure. On average, Dominican consumers are
   willing to pay 17.5 % more for organic, and 12 % more for locally grown,
   produce. These results were varied significantly across demographic
   segments of the sampled population, respondent tastes and preferences,
   the health status of their family, and the extent to which they were
   early adopters of new products. Despite several expected challenges of a
   successful transition to organic, implementation of this policy may
   offer a net positive welfare increase for Dominica's permanent
   residents. Results from this analysis suggest that, from the perspective
   of domestic consumers, Dominica should continue to pursue the
   possibility of becoming an "Organic Island.".

AB Objective
   Prior studies of US Hispanics, largely performed on the East Coast, have
   found a younger age of dementia onset than in White non-Hispanics. We
   performed a cross-sectional study to examine clinical and
   sociodemographic variables associated with age of dementia diagnosis in
   older Hispanics and White, non-Hispanics in southern California.
   Methods
   Two hundred ninety (110 Hispanic and 180 White non-Hispanic) community
   dwelling, cognitively symptomatic subjects, aged 50 years and older,
   were assessed and diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease or
   probable vascular dementia. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype was
   assessed in a subset of cases. Analysis of variance and multiple
   stepwise linear regression were used to assess main effects and
   interactions of ethnicity with dementia severity (indexed by mini mental
   state examination scores) and other sociodemographic and clinical
   variables on age of dementia diagnosis.
   Results
   Hispanics were younger by an average of 4 years at the time of
   diagnosis, regardless of dementia subtype, despite a similar prevalence
   of the APOE epsilon 4 genotype. The earlier age at diagnosis for
   Hispanics was not explained by gender, dementia severity, years of
   education, history of hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, or diabetes.
   Only ethnicity was significantly associated with age of onset.
   Conclusions
   These findings confirm that US Hispanics living in the southwestern USA
   tend to be younger at the time of dementia diagnosis than their White
   non-Hispanic counterparts. As this is not explained by the presence of
   the APOE epsilon 4 genotype, further studies should explore other
   cultural, medical, or genetic risk factors influencing the age of
   dementia onset in this population. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons,

AB Objectives
   We explored relationships between general religiousness, positive
   religious coping, negative religious coping (spiritual struggle), and
   affective symptoms among geriatric mood disordered outpatients, in the
   northeastern USA.
   Methods
   We assessed for general religiousness (religious affiliation, belief in
   God, and private and public religious activity) and positive/negative
   religious coping, alongside interview and self-report measures of
   affective functioning in a diagnostically heterogeneous sample of n = 34
   geriatric mood disordered outpatients (n = 16 bipolar and n = 18 major
   depressive) at a psychiatric hospital in eastern Massachusetts.
   Results
   Except for a modest correlation between private prayer and lower
   Geriatric Depression Scale scores, general religious factors (belief in
   God, public religious activity, and religious affiliation) as well as
   positive religious coping were unrelated to affective symptoms after
   correcting for multiple comparisons and controlling for significant
   covariates. However, a large effect of spiritual struggle was observed
   on greater symptom levels (up to 19.4% shared variance). Further, mean
   levels of spiritual struggle and its observed effects on symptoms were
   equivalent irrespective of religious affiliation, belief, and private
   and public religious activity.
   Conclusions
   Previously observed effects of general religiousness on (less)
   depression among geriatric mood disordered patients may be less
   pronounced in less religious areas of the USA. However, spiritual
   struggle appears to be a common and important risk factor for depressive
   symptoms, regardless of patients' general level of religiousness.
   Further research on spiritual struggle is warranted among geriatric mood
   disordered patients. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Purpose: The optimal locoregional therapy for stage IIIA non-small cell
   lung cancer (NSCLC) is controversial, with definitive chemoradiation
   therapy (CRT) and neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery (NT-S) serving
   as competing strategies. In this study, we used the National Cancer
   Database to determine the prevalence and predictors of NT in a large,
   modern cohort of patients.
   Methods and Materials: Patients with stage IIIA NSCLC treated with CRT
   or NT-S between 2003 and 2010 at programs accredited by the Commission
   on Cancer were included. Predictors were categorized as clinical,
   time/geographic, socioeconomic, and institutional. In accord with the
   National Cancer Database, institutions were classified as
   academic/research program and as comprehensive and noncomprehensive
   community cancer centers. Logistic regression and random effects
   multilevel logistic regression were performed for univariable and
   multivariable analyses, respectively.
   Results: The cohort consisted of 18,581 patients, 3,087 (16.6%) of whom
   underwent NT-S (10.6% induction CRT, 6% induction chemotherapy). The
   prevalence of NT-S was constant over time, but there were significant
   relative 31% and 30% decreases in pneumonectomy and right-sided
   pneumonectomy, respectively, over time (P trend <.02). In addition to
   younger age, lower T stage, and favorable comorbidity score, indicators
   of higher socioeconomic status were strong independent predictors of
   NT-S, including white race, higher income, and private/managed
   insurance. The type of institution (academic/research program vs
   comprehensive or noncomprehensive community cancer centers, odds ratio
   1.54 and 2.08, respectively) strongly predicted NT-S, but treatment
   volume did not.
   Conclusions: Neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery was an uncommon
   treatment approach in Commission on Cancer programs, and the prevalence
   of postinduction pneumonectomy decreased over time. Higher socioeconomic
   status and treatment at academic institutions were significant
   predictors of NT-S. Further research should be performed to enable a
   better understanding of these disparities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper provides a frame for thinking about youths' public
   consumption of fast foods. It draws attention to the significance of the
   social encounters that surround food by giving greater analytical focus
   to the late sociologist, Erving Goffinan's conception of "the situation"
   than is typically given in research on youth food consumption. Focusing
   on the role of the situation in structuring the experience of youths'
   consumption of fast food directs attention to the significance of the
   body as symbolic resource, the collective mood, emotional energy
   affective gains, and the socio-spatial context to young people's
   participation in fast-food settings as consumers. A shift away from the
   individual youth food consumer as unit of analysis to a focus on
   situations provides greater analytical purchase in trying to work
   through the complicated relationship between youth agency and the
   consumer markets' influence over youth, as it plays out around and
   through food.

   Design: This analysis included Black and White respondents (>= 18 years)
   from the Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated
   Communities-Southwest Baltimore (EHDIC-SWB; N=1350) Study and the
   National Health Interview Survey (NHIS; N=67790). Respondents who
   reported no levels of moderate or vigorous physical activity, during
   leisure time, over a usual week were considered physically inactive.
   Results: After controlling for confounders, Blacks had higher adjusted
   odds of physical inactivity compared to Whites in the national sample
   (odds ratio [OR] = 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.30-1.51). In
   EHDIC-SWB, Blacks and Whites had a similar odds of physical inactivity
   (OR = 1.09; 95% CI.86-1.40).
   Conclusion: Social context contributes to our understanding of racial

EP 381
PD SUM 2014

AB Objectives: Although hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is
   associated with mortality reduction, it continues to be underutilized.
   The failure to conduct screening tests is a significant factor in the
   late diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma when curative interventions
   may not be feasible. Reasons for these low surveillance rates are
   unclear and need to be elucidated.
   Design, Setting, Patients: This retrospective study reviewed 616 cases
   of HCC from a hepatobiliary surgery office in Hawaii for age, sex,
   ethnicity, birthplace, residence, education, employment, insurance, and
   obesity to determine their influence on HCC screening.
   Main Outcome Measures: HCC screening.
   Results: Of the 616 cases, only 132 patients (21.4%) had undergone
   screening. Although the majority of patients were male, those who were
   screened were more likely to be female (P=.0082). However, multivariate
   analysis found ethnicity to be the sole determinant of screening
   (P<.0005). Koreans were more likely than Whites to have had screening,
   whereas Japanese, Pacific Islanders, and Filipinos were less likely. Age
   >60 years, sex, American birthplace, urban residence, high school
   completion, employment status, insurance, and BMI>35 kg/m(2) were not
   predictors of screening.
   Conclusions: Of the sociodemographic factors, ethnicity was important in
   predicting screening. Further research is needed to understand the
   reasons for these ethnic differences and to develop targeted
   interventions to improve hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance
   utilization rates.

AB Against the background of recent methodological debates pitting
   ethnography against interviewing, this paper offers a defense of the
   latter and argues for methodological pluralism and pragmatism and
   against methodological tribalism. Drawing on our own work and on other
   sources, we discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of
   interviewing. We argue that concern over whether attitudes correspond to
   behavior is an overly narrow and misguided question. Instead we offer
   that we should instead consider what interviewing and other data
   gathering techniques are best suited for. In our own work, we suggest,
   we have used somewhat unusual interviewing techniques to reveal how
   institutional systems and the construction of social categories,
   boundaries, and status hierarchies organize social experience. We also
   point to new methodological challenges, particularly concerning the
   incorporation of historical and institutional dimensions into
   interview-based studies. We finally describe fruitful directions for
   future research, which may result in methodological advances while
   bringing together the strengths of various data collection techniques.

AB Can quantitative evidence be valuable for qualitative research designs?
   Here, I first examine recent arguments by qualitative methodologists who
   challenge the conventional view that quantitative evidence is necessary
   for explanatory generalization, but note that many qualitative
   researchers frequently incorporate quantitative evidence in their
   studies, despite methodological arguments to the contrary. I then extend
   recent developments in mixed methods research to argue that quantitative
   evidence offers preliminary description of sociological patterns to be
   explained by qualitative investigation.

AB The present study evaluated the impact of the Collaborative Life Skills
   Program (CLS), a novel school-home psychosocial intervention, on social
   and behavioral impairments among children with attention and behavior
   problems. Fifty-seven ethnically/racially diverse children (70 % boys)
   with attention and/or behavior problems in the second through fifth
   grades participated in a pilot study. Ten school-based mental health
   professionals were trained and then implemented the intervention at
   their respective schools. Children significantly improved from pre- to
   post-treatment on parent, teacher, and report card ratings of children's
   social and behavioral functioning. Treatment improvements were
   consistent for children with and without co-occurring disruptive
   behavior problems. The impact of the intervention was enhanced when
   parents used the intervention strategies more regularly, according to
   both clinicians' and parents' reports. Findings support the emphasis of
   CLS on coordinating intervention strategies across contexts to
   facilitate the generalization of treatment-related improvements in
   social and behavioral functioning.

AB Most scholarship on media technologies can be organized along two main
   dimensions of inquiry: the production or consumption of these
   technologies, and their content or material dimensions. This map of the
   field of inquiry would produce four specific research areas: the
   production of content, the consumption of content, the production of
   materiality, and the consumption of materiality. Despite their
   respective contributions, these silos have also resulted in important
   scholarly limitations. Thus, in this paper, we consider the intellectual
   opportunities that arise from reevaluating these traditions through the
   lens of cosmopolitanism, which promotes the crossing of scholarly
   territories in the study of media technologies in order to rethink
   assumptions and taken-for-granted processes. We propose some steps
   toward cosmopolitanism in the study of media technologies by elaborating
   on the theoretical, methodological, pedagogical, and design implications
   of conducting research at the intersection of these four areas.

AB Background. Waiting time to deceased donor kidney transplant varies
   greatly across the United States. This variation violates the final
   rule, a federal mandate, which demands geographic equity in organ
   allocation for transplantation.
   Methods. Retrospective analysis of the United States Renal Data System
   and United Network for Organ Sharing database from 2000 to 2009. Median
   waiting time was calculated for each of the 58 donor service areas (DSA)
   in the United States. Multivariate regression was performed to identify
   DSA predictors for long waiting times to kidney transplantation.
   Results. The median waiting time varied between the 58 DSAs from 0.61 to
   4.57 years, ranging from 0.59 to 5.17 years for standard criteria donor
   kidneys and 0.41 to 4.69 years for expanded criteria donor kidneys. The
   disparity in waiting time between the DSAs grew from 3.26 years (range,
   0.41-3.67) in 2000 to 4.72 years (range, 0.50-5.22) in 2009. In DSAs
   with longer waiting times, there were significantly more patients
   suffering from end-stage renal disease and more patients listed for
   kidney transplant, lower kidney procurement rates, and higher transplant
   center competition. Patients were more likely black, sensitized, with
   lower educational attainment and less likely to waitlist outside of
   their DSA of residence. Donor organs used in DSAs with long waiting
   times were more likely hepatitis C positive and had a higher kidney
   donor profile index. Graft and patient survival at 5 years was worse for
   deceased donor kidney transplant, but rates for living donor kidney
   transplant were higher.
   Conclusion. Our analysis demonstrates significant and worsening
   geographic disparity in waiting time for kidney transplant across the
   DSAs. Increase in living donor kidney transplant and use of marginal
   organs has not mitigated the disparity. Changes to the kidney allocation
   system might be required to resolve this extensive geographic disparity
   in kidney allocation.

   overlooks the component of earnings inequality that is arguably most
   consequential for the "other 99 percent" of citizens: the dramatic

   supply and demand for skills in shaping inequality, discusses why skill
   demands have persistently risen in industrialized countries, and
   considers the economic value of inequality alongside its potential
   social costs. I conclude by highlighting the constructive role for

AB BACKGROUNDTo the authors' knowledge, it remains unknown whether
   race-based differences in cancer outcomes have changed with time. In the
   current study, the authors assessed whether racial disparities in
   cancer-specific mortality have improved over the last 20 years.
   METHODSThe Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used
   to identify 2,713,474 patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 with
   either lung, breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (the leading 3
   causes of cancer-related mortality among each sex). After exclusions,
   1,001,978 patients remained eligible for analysis. The impact of race on
   cancer-specific mortality was assessed using the regression model of
   Fine and Gray; an interaction model evaluated trends over time.
   RESULTSAfrican Americans presented with a more advanced stage of disease
   (P<.001) and underwent definitive therapy less often (P<.001) than
   whites. After adjustment for demographics and year of diagnosis, African
   Americans were found to have higher estimates of cancer-specific
   mortality than whites for all cancers combined (hazards ratio, 1.28; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.26-1.30 [P<.001]) and within each individual
   cancer (each P<.05). These differences did not change significantly
   between 1988 through 1997 and 1998 through 2007, except among patients
   with breast cancer, in whom survival disparities increased. These
   findings remained significant after adjustment for stage of disease at
   presentation and receipt of definitive therapy (hazards ratio for breast
   cancer mortality in African Americans vs whites: 1.37 from 1988-1997 and
   1.53 from 1998-2007; P for interaction,<.001).
   CONCLUSIONSThe survival gap for African Americans has not closed over
   time. Race-based differences in outcome persist independent of stage of
   disease and treatment, suggesting that additional strategies beyond
   screening and improving access to care, such as further research into
   tumor biologies disproportionately affecting African Americans, are
   needed to improve survival for African American patients with cancer.
   Cancer 2014;120:1532-1539. (c) 2014 American Cancer Society.
   African American patients with cancer are at an increased risk of
   cancer-specific mortality compared with white patients. The survival gap
   for African Americans has not narrowed with time, and in the case of
   patients with breast cancer, appears to be widening.

AB Background: Street-connected youth are a neglected and vulnerable
   population, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The
   development of interventions and supports for this population requires
   insight into how they live. This study describes the social and economic
   characteristics of a convenience sample of street youth (SY) in Eldoret,
   Kenya.
   Methods: Participants were eligible if they were aged 12-21, living in
   Eldoret, spending days only (part-time), or nights and days on the
   street (full-time) and able and willing to consent or assent. Data were
   collected using a standardized interview conducted in English or
   Kiswahili. Binary dependent variables were having been arrested and/or
   jailed, and first priority for spending money (food vs. other). Nominal
   categorical dependent variables included major source of support, and
   major reason for being street-involved. Multivariable analysis used
   logistic regression models to examine the association of gender and
   level of street-involvement with social and economic factors of interest
   adjusting for age and length of time on the street. Data were analyzed
   using SAS 9.3.
   Results: Of the 200 SY enrolled, 41% were female, mean age of 16.3
   years; 71% were on the street full-time, and 29% part-time. Compared
   with part-time SY, full-time SY were more likely to have been arrested
   (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 2.33, 95% Confidence Interval
   [95%CI]:1.01-5.35), name food as their first spending priority (AOR:
   2.57, 95% CI:1.03-6.45), have left home due to violence (AOR: 5.54,
   95%CI: 1.67-18.34), and more likely to report friends on the street as a
   major source of support (AOR: 3.59, 95% CI: 1.01-12.82). Compared with
   females, males were more likely to have ever been arrested (AOR: 2.66,
   95%CI:1.14-6.18), and to have ever been jailed (AOR: 3.22,
   95%CI:1.47-7.02).
   Conclusions: These results suggest a high degree of heterogeneity and
   vulnerability among SY in this setting. There is an urgent need for
   interventions taking into consideration these characteristics.

AB Seemingly similar individuals often experience drastically different
   success trajectories, with some repeatedly failing and others
   consistently succeeding. One explanation is preexisting variability
   along unobserved fitness dimensions that is revealed gradually through
   differential achievement. Alternatively, positive feedback operating on
   arbitrary initial advantages may increasingly set apart winners from
   losers, producing runaway inequality. To identify social feedback in
   human reward systems, we conducted randomized experiments by intervening
   in live social environments across the domains of funding, status,
   endorsement, and reputation. In each system we consistently found that
   early success bestowed upon arbitrarily selected recipients produced
   significant improvements in subsequent rates of success compared with
   the control group of nonrecipients. However, success exhibited
   decreasing marginal returns, with larger initial advantages failing to
   produce much further differentiation. These findings suggest a lesser
   degree of vulnerability of reward systems to incidental or fabricated
   advantages and a more modest role for cumulative advantage in the
   explanation of social inequality than previously thought.

AB Cross-cultural psychologists have mostly contrasted East Asia with the

   differences within China. We propose that a history of farming rice
   makes cultures more interdependent, whereas farming wheat makes cultures
   more independent, and these agricultural legacies continue to affect
   people in the modern world. We tested 1162 Han Chinese participants in
   six sites and found that rice-growing southern China is more
   interdependent and holistic-thinking than the wheat-growing north. To
   control for confounds like climate, we tested people from neighboring
   counties along the rice-wheat border and found differences that were
   just as large. We also find that modernization and pathogen prevalence

AB Background: Human resource capacity is vital to the scale-up of
   voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services. VMMC providers are
   at risk of "burnout'' from performing a single task repeatedly in a high
   volume work environment that produces long work hours and intense work
   effort.
   Methods and findings: The Systematic Monitoring of the Voluntary Medical
   Male Circumcision Scale-up (SYMMACS) surveyed VMMC providers in Kenya,
   South Africa, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe in 2011 (n = 357) and 2012 (n =
   591). Providers self-reported on their training, work experience, levels
   of job-fulfillment and work fatigue/burnout. Data analysis included a
   descriptive analysis of VMMC provider characteristics, and both
   bivariate and multivariate analyses of factors associated with provider
   work fatigue/burnout. In 2012, Kenyan providers had worked in VMMC for a
   median of 31 months compared to South Africa (10 months), Tanzania (15
   months), and Zimbabwe (11 months). More than three-quarters (78-99%) of
   providers in all countries in 2012 reported that VMMC is a personally
   fulfilling job. However, 67% of Kenyan providers reported starting to
   experience work fatigue/burnout compared to South Africa (33%), Zimbabwe
   (17%), and Tanzania (15%). Despite the high level of work
   fatigue/burnout in Kenya, none of the measured factors (i.e., gender,
   age, full-time versus part-time status, length of service, number of
   operations performed, or cadre) were significantly associated with work
   fatigue/burnout in 2011. In 2012, logistic regression found increases in
   age (p<.05) and number of months working in VMMC (p<.01) were associated
   with an increased likelihood of experiencing work fatigue/burnout, while
   higher career total VMMCs decreased the likelihood of experiencing
   burnout.
   Conclusion: Given cross-country differences, further elucidation of
   cultural and other contextual factors that may influence provider
   burnout is required. Continuing to emphasize the contribution that
   providers make in the fight against HIV/AIDS is important.

AB Disgust has been implicated as a potential causal agent underlying
   socio-political attitudes and behaviors. Several recent studies have
   suggested that pathogen disgust may be a causal mechanism underlying
   social conservatism. However, the specificity of this effect is still in
   question. The present study tested the effects of disgust on a range of
   policy preferences to clarify whether disgust is generally implicated in
   political conservatism across public policy attitudes or is uniquely
   related to specific content domains. Self-reported socio-political
   attitudes were compared between participants in two experimental
   conditions: 1) an odorless control condition, and 2) a disgusting odor
   condition. In keeping with previous research, the present study showed
   that exposure to a disgusting odor increased endorsement of socially
   conservative attitudes related to sexuality. In particular, there was a
   strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for
   gay marriage.

AB While considerable research has documented stigma toward key populations
   affected by HIV and AIDS - men who have sex with men (MSM), sex workers
   (SWs) - it provided limited empirical evidence on the presence of
   layered stigma among health-care professionals providing services for
   these populations. C-Change conducted a survey among 332 staff of
   health-care and social service agencies in Jamaica and The Bahamas to
   understand the levels of stigma toward people living with HIV (PLHIV),
   including MSM and SWs and factors associated with stigma. While most
   health-care professionals responding to the survey said that PLHIV, MSM,
   and SWs deserved quality care, they expressed high levels of blame and
   negative judgments, especially toward MSM and SWs. Across a stigma
   assessment involving eight vignette characters, the highest levels of
   stigma were expressed toward PLHIV who were also MSM or SWs, followed by
   PLHIV, MSM, and SWs. Differences were assessed by gender, country, type
   of staff, type of agency, and exposure to relevant training. Findings
   indicate higher reported stigma among nonclinical vs. clinical staff,
   staff who worked in general vs. MSM/SW-friendly health facilities, and
   among untrained vs. training staff. This implies the need for targeted
   staff capacity strengthening as well as improved facility environments
   that are MSM/SW-friendly.

AB To explore factors associated with occupational sex segregation in the
   United States over the past four decades, we analyzed U. S. Bureau of
   Labor Statistics data for the percent of women employed in 60 varied
   occupations from 1972 to 2010. Occupations were assessed on status,
   people-things orientation, and data-ideas orientation. Multilevel linear
   modeling (MLM) analyses showed that women increasingly entered
   high-status occupations from 1972 to 2010, but women's participation in
   things-oriented occupations (e. g., STEM fields and mechanical and
   construction trades) remained low and relatively stable. Occupations'
   data-ideas orientation was not consistently related to sex segregation.
   Because of women's increased participation in high-status occupations,
   occupational status became an increasingly weak predictor of women's
   participation rates in occupations, whereas occupations' people-things
   orientation became an increasingly strong predictor over time. These
   findings are discussed in relation to theories of occupational sex
   segregation and social policies to reduce occupational sex segregation.

AB Can consumers be socially responsible? Can the interests of consumers,
   corporations, and the overall society be reconciled? Traditionally,
   sociologists have conceptualized consumerism as enhancing individual
   wellbeing at the expense of moral citizenship. Yet throughout US
   history, popular discourse has linked consumption to the social good.
   Business schools currently expound this belief in their 'principles of
   marketing' courses. Popular textbooks promote 'relationship management
   marketing' which teaches students to target their most profitable
   customers, develop life-long relationships with them, and promote the
   societal concerns that they care about. The textbooks maintain that
   corporations are well-equipped to address the societal concerns of
   profitable customers through the use of cause marketing, granted minimal
   government interference. We describe this worldview as 'neoliberal
   consumer citizenship' and discuss its implications for social theory and
   a democratic society.

AB This essay examines the role played by Soviet sociology in the USSR's
   transition to capitalism. It analyzes the discipline's contribution to
   the critique of Soviet socio-economic life during the 1980s, identifying
   the emergence of two divergent viewpoints within Soviet sociology over
   the relationship between inequality, the market, and the goals of a
   socialist society. The essay explores how these viewpoints intersected
   with the implementation of economic reforms by the Gorbachev regime,
   arguing that the dominant forces within Soviet sociology ultimately
   helped the party-state bureaucracy craft the legitimizing ideology of
   perestroika by insisting that growing social inequality and market-based
   mechanisms of distribution were the very embodiment of socialism. After
   enduring a politically fraught and semi-pariah existence for much of its
   history, Soviet sociology enjoyed a belle epoque as it helped the ruling
   elite navigate the transition to capitalism.

AB Scholars have recently called attention to the changing nature of the
   American university in the wake of the current economic downturn.
   Considering the transformative nature of knowledge production in the
   United States, we introduce the concept of intellectual closure in
   illustration of the unintended outcomes of individual decisions and
   career trajectories as they operate under the forces of social closure.
   Intellectual closure is defined as subtle and hidden forms of constraint
   on individual agency. Intellectual closure includes calculative thinking
   about how to publish in flagship journals, avoidance of high-risk
   projects, and preference for short-term projects with more immediate
   rewards. Structural constraints, specifically within sociology, are
   enabling the emergence of narrower perspectives and eroding former
   professional norms as individual decisions aggregate, unintentionally,
   to constitute a more competitive discipline with narrower definitions of
   productivity and quality.

AB Anarchism has not had a noticeable impact upon sociology. The two
   traditions diverged in their interest in society and their relationship
   to it. This paper contrasts the practitioners or thinkers of one
   tradition against the other. The analysis shows some strong antagonisms,
   many instances of close analysis and critique of each other's
   perspectives, and a number of friendly and supportive relationships
   between anarchists and sociologists. Anarchists tended to admire the
   intellectual rigor of sociologists, but thought sociologists were
   insiders - mere reformers at best, reactionaries at worst - content to
   study society, but rarely to act for its improvement. Sociologists
   viewed anarchists with an even wider range of opinion, including
   considering them principled and admirable revolutionaries, slightly
   naive utopians, or criminals and chaos-lovers bent on the destruction of
   social order. These factors contributed to the exclusion of anarchist
   ideas and anarchists themselves from the sociological canon.

   and physical exercise continue to be significant topics of debate.
   General interventions targeted toward Black women to address obesity and
   increase physical exercise have been largely ineffective. In this
   article, I situate the current public health discourse on obesity and
   related interventions within a sociocultural context of body appearance,
   with a specific focus on hair. Why do some African American women feel
   such strong ties to their hair that they will avoid exercise? What can
   be done to understand this phenomenon and address alternatives that may
   make both hair maintenance and regular exercise feasible? I map a
   theoretical argument for why hair matters for some women, and discuss
   how physical activity intervention strategies might be improved by
   considering such complexities.

AB Objectives. We examined associations of household socioeconomic status
   (SES) and food security with children's oral health outcomes.
   Methods. We analyzed 2007 and 2008 US National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey data for children aged 5 to 17 years (n = 2206) to
   examine the relationship between food security and untreated dental
   caries and to assess whether food security mediates the SES-caries
   relationship.
   Results. About 20.1% of children had untreated caries. Most households
   had full food security (62%); 13% had marginal, 17% had low, and 8% had
   very low food security. Higher SES was associated with significantly
   lower caries prevalence (prevalence ratio [PR] = 0.77; 95% confidence
   interval = 0.63, 0.94; P = .01). Children from households with low or
   very low food security had significantly higher caries prevalence (PR =
   2.00 and PR = 1.70, respectively) than did children living in fully
   food-secure households. Caries prevalence did not differ among children
   from fully and marginally food-secure households (P = .17). Food
   insecurity did not appear to mediate the SES-caries relationship.
   Conclusions. Interventions and policies to ensure food security may help
   address the US pediatric caries epidemic.

AB Objectives. We identified communities of interconnected people that
   might serve as normative reference groups for individual-level behavior
   related to latrine adoption.
   Methods. We applied an algorithmic social network method to determine
   the network community from respondent-reported social ties of 16 403
   individuals in 75 villages in rural Karnataka, India; data were
   collected from 2006 to 2008. We used multilevel modeling to test the
   association between latrine ownership and community-level and
   village-level latrine ownership. We also investigated the degree to
   which network cohesion affected individual latrine ownership.
   Results. Three levels of social contacts (direct friends, social network
   community, and village) significantly predicted individual latrine
   ownership, but the strongest effect was found at the level of social
   network communities. In communities with high levels of network
   cohesion, the likelihood was decreased that any individual would own a
   latrine; this effect was significant only at lower levels of latrine
   ownership, suggesting a role for network cohesion in facilitating the
   nonownership norm.
   Conclusions. Although many international health and development
   interventions target village units, these results raise the possibility
   that the optimal target for public health interventions may not be
   determined through geography but through social network interactions.

   Methods. We used 6 waves of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System and data on county characteristics to describe regional trends in
   tooth loss and decompose diverging trends into the parts explained by
   individual and county components.
   Results. Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta had higher levels of tooth
   loss than the rest of the country in 1999. From 1999 to 2010, tooth loss
   declined in the United States. However, Appalachia did not converge
   toward the US average, and the Mississippi Delta worsened relative to
   the United States. Socioeconomic status explained the largest portion of
   differences between regions in 1999, but a smaller portion of the
   trends. The Mississippi Delta is aging more quickly than the rest of the
   country, which explains 17% of the disparity in the time trend.
   Conclusions. The disadvantage in tooth loss is persistent in Appalachia
   and growing in the Mississippi Delta. The increasing disparity is partly
   explained by changes in the age structure but is also associated with
   behavioral and environmental factors.

AB Humans are both similar and diverse in such a vast number of dimensions
   that for human geneticists and social scientists to decide which of
   these dimensions is a worthy focus of empirical investigation is a
   formidable challenge. For geneticists, one vital question, of course,
   revolves around hypothesizing which kind of social diversity might
   illuminate genetic variation-and vice versa (i.e., what genetic
   variation illuminates human social diversity). For example, are there
   health outcomes that can be best explained by genetic variation-or for
   social scientists, are health outcomes mainly a function of the social
   diversity of lifestyles and social circumstances of a given population?
   Indeed, what is a "population," how is it bounded, and are those
   boundaries most appropriate or relevant for human genetic research, be
   they national borders, religious affiliation, ethnic or racial
   identification, or language group, to name but a few? For social
   scientists, the matter of what constitutes the relevant borders of a
   population is equally complex, and the answer is demarcated by the goal
   of the research project. Although race and caste are categories deployed
   in both human genetics and social science, the social meaning of race
   and caste as pathways to employment, health, or education demonstrably
   overwhelms the analytic and explanatory power of genetic markers of
   difference between human aggregates.

AB A central theme of economic sociology has been to highlight the
   complexity and diversity of real world markets, but many network models
   of economic social structure ignore this feature and rely instead on
   stylized one-dimensional characterizations. Here, the authors return to
   the basic insight of structural diversity in economic sociology. Using
   the Indian interorganizational ownership network as their case, they
   discover a composite-or "hybrid"-model of economic networks that
   combines elements of prior stylized models. The network contains a
   disconnected periphery conforming closely to a "transactional" model; a
   semiperiphery characterized by small, dense clusters with sporadic
   links, as predicted in "small world" models; and finally a nested core
   composed of clusters connected via multiple independent paths. The
   authors then show how a firm's position within the mesolevel structure
   is associated with demographic features such as age and industry and
   differences in the extent to which firms engage in multiplex and
   high-value exchanges.

AB Environments are complex socioecological systems demanding
   interdisciplinary research and conservation. Despite significant
   progress in characterizing socioecological complexity, including
   important inroads for measuring human wellbeing through ecosystem
   services approaches, cultural interactions with ecosystems remain poorly
   understood. Inadequate knowledge of cultural dimensions of ecosystems
   challenges the ability of conservation professionals to include these
   considerations in their programs. Ecosystem-based conservation without
   cultural considerations is not only insufficient, it risks producing
   unaccounted negative impacts to communities and misses an opportunity to
   build culturally meaningful alternatives. This mini review of relevant
   social science identifies five key cultural dimensions of ecosystems,
   highlighting examples from coastal North America. These key dimensions
   are: meanings, values, and identities; knowledge and practice;
   governance and access; livelihoods; and interactions with biophysical
   environments. We outline guiding principles for addressing these
   connections in integrated conservation research and application.
   Finally, we discuss potential methodologies to help improve
   interdisciplinary assessment and monitoring of cultural dimensions of
   conservation.

AB Objective: To delineate the association between baseline socioeconomic
   status (SES) indicators and mortality and lost to follow-up (LTFU) in a
   cohort of HIV-infected individuals enrolled in antiretroviral therapy
   (ART) in urban Uganda.
   Design: Retrospective cohort study nested in an antiretroviral
   clinic-based cohort.
   Methods: SES indicators including education, employment status, and a
   standardized wealth index, and other demographic and clinical variables
   were assessed at baseline among ART-treated patients in a clinic-based
   cohort in Kampala, Uganda. Confirmed mortality (primary outcome) and
   LTFU (secondary outcome) were actively ascertained over a 4-year
   follow-up period from 2005 to 2009.
   Results: Among 1763 adults [70.5% female; mean age, 36.2 years (SD =
   8.4)] enrolled in ART, 14.4% (n = 253) were confirmed dead and 19.7% (n
   = 346) were LTFU at 4-year follow-up. No formal education [adjusted odds
   ratio (AOR) 1.76; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19 to 2.59], having
   fewer than 6 dependents (AOR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.86), unemployment
   (AOR 1.98; 95% CI: 1.48 to 2.66), and housing tenure index score (a
   component of the wealth index) (AOR 1.11; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.23) were
   significantly associated with confirmed mortality at 4 years. SES
   indicators were not associated with LTFU at 4 years.
   Conclusions: Baseline SES indicators, including education, number of
   dependents, employment status, and components of a standard wealth index
   may indicate long-term vulnerability to mortality in patients with
   HIV/AIDS, despite uniform access to ART. Future studies delineating the
   pathways through which poverty and limited assets affect clinical
   outcomes may lead to more effective HIV interventions in low-resource

   Methods: Using the population-weighted risk difference, the authors
   investigated geographic patterns of racial/ethnic disparities in

   significant racial/ethnic disparities in cervical cancer mortality.
   Compared with a census tract with the highest SES, a census tract with
   the lowest SES was more likely to have higher mortality rates in African
   Americans (odds ratio 4.19, confidence interval 2.18-8.07) or Hispanics
   (odds ratio 8.15, confidence interval 5.27-12.61) than non-Hispanic
   whites after adjusting for covariates. Health insurance expenditures
   also influenced racial/ethnic disparities in mortality, although this
   effect was attenuated after adjusting for covariates. Neither our
   calculated behavioral factor nor spatial analysis of access to health
   care explained racial/ethnic gaps in mortality.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study could allow cervical cancer
   intervention programs to more clearly identify areas that would reduce
   disparities in cervical cancer outcomes.

AB Food-related embodied experiences are entangled in all aspects of
   subject positions, from ethnicity to class, from age to gender. When it
   comes to masculinity, food plays a very important role as an arena where
   various models of masculinity are negotiated. Representations of men
   around food in a specific medium - comic books and detective stories -
   can establish, question, reinforce, reproduce or destroy cultural
   assumptions about masculinity and gender relations. The comic book Chew
   employs irony and tropes from horror, detective, and action genres to
   blur gender and ethnic stereotypes about eating and ingestion that are
   otherwise prevalent in many forms of popular culture, from movies to
   cookbooks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper investigates the status of trails on American Indian lands in
   the United States and their contribution to quality of life in Indian
   Country. Although American Indians have been using trails for centuries
   and trails have been the subject of considerable scholarly inquiry, very
   little research explores community trails on American Indian land.
   However, such research could serve an important purpose: American Indian
   communities, and reservations in particular, face a suite of social
   challenges related to land tenure, economic disparity, health epidemics,
   and transportation safety. Meanwhile, the social benefits of community
   trails have been well documented. This paper seeks to fill this
   knowledge gap by describing the current existence and uses of trails on
   American Indian land; the benefits they bring to tribal and non-tribal
   users; the potential benefits of expanding trails; and potential
   obstacles to trail development. To develop this understanding, we
   conducted informational interviews with 21 tribal representatives and
   resource managers from across the United States. Our results shed light
   on the important role that trails can play in strengthening American
   Indian communities. We find that trails (1) help strengthen and preserve
   cultural identity and natural heritage; (2) directly address some of the
   most pervasive social challenges that American Indian communities face;
   and (3) spur the creation of constructive partnerships with individuals,
   organizations, and various levels of government. These results provide
   strong incentive for continued and improved funding and development of
   trails not only in American Indian communities but also on indigenous
   lands across the globe. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Around the world, many urban districts and some entire cities are
   dominated by vacant and abandoned property. Former uses of these
   properties range from heavy industry to residential neighborhoods, and
   each bears many potential legacies of past uses, including: introduction
   of contaminants that may threaten the health of humans and other
   species, engineering of land and infrastructure that may undermine
   hydrological ecosystem services, and introduction of species including
   invasives. While the ecological functions that characterize vacant urban
   lands have been only partially investigated, the legacies associated
   with their past uses are known to affect ecosystem services. In
   addition, changed industries, weakened economies, arcane financial
   systems, population migration, and aging resident populations have left
   many people living in the midst of this vacancy, with clear implications
   for human health and safety. Since market demand is weak in highly
   vacant districts, social capital may be particularly important to
   protecting quality of life and ecosystem services. New design and
   planning approaches should be informed by urban ecological knowledge
   that is synthesized with social and cultural understanding of residents'
   perceptions and values. Interest in urban agriculture, green
   infrastructure, and open space planning for vacant urban lands is
   burgeoning. However, without adequate knowledge of highly vacant
   districts as socio-ecological systems, design and planning may have
   unintended consequences for human health, water quality, adaptation to
   climate change, and a panoply of other ecosystem services. Research
   questions and design and planning applications require a
   transdisciplinary approach to address highly vacant urban districts with
   legitimacy and relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Urban ecology and its theories are increasingly poised to contribute to
   urban sustainability, through both basic understanding and action. We
   present a conceptual framework that expands the Industrial : Sanitary
   Sustainable City transition to include non-sanitary cities, "new
   cities", and various permutations of transition options for cities
   encountering exogenous and endogenous "triggers of change". When
   investigating and modeling these urban transitions, we should consider:
   (1) the triggers that have induced change: (2) situations where crisis
   triggers change; (3) why cities transition toward more sustainable
   states on their own, in the absence of crisis; (4) what we can learn
   from new city transitions, and non-sanitary city transitions; and (5)
   how resource interactions affect urban transition s.
   Several existing theoretical frameworks, including sustainability,
   resilience, adaptation, and vulnerability, may be helpful when
   considering urban transitions. We suggest that all of these theories
   interact through inertia in urban systems, and that this multi-faceted
   inertia e.g. institutional inertia, infrastructural inertia, and social
   inertia imparts degrees of rigidity that make urban systems less
   flexible and nimble when facing transitional triggers and change. Given
   this, solutions to urban sustainability challenges may be categorized as
   those: (1) that "tweak" the current systems and work with or even take
   advantage of the inertia in those systems, versus; (2) that are more
   "transformative", that confront systemic inertia, and that may require
   new systems. We propose that a model for addressing urban sustainability
   in the context of relevant theory, and for bridging research and
   practice, should focus on intercity comparisons. And one mechanism to
   facilitate this approach is a newly formed interdisciplinary Research
   Coordination Network (RCN) that focuses on urban sustainability by
   integrating urban research while incubating solutions-oriented products
   and collaborative partnerships with practitioners. The Network includes
   more than two dozen cities in five continents that are in various
   degrees of transition. In the true vein of sustainability science, our
   Network activities are incubating societally-relevant solutions through
   projects that will lead to tangible, "on the ground" sustainable
   solutions for all types of cities. Our ultimate goal is to understand
   the process by which cities become more sustainable while affecting that
   process through action inspired by knowledge. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:Sexual assault is a major cause of injury,
   unplanned pregnancy, HIV infection, and mental health problems
   worldwide. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, sexual assault has reached
   epidemic proportions. This study evaluated the efficacy of an
   empowerment and self-defense intervention for adolescent girls to
   decrease the incidence of sexual assault and harassment in Nairobi's
   large informal settlements.METHODS:A prospective cohort of 1978
   adolescents from 4 neighborhoods near Nairobi were taught empowerment,
   deescalation, and self-defense skills in six 2-hour sessions. The
   standard-of-care (SOC) group (n = 428) received a life skills class.
   Self-reported, anonymous survey data were collected at baseline and 10.5
   months after intervention.RESULTS:Annual sexual assault rates decreased
   from 17.9/100 person-years at baseline to 11.1 at follow-up (rate ratio
   = 1.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-1.86; P < .001); there was no
   significant change in the SOC group (14.3 to 14.0, rate ratio = 1.02;
   95% CI, 0.67-1.57, P = .92). Sexual assault disclosure in the
   intervention group increased from 56% to 75% (P = .006), compared with a
   constant incidence of disclosure (53%) in the SOC group. The majority
   (52.3%) of adolescents in the intervention group reported using skills
   learned to stop an assault.CONCLUSIONS:This intervention decreased
   sexual assault rates among adolescent girls in Kenya. The intervention
   was also associated with an increase in the disclosure of assaults,
   thereby enabling survivors to seek care and support and possibly leading
   to the identification and prosecution of perpetrators. This model should
   be adaptable to other settings both in Africa and globally.

AB Research in the area of the sociology of diagnosis has recently
   expanded. Despite this development, the foundations of the social
   aspects of diagnoses, including race, class and gender, are relatively
   unexplored. Understanding such diversity is important, however, as
   researchers have shown that diagnoses have significant repercussions on
   the illness experience. This article is an effort to overcome this gap
   in the literature by examining class diversity in interpretations and
   understandings of diagnoses. Using the medicalised condition of
   infertility as a case example of class differences around diagnoses, I
   conducted 58 in-depth interviews with infertile women of various class
   backgrounds in the USA. By comparing the lived experiences of
   infertility between higher and lower class women, I explore differences
   in the understanding, interpretation and outcomes of diagnoses,
   specifically. Furthermore, among lower class women, I examine how they
   understand infertility outside the medical diagnostic framework. The
   findings reveal how interpretations and experiences of diagnoses vary
   depending on an individual's social location. In other words, the study
   demonstrates that class matters in terms of diagnoses and their
   understanding.

AB Purpose:To describe ethnic/racial group differences in prescription drug
   misuse within a nationally representative sample of US adolescents. Also
   to identify potential sociocultural influences on this health risk
   behavior.Methods:A secondary data analysis was conducted on the
   public-use data of the 2010 National Survey of Drug Use and Health using
   the records of 12- to 17-year-old African American, Hispanic, and white
   participants (N = 18,614). Logistic and Poisson regression analyses
   focused on examining the predictive role of perceived parental and peer
   substance use disapproval on adolescents' prescription drug misuse and
   how these social influences varied by ethnic group.Results:Within this
   sample, 10.4% of adolescents endorsed misusing 1 or more subtypes of
   prescription drugs. The results showed significant ethnic group
   differences in rates of prescription drug misuse such that white
   adolescents reported the highest rates and African American adolescents
   reported the lowest rates of prescription drug misuse. Rates of misuse
   for Hispanic adolescents fell in between. Importantly, perceived
   parental and peer substance use disapproval decreased the likelihood of
   prescription drug misuse most significantly among white adolescents
   compared to Hispanic and African American adolescents. Furthermore,
   influence of disapproval differed by the type of substance, indicating
   ethnic group differences in disapproval, such as views of alcohol versus
   marijuana use.Conclusions:These findings provide new ethnic
   group-specific information about the role that the attitudes of peers
   and parents on substance use may play in whether adolescents misuse
   prescription drugs. Future studies should explore possible
   parent/peer-related socialization mechanisms, which may account for
   these ethnic group differences.

AB Background. Gagging is a behavioral response that interferes with oral
   health care and may be related to dental care-related fear. Little is
   known, however, about the epidemiology of gagging during dental
   treatment.
   Methods. To explore this phenomenon, the authors recruited participants
   from the waiting area of an oral diagnosis clinic. Participants
   completed a gagging behavior questionnaire, the Dental Fear Survey, the
   Fear of Pain Questionnaire-9, the Revised Dental Beliefs Survey and a
   demographics questionnaire.
   Results. Almost one-half of the 478 participants reported gagging on at
   least one occasion during dental visits, and 7.5 percent of participants
   reported almost always or always gagging. With higher frequency of
   problems with gagging, patients were more likely to have greater levels
   of dental care-related fear, fear of pain and more negative beliefs
   about dental professionals and dental treatment. Furthermore,
   participants who gagged more readily had greater dental care-related
   fear than did participants who had less of a propensity to gag.
   Conclusions. Gagging in the dental office is a prevalent problem, and
   dental care-related fear and fear of pain are associated with more
   frequent gagging.

AB This article examines the methodological implications of the fact that
   what people say is often a poor predictor of what they do. We argue that
   many interview and survey researchers routinely conflate self-reports
   with behavior and assume a consistency between attitudes and action. We
   call this erroneous inference of situated behavior from verbal accounts
   the attitudinal fallacy. Though interviewing and ethnography are often
   lumped together as "qualitative methods," by juxtaposing studies of
   "culture in action" based on verbal accounts with ethnographic
   investigations, we show that the latter routinely attempts to explain
   the "attitude-behavior problem" while the former regularly ignores it.
   Because meaning and action are collectively negotiated and
   context-dependent, we contend that self-reports of attitudes and
   behaviors are of limited value in explaining what people actually do
   because they are overly individualistic and abstracted from lived
   experience.

   global social problem of environmental degradation has been largely
   confined to the individual act of recycling. This article examines why
   Americans are not doing more to address climate change and other
   environmental issues. Taking a cognitive sociological perspective, I
   describe how Americans think about environmental issues and
   pro-environmental behavior. I draw on Swidler's concept of a "cultural
   tool kit," to examine the cultural narratives Americans use to account
   for the small amount of pro-environmental behavior they perform. The act
   of recycling functions as a synecdoche for pro-environmental behavior in
   general, allowing individuals to over-claim the significance of a modest
   amount of pro-environmental behavior. I argue that Americans' failure to
   engage with environmental issues at a collective level is rooted in the
   individualized culture of American environmentalism.

AB Although fraught with complexity, the self is a central phenomenon of

   this discourse by introducing the Buddhist ideas of anatta (no-self) and
   prattyasamutpada (interdependence) as analytic frameworks to deconstruct
   and rethink the self within sociology. We argue that the sociological
   self, most clearly articulated by symbolic interactionism, is premised
   on a self-other dualism. This dualism leads to a conceptualization of
   the self as constantly threatened and anxious. Using these Buddhist
   concepts we propose an alternative interpretive schema, a sociology of
   no-self, for analyzing social interaction and understanding the roots of
   social angst.

   friendship information, applying newer analytic methods to identify
   friendship groups, and making strategic use of control variables to
   clarify the meaning of differences among group positions. We report
   secondary analyses of 6th through 9th grade data from the PROSPER study,
   which include approximately 9500 adolescents each year from 27 school
   districts and 368 school grade cohort friendship networks. We find that
   core members of friendship groups were more likely to drink than
   isolates and liaisons, especially in light of their positive social
   integration in school, family, and religious contexts. Isolates were
   more likely to use cigarettes than core members, even controlling for
   all other factors. Finally, liaisons were more likely to use marijuana
   than core members. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Aims
   Social ecological theories suggest that greater community alcohol
   availability and individual drinker characteristics should jointly
   affect drinking patterns and the use of drinking contexts. We assessed
   relationships of demographic and personality characteristics of
   individual drinkers and environmental characteristics at the city-level
   to measures of drinking patterns and use of drinking contexts.
   Design
   Multi-level statistical analyses of archival and survey data from 50
   cities in California, USA.
   Settings
   An ecological sample of 50 geographically distinct cities with
   populations from 50 000 to 500 000 people.
   Participants
   General population telephone survey of 8553 adults 18 years of age and
   older stratified by cities.
   Measurements
   Archival data on city-level alcohol outlet densities were combined with
   individual survey data identifying community conditions, individual
   demographic and psychosocial characteristics, frequencies of use of
   drinking contexts and drinking patterns.
   Findings
   Greater on-premise outlet densities were related to greater drinking
   frequencies (b = 2.9671, z = 4.688, P < 0.001) and volumes (b = 0.6274,
   z = 3.394, P < 0.001) and use of on-premises drinking places (bars, b =
   0.3340, z = 2.645, P < 0.006 and restaurants, b = 0.1712, z = 2.770, P =
   0.005). Individual demographic and personality characteristics were
   related to drinking and use of drinking contexts. For example, greater
   impulsivity was related to greater drinking frequencies (b = 0.2001, z =
   2.088, P = 0.023) and logged quantities (b = 0.0151, z = 2.009, P =
   0.026) and proportionately more drinking at bars (b = 0.0332, z = 2.016,
   P = 0.026) and parties (b = 0.1712, z = 2.770, P = 0.004).
   Conclusion
   Community availability of alcohol and individual drinker characteristics
   appear to act jointly to affect drinking levels and use of drinking
   contexts. These effects may increase risks related to drinking in some
   contexts (e.g. bars) much more than others (e.g. at friends' or
   relatives' homes).

AB BACKGROUND
   Hispanics are more likely than other racial/ethnic groups in the United
   States to be diagnosed with later stage of prostate cancer, yet they
   have lower prostate cancer mortality rates. The authors evaluated the
   impact of nativity and neighborhood-level Hispanic ethnic enclave on
   prostate cancer survival among Hispanics.
   METHODS
   A total of 35,427 Hispanic men diagnosed with invasive prostate cancer
   from 1995 through 2008 in the California Cancer Registry were studied;
   vital status data were available through 2010. Block group-level
   neighborhood measures were developed from US Census data.
   Stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the
   effect of nativity and ethnic enclave on prostate cancer survival.
   RESULTS
   In models adjusted for neighborhood socioeconomic status and other
   individual factors, foreign-born Hispanics were found to have a
   significantly lower risk of prostate cancer survival (hazards ratio
   [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.75-0.87). Living in an
   ethnic enclave appeared to modify this effect, with the survival
   advantage slightly more pronounced in the high ethnic enclave
   neighborhoods (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86) compared with low ethnic
   enclave neighborhoods (HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98).
   CONCLUSIONS
   Despite lower socioeconomic status, Hispanic immigrants have better
   survival after prostate cancer than US-born Hispanics and this pattern
   was more striking among those living in ethnic enclaves. Identifying the
   modifiable individual and neighborhood-level factors that facilitate
   this survival advantage in Hispanic immigrants may help to inform
   specific interventions to improve survival among all patients. Cancer

AB Background: Research is limited on the independent and joint effects of
   individual-and neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES) on breast
   cancer survival across different racial/ethnic groups.
   Methods: We studied individual-level SES, measured by self-reported
   education, and a composite neighborhood SES (nSES) measure in females
   (1,068 non-Hispanic whites, 1,670 Hispanics, 993 African-Americans, and
   674 Asian-Americans), ages 18 to 79 years and diagnosed 1995 to 2008, in
   the San Francisco Bay Area. We evaluated all-cause and breast
   cancer-specific survival using stage-stratified Cox proportional hazards
   models with cluster adjustment for census block groups.
   Results: In models adjusting for education and nSES, lower nSES was
   associated with worse all-cause survival among African-Americans
   (P-trend 0.03), Hispanics (P-trend 0.01), and Asian-Americans (P-trend
   0.01). Education was not associated with all-cause survival. For breast
   cancer-specific survival, lower nSES was associated with poorer survival
   only among Asian-Americans (P-trend 0.01). When nSES and education were
   jointly considered, women with low education and low nSES had 1.4 to 2.7
   times worse all-cause survival than women with high education and high
   nSES across all races/ethnicities. Among African-Americans and
   Asian-Americans, women with high education and low nSES had 1.6 to 1.9
   times worse survival, respectively. For breast cancer-specific survival,
   joint associations were found only among Asian-Americans with worse
   survival for those with low nSES regardless of education.
   Conclusions: Both neighborhood and individual SES are associated with
   survival after breast cancer diagnosis, but these relationships vary by
   race/ethnicity.
   Impact: A better understanding of the relative contributions and
   interactions of SES with other factors will inform targeted
   interventions toward reducing long-standing disparities in breast cancer
   survival. (C) 2014 AACR.

AB Background: While some argue that social network ties of individuals
   with alcohol use disorders (AUD) are robust, there is evidence to
   suggest that individuals with AUDs have few social network ties, which
   are a known risk factor for health and wellness. Objectives: Social
   network ties to friends, family, co-workers and communities of
   individuals are compared among individuals with a past-year diagnosis of
   alcohol dependence or alcohol abuse to individuals with no lifetime
   diagnosis of AUD. Method: Respondents from Wave 2 of the National
   Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol Related Conditions (NESARC) were
   assessed for the presence of past-year alcohol dependence or past-year
   alcohol abuse, social network ties, sociodemographics and clinical
   characteristics. Results: Bivariate analyses showed that both social
   network size and social network diversity was significantly smaller
   among individuals with alcohol dependence, compared to individuals with
   alcohol abuse or no AUD. When social and clinical factors related to AUD
   status were controlled, multinomial logistic models showed that social
   network diversity remained a significant predictor of AUD status, while
   social network size did not differ among AUD groups. Conclusion: Social
   networks of individuals with AUD may be different than individuals with
   no AUD, but this claim is dependent on specific AUD diagnosis and how
   social networks are measured.

AB Background: Few studies have considered the retention of the individuals
   (alters) comprising the social networks of people in recovery.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe factors predicting
   whether alters were retained 6 months after participants completed
   treatment. Method: The Important Person Inventory was given to 270
   ex-offenders (224 men, 46 women) transitioning from treatment to Oxford
   House residences, Safe Haven therapeutic communities, or to usual
   aftercare. A 6-month follow-up was completed by 176 participants (137
   men, 39 women). Results: We found that alters who were related to the
   participant, did not use drugs, were embedded in smaller networks, and
   had more frequent contact with the participant were significantly more
   likely to be retained as important people over 6 months. The alters'
   drinking and criminal history were not significantly predictive of
   retention in the network. Conclusions: Certain characteristics of
   important people are related to their retention in a social network.
   Understanding these relationships and the extent to which the network
   change that occurs is aligned with abstinence-supporting networks is
   essential for creating effective social interventions for persons in
   recovery.

AB Today, a great challenge of our profession is to envision how we will
   deliver exemplary neurosurgical care in the future. To accomplish this
   requires anticipating how economic, political, and societal influences
   will affect our ability to provide the highest quality of patient care
   in an arena that will look increasingly different from today's world of
   medicine. Already, our profession is battling a relentless assault as
   numerous sectors implement change that impacts us and our community
   every day. Surviving this requires an effective strategy that will
   involve significant cultural change. To accomplish this, neurosurgery
   must take an honest look inward and then commit to being the agents of
   positive cultural change.
   Such a path will not be easy but should reap important benefits for all
   of neurosurgery and our patients. Several practical and proven
   strategies can help us to realize the rewards of changing our culture.
   Vital to this process is understanding that effecting behavioral change
   will increase the likelihood of achieving sustainable cultural change.
   Innovation and diversity are crucial to encourage and reward when trying
   to effect meaningful cultural change, while appreciating the power of a
   "Tipping Point" strategy will also reap significant benefits.
   As a profession, if we adopt these strategies and tactics we can lead
   our profession to proceed in improvement, and as individuals we can use
   the spirit that drove us into neurosurgery to become the agents of an
   enduring and meaningful cultural change that will benefit our patients
   and us.

AB Collection of salivary cortisol has become increasingly popular in large
   population-based studies. However, the impact of protocol compliance on
   day-to-day reliabilities of measures, and the extent to which
   reliabilities differ systematically according to socio-demo-graphic
   characteristics, has not been well characterized in large-scale
   population-based studies to date. Using data on 935 men and women from
   the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, we investigated whether
   sampling protocol compliance differs systematically according to
   socio-demographic factors and whether compliance was associated with
   cortisol estimates, as well as whether associations of cortisol with
   both compliance and socio-demographic characteristics were robust to
   adjustments for one another. We further assessed the day-to-day
   reliability for cortisol features and the extent to which reliabilities
   vary according to socio-demographic factors and sampling protocol
   compliance. Overall, we found higher compliance among persons with
   higher levels of income and education. Lower compliance was
   significantly associated with a less pronounced cortisol awakening
   response (CAR) but was not associated with any other cortisol features,
   and adjustment for compliance did not affect associations of
   socio-demographic characteristics with cortisol. Reliability was higher
   for area under the curve (AUC) and wake up values than for other
   features, but generally did not vary according to socio-demographic
   characteristics, with few exceptions. Our findings regarding intra-class
   correlation coefficients (ICCs) support prior research indicating that
   multiple day collection is preferable to single day collection,
   particularly for CAR and slopes, more so than wakeup and AUC. There were
   few differences in reliability by socio-demographic characteristics.
   Thus, it is unlikely that group-specific sampling protocols are
   warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Analyses test the hypothesis that aspects of social
   relationships (quantity of ties, social support and social strain) are
   associated with differences in levels of biological risk across multiple
   major physiological regulatory systems and consequently overall
   multi-systems risk (i.e., allostatic load [AL]).
   Methods: Data are from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
   Adults (CARDIA) study a bi-ethnic, prospective, multi-center
   epidemiological study, initiated in 1985-1986 to track the development
   of cardiovascular risk in young adulthood (N = 5115). At the year 15
   follow-up when participants were between 32 and 45 years of age,
   additional social and biological data were collected; biological data
   used to assess AL were collected at the Oakland, CA and Chicago, IL
   sites (N = 844).
   Results: Social strains were most strongly and positively related to
   overall AL (Cohen's d =.79 for highest vs. lowest quartile), and to each
   of its component biological subsystems, independent of social ties and
   support as well as sociodemographics and health behaviors. Social ties
   and emotional support were also negatively related to AL (Cohen's d =.33
   and d =.44 for lowest vs. highest quartiles of ties and support,
   respectively) though controls for social strains reduced these
   associations to non-significance. Social support and social strain were
   more strongly related to overall AL than to any of its component
   subscales while social ties were less strongly related to AL and to its
   component subscales. There was no evidence that effects differed by sex,
   age or ethnicity. Conclusions: Findings focus attention on the
   particularly strong relationship between social strains and profiles of
   biological risk and support the cumulative impact of social factors on
   biological risks, showing larger effects for cumulative AL than for any
   of the individual biological systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background. Estimates of the number of firearm-related injuries widely
   vary. Although focus has been primarily on deaths, the societal cost of
   caring for victims of these-injuries is largely unknown. Our goal was to
   estimate the economic impact of nonfatal, firearm-related injuries in
   the United States based on recent, publically available data.
   Methods. We queried several national registries for hospital and
   emergency department (ED) discharges from 2006 to 2010 to estimate the
   annual incidence of firearm-related injuries. The cost of direct medical
   services and lost productivity from firearm-related injuries were
   extrapolated from recently published estimates. To identify potentially
   important trends, we compared the economic impact and payer mix for
   firearm-related injuries in 2006 with those in 2010.
   Results. During the 5-year analytic period, we identified 385,769
   (SE=29,328) firearm-related ED visits resulting in 141,914 (SE=14,243)
   hospital admissions, costing more than $88 billion (SE=$8.0 billion).
   Between 2006 and 2010, there was a decrease in the rate of hospital
   visits from 6.65 per 10,000 visits in 2006 to 5.76 per 10,000 visits in
   2010 (P<.001). Similarly, the rate of hospital admissions and ED visits
   without admission decreased from 2.58 per 10,000 to 1.96 per 10,000
   (P<.001) and 4.08 per 10,000 to 3.79 per 10,000 (P<.001). Regression of
   the economic costs from 2006 to 2010, adjusted for Consumer Price Index,
   showed no change (P=.15). There was a decrease in the proportion of
   Uninsured between 2006 and 2010 from 51.6% to 46.78% (P<.001).
   Conclusion. Firearm-related injuries are a major economic burden to not
   only the American health care system but also to American society. The
   incidence of these injuries has decreased slightly from 2006 to 2010,
   with no change in the economic burden. Research aimed at understanding
   the associated financial, social, health, and disability-related issues
   related to firearm injuries is necessary and would likely enhance our
   knowledge of the causes of these events, and may accelerate development
   of interventions and policies to decrease the staggering medical and
   societal cost of gun violence.

AB Negotiations about reparations tend to take the language of interests
   and to deal primarily with monetary compensation for disadvantaged
   groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are likely to make a
   variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience,
   ranging from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the
   entire process altogether. This article draws attention to the
   communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims
   that actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they
   hold sacred, but simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of
   self-worth and to elicit identification by raising moral critiques about
   the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005
   removal of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It
   shows that settlers indeed demanded to be compensated fiscally for their
   lost property. At the same time, it shows that they raised objections to
   the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered
   alternate logics of evaluation. The settlers resisted shame and
   devaluation through such competing logics, demanding that the state
   reaffirm a positive and embracing relationship with them despite its
   decision to evict them.

   This analysis used the data from 2005 National Health Interview Survey
   and included women at age a parts per thousand yen 40 years who
   completed the cancer questionnaires (2,427,075 breast cancer survivors
   and 57,978,043 women without cancer). Self-reported information on
   cancer history, healthy behaviors (body mass index, smoking, alcohol
   use, physical activity, fruit/vegetable consumption, sunscreen use) was
   collected. We compared distributions of each factor among Caucasian,
   African American, and Hispanic women with and without breast cancer
   history.
   Caucasian breast cancer survivors as compared to their cancer-free
   counterparts were less likely to be current smokers (8.3 vs. 16.9 %, p <
   0.001) and to have regular mammograms (51.5 vs. 36.9 %, p < 0.05).
   Differences in associations between cancer survivors and respondents
   without cancer among African American and Hispanic women did not reach
   statistical significance.
   Certain breast cancer survivor groups can benefit from tailored
   preventive services that would address concerns related to selected
   healthy behaviors and screening practices. However, most of the
   differences are suggestive and do not differ by race.

AB Higher pathologic grade, suboptimal debulking surgery, and late-stage
   are markers of more aggressive and advanced ovarian cancer. Neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with more aggressive and
   advanced tumors for other cancer sites, and this may also be true for
   ovarian cancer.
   We examined the association between neighborhood SES and ovarian cancer
   tumor characteristics using data on 581 women diagnosed with epithelial
   ovarian cancer in Cook County, Illinois. Two complementary measures
   (concentrated disadvantage and concentrated affluence) were used to
   estimate neighborhood SES. Prevalence differences and 95 % confidence
   intervals were estimated in logistic regression models adjusted for age
   and race.
   Greater disadvantage was associated with higher grade tumors (p = 0.03)
   and suboptimal debulking (p = 0.05) and marginally associated with later
   tumor stage (p = 0.20). Greater affluence was inversely associated with
   stage at diagnosis (p = 0.004) and suboptimal debulking (p = 0.03) and
   (marginally) with tumor grade (p = 0.21).
   Our findings suggest that lower SES, estimated by neighborhood SES, is
   associated with ovarian cancer tumor characteristics indicative of more
   advanced and aggressive disease.

AB Background: Some contend that gender differences in outcomes after lower
   extremity bypass (LEB) for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) relate to
   socioeconomic factors (SEFs). Here, we evaluate these disparities with
   attention to clinically relevant yet understudied SEF.
   Methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients aged >50 y with PAD
   undergoing LEB was performed using data from Pennsylvania Health care
   and Cost Containment Council (2003-2011). Multivariable logistic
   regression modeling was performed to evaluate the association between
   gender and outcomes with adjustment for potential confounders including
   SEF such as income, insurance provider, distance to hospital, and race.
   Generalized estimating equations were used to adjust for hospital
   clustering. Independent models were developed to examine death or
   serious morbidity (DSM) and failure-to-rescue (FTR).
   Results: Of 4202 patients identified, 1510 (36%) were women. SEF
   differed by gender. DSM was more frequent in women (15.6% versus 12.2%;
   P = 0.002). There was no association between gender and FTR in
   univariate analysis (P = 0.49). SEFs were associated with DSM and FTR.
   After adjustment for potential confounders including SEF, women remained
   more likely to experience DSM (odds ratio = 1.28; P = 0.01). There
   remained no significant association between gender and FTR on
   independent modeling (odds ratio = 0.49; P = 0.11).
   Conclusions: Women undergoing LEB in the state of Pennsylvania are at
   increased risk of poor outcomes, which is not completely explained by
   SEF. Quality of postoperative care does not appear to be different
   between gender as there was no difference in FTR. To improve these
   outcomes, efforts should be made to increase awareness of PAD and
   promote screening among high-risk women to ensure timely diagnosis and
   referral. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB ObjectivesTo help guide universal influenza vaccination efforts in the
   United States, it is important to know which demographic groups are
   currently at highest risk of costly complications of influenza
   infection. Few studies have examined the relationship between
   hospitalization with influenza and either socioeconomic status (SES) or
   sex. We examined associations between census tract-level SES and sex and
   incidence of influenza-related hospitalizations among adults.
   DesignDescriptive analysis of data collected by active population-based
   surveillance for persons >18years old hospitalized with laboratory
   confirmed influenza during the 2007-2008 through 2010-2011 influenza
   seasons. Case residential addresses were geocoded and linked to data
   from the 2006-2010 American Community Survey to obtain census-tract
   level (neighborhood) SES measures. Census-tract level SES variables
   included measures of poverty, education, crowding, primary language, and
   median income. Four levels were created for each.
   SettingNew Haven, County, Connecticut.
   SampleEntire New Haven County population >18years old.
   Main Outcome MeasuresAge-adjusted incidence of influenza
   hospitalizations and relative risk by sex and by each of five SES
   measures.
   ResultsCrude and age-adjusted incidence progressively increased with
   decreasing neighborhood SES for each measure both overall and for each
   influenza season. Female incidence was higher than male for each age
   group, and female age-adjusted incidence was higher for each SES level
   and influenza season.
   ConclusionsFemale sex and lower neighborhood SES were independently and
   consistently associated with higher incidence of hospitalization of
   adults with influenza. If this is more broadly the case, these findings
   have implications for future influenza vaccination efforts. Analysis
   using census tract SES measures can provide additional perspective on
   health disparities.

   This study examines how in the social domain, possible selves, a
   future-oriented self-concept, and self-regulation, including
   self-regulatory beliefs and intraindividual variability in
   self-regulatory behavior, relate to differences in overall daily social
   goal progress. An online older-adult sample worked towards a
   self-defined meaningful social goal over 100 days. Multilevel analysis
   showed that participants with social possible selves made higher overall
   daily goal progress, especially those with both hoped-for and feared
   possible selves, than those with possible selves in nonsocial domains.
   Self-regulatory beliefs were positively whereas variability was
   negatively associated with overall daily goal progress. The findings
   suggest that possible selves, in combination with two distinct
   self-regulatory constructs, significantly guide social goal progress.

AB This paper describes the development of the Sustainable Neighborhoods
   for Happiness Index (SNHI): a tool to assess and compare how well
   individual cities, towns, neighborhoods and communities embrace
   sustainable practices and how these practices translate to opportunities
   for residents to pursue happiness. The SNHI is grounded in findings from
   primary literature and previous research suggesting associations between
   aspects of sustainable development and higher levels of self-reported
   happiness. Nine subsystems of community development were selected for
   the generation of the SNHI: water management, energy management, urban
   design, food management, business & economic development, waste
   management, buildings & infrastructure, transportation and community
   governance. SNHI scores were generated for sixteen US cities with data
   compiled from the Green City Index (2011) and the SustainLane US City
   Rankings (2007). A method was then developed to generate the Sustainable
   Neighborhoods for Happiness Distribution (SNHD) to plot future SNHI
   scores for comparison. The SNHI scoring methodology was then applied by
   collecting data for Athens, Georgia and Ithaca, New York. Our results
   suggest that San Francisco has the highest SNHI, while Detroit has the
   lowest and that Athens is just below and Ithaca just above the mean SNHI
   on the SNHD. The SNHI can serve as a unique tool for decision makers,
   community stakeholders, engineers, developers, architects, planners and
   researchers to assess the relative status of any neighborhood or
   community, with respect to development and happiness. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB In 2008, the activist group Iraq Veterans Against the War (IVAW)
   produced Operation First Casualty, a piece of guerrilla theater staged
   on streets and in parks in U.S. cities, in which members performed
   actions that they had carried out as they patrolled Iraq and
   Afghanistan. In opposition to representations of war that excerpt
   violent events from daily life, IVAW portrays military culture as one of
   habitual brutality. At the same time, Operation First Casualty placed an
   audience of American bystanders in positions akin to those of Iraqis and
   Afghanis, in an attempt to engage empathy for, and enable solidarity
   with, the people whose countries are occupied by the US. Due to what I
   describe as soldiers' function as a scapegoat figure in the national
   imaginary, IVAW's insight has had little influence on public discourse.
   To understand the co-determinacy of the marginal status of soldiers and
   the social framing that gives the soldier figure such pull, I overlay
   theories of tragedy and political sociology in which scholars explore
   the ritualistic dynamics of scapegoats, collective identity, and
   outsiders in democratic society.

AB This paper makes the argument that personal travel blogs are an
   important site for studying self-reports of face-to-face intercultural
   interaction. The guiding research question is "Are personal travel blogs
   good sources of intercultural communication data?" A content analysis of
   an American woman's travel blog, written on a sojourn to Zimbabwe, was
   performed using four intercultural communication constructs that served
   as frameworks for developing a rubric and for analysis. Those constructs
   are: culture shock, intercultural communication challenges,
   cross-cultural comparison and intercultural adaptation. Results provide
   evidence of written reflections by the blogger in all four coding
   categories. The evidence of culture shock provided in the blog was
   multifold, multifaceted, and congruent with many of the well-established
   elements of culture shock reported in the field. The evidence of
   cross-cultural comparison in the personal travel blog was,
   overwhelmingly, comprised of reflections comparing host and home
   cultures, both in environment and cultural practices. There was limited
   evidence of reflections about communication challenges or adaptation by
   the blogger on her sojourn. The article concludes with a discussion of
   the implications these findings have for the potential travel blogs
   might provide for analysis of intercultural communication as well as
   addressing the limitations of the study's findings.

AB Disadvantaged social environments are associated with adverse health
   outcomes. This has been attributed, in part, to chronic stress. Telomere
   length (TL) has been used as a biomarker of chronic stress: TL is
   shorter in adults in a variety of contexts, including disadvantaged
   social standing and depression. We use data from 40, 9-y-old boys
   participating in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to
   extend this observation to African American children. We report that
   exposure to disadvantaged environments is associated with reduced TL by
   age 9 y. We document significant associations between low income, low
   maternal education, unstable family structure, and harsh parenting and
   TL. These effects were moderated by genetic variants in serotonergic and
   dopaminergic pathways. Consistent with the differential susceptibility
   hypothesis, subjects with the highest genetic sensitivity scores had the
   shortest TL when exposed to disadvantaged social environments and the
   longest TL when exposed to advantaged environments.

AB Background: The extent to which patients with COPD are receiving
   indicated treatment with medications to improve lung function and recent
   trends in the use of these medications is not well documented in the
   United States. The objective of this study was to examine trends in
   prescription medications for COPD among adults in the United States from
   1999 to 2010.
   Methods: We performed a trend analysis using data from up to 1426
   participants aged >= 20 years with self-reported COPD from six national
   surveys (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010).
   Results: During 2009-2010, the age-adjusted percentage of participants
   who used any kind of medication was 44.2%. Also during 2009-2010, the
   most commonly used medications were short-acting agents (36.0%), inhaled
   corticosteroids (ICS) (18.3%), and LABAs (16.7%). The use of long-acting
   beta-2 agonists (LABAs) (p for trend <0.001), ICS (p for trend = 0.013)
   increased significantly over the 12-year period. Furthermore, the use of
   tiotropium increased rapidly during this period (p for trend <0.001).
   For the years 2005-2010, the use of LABAs, ICS and tiotropium increased
   with age. Compared with whites, Mexican Americans were less likely to
   use short-acting agents, LABAs, ICS, tiotropium, and any kind of COPD
   medication. Among participants aged 20-79 years with spirometry
   measurements during 2007-2010, the use of any medication was reported by
   19.0% of those with a moderate/severe obstructive impairment and by
   72.6% of those with self-reported COPD and any obstructive impairment.
   Conclusion: The percentages of adults with COPD who reported having
   various classes of prescription medications that improve airflow
   limitations changed markedly from 1999-2000 to 2009-2010. However, many
   adults with COPD did not report having recommended prescription
   medications.

AB The collapsing of social contexts together has emerged as an important
   topic with the rise of social media that so often blurs the public and
   private, professional and personal, and the many different selves and
   situations in which individuals find themselves. Academic literature is
   starting to address how the meshing of social contexts online has many
   potentially beneficial as well as problematic consequences. In an effort
   to further theorize context collapse, we draw on this literature to
   consider the conditions under which context collapse occurs, offering
   key conceptual tools with which to address these conditions.
   Specifically, we distinguish two different types of context collapse,
   splitting collapse into context collusions and context collisions. The
   former is an intentional collapsing of contexts, while the latter is
   unintentional. We further examine the ways in which both technological
   architectures and agentic user practices combine to facilitate and
   mitigate the various effects of collapsing contexts.

AB Large-scale mobilization of individuals across social networks is
   becoming increasingly prevalent in society. However, little is known
   about what affects the speed of social mobilization. Here we use a
   framed field experiment to identify and measure properties of
   individuals and their relationships that predict mobilization speed. We
   ran a global social mobilization contest and recorded personal traits of
   the participants and those they recruited. We studied the effects of
   ascribed traits (gender, age) and acquired traits (geography, and
   information source) on the speed of mobilization. We found that
   homophily, a preference for interacting with other individuals with
   similar traits, had a mixed role in social mobilization. Homophily was
   present for acquired traits, in which mobilization speed was faster when
   the recuiter and recruit had the same trait compared to different
   traits. In contrast, we did not find support for homophily for the
   ascribed traits. Instead, those traits had other, non-homophily effects:
   Females mobilized other females faster than males mobilized other males.
   Younger recruiters mobilized others faster, and older recruits mobilized
   slower. Recruits also mobilized faster when they first heard about the
   contest directly from the contest organization, and decreased in speed
   when hearing from less personal source types (e. g. family vs. media).
   These findings show that social mobilization includes dynamics that are
   unlike other, more passive forms of social activity propagation. These
   findings suggest relevant factors for engineering social mobilization
   tasks for increased speed.

AB Objective: This study examined the ability of social, demographic,
   environmental and health-related factors to explain geographic
   variability in preterm delivery among black and white women in the US
   and whether these factors explain black-white disparities in preterm
   delivery.
   Methods: We examined county-level prevalence of preterm delivery (20-31
   or 32-36 weeks gestation) among singletons born 1998-2002. We conducted
   multivariable linear regression analysis to estimate the association of
   selected variables with preterm delivery separately for each
   preterm/race-ethnicity group.
   Results: The prevalence of preterm delivery varied two-to three-fold
   across U. S. counties, and the distributions were strikingly distinct
   for blacks and whites. Among births to blacks, regression models
   explained 46% of the variability in county-level risk of delivery at
   20-31 weeks and 55% for delivery at 32-36 weeks (based on R-squared
   values). Respective percentages for whites were 67% and 71%. Models
   included socio-environmental/demographic and health-related variables
   and explained similar amounts of variability overall.
   Conclusions: Much of the geographic variability in preterm delivery in
   the US can be explained by socioeconomic, demographic and health-related
   characteristics of the population, but less so for blacks than whites.

AB Diverse socioeconomic and clinical factors influence susceptibility to
   tuberculosis (TB) disease in Mexico. The role of genetic factors,
   particularly those that differ between the parental groups that admixed
   in Mexico, is unclear. The objectives of this study are to identify the
   socioeconomic and clinical predictors of the transition from latent TB
   infection (LTBI) to pulmonary TB disease in an urban population in
   northeastern Mexico, and to examine whether genetic ancestry plays an
   independent role in this transition. We recruited 97 pulmonary TB
   disease patients and 97 LTBI individuals from a public hospital in
   Monterrey, Nuevo Leon. Socioeconomic and clinical variables were
   collected from interviews and medical records, and genetic ancestry was
   estimated for a subset of 142 study participants from 291,917 single
   nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We examined crude associations between
   the variables and TB disease status. Significant predictors from crude
   association tests were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression.
   We also compared genetic ancestry between LTBI individuals and TB
   disease patients at 1,314 SNPs in 273 genes from the TB biosystem in the
   NCBI BioSystems database. In crude association tests, 12 socioeconomic
   and clinical variables were associated with TB disease. Multivariable
   logistic regression analyses indicated that marital status, diabetes,
   and smoking were independently associated with TB status. Genetic
   ancestry was not associated with TB disease in either crude or
   multivariable analyses. Separate analyses showed that LTBI individuals
   recruited from hospital staff had significantly higher European genetic
   ancestry than LTBI individuals recruited from the clinics and waiting
   rooms. Genetic ancestry differed between individuals with LTBI and TB
   disease at SNPs located in two genes in the TB biosystem. These results
   indicate that Monterrey may be structured with respect to genetic
   ancestry, and that genetic differences in TB susceptibility in parental
   populations may contribute to variation in disease susceptibility in the
   region.

AB Community structure is one of the most commonly observed features of
   Online Social Networks (OSNs) in reality. The knowledge of this feature
   is of great advantage: it not only provides helpful insights into

   wide range of applications enabled by social and mobile networking, such
   as routing strategies in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and worm
   containment in OSNs. Unfortunately, understanding this structure is very
   challenging, especially in dynamic social networks where social
   interactions are evolving rapidly. Our work focuses on the following
   questions: How can we efficiently identify communities in dynamic social
   networks? How can we adaptively update the network community structure
   based on its history instead of recomputing from scratch? To this end,
   we present Quick Community Adaptation (QCA), an adaptive
   modularity-based framework for not only discovering but also tracing the
   evolution of network communities in dynamic OSNs. QCA is very fast and
   efficient in the sense that it adaptively updates and discovers the new
   community structure based on its history together with the network
   changes only. This flexible approach makes QCA an ideal framework
   applicable for analyzing large-scale dynamic social networks due to its
   lightweight computing-resource requirement. To illustrate the
   effectiveness of our framework, we extensively test QCA on both
   synthesized and real-world social networks including Enron, arXiv
   e-print citation, and Facebook networks. Finally, we demonstrate the
   applicability of QCA in real applications: (1) A social-aware message
   forwarding strategy in MANETs, and (2) worm propagation containment in
   OSNs. Competitive results in comparison with other methods reveal that
   social-based techniques employing QCA as a community detection core
   outperform current available methods.

AB The presence of apparently irrational fair play in the ultimatum game
   remains a focal point for studies in the evolution of social behaviour.
   We investigate the role of negative assortment in the evolution of fair
   play in the ultimatum game. Spite-social behaviour that inflicts harm
   with no direct benefit to the actor-can evolve when it is
   disproportionally directed at individuals playing different strategies.
   The introduction of negative assortment alters the dynamics in away that
   increases the chance fairness evolves, but at a cost: spite also
   evolves. Fairness is usually linked to cooperation and prosocial
   behaviour, but this study shows that it may have evolutionary links to
   harmful antisocial behaviour.

AB Good nutrition in late life is key to the health of older adults and
   demands the attention of health promoters. To assess how the social
   lives and community environmental supports and barriers affect older
   adults' nutritional health, we conducted 29 focus groups with 144
   residents of The Villages, Florida. Participants reside in one of the
   largest retirement communities in the United States. Thematic analysis
   revealed that the high social connectedness of residents confers both
   positive and negative influences on the nutritional lives of residents.
   Neighbors and friends are essential to a resident's ability to access
   foods in times of need. Conversely, many social functions in the
   community revolve around the consumption of foods of low nutrient
   density. Friends and neighbors may provide the best point of entry for
   nutritional interventions, such as food assistance strategies and health
   promotion and education. Policy and practice implications are also
   discussed.

AB The spread of crime is a complex, dynamic process that calls for a

   systems models of the spread of crime, imprisonment and recidivism,
   using only abstract transition parameters. To find the general patterns
   among these parameters-patterns that are independent of the underlying
   particulars-we compute analytic expressions for the equilibria and for
   the tipping points between high-crime and low-crime equilibria in these
   models. We use these expressions to examine, in particular, the effects
   of longer prison terms and of increased incarceration rates on the
   prevalence of crime, with a follow-up analysis on the effects of a
   Three-Strike Policy.

AB With this article, we develop the Drinking Water Disparities Framework
   to explain environmental injustice in the context of drinking water in
   the United States. The framework builds on the social epidemiology and
   environmental justice literatures, and is populated with 5 years of
   field data (2005-2010) from California's San Joaquin Valley. We trace
   the mechanisms through which natural, built, and sociopolitical factors
   work through state, county, community, and household actors to constrain
   access to safe water and to financial resources for communities. These
   constraints and regulatory failures produce social disparities in
   exposure to drinking water contaminants. Water system and household
   coping capacities lead, at best, to partial protection against exposure.
   This composite burden explains the origins and persistence of social
   disparities in exposure to drinking water contaminants.

AB Objectives. We examined the association of childhood and adult
   socioeconomic status with longitudinal change in allostatic load (AL), a
   measure of biological dysfunction.
   Methods. The study sample included 6135 participants from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, aged 45 to 84 years, recruited in
   2000 from 6 US counties; 3 follow-up examinations took place through
   September 2011. We calculated standardized scores for several metabolic
   and cardiovascular components relative to accepted clinical cut points
   for "higher risk" and then summed them to create an overall index of AL.
   We used mixed effects growth curve models to assess the relationship
   between socioeconomic status and AL as a linear function of time passed
   since the baseline examination; we included random effects for the
   intercept and slope.
   Results. Among those with lower baseline AL (< median), high adult
   education was associated with a significantly slower increase in AL over
   time, whereas there was no significant association among those with
   higher baseline AL.
   Conclusions. The relationship between socioeconomic status and patterns
   of change in health parameters may vary over time and with the
   accumulation of biological risk.

AB Objectives. We examined whether acculturation and immigrant generation,
   a marker for assimilation, are associated with diabetes risk in an aging
   Mexican-origin population.
   Methods. We analyzed data on 1789 adults aged 60 to 101 years from the
   Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. We ascertained type 2 diabetes on
   the basis of diabetic medication use, self-report of physician
   diagnosis, or a fasting glucose of 126 milligrams/deciliter or greater.
   Logistic regression modeled prevalent diabetes.
   Results. Adjusting for age and gender, we observed significant but
   divergent associations between immigrant generation, acculturation, and
   diabetes risk. Relative to first-generation adults, second-generation
   adults had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] =
   1.4, 2.4) and third-generation adults had an OR of 2.1 (95% CI = 1.4,
   3.1) of having diabetes. Greater US acculturation, however, was
   associated with a slightly decreased diabetes rate. In the full model
   adjusting for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, the association
   between generation (but not acculturation) and diabetes remained
   significant.
   Conclusions. Our study lends support to the previously contested notion
   that assimilation is associated with an increased diabetes risk in
   Mexican immigrants. Researchers should examine the presence of a causal
   link between assimilation and health more closely.

AB Background Few studies have examined the degree to which racial
   disparities in the development of diabetes are accounted by differences
   in lifecourse socioeconomic position (SEP). We assessed the association
   between race, lifecourse SEP measures and prevalence of diabetes in a
   representative US sample of black and white adults.
   Methods A generalised estimating equations approach was used with a
   sample of 3497 adults from the Americans' Changing Lives study.
   Sex-specific models were calculated to compute prevalence ratios (PR)
   for associations of race and SEP with self-reported diagnoses of
   diabetes.
   Results For men, childhood and adult SEP were unrelated to diabetes, and
   adjustment for lifecourse SEP had little effect on the excess diabetes
   in blacks (PR=1.56, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.21). Adjustment for measures of
   lifecourse SEP reduced the PR for the association between race and
   diabetes in women from 1.96 (95% CI 1.52 to 2.54) to 1.40 (95% CI 1.04
   to 1.87) with the respondent's education responsible for most of the
   reduction in the association. However, diabetes was also inversely
   associated with father's education, and low SEP throughout the
   lifecourse was associated with a nearly threefold increase in diabetes
   (PR= 2.89, 95% CI 2.10 to 3.99).
   Conclusions Racial disparities in diabetes existed among both men and
   women, but lifecourse SEP was related to diabetes only among women. The
   pathway and cumulative hypotheses for lifecourse SEP effects on diabetes
   may be especially salient for women.

AB Background In this partially randomised intervention study, we assessed
   the effect of social networks on the improvement of type 2 diabetes
   management in a largely African-American population in Baltimore.
   Methods Patients in the intervention group (n=68) were asked to recruit
   peers, form small groups, and attend monthly diabetes education
   sessions, emphasising peer support. Patients in the control group (n=70)
   were recruited individually to attend standard diabetes education
   sessions. The primary outcomes were changes in haemoglobin A1C (HbA(1c))
   and blood glucose. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure, weight,
   functional status, self-efficacy, perceived cohesion, social network
   connectedness and diabetes knowledge. General linear mixed models were
   built to assess mean absolute changes in primary and secondary outcomes
   at 3 and 6 months.
   Results At 6 months from baseline, the social network intervention group
   achieved a larger reduction in HbA(1c) of -0.32% (p<0.0001) and blood
   glucose of -10.6 mg/dL, (p<0.0001) compared to the control group. In
   analyses of secondary endpoints, the intervention group had more
   favourable outcomes over time for weight, quality of life,
   self-efficacy, social network scores and diabetes knowledge, compared to
   the control group. While blood pressure decreased, and perceived
   cohesion increased in both groups over the duration of the study, the
   difference between groups was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions The social networks intervention showed improved integration
   of patients within their existing networks leading to a greater
   reduction in HbA(1c) and blood glucose, as well as improved behaviour
   mediating outcomes.

AB It has been documented that given the same type of climate related
   hazard and degree of exposure, the vulnerability of a region to the
   hazard and its resultant damages could be very different, depending on a
   number of natural and socioeconomic factors. An understanding of the
   factors contributing to the vulnerability of a region requires a good
   assessment method. This paper reports the results of a vulnerability
   assessment to hurricane hazards for the countries in the Caribbean
   region. The resultant index is a weighted combination of variables. The
   paper demonstrates a methodology to validate the weights of the
   variables used to compute the index through regression analysis with the
   storm damage data. The refined vulnerability indices for the 25
   countries studied were found to, range from 0.31 to 0.77. Small island
   countries were generally more vulnerable than large countries, with the
   highest vulnerability indices (>0.6) found in The Bahamas, Montserrat,
   St. Kitts and Nevis, and Turks and Caicos Is. Although the hurricane
   exposure was originally considered a key variable contributing to high
   vulnerability, low adaptive capacity in the form of low socioeconomic
   status, high electricity consumption, and low infrastructure development
   were found to have a higher weight contributing to the overall
   vulnerability index.

AB IMPORTANCE Socioeconomic and behavioral factors can negatively influence
   posthospital outcomes among patients of low socioeconomic status (SES).
   Traditional hospital personnel often lack the time, skills, and
   community linkages required to address these factors.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether a tailored community health worker (CHW)
   intervention would improve posthospital outcomes among low-SES patients.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-armed, single-blind, randomized
   clinical trial was conducted between April 10, 2011, and October 30,
   2012, at 2 urban, academically affiliated hospitals. Of 683 eligible
   general medical inpatients (ie, low-income, uninsured, or Medicaid) that
   we screened, 237 individuals (34.7%) declined to participate. The
   remaining 446 patients (65.3%) were enrolled and randomly assigned to
   study arms. Nearly equal percentages of control and intervention group
   patients completed the follow-up interview (86.6% vs 86.9%).
   INTERVENTIONS During hospital admission, CHWs worked with patients to
   create individualized action plans for achieving patients' stated goals
   for recovery. The CHWs provided support tailored to patient goals for a
   minimum of 2 weeks.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The prespecified primary outcome was
   completion of primary care follow-up within 14 days of discharge.
   Prespecified secondary outcomes were quality of discharge communication,
   self-rated health, satisfaction, patient activation, medication
   adherence, and 30-day readmission rates.
   RESULTS Using intention-to-treat analysis, we found that intervention
   patients were more likely to obtain timely posthospital primary care
   (60.0% vs 47.9%; P = .02; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI,
   1.03-2.23), to report high-quality discharge communication (91.3% vs
   78.7%; P = .002; adjusted OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 1.5-5.8), and to show
   greater improvements in mental health (6.7 vs 4.5; P = .02) and patient
   activation (3.4 vs 1.6; P = .05). There were no significant differences
   between groups in physical health, satisfaction with medical care, or
   medication adherence. Similar proportions of patients in both arms
   experienced at least one 30-day readmission; however, intervention
   patients were less likely to have multiple 30-day readmissions (2.3% vs
   5.5%; P = .08; adjusted OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.14-1.06). Among the subgroup
   of 63 readmitted patients, recurrent readmission was reduced from 40.0%
   vs 15.2%(P = .03; adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.08-0.89).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patient-centered CHW intervention improves
   access to primary care and quality of discharge while controlling
   recurrent readmissions in a high-risk population. Health systems may
   leverage the CHW workforce to improve posthospital outcomes by
   addressing behavioral and socioeconomic drivers of disease.

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate the association between urinary incontinence (UI)
   and probable depression, work disability, and workforce exit.
   METHODS: The analytic sample consisted of 4,511 women enrolled in the
   population-based Health and Retirement Study cohort. The analysis
   baseline was 1996, the year that questions about UI were added to the
   survey instrument, and at which time study participants were 5465 years
   of age. Women were followed-up with biennial interviews until 2010-2011.
   Outcomes of interest were onset of probable depression, work disability,
   and workforce exit. Urinary incontinence was specified in different ways
   based on questions about experience and frequency of urine loss. We fit
   Cox proportional hazards regression models to the data, adjusting the
   estimates for baseline sociodemographic and health status variables
   previously found to confound the association between UI and the outcomes
   of interest.
   RESULTS: At baseline, 727 participants (survey-weighted prevalence,
   16.6%; 95% confidence interval [ CI] 15.4-18.0) reported any UI, of
   which 212 (survey-weighted prevalence, 29.2%; 95% CI 25.4-33.3) reported
   urine loss on more than 15 days in the past month; and 1,052
   participants were categorized as having probable depression
   (survey-weighted prevalence, 21.6%; 95% CI 19.8-23.6). Urinary
   incontinence was associated with increased risks for probable depression
   (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% CI 1.27-1.62) and work disability
   (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI 1.01-1.45), but not workforce exit
   (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI 0.93-1.21).
   CONCLUSION: In a population-based cohort of women between ages 54 and 65
   years, UI was associated with increased risks for probable depression
   and work disability. Improved diagnosis and management of UI may yield
   significant economic and psychosocial benefits.

   were lowest. Men were nearly twice as likely to have a colonoscopy (OR =
   1.94, 95% CI = 1.89-1.99) as women. A personal screening history,
   presence of comorbidities, and family history of cancer predicted higher
   screening utilization across modalities, but to different degrees across
   ethnic groups.
   Conclusions: This study confirms previously reported sex differences in
   colorectal cancer screening and ethnic disparities in screening
   participation. The findings suggest it may be useful to include personal
   screening history and family history of cancer into counseling patients
   about screening participation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background Social inclusion is increasingly recognized as a key outcome
   for evaluating global mental health programmes and interventions.
   Whereas social inclusion as an outcome is not a new concept in the field
   of mental health, its measurement has been hampered by varying
   definitions, concepts and instruments. To move the field forward, this
   paper reviews the currently available instruments-which measure social
   inclusion and are reported in the literature, realizing that no single
   measure will be appropriate for all studies or contexts.
   Methods A systematic literature search of English language peer-reviewed
   articles published through February 2013 was undertaken to identify
   scales specifically developed to measure social inclusion or
   social/community integration among populations with mental disorders.
   Results Five instruments were identified through the search criteria.
   The scales are discussed in terms of their theoretical underpinnings,
   domains and/or key items and their potential for use in global settings.
   Whereas numerous reviewed abstracts discussed mental health and social
   inclusion or social integration, very few were concerned with direct
   measurement of the construct. All identified scales were developed in
   high-income countries with limited attention paid to how the scale could
   be adapted for cross-cultural use.
   Conclusions Social inclusion is increasingly highlighted as a key
   outcome for global mental health policies and programmes, yet its
   measurement is underdeveloped. There is need for a global cross-cultural
   measure that has been developed and tested in diverse settings. However,
   until that need is met, some of the scales presented here may be
   amenable to adaptation.

AB Methods: We estimated the Poisson regression model using original data
   on 109 celebrity suicides and daily suicide counts (n = 8035) in Japan
   from 1989 through 2010. Various fixed effects were included in the model
   to control for the effects of seasonal variations and time-specific
   shocks.
   Results: The media reports on celebrity suicides were associated with an
   immediate increase in total suicides. The total number of suicides
   increased by 4.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.4-6.7) on the day
   that media reports on celebrity suicides were published. The increase
   during the post-report period lasted for about 10 days after the
   publication of news reports. The average effect of celebrity suicides on
   total suicides over the 10-day post-reporting period was estimated to be
   highest when the suicide by nationally recognized politicians was
   reported (14.8%; CI: 10.9-18.7), whereas reports on the deaths of
   entertainment celebrities were followed by a 4.7% increase (CI: 2.9-6.5)
   in suicide counts.
   Conclusions: This study presents evidence that media reports on
   celebrity suicides have an immediate impact on the number of suicides in
   the general population. Our findings also highlight the importance of
   responsible and cautious media reporting on suicide.

AB The nature of social support available to incarcerated women is not
   well-understood, particularly among women at high risk of negative
   outcomes, including women dually diagnosed with Major Depressive
   Disorder and a Substance Use Disorder (MDD-SUD). Descriptive statistics
   and paired-tests were conducted on 60 incarcerated MDD-SUD women
   receiving in-prison substance use and depression treatments to
   characterize the women's social networks, including the strength of
   support, network characteristics, and types of support provided as well
   as to determine what aspects of social support may be amenable to change
   during incarceration and post-release. Study results showed that, on
   average, women perceived they had moderately supportive individuals in
   their lives, although more than a quarter of the sample could not
   identify any regular supporters in their network at baseline. During
   incarceration, women's social networks significantly increased in
   general supportiveness, and decreased in network size and percentage of
   substance users in their networks. Participants maintained positive
   social support gains post-release in most areas while also significantly
   increasing the size of their support network post-release. Findings
   suggest that there are aspects of incarcerated MDD-SUD women's social
   networks that are amenable to change during incarceration and
   post-release and provide insight into treatment targets for this
   vulnerable population.

AB High prices garnered by British contemporary artists are often presented
   as a problem of valuation. This article seeks to connect the rapid
   ascent of British contemporary artists to the emergence and
   institutionalization of the Turner Prize, today's most prestigious art
   award. Although prizes and awards proliferate in fields of cultural
   production, little academic research has investigated their implications
   for artists' careers and trajectories. Combining a detailed, qualitative
   description of the institutionalization of the Turner Prize with a
   quantitative investigation of its influence on auction prices, we find
   that British contemporary artists' unusual valuation pattern (fast
   market ascension and hastened, rather than "deferred," commercial
   success) largely results from a different relation between value and
   price rooted in the Turner Prize's three innovative valuation
   mechanisms: brokerage, deliberation, and institutional labeling. (C)

AB Sociologists and instructors who teach about community service share an
   affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many
   studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community
   service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating
   sociological content into community service classes. The authors
   supplemented a community service course at a large public university
   with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest
   that this integration increased student understanding of the social
   structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served,
   sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and
   discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation
   of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and
   facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of
   populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We
   argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across
   college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide
   beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

AB Sociologists have developed compelling pedagogical strategies to focus
   the undergraduate gaze on problems of gender and sexuality. Nested
   within the social construction of gender norms, the sexualization of
   girls and women negatively impacts individual, interpersonal, and
   societal levels of social interaction. Nevertheless, this important
   issue remains under-explored in the sociology of teaching and learning.
   This article reports on a pedagogical module that utilizes a multimedia
   presentation to define and illustrate the sexualization of girls and
   women. Lesson impacts were assessed through an online survey. Results
   indicate a critical gap between the social importance of this topic and
   educational exposure. Students unanimously recommended this module be
   taught in introductory sociology courses and offered specific examples
   of individual and interpersonal impacts. Our findings suggest an ongoing
   need to address the sexualization of girls and women inside, and
   outside, of the classroom.

   inflict deleterious consequences on individuals and groups.
   Additionally, the presence of videos of breaching experiments on the

   publicly touting as sociological practice. By giving greater
   consideration to the embeddedness of the breaching experiment and its
   practitioners in the broader social world, students and instructors can
   create breaching experiments that are enlightening while still
   manifesting an appreciation of their effects on the experiments'
   subjects and perhaps even making a contribution to the amelioration or
   transformation of the structures within which they take place.

AB A perspective that has often been absent in criminal justice research is
   that of former prisoners. This article discusses the establishment, in
   1997, of convict criminology, a group of scholars producing research
   informed by their experiences of crime and the criminal justice process;
   that is, either those who have served time themselves or who have
   operated alongside prisoners as professionals in custodial settings. It
   is argued that such scholars face similar dilemmas to others in terms of
   emotionalism, but suggests that their emotions are of a different
   nature. While an insider perspective cannot lay claim to scientific
   objectivity, the article argues that the existence of emotion does not
   invalidate an insider criminologist's views. Rather, the passion
   engendered by the experience of incarceration can add color, context,
   and contour to data collection, findings, and analysis and may therefore
   be regarded as an essential thread in the tapestry of criminological
   inquiry.

AB OBJECTIVES: Heritable and environmental factors may contribute to
   differences in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence across populations. We
   capitalized on the resources of the California Cancer Registry (CCR) and
   California's diverse Asian population to perform a cohort study
   exploring the relationships between CRC incidence, nativity, and
   neighborhood-level factors across Asian subgroups.
   METHODS: We identified CRC cases in the CCR from 1990 to 2004 and
   calculated age-adjusted CRC incidence rates for non-Hispanic Whites and
   US-born vs. foreign-born Asian ethnic subgroups, stratified by
   neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and "ethnic enclave." Trends
   were studied with joinpoint analysis.
   RESULTS: CRC incidence was lowest among foreign-born South Asians
   (22.0/100,000; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 19.7-24.5/100,000) and
   highest among foreign-born Japanese (74.6/100,000; 95 % CI:
   70.1-79.2/100,000). Women in all Asian subgroups except Japanese, and
   men in all Asian subgroups except Japanese and US-born Chinese, had
   lower CRC incidence than non-Hispanic Whites. Among Chinese men and
   Filipino women and men, CRC incidence was lower among foreign-born than
   US-born persons; the opposite was observed for Japanese women and men.
   Among non-Hispanic Whites, but not most Asian subgroups, CRC incidence
   decreased over time. CRC incidence was inversely associated with
   neighborhood SES among non-Hispanic Whites, and level of ethnic enclave
   among Asians.
   CONCLUSIONS: CRC incidence rates differ substantially across Asian
   subgroups in California. The significant associations between CRC
   incidence and nativity and residence in an ethnic enclave suggest a
   substantial effect of acquired environmental factors. The absence of
   declines in CRC incidence rates among most Asians during our study
   period may point to disparities in screening compared with Whites.

AB Social comparison pervades our interactions with others, informing us of
   our standing and motivating improvement, but producing negative
   emotional and behavioral consequences that can harm relationships and
   lead to poor health outcomes. Social neuroscience research has begun to
   illuminate some mechanisms by which status divides lead to interpersonal
   consequences. This review integrates core findings on the neuroscience
   of social comparison processes, showing the effects of comparing the
   self to relevant others on dimensions of competence and warmth. The
   literature converges to suggest that relative status divides initiate
   social comparison processes, that upward and downward comparisons
   initiate pain- and pleasure-related neural responses, and that these
   responses can predict people's kindly or aggressive intentions toward
   one another. Across different types of comparisons, brain regions
   involved in mentalizing are also sometimes involved. Along with future
   work, the research reviewed here may inform efforts to mitigate negative
   outcomes of constant social comparisons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd: All

   in a cohort of parents of 2-month-olds and how they differ by
   race/ethnicity.METHODS:Parents participating in Greenlight, a cluster,
   randomized trial of obesity prevention at 4 health centers, were queried
   at enrollment about feeding and activity behaviors thought to increase
   obesity risk. Unadjusted associations between race/ethnicity and the
   outcomes of interest were performed by using Pearson (2) and
   Kruskal-Wallis tests. Adjusted analyses were performed by using
   proportional odds logistic regressions.RESULTS:Eight hundred sixty-three
   parents (50% Hispanic, 27% black, 18% white; 86% Medicaid) were
   enrolled. Exclusive formula feeding was more than twice as common (45%)
   as exclusive breastfeeding (19%); 12% had already introduced solid food;
   43% put infants to bed with bottles; 23% propped bottles; 20% always fed
   when the infant cried; 38% always tried to get children to finish milk;
   90% were exposed to television (mean, 346 minutes/day); 50% reported
   active television watching (mean, 25 minutes/day); and 66% did not meet
   tummy time recommendations. Compared with white parents, black parents
   were more likely to put children to bed with a bottle (adjusted odds
   ratio [aOR] = 1.97, P < .004; bottle propping, aOR = 3.1, P < .001), and
   report more television watching (aOR = 1.6, P = .034). Hispanic parents
   were more likely than white parents to encourage children to finish
   feeding (aOR = 1.9, P = .007), bottle propping (aOR = 2.5, P = .009),
   and report less tummy time (aOR = 0.6, P = .037).CONCLUSIONS:Behaviors
   thought to relate to later obesity were highly prevalent in this large,
   diverse sample and varied by race/ethnicity, suggesting the importance
   of early and culturally-adapted interventions.

   capacity for mobilization and capacity for health communication-and
   residents' self-reported health status in order to explore the role
   health communication may play in community building for health.
   To estimate multi-level effects of the community participation and the
   two contextual indicators with self-rated health status, we applied
   hierarchical generalized linear regression to crosssectional data from
   the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
   After adjusting for individual- and community-level confounders, the
   likelihood of having high self-rated health status is significantly
   higher among those who live in a region with higher community capacity
   for mobilization, higher health communication capacity at the community
   level, and higher participation in community groups at the
   individual-level.
   Our findings suggest that living in a community characterized by higher
   levels of communication and mobilization capacity is beneficial to
   residents' self-rated health status-increasing the odds of high health
   status by up to 9 %. Thus, building community capacity in mobilization
   and health communication may help develop better health promotion
   campaigns.

AB Agroforestry has been suggested to produce an array of ecological and
   socio-economic benefits that not only reach their adopters, but society
   as a whole. In spite of strong evidence of the benefits of agroforestry,
   there is a lack of understanding of the public perceptions of those
   benefits, which prevents the development of benefit-based promotion
   strategies of agroforestry products. Thus, this study examines the
   awareness of these benefits among residents and explores whether
   perceptions vary across individuals with different socio-demographic
   characteristics. An on-line platform was used to survey three panels of
   residents from Missouri, Pennsylvania and Texas. Overall, respondents
   had a neutral perception of the importance of the ecological and
   socio-economic benefits that agroforestry farms provide to society when
   compared to farms employing conventional agricultural practices. These
   results stress the need to increase public awareness of agroforestry
   practices and their benefits to more strategically position their
   products among the final consumer. Gender, education level, and
   residence location were significantly associated with the perceived
   ecological benefits produced by agroforestry farms and to a lesser
   extent with the socio-economic benefits. Results also showed that
   females and young individuals have a greater awareness of several
   benefits produced by agroforestry farms. Critical marketing implications
   to stimulate the purchase of agroforestry products (e.g., berries, nuts)
   among specific groups of consumers are discussed.

AB Encephalitis produces considerable morbidity in the United States, but
   morbidity rates among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have
   not been described. Hospitalization records listing an encephalitis
   diagnosis were analyzed by using Indian Health Service direct/contract
   inpatient data. For 1998-2010, there were 436 encephalitis-associated
   hospitalizations among AI/AN people, an average annual age-adjusted
   hospitalization rate of 3.1/100,000 population. The rate for infants
   (11.9) was more than double that for any other age group. Death occurred
   for 4.1% of hospitalizations. Consistent with reports for the general
   U.S. population, the rate was high among infants and most (53.9%)
   hospitalizations were of unexplained etiology. The average annual rate
   during the study period appeared lower than for the general U.S.
   population, due particularly to lower rates in the elderly. Future
   community-based surveillance and mortality studies are needed to confirm
   these findings and examine reasons underlying the low rates of
   encephalitis in AI/AN people.

AB Background: The misuse of benzodiazepines (BZs) among adolescents is an
   important issue within the fields of mental health, medicine, and public
   health. Though there is an increasing amount of research on prescription
   medication misuse, a relatively small number of studies focus on
   adolescent BZ misuse. The goal of this study, therefore, is to identify
   demographic and psychosocial factors that place adolescents at risk for
   misusing BZs. Additionally, the authors applied concepts from social
   bonding theory, social learning theory, and strain theory to determine
   the extent to which these concepts explain BZ misuse.
   Methods: Using data from the 2011 National Survey of Drug Use & Health,
   multivariate logistic regression models were estimated to determine
   which factors were associated with an increased risk of BZ misuse.
   Results: These findings help to describe the psychosocial profile of
   adolescent BZ misusers which should increase the ability of clinicians
   to identify patients who may be at greater risk for misuse.
   Conclusion: This study is particularly important within the context of
   psychiatry, where a clearer understanding of adolescent BZ misuse is
   critical for informing prevention efforts and developing best practices
   for prescribing BZs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) often exhibit prominent,
   early and progressive impairments in social behaviour. We developed the
   Social Impairment Rating Scale (SIRS), rated by a clinician after a
   structured interview, which grades the types and severity of social
   behavioural symptoms in seven domains. In 20 FTD patients, we used the
   SIRS to study the anatomic basis of social impairments. In support of
   hypotheses generated from a prior study of healthy adults, we found that
   the relative magnitude of brain atrophy in three partially dissociable
   corticolimbic networks anchored in the amygdala predicted the severity
   of distinct social impairments measured using the SIRS. Patients with
   the greatest atrophy in a mesolimbic, reward-related (affiliation)
   network exhibited the most severe socioemotional detachment, whereas
   patients with the greatest atrophy in an interoceptive, pain-related
   (aversion) network exhibited the most severe lack of social
   apprehension. Patients with the greatest atrophy in a perceptual network
   exhibited the most severe lack of awareness or understanding of others'
   social and emotional behaviour. Our findings underscore observations
   that FTD is associated with heterogeneous social symptoms that can be
   understood in a refined manner by measuring impairments in component
   processes subserved by dissociable neural networks. Furthermore, these
   findings support the validity of the SIRS as an instrument to measure
   the social symptoms of patients with FTD. Ultimately, we hope it will be
   useful as a longitudinal outcome measure in natural history studies and
   in clinical trials of putative interventions to improve social
   functioning.

AB Objective: Pain and depressive symptoms are commonly experienced by
   cancer survivors. Lower social support is linked to a variety of
   negative mental and physical health outcomes among survivors. Immune
   dysregulation may be one mechanism linking low social support to the
   development of pain and depressive symptoms over time. Accordingly, the
   goal of the present study was to examine the relationships among
   survivors' social support, pain, depressive symptoms, and inflammation.
   Methods: Breast cancer survivors (N = 164, stages 0-IIIA) completed two
   study visits, one before any cancer treatment and the other 6 months
   after the completion of surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy, whichever
   came last. Women completed self-report questionnaires assessing social
   support, pain, and depressive symptoms, and provided a blood sample at
   both visits.
   Results: Survivors with lower social support prior to treatment
   experienced higher levels of pain and depressive symptoms over time than
   their more socially supported counterparts. Furthermore, women with
   lower pretreatment social support had higher levels of IL-6 over time,
   and these elevations in IL-6 predicted marginally larger increases in
   depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that social support at
   the time of diagnosis predicts the post-treatment development of pain,
   depressive symptoms, and inflammation. Consequently, early interventions
   targeting survivors' social networks could improve quality of life
   during survivorship. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A growing body of research has revealed that social evaluative stressors
   trigger biological and psychological responses that in chronic forms
   have been linked to aging and disease. Recent research suggests that
   self-compassion may protect the self from typical defensive responses to
   evaluation. We investigated whether brief training in self-compassion
   moderated biopsychological responses to the Trier Social Stress Test
   (TSST) in women. Compared to attention (placebo) and no-training control
   conditions, brief self-compassion training diminished sympathetic
   (salivary alpha-amylase), cardiac parasympathetic, and subjective
   anxiety responses, though not HPA-axis (salivary cortisol) responses to
   the TSST. Self-compassion training also led to greater self-compassion
   under threat relative to the control groups. In that social stress
   pervades modern life, self-compassion represents a promising approach to
   diminishing its potentially negative psychological and biological
   effects. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background and Purpose The inverse relation between socioeconomic status
   and cardiovascular disease is well established. However, few studies
   have investigated socioeconomic status assessed repeatedly during
   adulthood in relation to subclinical atherosclerosis. We aimed to test
   whether consistently low socioeconomic status, as indexed by education,
   income, and financial strain, for 12 years of midlife was related to
   later carotid intima-media thickness and plaque among women.
   Methods The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a multisite
   longitudinal study of midlife women. Education was assessed at the study
   baseline, income and financial strain were obtained yearly for 12 years,
   and a carotid ultrasound was obtained at study year 12 among 1402 women.
   Associations were tested in linear and multinomial logistic regression
   models adjusted for demographic, biological, and behavioral risk
   factors.
   Results A high school education or less (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence
   interval {CI}], 1.72 [1.15-2.59]; P<0.01), some college education (OR
   [95% CI], 1.65 [1.17-2.32]; P<0.01), consistently low income (OR [95%
   CI], 1.83 [1.15-2.89]; P<0.05), and consistent financial strain (OR [95%
   CI], 1.78 [1.21-2.61]; P<0.01) for 12 years were associated with higher
   carotid plaque, and consistent financial strain was associated with
   elevated maximal intima-media thickness ( [SE]=0.02 [0.01]; P<0.05)
   controlling for standard cardiovascular disease risk factors. When
   socioeconomic status indices were considered together, financial strain
   ( [SE]=0.02 [0.01]; P<0.05) and low education (high school education or
   less: OR [95% CI], 1.55 [1.01-2.37]; P<0.05; some college: OR [95% CI],
   1.56 [1.09-2.21]; P<0.05) were most consistently associated with
   intima-media thickness and plaque, respectively, controlling for risk
   factors.
   Conclusions The findings indicate the importance of targeting
   economically disadvantaged women in efforts to prevent cardiovascular
   disease among women.

   (candidates) position in the social structure and the consecration of
   their creative work by relevant audiences. We argue that the outcome of
   this process of evaluation in any cultural field, whether in art or
   science, is a function of (1) candidates' embeddedness within the field,
   and (2) the type of audience-that is, peers versus critics-evaluating
   candidates' work. Specifically, we hypothesize that peers are more
   likely to favor candidates who are highly embedded in the field, whereas
   critics will not show such favoritism. We find support for these

AB Atypical moral development is associated with antisocial behavior, but
   the neural systems required for moral development are unclear.
   Taber-Thomas, Asp et al. study patients with ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex lesions acquired during development, and find that such lesions
   result in arrested moral development, as revealed by an increase in
   self-interested morality.Learning to make moral judgements based on
   considerations beyond self-interest is a fundamental aspect of moral
   development. A deficit in such learning is associated with poor
   socialization and criminal behaviour. The neural systems required for
   the acquisition and maturation of moral competency are not well
   understood. Here we show in a unique sample of neurological patients
   that focal lesions involving ventromedial prefrontal cortex, acquired
   during development, result in an abnormally egocentric pattern of moral
   judgement. In response to simple hypothetical moral scenarios, the
   patients were more likely than comparison participants to endorse
   self-interested actions that involved breaking moral rules or physically
   harming others in order to benefit themselves. This pattern (which we
   also found in subjects with psychopathy) differs from that of patients
   with adult-onset ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions-the latter group
   showed normal rejection of egocentric rule violations. This novel
   contrast of patients with ventromedial prefrontal cortex lesions
   acquired during development versus during adulthood yields new evidence
   suggesting that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is a critical neural
   substrate for the acquisition and maturation of moral competency that
   goes beyond self-interest to consider the welfare of others. Disruption
   to this affective neural system early in life interrupts moral
   development.

AB Unwarranted breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy dose reductions have

   characterize factors associated with first cycle chemotherapy dose
   selection in a multi-ethnic sample of low-income women receiving
   chemotherapy through the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention Treatment
   Program (BCCPT) and to investigate the impact of Hispanic ethnicity and
   patient self-efficacy on adjuvant chemotherapy dose selection. Survey
   and chemotherapy information were obtained from consenting participants
   enrolled in the California BCCPT. Analyses identified clinical and
   non-clinical factors associated with first cycle chemotherapy doses less
   than 90 % of expected doses. Of 552 patients who received chemotherapy,
   397 (72 %) were eligible for inclusion. First cycle dose reductions were
   given to 14 % of the sample. In multivariate analyses, increasing body
   mass index and non-academic treatment site were associated with doses
   below 90 % of the expected doses. No other clinical or non-clinical
   factors, including ethnicity, were associated with first cycle doses
   selection. In this universally low-income sample, we identified no
   association between Hispanic ethnicity and other non-clinical patient
   factors, including patient self-efficacy, in chemotherapy dose
   selection. As seen in other studies, obesity was associated with
   systematic dose limits. The guidelines on chemotherapy dose selection in
   the obese may help address such dose reductions. A greater understanding
   of the association between type of treatment site and dose selection is
   warranted. Overall, access to adequate health care allows the vast
   majority of low-income women with breast cancer to receive high-quality
   breast cancer chemotherapy.

   practices, even as they decenter and suspend the semantic and pragmatic
   norms of such terms. Through such suspensions, forms of youth sociality
   and identity are performed. Such sociality and identity turn on the
   ability of tropes on cross-kin terms to distance their users from
   various hierarchies that youth associate with traditional adult
   respectability and propriety. At the same time, such practices inscribe
   new hierarchies of college year, region, class, and gender. The paper
   then turns to how such kinship appropriations and suspensions are linked
   to changing conceptions of kinship and practices of cross-kin marriage.
   The spread of such terms among college youth has gone along with a
   tendency among the upwardly mobile and urban to avoid using such terms
   within their kin groups and to avoid such marriages. The paper concludes
   with reflections on the interplay between normative and tropic kinship,
   arguing that focusing on the dialectics between kinship semantics and
   pragmatics, norm and trope, resolves certain impasses in the study of
   kinship.

AB Few studies exist of allomaternal nursing in humans. It is relatively
   common among some cultures, such as the Aka and Efee hunter-gatherers of
   the Congo Basin, but it does not occur in other foragers such as the
   !Kung and Hadza of Southern and East Africa. This paper utilizes focal
   follow observations of Aka and Efee infants, interviews with Aka
   mothers, ethnographic reports from researchers working with
   hunter-gatherers, and a survey of the eHRAF cultures to try to answer
   the following questions: how often does allomaternal nursing occur, who
   provides it, and under what contexts does it take place? The study
   indicates that it occurs in many cultures (93% of cultures with data)
   but that it is normative in relatively few cultures; biological kin,
   especially grandmothers, frequently provide allomaternal nursing and
   that infant age, mother''s condition, and culture (e.g., cultural models
   about if and when women other than the mother can nurse an infant or
   colostrum taboos) impact the nature and frequency of allomaternal
   nursing. The empirical results of this exploratory study are discussed
   in the context of existing hypotheses used to explain allomaternal
   nursing.

AB Ecosystems may undergo nonlinear responses to stresses or perturbations.
   Hence there can be more than one stable state or regime. It is not known
   whether alternate regimes also occur in coupled social-ecologica-l
   systems, in which there is the potential for intricate feedbacks between
   natural and social processes. To find out, we investigated the
   management of rice paddies by Balinese farmers, where ecological
   processes impose constraints on the timing and spatial scale of
   collective action. We investigated responses to environmental and social
   conditions by eight traditional community irrigation systems (subaks)
   along a river in Bali to test the intuition that older and more
   demographically stable subaks function differently than those with less
   stable populations. Results confirm the existence of two attractors,
   with sharply contrasting patterns of social and ecological interactions.
   The transition pathway between the two basins of attraction is dominated
   by differences in the efficacy of sanctions and the ability of subaks to
   mobilize agricultural labor.

AB Objective: We sought to evaluate the validity of the Spanish language
   version of the patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) depression scale
   in a large sample of pregnant Peruvian women using Rasch item response
   theory (IRT) approaches. We further sought to examine the
   appropriateness of the response formats, reliability and potential
   differential item functioning (Din by maternal age, educational
   attainment and employment status.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 1520 pregnant
   women in Lima, Peru. A structured interview was used to collect
   information on demographic characteristics and PHQ-9 items. Data from
   the PHQ-9 were fitted to the Rasch IRT model and tested for appropriate
   category ordering, the assumptions of unidimensionality and local
   independence, item fit, reliability and presence of DIF.
   Results: The Spanish language version of PHQ-9 demonstrated
   unidimensionality, local independence, and acceptable fit for the Rasch
   IRT model. However, we detected disordered response categories for the
   original four response categories. After collapsing "more than half the
   days" and "nearly every day", the response categories ordered properly
   and the PHQ-9 fit the Rasch IRT model. The PHQ-9 had moderate internal
   consistency (person separation index, PSI =0.72). Additionally, the
   items of PHQ-9 were free of DIF with regard to age, educational
   attainment, and employment status.
   Conclusions: The Spanish language version of the PHQ-9 was shown to have
   item properties of an effective screening instrument. Collapsing rating
   scale categories and reconstructing three-point Likert scale for all
   items improved the fit of the instrument. Future studies are warranted
   to establish new cutoff scores and criterion validity of the three-point
   Liked scale response options for the Spanish language version of the
   PHQ-9. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved

AB The effects of land use policy and socioeconomic changes on urban
   landscape dynamics have been increasingly investigated around the world,
   but our knowledge of the underlying processes of these effects is still
   inadequate for sustainably managing urban ecosystems. Thus, the main
   goal of this study was to understand: (1) the changes in urban
   landscape, population, and economic conditions over a 36-year period,
   and (2) the coupled dynamics of land use policy, landscape structure,
   major demographic features, and three kinds of industries in one of the
   most dazzling modern cities of China-the Shenzhen special economic zone
   (SEZ). The landscape expansion index was used to explore the
   developed-land expansion under different land use policies while
   structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze the relationship
   among three variables (Land Cover Change or LCC, Economy, and
   Population). We found that the urban expansion during the four periods
   (1973-1979, 1979-1995, 1995-2003, and 2003-2009) was not always at the
   expense of urban vegetation cover. The importance of each socioeconomic
   driver during the four periods was not consistent over time, with policy
   shifts as the primary driver. Our SEM showed that Economy played a more
   important role than Population in driving LCC in the Shenzhen SEZ.
   Meanwhile, the secondary and tertiary industries had a stronger
   influence than the primary industry; and the floating population had a
   greater effect than the registered permanent population.

AB Several theories have emerged to explain how group cooperation
   (collective action) can arise and be maintained in the face of
   incentives to engage in free riding. Explanations focusing on
   reputational benefits and partner choice have particular promise for
   cases in which punishment is absent or insufficient to deter free
   riding. In indigenous communities of highland Peru, collective action is
   pervasive and provides critical benefits. Participation in collective
   action is unequal across households, but all households share its
   benefits. Importantly, investment in collective action involves
   considerable time, energy, and risk. Differential participation in
   collective action can convey information about qualities of fellow
   community members that are not easily observable otherwise, such as
   cooperative intent, knowledge, work ethic, skill, and/or physical
   vitality. Conveying such information may enhance access to adaptive
   support networks. Interview and observational data collected in a
   Peruvian highland community indicate that persons who contributed more
   to collective action had greater reputations as reliable, hard workers
   with regard to collective action and also were considered the most
   respected, influential, and generous people in the community.
   Additionally, household heads with greater reputations had more social
   support partners (measured as network indegree centrality), and
   households with larger support networks experienced fewer illness
   symptoms.

AB Background
   Promoting communication among African American men who have sex with men
   (AA MSM) and their social networks about HIV testing is an avenue for
   altering HIV prevention social norms. This study examined the attitudes
   of AA MSM on talking with peers about HIV testing and characteristics of
   their network members with whom they have these conversations.
   Methods
   Data came from a cross-sectional survey of 226 AA MSM who were 18 years
   or older and self-reported sex with another male in the prior 90 days.
   Participants completed an inventory to characterize network members with
   whom they had conversations about HIV testing and HIV status.
   Results
   Most of the sample reported that it was important/very important to talk
   to male friends about HIV (85%) and that they were comfortable/very
   comfortable talking with their friends about sexual behaviors (84%).
   However, a small proportion of the social network had been talked to by
   the participant about HIV testing (14%). Among sexual networks, 58% had
   been talked to about their HIV status, and this was positively
   associated with main and casual partner type compared with partners with
   whom money or drugs were exchanged.
   Conclusions
   Findings suggest that positive attitudes about communication may be
   necessary but not sufficient for actual conversations to occur.
   Designing interventions that increase communication with social networks
   is warranted.

AB Urban forest management is being increasingly recognized as a viable
   policy vehicle for improving community health, sustainable development,
   and well-being for city dwellers. To improve our understanding of public
   concern for the local urban forest, a theoretical framework employing
   concepts traditionally explored in social-psychological and
   environmental concern studies was tested using data from a public
   opinion survey of 800 homeowners living in a major urban area in
   Southern Appalachia, USA. Publicly available geographic information
   system (GIS) data were analyzed to measure tree canopy density around
   survey respondents' properties. Structural equation modeling was used to
   test the validity of the hypothesized relationships among the
   survey-derived constructs and the spatial data as predictors of public
   support for urban forest protection policy. The results suggest that
   homeowners living around urban trees place greater importance on various
   attributes of trees, and that tree knowledge and experience are
   indirectly and positively related to support for urban forest
   protection.

AB Prayer is often used to cope with racism-related stress. Little is known
   about its impact on cardiovascular function.
   This study examined how prayer coping relates to cardiovascular
   reactivity (CVR), post-stress recovery, and affective reactivity in
   response to racism-related stress.
   African American women (n = 81; mean age=20 years) reported their use of
   prayer coping on the Perceived Racism Scale and completed anger recall
   and racism recall tasks while undergoing monitoring of systolic and
   diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate, heart rate variability
   (HRV), and hemodynamic measures. Prayer coping was examined for
   associations with CVR, recovery, and affective change scores using
   general linear models with repeated measures.
   Higher prayer coping was associated with decreased state stress and DBP
   reactivity during racism recall (p's < 0.05) and with decreased DBP and
   increased HRV during racism recall recovery(p's < 0.05).
   Coping with racism by utilizing prayer may have cardiovascular benefits

AB BACKGROUNDTo ensure that National Institutes of Health-funded research
   is relevant to the population's needs, specific emphasis on proportional
   representation of minority/sex groups into National Cancer Institute
   (NCI) cancer centers' clinical research programs is reported to the NCI.
   METHODSEMPaCT investigators at 5 regionally diverse comprehensive cancer
   centers compared data reported to the NCI for their most recent Cancer
   Center Support Grant competitive renewal to assess and compare the
   centers' catchment area designations, data definitions, data elements,
   collection processes, reporting, and performance regarding proportional
   representation of race/ethnicity and sex subsets.
   RESULTSCancer centers' catchment area definitions differed widely in
   terms of their cancer patient versus general population specificity,
   levels of specificity, and geographic coverage. Racial/ethnic categories
   were similar, yet were defined differently, across institutions.
   Patients' socioeconomic status and insurance status were inconsistently
   captured across the 5 centers.
   CONCLUSIONSCatchment area definitions and the collection of
   patient-level demographic factors varied widely across the 5
   comprehensive cancer centers. This challenged the assessment of success
   by cancer centers in accruing representative populations into the cancer
   research enterprise. Accrual of minorities was less than desired for at
   least 1 racial/ethnic subcategory at 4 of the 5 centers. Institutions
   should clearly and consistently declare their primary catchment area and
   the rationale and should report how race/ethnicity and sex are defined,
   determined, collected, and reported. More standardized, frequent,
   consistent collection, reporting, and review of these data are
   recommended, as is a commitment to collecting socioeconomic data, given
   that socioeconomic status is a primary driver of cancer disparities in
   the United States. Cancer 2014;120(7 suppl):1113-21. (c) 2014 American
   Cancer Society.
   For the 5 regionally diverse comprehensive cancer centers surveyed,
   racial/ethnic categories are similar, yet are defined differently,
   across institutions. Patient-level factors are defined and reported
   differently across centers, and catchment area definitions may not be
   reflective of minority cancer cases.

AB The college hookup scene is a profoundly gendered and heteronormative
   sexual field. Yet the party and bar scene that gives rise to hookups
   also fosters the practice of women kissing other women in public,
   generally to the enjoyment of male onlookers, and sometimes facilitates
   threesomes involving same-sex sexual behavior between women. In this
   article, we argue that the hookup scene serves as an opportunity
   structure to explore same-sex attractions and, at least for some women,
   to later verify bisexual, lesbian, or queer sexual identities. Based on
   quantitative and qualitative data and combining queer theory and
   identity theory, we offer a new interpretation of women's same-sex
   practices in the hookup culture. Our analysis contributes to gender
   theory by demonstrating the utility of identity theory for understanding
   how non-normative gender and sexual identities are negotiated within
   heteronormatively structured fields.

   linkages in a case study of the Lake St. Clair (LSC) region, part of the
   Laurentian Great Lakes system. Our research phases included: (1)
   investigating and revising existing coupled human and natural systems
   frameworks to develop a framework for this case study; (2) testing and
   refining the framework by hosting a 1-day stakeholder workshop and (3)
   creating a causal loop diagram (CLD) to illustrate the relationships
   among the systems' key components. With stakeholder assistance, we
   identified four interrelated pathways that include water use and
   discharge, land use, tourism and shipping that impact the ecological
   condition of LSC. The interrelationships between the pathways of water
   use and tourism are further illustrated by a CLD with several feedback
   loops. We suggest that this holistic approach can be applied to other
   case studies and inspire the development of dynamic models capable of
   informing decision making for sustainability.

   present data on local perceptions of TEK change from three communities
   on Malekula Island in Vanuatu. Utilizing a structured interview (n =
   120), we find a common perception of TEK loss. Participants defined two
   key periods of TEK erosion (roughly 1940-1960 and 1980-present), and
   noted that TEK decline was driven both external (e.g., church) and
   internal (e.g., shifting values) processes. Erosion was perceived to
   more comprehensive in the worldview domain than in aspects of
   ethnobiological knowledge and practice. These data indicate the
   perceived fragility of TEK systems and the complexity of TEK change. TEK
   systems are critical to natural resource management, and data such as
   these will assist in designing nuanced responses to the ongoing loss of
   cultural knowledge and practice.

   < 0.001 and OR: 0.68, P < 0.001, respectively). High school completion,
   median income, insurance status, family medicine physician density, and
   internist density in one's area of residence were not associated with
   odds of thick versus thin NM. In contrast to other types of melanoma, NM
   thickness at diagnosis is not associated with the socioeconomic
   environment in one's area of residence. Instead, it is related to
   factors associated with incidental or formal detection. This information
   should be used to better target melanoma education and early detection
   programs.

AB In the 1980s, an anti-drunk-driving movement emerged, seemingly out of
   nowhere. How is it that this movement could flourish and have such
   dramatic effects? More significantly, how has Mothers Against Drunk
   Driving continued to flourish even today? In this article, I demonstrate
   that more than a strong organizational basis, the right historical
   context, and the appropriate management of material and symbolic
   resources, the continuing success of Mothers Against Drunk Driving and
   drunk driving depends on Mothers Against Drunk Driving's ability to
   evoke intense emotions and fears surrounding drunk driving. Generalizing
   from Alexander et al.'s cultural trauma theory, I introduce two
   concepts: perpetual trauma and the trauma organization. Perpetual trauma
   is based on potentiality, a sense of future danger, and iconic
   victims/perpetrators. Beyond an improved understanding of Mothers
   Against Drunk Driving and drunk driving, perpetual trauma theory offers
   a sociological explanation for how individuals and societies understand
   their deepest fears and emotions in postmodern society.

AB The largest in-depth cross-cultural study of the 20th Century, directed
   by psychologist Charles Osgood at the University of Illinois,
   demonstrated that the affective meanings of concepts vary along three
   dimensions within all 30 cultures considered in the project, and for
   individuals responding in more than 21 languages. I analyze data on 17
   cultures from this project in order to get some insights on how cultures
   differ in their sentiments and how sentiments about some concepts vary
   across cultures. An affective map of the cultures derived with
   multi-dimensional scaling revealed that affective similarities and
   differences among cultures cannot be explained in terms of geography,
   nationality, or major religions. Underlying dimensions of the affective
   map perhaps relate to secularization and to a history of
   slavery/colonization. Meanwhile, sentiments about most concepts are
   remarkably similar across cultures, compared to the divergences of
   sentiments about different concepts. Thus, ubiquitous breakdowns in
   inter-cultural understandings must emerge from relatively small
   variations in feelings, or from issues where there are major differences
   in sentiments across cultures.

AB Human interaction dynamics are known to play an important role in the
   development of robust pedestrian trackers that are needed for a variety
   of applications in video surveillance. Traditional approaches to
   pedestrian tracking assume that each pedestrian walks independently and
   the tracker predicts the location based on an underlying motion model,
   such as a constant velocity or autoregressive model. Recent approaches
   have begun to leverage interaction, especially by modeling the repulsion
   forces among pedestrians to improve motion predictions. However, human
   interaction is more complex and is influenced by multiple social
   effects. This motivates the use of a more complex human interaction
   model for pedestrian tracking. In this paper, we propose a novel human
   tracking method by modeling complex social interactions. We present an
   algorithm that decomposes social interactions into multiple potential
   interaction modes. We integrate these multiple social interaction modes
   into an interactive Markov Chain Monte Carlo tracker and demonstrate how
   the developed method translates into a more informed motion prediction,
   resulting in robust tracking performance. We test our method on videos
   from unconstrained outdoor environments and evaluate it against common
   multi-object trackers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: A suboptimal level of seasonal influenza vaccination among
   pregnant minority women is an intractable public health problem,
   requiring effective message resonance with this population. We evaluated
   the effects of randomized exposure to messages which emphasize positive
   outcomes of vaccination ("gain-frame"), or messages which emphasize
   negative outcomes of forgoing vaccination ("loss-frame"). We also
   assessed multilevel social and community factors that influence maternal
   immunization among racially and ethnically diverse populations.
   Study design: Minority pregnant women in metropolitan Atlanta were
   enrolled in the longitudinal study and randomized to receive
   intervention or control messages. A postpartum questionnaire
   administered 30 days postpartum evaluated immunization outcomes
   following baseline message exposure among the study population. We
   evaluated key outcomes using bivariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: Neither gain- [OR = 0.5176, (95% CI: 0.203,1.322)] nor
   loss-framed [OR = 0.5000, 95% CI: (0.192,1.304)] messages were
   significantly associated with increased likelihood of immunization
   during pregnancy. Significant correlates of seasonal influenza
   immunization during pregnancy included healthcare provider
   recommendation [OR= 3.934, 95% CI: (1.331,11.627)], use of
   hospital-based practices as primary source of prenatal care [OR= 2.584,
   95% CI: (1.091,6.122)], and perceived interpersonal support for
   influenza immunization [OR= 3.405, 95% CI: (1.412,8.212)].
   Conclusion: Dissemination of vaccine education messages via healthcare
   providers, and cultivating support from social networks, will improve
   seasonal influenza immunization among pregnant minority women. (C) 2014

AB Scientists have increasingly turned to the brain and to neuroscience
   more generally to further an understanding of social and emotional
   judgments and behavior. Yet, many neuroscientists(certainly not all) do
   not consider the role of relational context. Moreover, most have not
   examined the impact of relational context in a manner that takes
   advantage of conceptual and empirical advances in relationship science.
   Here we emphasize that: (1) all social behavior takes place, by
   definition, within the context of a relationship (even if that
   relationship is a new one with a stranger), and (2) relational context
   shapes not only social thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, but also some
   seemingly non-social thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in profound ways.
   We define relational context and suggest that accounting for it in the
   design and interpretation of neuroscience research is essential to the
   development of a coherent, generalizable neuroscience of social
   behavior. We make our case in two ways: (a) we describe some existing
   neuroscience research in three substantive areas(perceiving and reacting
   to others' emotions, providing help, and receiving help) that already
   has documented the powerful impact of relational context. (b) We
   describe some other neuroscience research from these same areas that has
   not taken relational context into account. Then, using findings from
   social and personality psychology, we make a case that different results
   almost certainly would have been found had the research been conducted
   in a different relational context. We neither attempt to review all
   evidence that relational context shapes neuroscience findings nor to put
   forward a theoretical analysis of all the ways relational context ought
   to shape neuroscience findings. Our goal is simply to urge greater and
   more systematic consideration of relational context in neuroscientific
   research.

AB We explored the social-signaling hypothesis that variability in
   exogenous pain sensitivities across the menstrual cycle is moderated by
   women's current romantic relationship status and hence the availability
   of a solicitous social partner for expressing pain behaviors in regular,
   isochronal ways. In two studies, we used the menstrual calendars of
   healthy women to provide a detailed approximation of the women's
   probability of conception based on their current cycle-day, along with
   relationship status, and cold pressor pain and ischemic pain
   sensitivities, respectively. In the first study (n = 135; 18-46 yrs.,
   M-age = 23 yrs., 50% natural cycling), we found that naturally-cycling,
   pair-bonded women showed a positive correlation between the probability
   of conception and ischemic pain intensity (r = .45), associations not
   found for single women or hormonal contraceptive-users. A second study
   (n = 107; 19-29 yrs., M-age = 20 yrs., 56% natural cycling) showed a
   similar association between greater conception risk and higher
   cold-pressor pain intensity in naturally-cycling, pair-bonded women only
   (r = .63). The findings show that variability in exogenous pain
   sensitivities across different fertility phases of the menstrual cycle
   is contingent on basic elements of women's social environment and
   inversely correspond to variability in naturally occurring,
   perimenstrual symptoms. These findings have wide-ranging implications
   for: a) standardizing pain measurement protocols; b) understanding basic
   biopsychosocial pain-related processes; c) addressing clinical pain
   experiences in women; and d) understanding how pain influences, and is
   influenced by, social relationships.

AB BACKGROUNDThis study examined racial/ethnic differences among patients
   in clinical trial (CT) enrollment, refusal rates, ineligibility, and
   desire to participate in research within the National Cancer Institute's
   Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) Clinical Trial Screening and
   Accrual Log.
   METHODSData from 4509 log entries were evaluated in this study. Four
   logistic regression models were run using physical/medical conditions,
   enrollment into a CT, patient eligible but declined a CT, and no desire
   to participate in research as dependent variables.
   RESULTSAge65 years (OR=1.51, 95% CI=1.28-1.79), males (OR=2.28, 95%
   CI=1.92-2.71), and non-Hispanic black race (OR=1.53, 95% CI=1.2-1.96)
   were significantly associated with more physical/medical conditions.
   Age65 years was significantly associated with lower CT enrollment
   (OR=0.83, 95% CI=0.7-0.98). Males (OR=0.78, 95% CI=0.65-0.94) and a
   higher grade level score for consent form readability (OR=0.9, 95%
   CI=0.83-0.97) were significantly associated with lower refusal rates.
   Consent page length20 was significantly associated with lower odds of no
   desire to participate in research among CT decliners (OR=0.75, 95%
   CI=0.58-0.98).
   CONCLUSIONSThere were no racial/ethnic differences in CT enrollment,
   refusal rates, or no desire to participate in research as the reason
   given for CT refusal. Higher odds of physical/medical conditions were
   associated with older age, males, and non-Hispanic blacks. Better
   management of physical/medical conditions before and during treatment
   may increase the pool of eligible patients for CTs. Future work should
   examine the role of comorbidities, sex, age, and consent form
   characteristics on CT participation. Cancer 2014;120:877-884. (c) 2013

AB BACKGROUNDAdherence to guidelines for surveillance mammography and
   clinic visits is an important component of breast cancer survivorship
   care. Identifying ethnic disparities in adherence may lead to improved
   care delivery and outcomes.
   METHODSRecords were evaluated for 4535 patients who were treated for
   stage I, II, or III breast cancer at the University of Texas MD Anderson
   Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, cancer center between January 1997 and
   December 2006. Generalized estimating equations and Cox proportional
   hazards analyses were used to evaluate ethnic differences in missed
   mammograms and clinic visits up to 4 years of follow-up and the impact
   of those differences on overall survival.
   RESULTSNonadherence to guidelines for mammography (P=.0002) and clinic
   visits (P<.0001) increased over time. Hispanic and black patients were
   more likely to be nonadherent to guidelines for mammography (odds ratio
   [OR]=1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.10-1.65; OR=1.36, 95%
   CI=1.11-1.66, respectively) and clinic visits (OR=1.62, 95%
   CI=1.27-2.06; OR=1.45, 95% CI=1.13-1.86, respectively) than white
   patients. There was an interaction between Hispanic ethnicity and
   endocrine therapy on nonadherence to mammography guidelines (P=.001).
   Nonadherence to mammography and clinic visit guidelines was not
   associated with overall survival.
   CONCLUSIONSWithdrawal from breast cancer survivorship care increases
   over time, and black and Hispanic patients are more likely to be
   nonadherent. An understanding of the reasons for ethnic disparities in
   adherence to guidelines for mammography and clinic visits is needed to
   improve retention in survivorship care. Cancer 2014;120:894-900. (c)
   2013 American Cancer Society.
   Ethnic disparities exist in adherence to breast cancer survivorship
   care. Health promotion interventions specifically targeted to minority
   breast cancer patients and patients not receiving adjuvant endocrine
   therapy are needed to improve patient retention in survivorship care.

AB The effect of intergroup contact has long been a question central to
   social scientists. As political and technological changes bring
   increased international migration, understanding intergroup contact is
   increasingly important to scientific and policy debates. Unfortunately,
   limitations in causal inference using observational data and the
   practical inability to experimentally manipulate demographic diversity
   has limited scholars' ability to address the effects of intergroup
   contact. Here, I report the results of a randomized controlled trial
   testing the causal effects of repeated intergroup contact, in which
   Spanish-speaking confederates were randomly assigned to be inserted, for
   a period of days, into the daily routines of unknowing Anglo-whites
   living in homogeneous communities in the United States, thus simulating
   the conditions of demographic change. The result of this experiment is a
   significant shift toward exclusionary attitudes among treated subjects.
   This experiment demonstrates that even very minor demographic change
   causes strong exclusionary reactions. Developed nations and politically
   liberal subnational units are expected to experience a politically
   conservative shift as international migration brings increased
   intergroup contact.

AB Contagion is a form of magical thinking in which people believe that a
   person's immaterial qualities or essence can be transferred to an object
   through physical contact. Here we investigate how a belief in contagion
   influences the sale of celebrity memorabilia. Using data from three
   high-profile estate auctions, we find that people's expectations about
   the amount of physical contact between the object and the celebrity
   positively predicts the final bids for items that belonged to well-liked
   individuals (e. g., John F. Kennedy) and negatively predicts final bids
   for items that belonged to disliked individuals (e. g., Bernard Madoff).
   A follow-up experiment further suggests that these effects are driven by
   contagion beliefs: when asked to bid on a sweater owned by a well-liked
   celebrity, participants report that they would pay substantially less if
   it was sterilized before they received it. However, sterilization
   increases the amount they would pay for a sweater owned by a disliked
   celebrity. These studies suggest that magical thinking may still have
   effects in contemporary Western societies and they provide some unique
   demonstrations of contagion effects on real-world purchase decisions.

AB Cultural competence is a vital component of many missions in today's
   military. Cultural competence enables one to further a mission, save
   resources, and save lives. Conversely, a lack of cultural competence may
   bring about challenges to mission completion, requirement for more
   resources, waste of resources, and destruction of lives. Cultural
   competence involves many components. One particular component is
   cultural heritage awareness and protection of cultural property. This
   study sought to assess current understanding of cultural property
   protection and determine the effectiveness of a training aimed at
   increasing cultural property protection awareness, knowledge, and
   comfort within the military setting. It was hypothesized that
   participants would vary in their level of awareness, knowledge, and
   comfort of cultural property protection, and that all would show a
   significant improvement in knowledge scores post training. Factors such
   as deployment experience were examined for potential correlation with
   measures such as awareness. A 14 question pre-read survey was developed
   to assess participants' demographics, awareness, knowledge, and comfort
   with cultural property protection. Awareness included value, laws, and
   procedures while knowledge examined "know how" such as how to bed down
   in a protected structure or communicate information about the structure.
   Comfort assessed one's comfort with engaging in the knowledge based
   tasks. A 24 question post read survey was administered to assess
   awareness, knowledge, and comfort, and to solicit additional feedback on
   the manual itself. The survey utilized a 1-5 rating scale with 1
   representing no awareness, knowledge, or comfort and 5 representing
   absolute awareness, knowledge, and comfort with different aspects of
   cultural property protection. Cultural property protection value was
   highest pre and post training while knowledge regarding recovery of
   property was rated lowest pre and post training. Results are encouraging
   for the pursuit of cultural property education. Further studies should
   include knowledge assessment versus self rating as well as tracking of
   incidents and outcomes in the field. Implications for mission readiness
   and success are discussed.

   field of global leadership research by identifying and measuring
   proximal attributes and leadership criteria as suggested by Zaccaro's
   trait-based leadership model (American Psychologist 62: 6-16, 2007).
   Only global leaders were included in the study - CEO's, General
   Managers, Function Heads, or those with Profit and Loss responsibility
   for their businesses. These 1867 leaders of 13 nationalities were
   engaged in leading people across cultures - either on international
   assignment or working from their home base. A set of six intercultural
   competencies and three criteria of global leadership success were
   identified and compared across nationalities. The competencies were
   measured and used to predict success over time. Applications are
   discussed in terms of global leadership assessment and development.

AB Introduction: Understanding the social determinants of child health is a
   prominent area of research. This paper examines the measurement of
   socioeconomic position in a sample of families of children with cancer.
   Socioeconomic position is difficult to measure in pediatric health
   research due to sensitivity of asking about finances when research is
   conducted in health care delivery settings, financial volatility
   associated with periods of pediatric illness, and difficulty recruiting
   fathers to research.
   Methods: Caregivers of children with cancer (n = 76) completed a
   questionnaire that included the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social
   Status (SSS). SSS was measured using two 10-rung ladders with differing
   referent groups: the US and respondents' communities. Respondents placed
   themselves on each ladder by placing an X on the rung that represented
   their social position in relation to the two referent groups.
   Individuals' SSS ratings and discrepancies in SSS ratings within couples
   were examined, and associations with objective social status measures
   were evaluated using Pearson correlations or t-tests.
   Results: Parents' placement on the US and community ladders was
   positively associated with their income, education, wealth, household
   savings, and household savings minus debt. On average, respondents
   placed themselves higher on the US ladder compared to the community
   ladder. There was an average intra-couple discrepancy of 1.25 rungs in
   partner's placements on the US ladder and a 1.56 rung difference for the
   community ladder. This intra-couple discrepancy was not associated with
   gender.
   Discussion: Results offer insight into the use of subjective social
   status measures to capture a more holistic assessment of socioeconomic
   position and the measurement of socioeconomic position in two-parent
   families.

AB IMPORTANCE Youth in high-poverty neighborhoods have high rates of
   emotional problems. Understanding neighborhood influences on mental
   health is crucial for designing neighborhood-level interventions.
   OBJECTIVE To perform an exploratory analysis of associations between
   housing mobility interventions for children in high-poverty
   neighborhoods and subsequent mental disorders during adolescence.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Moving to Opportunity
   Demonstration from 1994 to 1998 randomized 4604 volunteer public housing
   families with 3689 children in high-poverty neighborhoods into 1 of 2
   housing mobility intervention groups (a low-poverty voucher group vs a
   traditional voucher group) or a control group. The low-poverty voucher
   group (n=1430) received vouchers to move to low-poverty neighborhoods
   with enhanced mobility counseling. The traditional voucher group
   (n=1081) received geographically unrestricted vouchers. Controls
   (n=1178) received no intervention. Follow-up evaluation was performed 10
   to 15 years later (June 2008-April 2010) with participants aged 13 to 19
   years (0-8 years at randomization). Response rates were 86.9% to 92.9%.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Presence of mental disorders from the
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
   within the past 12 months, including major depressive disorder, panic
   disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), oppositional-defiant
   disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, and conduct disorder, as
   assessed post hoc with a validated diagnostic interview.
   RESULTS Of the 3689 adolescents randomized, 2872 were interviewed (1407
   boys and 1465 girls). Compared with the control group, boys in the
   low-poverty voucher group had significantly increased rates of major
   depression (7.1% vs 3.5%; odds ratio (OR), 2.2 [95% CI, 1.2-3.9]), PTSD
   (6.2% vs 1.9%; OR, 3.4 [95% CI, 1.6-7.4]), and conduct disorder (6.4% vs
   2.1%; OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 1.7-5.8]). Boys in the traditional voucher group
   had increased rates of PTSD compared with the control group (4.9% vs
   1.9%, OR, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.2-5.8]). However, compared with the control
   group, girls in the traditional voucher group had decreased rates of
   major depression (6.5% vs 10.9%; OR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.3-0.9]) and conduct
   disorder (0.3% vs 2.9%; OR, 0.1 [95% CI, 0.0-0.4]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Interventions to encourage moving out of
   high-poverty neighborhoods were associated with increased rates of
   depression, PTSD, and conduct disorder among boys and reduced rates of
   depression and conduct disorder among girls. Better understanding of
   interactions among individual, family, and neighborhood risk factors is
   needed to guide future public housing policy changes.

AB Objectives: School-based sex education is a cornerstone of HIV
   prevention for adolescents who continue to bear a disproportionally high
   HIV burden globally. We systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the
   existing evidence for school-based sex education interventions in
   low-and middle-income countries to determine the efficacy of these
   interventions in changing HIV-related knowledge and risk behaviors.
   Methods: We searched five electronic databases, PubMed, Embase,
   PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Sociological Abstracts, for eligible articles. We
   also conducted hand-searching of key journals and secondary reference
   searching of included articles to identify potential studies.
   Intervention effects were synthesized through random effects
   meta-analysis for five outcomes: HIV knowledge, self-efficacy, sexual
   debut, condom use, and number of sexual partners.
   Results: Of 6191 unique citations initially identified, 64 studies in 63
   articles were included in the review. Nine interventions either focused
   exclusively on abstinence (abstinence-only) or emphasized abstinence
   (abstinence-plus), whereas the remaining 55 interventions provided
   comprehensive sex education. Thirty-three studies were able to be
   meta-analyzed across five HIV-related outcomes. Results from
   meta-analysis demonstrate that school-based sex education is an
   effective strategy for reducing HIV-related risk. Students who received
   school-based sex education interventions had significantly greater HIV
   knowledge (Hedges g = 0.63, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.49-0.78,
   p<0.001), self-efficacy related to refusing sex or condom use (Hedges g
   = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.14-0.36, p<0.001), condom use (OR = 1.34, 95% CI:
   1.18-1.52, p<0.001), fewer sexual partners (OR = 0.75, 95% CI:
   0.67-0.84, p<0.001) and less initiation of first sex during follow-up
   (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.83, p<0.001).
   Conclusions: The paucity of abstinence-only or abstinence-plus
   interventions identified during the review made comparisons between the
   predominant comprehensive and less common abstinence-focused programs
   difficult. Comprehensive school-based sex education interventions
   adapted from effective programs and those involving a range of
   school-based and community-based components had the largest impact on
   changing HIV-related behaviors.

AB Cash transfer programs seek to alter structural determinants of HIV risk
   such as poverty and gender inequality. We sought to explore the
   feasibility and potential effectiveness of a cash transfer intervention
   for young women as part of combination HIV prevention in Iringa,
   Tanzania. Qualitative, in-depth interviews were conducted with 116
   stakeholders and residents from the region, including key informants,
   service delivery users, and members of key populations. Most respondents
   felt a cash transfer program would assist young women in Iringa to have
   more control over sexual decision-making and reduce poverty-driven
   transactional sex. Respondents were divided on who should receive funds:
   young women themselves, their parents/guardians, or community leaders.
   Cash amounts and suggested target groups varied, and several respondents
   suggested providing microcredit or small business capital instead of
   cash. Potential concerns included jealousy, dependency, and corruption.
   However, most respondents felt that some intervention was needed to
   address underlying poverty driving some sexual risk behavior. A cash
   transfer program could fill this role, ultimately reducing HIV, sexually
   transmitted infections, and unintended pregnancies. As increased
   attention is given to economic and structural interventions for HIV
   prevention, local input and knowledge should be considered in a program
   design.

AB Approximately 2.4 million people in India are living with HIV. Gender
   inequality affects HIV prevention, detection, and management. The
   purpose of this paper was to describe gender differences in the
   experience of living with HIV in Bengaluru, India. A subsample of n =
   313 (159 men and 154 women) from a larger cohort was used for these
   analyses. Participants were recruited through AIDS service
   organizations. They completed an interviewer-administered survey
   assessing HIV testing experience, types of stigma, and perceived
   consequences of stigmatization. The majority of men (67%) reported
   getting HIV tested because of illness, while women were more likely to
   be tested after learning their spouse's HIV-positive status (42%). More
   men (59%) than women (45%, p<0.05) were tested in private care settings.
   Men reported significantly higher mean levels of internalized stigma
   (men: M=0.71, SD = 0.63; women: M=0.46, SD = 0.55; p<0.001), whereas the
   women reported significantly higher scores for enacted stigma (men:
   M=1.30, SD = 1.69; women: M=2.10, SD = 2.17; p<0.001). These differences
   remained significant after controlling for potential socio-demographic
   covariates. Following their diagnosis, more women reported moving out of
   their homes (men: 16%; women: 26%; p<0.05). More men (89%) than women
   (66%; p<0.001) reported to have modified their sexual behavior after
   being diagnosed. These findings suggest that the experience of living
   with HIV and HIV stigma varies by gender in this population. Suggestions
   for a gender-based approach to HIV prevention and stigma reduction are
   provided.

AB Whichever nomenclature is used to describe the study of black peoples
   and the African Diaspora - whether Africana, Black or African Studies -
   the approach that is taken is critically important to academia in terms
   of its potential to provide a direct response and challenge to the
   intrinsic Eurocentric and Orientalist bias of the US educational system.
   Unlike other area and ethnic studies disciplines, this field was
   established as a link between the community and academia. However, in
   recent history, approaches have become polarized and the field has lost
   momentum as a consequence of arbitrary boundaries and politicized
   knowledge. In this article, the Orientalist perspective and Afro-centric
   knowledge in Black Studies are examined in their historical and
   political context. This analysis culminates in a proposed approach to
   use the Sociology of Africa as a new model for Afro-centric knowledge
   and teaching in this field.

AB 'Africana Sociology' begins with a reappraisal of the 'image of Africa'
   in the form of sociology's theoretical narrative about modernity's
   spatial and temporal order. Early sociologists, like Auguste Comte and
   Lester Ward, conceived sociology as a secular discourse, although it
   transmitted Protestant values that reduced people of African descent to
   fetish objects. In the work of Charles H. Long, the 'image of Africa'
   appears in the African American religious imagination because it - more
   than the land in which Blacks were enslaved - authenticated their
   origins. In my appropriation of the concept, it is a semiotic device
   that, through its dialectical relationship with the 'image of
   involuntary presence', structures sociology's narrative form. Like in
   the work of W. E.B. Du Bois, the image of Africa designates the American
   nation as a site of crisis, while imbuing Black subjectivity with a
   wider consciousness of modernity.

AB African American women are continually engaged in challenging
   invisibility, marginalization, and exclusion. Africana Sociology has the
   potential to support these efforts by incorporating key conceptual
   models and constructs from Black Sociology, Afrocentricity, and
   Transdisciplinary Applied Social Justice (TASJ (c)). Africana Sociology
   should recognize the role of intersectionality and socially-constructed
   and intertwined race, class, and gender identities; it should
   acknowledge the importance of African-centered thought, including the
   role of Ma'at; and it should reflect a commitment to praxis -using
   theory to transform social institutions and thus, social outcomes. With
   this conceptual foundation, Africana Sociology can serve as a
   theoretical, methodological, and practical approach for implementing
   transformative change in the experiences of African Americans, and
   African American women, in particular.

AB This essay seeks to contribute to the development of an African-centered
   sociological approach to examine Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer, and intersexed identities and performances. While
   sociologists using the most progressive approaches outline the Western
   hegemonic nature of Africana peoples' perceptions of gender and
   sexuality, neither approach allows sociologists to view the relationship
   between social formations, human consciousness, and cosmological
   patterns. African-centered social scientists and social theorists
   typically determine that Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
   queer, and intersexed identities and performances are outside of
   Africana humanity. Within this essay, the author relies upon the Kemetic
   Anunian cosmology and personality constructs as sources through which to
   develop an African-centered framework to explain the multiple
   expressions of Africana gender and sexuality. This model considers that
   one's gender and sexuality are contained within and inseparable from
   one's higher-self that animates one's existence. This work, then, opens
   the door for further theory development and praxis in the emerging field
   of African-centered sociology and African-centered gender and sexuality
   studies within the discipline of Africana studies.

   conceptual framework in the study of Africana life, history, and
   culture. This conceptual framework has been utilized and expanded on by
   those developing scholarship in the sub-discipline areas of Africana
   Studies, including African-centered psychology, history, and literature.
   However, to date the articulation of an African-centered sociology,
   grounded in an African-centered conceptual framework, has not developed;
   neither has it occurred for African-centered sociology as a
   sub-discipline of Africana Studies, a sub-discipline of traditional
   sociology, or as a stand-alone discipline, itself. After a review of the
   worldview concept and framework and an analysis of the intellectual
   history of Black Sociology, this article then discusses the possibility
   of an African-centered sociology contingent upon the usage of an African
   worldview as the conceptual framework. Finally, the impacts of an
   African-centered epistemology and African-centered social theory are
   considered for the future of African-centered sociology.

   sample of news stories on SMI and gun violence published in 14 national
   and regional news sources from 1997 to 2012. Across the study period,
   most news coverage occurred in the wake of mass shootings, and
   "dangerous people" with SMI were more likely than "dangerous weapons" to
   be mentioned as a cause of gun violence.

AB Objectives. We used Danish registry data to examine the association
   between parental incarceration and child mortality risk.
   Methods. We used a sample of all Danish children born in 1991 linked
   with parental information. We conducted discrete-time survival analysis
   separately for boys (n = 30 146) and girls (n = 28 702) to estimate the
   association of paternal and maternal incarceration with child mortality,
   controlling for parental socio-demographic characteristics. We followed
   the children until age 20 years or death, whichever came first.
   Results. Results indicated a positive association between paternal and
   maternal imprisonment and male child mortality. Paternal imprisonment
   was associated with lower child mortality risks for girls. The
   relationship between maternal imprisonment and female child mortality
   changed directions depending on the model, suggesting no clear
   association.
   Conclusions. These results indicate that the incarceration of a parent
   may influence child mortality but that it is important to consider the
   gender of both the child and the incarcerated parent.

   January 2008 and March 2011, which had 10 sites in 9 states. We assessed
   baseline and 6-month HIV treatment outcomes, stratifying by gender.
   Results. Of 867 evaluable participants, 277 (31.9%) were women. Compared
   with men, women were more likely to be younger, non-Hispanic White,
   married, homeless, and depressed, but were similar in recent alcohol and
   heroin use. By 6 months postrelease, women were significantly less
   likely than men to experience optimal HIV treatment outcomes, including
   (1) retention in care (50% vs 63%), (2) antiretroviral therapy
   prescription (39% vs 58%) or optimal antiretroviral therapy adherence
   (28% vs 44%), and (3) viral suppression (18% vs 30%). In multiple
   logistic regression models, women were half as likely as men to achieve
   viral suppression.
   Conclusions. HIV-infected women transitioning from jail experience
   greater comorbidity and worse HIV treatment outcomes than men. Future
   interventions that transition people from jail to community-based HIV
   clinical care should be gender-specific.

AB Objectives. We examined how early life conditions influence midlife
   overall and cause-specific mortality in a community cohort of
   disadvantaged African Americans.
   Methods. Using a prospective design, we assessed first-grade children
   and their teachers and families when children were 6 years old, with
   follow-up at ages 16, 32, and 42 years. We obtained information on death
   from family members, neighbors, and the National Death Index (NDI). We
   conducted a survival analysis and competing risk analysis to examine
   early life predictors of mortality.
   Results. Of 1242 participants, 87 (7%) had died by 2004. In multivariate
   Cox proportional hazards regression, males who lived in foster care and
   females with lower math grades in first grade were more likely to die by
   age 42 years. In multivariate competing risks analysis, hospitalization
   by the time of first grade was related to mortality from acute and
   chronic illness. Male gender, being in foster care, and aggressive
   behavior in first grade were related to mortality from drug use,
   violence, or suicide.
   Conclusions. Early classroom, environmental, and family-level
   interventions are potentially beneficial in reducing later overall and
   cause-specific mortality.

AB Objectives. We examined the impact of geographic residency status and
   census tract (CT)-level socioeconomic status (SES) on colorectal cancer
   (CRC) outcomes.
   Methods. This was a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed
   with CRC in Georgia for the years 2000 through 2007. Study outcomes were
   late-stage disease at diagnosis, receipt of treatment, and survival.
   Results. For colon cancer, residents of lower-middle-SES and low-SES
   census tracts had decreased odds of receiving surgery. Rural,
   lower-middle-SES, and low-SES residents had decreased odds of receiving
   chemotherapy. For patients with rectal cancer, suburban residents had
   increased odds of receiving radiotherapy, but low SES resulted in
   decreased odds of surgery. For survival, rural residents experienced a
   partially adjusted 14% (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.14; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 1.07, 1.22) increased risk of death following diagnosis
   of CRC that was somewhat explained by treatment differences and
   completely explained by CT-level SES. Lower-middle-and low-SES
   participants had an adjusted increased risk of death following diagnosis
   for CRC (lower-middle: HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.10, 1.22; low: HR = 1.24;
   95% CI = 1.16, 1.32).
   Conclusions. Future efforts should focus on developing interventions and
   policies that target rural residents and lower SES areas to eliminate
   disparities in CRC-related outcomes.

AB In the 1860s and 1870s, the feudal monarchy of the Tokugawa shogunate,
   which had ruled Japan for over two centuries, was overthrown, and the
   entire political order it had commanded was dismantled. This immense
   political transformation, comparable in its results to the great social
   revolutions of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in the West,
   was distinctive for lacking a major role for mass political
   mobilization. Since popular political action was decisive elsewhere for
   both providing the force for social revolutions to defeat old regimes
   and for pushing revolutionary leaders to more radical policies, the
   Meiji Restoration's combination of revolutionary outcomes with
   conservative personnel and means is puzzling. This article argues that
   previous accounts fail to explain why a group of relatively low-status
   samurai-administrative functionaries with some hereditary political
   privileges but in fact little secure power within the old regime-was
   able to overcome far more deeply entrenched political actors. To explain
   this, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between two political
   processes: the long-standing political relations of feudal monarchy and
   magnate lords and the unprecedented emergence of independent samurai
   political action and organizations cutting across domain boundaries. It
   was the interaction of these two processes that produced the overthrow
   of the Tokugawa and enabled the revolutionary outcomes that followed it.
   This article's revised explanation of the Meiji Restoration clearly
   places it within the same theoretical parameters as the major
   revolutions of the seventeenth century and later.

AB Extant research in organizational and economic sociology posits that
   organizations derive status from their prior demonstrations of quality,
   as well as their affiliations with high-status alters. Yet there are
   also indications that organizations may acquire status by virtue of
   their membership in salient social categories that are themselves status
   valued. In this article, the author explicitly theorizes and measure the
   concept of categorical status among organizations and test whether it
   influences the evaluation of organizational actions. More concretely,
   she develops a measure of industry status and test whether it affects
   the market reaction to U. S. firms announcing earnings restatements
   between 2000 and 2009. Results of the empirical analyses indicate that
   investors react less negatively to earnings restatements announced by
   firms from higher-status industries, supporting the argument that
   category status acts as a lens that shapes the extent to which an
   organization's actions are viewed favorably.

AB Social network analysis provides a broad and complex perspective on
   animal sociality that is widely applicable to almost any species. Recent
   applications demonstrate the utility of network analysis for advancing
   our understanding of the dynamics, selection pressures, development, and
   evolution of complex social systems. However, most studies of animal
   social networks rely primarily on a descriptive approach. To propel the
   field of animal social networks beyond exploratory analyses and to
   facilitate the integration of quantitative methods that allow for the
   testing of ecologically and evolutionarily relevant hypotheses, we
   review methodological and conceptual advances in network science, which
   are underutilized in studies of animal sociality. First, we highlight
   how the use of statistical modeling and triadic motifs analysis can
   advance our understanding of the processes that structure networks.
   Second, we discuss how the consideration of temporal changes and spatial
   constraints can shed light on the dynamics of social networks. Third, we
   consider how the study of variation at multiple scales can potentially
   transform our understanding of the structure and function of animal
   networks. We direct readers to analytical tools that facilitate the
   adoption of these new concepts and methods. Our goal is to provide
   behavioral ecologists with a toolbox of current methods that can
   stimulate novel insights into the ecological influences and evolutionary
   pressures structuring networks and advance our understanding of the
   proximate and ultimate processes that drive animal sociality.

AB Health disparities are preventable differences in the burden of disease
   or opportunities to achieve optimal health that are experienced by
   socially disadvantaged population groups. Reducing health disparities
   has been identified as an ethical imperative by the World Health
   Organization's Commission on Social Determinants of Health and numerous
   other national and international bodies. Significant progress has been
   made over the past years in identifying vulnerable groups, and 'distal'
   factors including political, economic, social, and community
   characteristics are now considered pivotal. It is thus unsurprising that
   the remarkable advances in the science and practice of dentistry have
   not led to notable reductions in oral health disparities. In this
   review, we summarize recent work and emphasize the need for a solid
   theoretical framing to guide oral health disparities research. We
   provide a theoretical framework outlining pathways that operate across
   the continuum of oral health determinants during the lifecourse and
   highlight potential areas for intervention. Because oral health
   disparities emanate from the unequal distribution of social, political,
   economic, and environmental resources, tangible progress is likely to be
   realized only by a global movement and concerted efforts by all
   stakeholders, including policymakers, the civil society, and academic,
   professional, and scientific bodies.

AB Purpose: The study sought to identify major-specific, training, and
   cultural factors affecting attitudes toward stuttering of
   speech-language pathology (SLP) students.
   Method: Eight convenience samples of 50 students each from universities
   in the USA and Poland filled out the Public Opinion Survey of Human
   Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) in English or Polish, respectively. USA
   samples included undergraduate and graduate students in SLP majors or
   non-SLP majors as well as a sample of non-SLP students who were Native
   Americans. Polish samples included SLP (logopedics), psychology, and
   mixed majors.
   Results: SLP students held more positive attitudes than non-SLP students
   in both countries. Graduate students held more positive attitudes than
   undergraduate students in the USA, and this effect was stronger for SLP
   than for non-SLP students. Native American students' stuttering
   attitudes were similar to other American non-SLP students' attitudes.
   Polish student attitudes were less positive overall than those of their
   American student counterparts.
   Conclusion: SLP students' attitudes toward stuttering are affected by a
   "halo effect" of being in that major, by specific training in fluency
   disorders, and by various cultural factors, yet to be clearly
   understood.
   Educational objectives: The reader will be able to: (a) describe major
   factors affecting SLP students' attitudes toward stuttering; (b)
   describe similarities and differences in attitudes toward stuttering of
   students from the USA and Poland; (c) describe similarities and
   differences in attitudes toward stuttering of Native American students

   and social psychological literatures to demonstrate how people construct
   their own civil purity and become pure. It uses in-depth interview data
   to uncover a language of civil purity that people draw on to construct
   their own belonging in civil society. It argues that some people create
   an imagined public-at-large that they infuse with polluting qualities
   associated with the binary cultural codes of civil society. This image
   functions as a mental heuristic, against which people compare themselves
   and see themselves as better than' on a number of moral values
   associated with civil society. This process of constructing civil purity
   is linked to one of the civil sphere's two fundamental social
   institutions, namely communication. As a form of nonfiction media with
   record lows in trust and credibility, the mainstream news serves as a
   social topic through which we can witness the construction of civil
   purity.

AB This essay reviews works in (political) sociology that offer
   alternatives to sociology-as-usual. Sociologists with even fleeting
   awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely
   familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward
   complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward
   existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience the
   complex contradictions of the social and political world' (Taylor, The
   New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind
   residues or traces,' and contributors in a recently edited volume
   challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces
   and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely,
   popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of
   deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to
   individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised
   by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the
   complexities of contemporary experiments in human being' are just the
   sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center
   of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite
   the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists
   should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential
   multiplicity.

   for resolution? And if so, to which political process do they defer?
   Through a novel interview exercise with 61 respondents from a variety of
   religious backgrounds, I find a general willingness to defer to a
   legitimate political process, even if it results in an undesirable
   outcome that violates religious (or other) political preferences.
   However, I also find that a political process need not be democratic to
   be seen as legitimate, and that process preferences do not map onto

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Health care reform offers a new opportunity
   to address child health disparities. This study sought to characterize
   racial differences in pediatric asthma readmissions with a focus on the
   potential explanatory role of hardships that might be addressed in
   future patient care models.
   METHODS: We enrolled 774 children, aged 1 to 16 years, admitted for
   asthma or bronchodilator-responsive wheezing in a population-based
   prospective observational cohort. The outcome was time to readmission.
   Child race, socioeconomic status (measured by lower income and caregiver
   educational attainment), and hardship (caregivers looking for work,
   having no one to borrow money from, not owning a car or home, and being
   single/never married) were recorded. Analyses used Cox proportional
   hazards.
   RESULTS: The cohort was 57% African American, 33% white, and 10%
   multiracial/other; 19% were readmitted within 12 months. After
   adjustment for asthma severity classification, African Americans were
   twice as likely to be readmitted as whites (hazard ratio: 1.98; 95%
   confidence interval: 1.42 to 2.77). Compared with whites, African
   American caregivers were significantly more likely to report lower
   income and educational attainment, difficulty finding work, having no
   one to borrow money from, not owning a car or home, and being
   single/never married (all P <= .01). Hardships explained 41% of the
   observed racial disparity in readmission; jointly, socioeconomic status
   and hardship explained 49%.
   CONCLUSIONS: African American children were twice as likely to be
   readmitted as white children; hardships explained > 40% of this
   disparity. Additional factors (eg, pollution, tobacco exposure, housing
   quality) may explain residual disparities. Targeted interventions could
   help achieve greater child health equity.

AB OBJECTIVE:This study included 54-month-old children with a history of
   institutional care. Our goal was to: (1) examine differences in
   indiscriminate social behaviors in children with a history of
   institutional care compared with home-reared children; (2) test whether
   foster care reduces indiscriminate social behaviors in a randomized
   controlled trial; and (3) examine early predictors of indiscriminate
   behaviors.METHODS:Participants were 58 children with a history of
   institutional care and 31 never-institutionalized control (NIG) subjects
   enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of foster care for
   institutional care, assessed from toddlerhood to 54 months.
   Indiscriminate social behaviors were measured naturalistically by using
   the Stranger at the Door procedure.RESULTS:In the Stranger at the Door
   procedure, children with a history of institutional care left with a
   stranger at higher rates than NIG subjects (33% vs 3.5%; P < .001).
   Children in the care as usual group left more than NIG subjects (41.9%
   vs 3.6%; P .001). The differences between the foster care group (24.1%)
   and the care as usual group and between foster care group and NIG were
   not significant. In a logistic regression, early disorganized attachment
   behaviors, baseline developmental quotient, and caregiving quality after
   randomization contributed to variance at 54 months. In the same analysis
   using only children with a history of institutional care, only
   disorganized attachment contributed significantly to 54-month
   indiscriminate social behaviors (Exp[B] = 1.6 [95% confidence interval:
   1.1-2.5]).CONCLUSIONS:Observed socially indiscriminate behaviors at 54

AB Background: Biobanking is the collection of human biospecimens (tissues,
   blood, and body fluids) and their associated clinical and outcome data.
   Hispanics are less likely to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.
   The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of
   acculturation, nativity status, and years living in the United States
   with participation in biobanking among individuals of Mexican descent.
   Methods: Participants were 19,212 adults of Mexican descent enrolled in
   an ongoing population-based cohort in Houston, TX. Participants were
   offered the opportunity to provide a blood, urine, or saliva sample for
   biobanking. Acculturation was assessed with the bidimensional
   acculturation scale for Hispanics and scores were categorized into " low
   acculturation," "bicultural," and "high-acculturation." Results: After
   multivariable adjustment, we found an increased likelihood of
   participation in biobanking among individuals classified as "bicultural"
   as compared with "highly acculturated" individuals [OR, 1.58; 95%
   confidence intervals (CI), 1.10-2.26]. The associations of nativity
   status and years living in the United States with biobanking were not
   statistically significant. After stratifying by gender, the associations
   of acculturation, nativity status, and years living in the United States
   with biobanking were not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Although individuals of Mexican descent who were
   "bicultural" were more likely to participate in biobanking than
   individuals who were "highly acculturated," the difference in rates of
   participation among acculturation categories was small. The high
   participation rate in biospecimen collection is likely due to extensive
   community-engaged research efforts. Future studies are warranted to
   understand individuals' participation in biobanking.
   Impact: Community-engaged research efforts may increase Hispanics'
   participation in biobanking.

   historical memory and disciplinary knowledge production. In order to do
   so, this paper will 1) utilize Cabral's (1970) theory of history to
   center humanity as historically developed into a racially gendered
   classed capitalist world-system, 2) employ intersectionality as a
   heuristic device to see how knowledge is manipulated to normalize
   dehumanization as well as to perpetuate exploitation and privilege by
   denying "Othered' " knowledges, and lastly 3) sociologically imagine
   this racially gendered classed process in the "institutional-structure"
   of American Sociology by exploring the ancestry of the concept of
   "intersectionality." In all this paper argues 1) American Sociology
   under theorizes history, a central aspect of the sociological
   imagination and production of new sociological knowledge, 2) American
   Sociology reproduces a dehumanized theory of history per Marx's
   "historical materialism" and 3) the structure of American Sociology's
   knowledge is racially gendered classed, as illustrated in the collective

AB Migration patterns of young adults are thought to have a significant
   role in the overall dynamics of population change in the Great Plains.
   Although most research has discussed migration patterns of "young
   people" as if this group were homogenous, there is evidence of gender
   differences with regard to residential preferences among youth, and
   still other research has noted the disparate opportunities afforded to
   men and women of the rural Great Plains. Sex ratio data for Kansas and
   Nebraska, calculated from US Census records at the county and subcounty
   levels for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010, were analyzed for differences
   in residential outcomes of young men and young women by creating age-sex
   "cohorts" and comparing their changes over a period of 10 years.
   Although more young men left areas of low population, places with
   populations of 800 or fewer residents experienced a mean sex ratio
   increase of 38.9% (+14.66 net change) over the period from 2000 to 2010,
   indicating increasing imbalance between men and women in those places.
   Conversely, places of more than 5,000 residents experienced an increase
   in young women relative to young men, resulting in a mean sex ratio
   decrease of 2.26% (-2.88 net change). Further analysis provides evidence
   that young women are disproportionately more attracted to urban places
   within the study area, and these places appear to be trending toward far
   more balance between young men and young women compared to less populous
   places.

AB Baseball managers and umpires don't always see eye-to-eye. Their
   on-field confrontations long have been part of the game-and the outcome
   of those contests. But those confrontations have received scant
   attention by researchers who focus on the dynamics of the game. This
   study serves as the sequel to our previous work that applied management
   and leadership theories in exploring the strategies baseball coaches use
   to contest an umpire's decision. We used leadership scholar John E.
   Barbuto's concept of influence tactics and the types of social power
   discussed by sociologists John R. French and Bertram Raven. The use of
   influence tactics and social power are standard in the workplace between
   managers and subordinates, managers and their peers, and managers and
   their supervisors. This study examines the success of those influence
   tactics-but from the umpire's perspective. We interviewed 12 umpires who
   call high school and collegiate games and categorized their findings
   into four themes: (1) when to approach umpires about a call; (2) how to
   approach them; (3) how umpires' age and experience affect their
   reactions to coaches; and (4) how to show umpires respect. This study,
   in investigating the interactions of baseball managers and umpires,
   reinforces congruence theory-that baseball imitates the workplace.

AB Over the last few decades, a steady stream of books decry the decline of
   the public intellectual in modern life, while academics continue to
   express the desire to "make a difference" by producing research that
   contributes to the amelioration of social problems. In this context,
   this article draws on basic and applied research on transgender
   prisoners in California as a case study to address larger questions
   about the pursuit of knowledge, the creation of policy, the prompting of
   praxis, and the promise of justice. The empirical research on
   transgender prisoners in prisons for men presented in this article
   begins with a decidedly specific policy question (how to keep
   transgender prisoners safe from sexual assault in prison) and ends with
   basic research that interrogates the social organization and workings of
   gender (how is gender accomplished among transgender prisoners in
   prisons for men). Reviewing this research and presenting a few
   instructive digressions referred to as "sidebars" leads to two
   conclusions: (1) The line between basic and policy work cannot be
   effectively erased (nor should it be), and (2) basic and applied
   research can be treated as productively interdependent (i.e., take us to
   new research paths and generate new insights). By operating
   side-by-side, basic and policy research can provide us with general and
   particularistic understandings of social processes and structures that
   ultimately help us make a difference in the lives of those who suffer
   the most from systems of inequality, in this case transgender women
   subject to state authority.

AB Huge numbers of children participate in sports. However, kids and sports
   are rarely seen, much less systematically studied by sport sociologists.
   Our survey of the past decade of three major sport sociology journals
   illustrates a dearth of scholarly research on children and sport. While
   noting the few exceptions, we observe that sport studies scholars have
   placed a disproportionate amount of emphasis on studying sport media,
   and elite amateur, college, and professional athletes and sport
   organizations, while largely conceding the terrain of children's sports
   to journalists and to a handful of scholars whose work is not grounded
   in sport sociology. We probe this paradox, speculating why sport
   scholars focus so little on such a large and important object of study
   in sport studies. We end by outlining a handful of important scholarly
   questions for sport scholars, focusing especially on key questions in
   the burgeoning sociological and interdisciplinary fields of children and
   youth, bodies and health, and intersectional analyses of social
   inequality.

   DesignProspective cohort study.
   SettingUniversity-affiliated urban safety-net healthcare system in
   Indianapolis, Indiana.
   ParticipantsCommunity-dwelling adults aged 65 and older with annual
   income less than 200% of the federal poverty level and enrolled in the
   Geriatric Resources for Assessment and Care of Elders (GRACE) randomized
   controlled trial (N=951).
   MeasurementsParticipant health and functional status at baseline and 6,
   12, 18, and 24months. Early readmission was defined as a repeat
   hospitalization occurring within 30days of a prior hospital discharge.
   Candidate risk factors included sociodemographic characteristics, health
   and functional status, prior care, lifestyle, and satisfaction with
   care.
   ResultsOf 457 index admissions in 328 participants, 85 (19%) were
   followed by an early readmission. The independent risk factors for early
   readmission identified according to regression analysis were living
   alone (odds ratio (OR)=1.71, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.02-2.87),
   fair or poor satisfaction with primary care physician (OR=2.12, 95%
   CI=1.01-4.46), not having Medicaid (OR=1.80, 95% CI=1.05-3.11),
   receiving a new assistive device in the past 6months (OR=2.26, 95%
   CI=1.26-4.05), and staying in a nursing home in the past 6months
   (OR=5.08, 95% CI=1.56-16.53). Age, race, sex, education, and chronic
   diseases were not associated with early readmission.
   ConclusionA broad range of nonmedical risk factors played a greater role
   than previously recognized in early hospital readmission of low-income
   seniors.

AB Studies have documented high levels of pain in hospitalized individuals
   at the end of life, with minorities reporting higher levels of pain than
   whites. In response, inpatient palliative care (IPC) teams have grown
   rapidly to improve care of seriously ill individuals. Although research
   indicates that IPC teams effectively reduce and maintain control of
   pain, racial and ethnic differences in pain following IPC consultation
   remain unclear. This study investigated racial and ethnic pain
   differences after an IPC intervention in 385 seriously ill white, black,
   and Latino individuals aged 65 and older. Using the 11-point Numeric
   Rating Scale for pain, individuals were asked to rate their pain
   intensity at four points during hospitalization (before IPC
   consultation, 2 and 24hours after the consultation, and at hospital
   discharge). Results indicate that whites (F-1.657,F- 173.998=16.528,
   P<.001), blacks (F-1.800,F- 95.410=7.103, P=.002), and Latinos
   (F-1.388,F- 73.584=10.902, P<.001) all experienced significant
   reductions in pain after the intervention. Adjusted multivariate models
   testing between-group racial and ethnic differences revealed that
   Latinos were 62% more likely than whites to report experiencing pain at
   hospital discharge (relative risk=0.38, 95% confidence
   interval=0.15-0.97). Regardless of race or ethnicity, IPC effectively
   reduces and controls pain after consultation. Despite pain decreases,
   Latinos remain more likely than whites to report pain at follow-up.
   Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms in operation and
   to better understand and address the needs of this population.

AB Professional and advocacy organizations have long urged that dementia
   should be recognized and properly diagnosed. With the passage of the
   National Alzheimer's Project Act in 2011, an Advisory Council for
   Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services was convened to advise the
   Department of Health and Human Services. In May 2012, the Council
   produced the first National Plan to address Alzheimer's disease, and
   prominent in its recommendations is a call for quality measures suitable
   for evaluating and tracking dementia care in clinical settings. Although
   other efforts have been made to set dementia care quality standards,
   such as those pioneered by RAND in its series Assessing Care of
   Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE), practitioners, healthcare systems, and
   insurers have not widely embraced implementation. This executive summary
   (full manuscript available at ) reports on a new measurement set for
   dementia management developed by an interdisciplinary Dementia Measures
   Work Group (DWG) representing the major national organizations and
   advocacy organizations concerned with the care of individuals with
   dementia. The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the American
   Geriatrics Society, the American Medical Directors Association, the
   American Psychiatric Association, and the American Medical
   Association-convened Physician Consortium for Performance Improvement
   led this effort. The ACOVE measures and the measurement set described
   here apply to individuals whose dementia has already been identified and
   properly diagnosed. Although similar in concept to ACOVE, the DWG
   measurement set differs in several important ways; it includes all
   stages of dementia in a single measure set, calls for the use of
   functional staging in planning care, prompts the use of validated
   instruments in patient and caregiver assessment and intervention,
   highlights the relevance of using palliative care concepts to guide care
   before the advanced stages of illness, and provides evidence-based
   support for its recommendations and guidance on the selection of
   instruments useful in tracking patient-centered outcomes. It also
   specifies annual reassessment and updating of interventions and care
   plans for dementia-related problems that affect families and other
   caregivers as well as individuals with dementia. Here, a brief synopsis
   of why major reforms in healthcare design and delivery are needed to
   achieve substantive improvements in the quality of care is first
   provided, and then the final measures approved for publication,
   dissemination, and implementation are listed.

AB Scholars largely assume that hog production is following the same
   industrialization process as the integrated poultry industry. Since the
   collapse of hog farming in the 1990s, academics have anticipated that
   producers will eventually become trapped in contracts that leave the
   integrator with full control over the production process. Embedded in
   this prediction is an assumption that hog farmers respond to these
   productive pressures individually. Our analysis of the Carthage
   Management System suggests a different path for the hog commodity chain.
   The Carthage Management System is a conglomeration of business
   management firms that bring finishing hog farmers together to form
   limited liability corporations (LLCs) in the breed-to-wean stage of hog
   production. We use a sociology of agrifood framework to suggest that the
   nuances of hog production encourage the use of what we call folding
   corporations to limit liability in ways that profoundly transform the
   family farm. Corporations and individual hog farmers alike employ this
   creative LLC structure to deflect responsibility for the risks of hog
   production. We identify how folding corporations externalize the costs
   of production onto rural communities. Additional research is needed to
   better understand unfolding farmer identities, legal protections for
   farmers, how widespread organizational structures like Carthage
   Management System are, and their consequences for rural communities and
   the industrialization process.

AB Social dilemmas have long been studied formally as cooperation games
   that pit individual gains against those of the group. In the real world,
   individuals face an ecology of games where they play many such games
   simultaneously, often with overlapping co-players. Here, we study an
   agent-based model of an ecology of public goods games and compare the
   effectiveness of two institutional mechanisms for promoting cooperation:
   a simple institution of limited group size (capacity constraints) and a
   reputational institution based on observed behavior. Reputation is shown
   to allow much higher relative payoffs for cooperators than do capacity
   constraints, but only if (1) the rate of reputational information flow
   is fast enough relative to the rate of social mobility, and (2)
   cooperators are relatively common in the population. When these
   conditions are not met, capacity constraints are more effective at
   protecting the interests of cooperators. Because of the simplicity of
   the limited-group-size rule, capacity constraints can also generate
   social organization, which promotes cooperation much more quickly than
   can reputation. Our results are discussed in terms of both normative
   prescriptions and evolutionary theory regarding institutions that
   regulate cooperation. More broadly, the ecology-of-games approach
   developed here provides an adaptable modeling framework for studying a
   wide variety of problems in the social sciences.

AB Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the associations

   and heavy drinking. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to
   estimate direct and indirect associations among 5,419 adolescents ages
   12-14 years from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997. Results:
   Adolescents whose parents were authoritative were less likely to drink
   heavily than adolescents who experienced neglectful or indulgent
   parenting styles. Religiosity was negatively associated with heavy
   drinking after other relevant variables were controlled for.
   Conclusions: Authoritative parenting appears to have both direct and
   indirect negative associations with the risk of heavy drinking among
   adolescents. Authoritative parenting, where monitoring and support are
   above average, and religiosity might help deter adolescents from heavy
   drinking, even when adolescents experience peer environments where
   alcohol use is common. Authoritarian parenting, although it was not
   associated with heavy drinking, was positively associated with alcohol
   use and peer alcohol use, thus placing adolescents at some risk

AB Objective: Racial discrimination has been identified as an important
   predictor of alcohol-related outcomes for African Americans. The goal of
   the current study was to extend previously found links between lifetime
   discrimination, alcohol use, and alcohol problems as well as to
   elucidate the affective mechanisms underlying these associations, as
   moderated by gender. Method: A multiple-groups structural equation model
   was computed using survey data collected from 619 students from a
   historically Black college/university. Results: The final model provided
   excellent fit to the data, explaining 6% of the variance in alcohol
   consumption and 37% of the variance in alcohol problems. Discrimination
   was a significant predictor of alcohol-related problems but not, by and
   large, level of use. For men, anger but not discrimination-specific
   anger was a significant partial mediator of the link between
   discrimination and both alcohol use and alcohol problems. Depression
   partially mediated the link between discrimination and alcohol problems
   for both men and women. Conclusions: The results suggest that, for
   African Americans whose drinking leads to drinking-related problems,
   discrimination and poor affective self-regulation are highly relevant
   and predictive factors, especially for men.

AB BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:
   Previous studies have demonstrated that socioeconomic disparities in the
   treatment of cerebrovascular diseases exist. We studied a large
   administrative data base to study disparities in the utilization of
   mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS:
   With the utilization of the Perspective data base, we studied
   disparities in mechanical thrombectomy utilization between patient race
   and insurance status in 1) all patients presenting with acute ischemic
   stroke and 2) patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke at centers
   that performed mechanical thrombectomy. We examined utilization rates of
   mechanical thrombectomy by race/ethnicity (white, black, and Hispanic)
   and insurance status (Medicare, Medicaid, self-pay, and private).
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential
   confounding variables was performed to study the association between
   race/insurance status and mechanical thrombectomy utilization.
   RESULTS:
   The overall mechanical thrombectomy utilization rate was 0.15%
   (371/249,336); utilization rate at centers that performed mechanical
   thrombectomy was 1.0% (371/35,376). In the sample of all patients with
   acute ischemic stroke, multivariate logistic regression analysis
   demonstrated that uninsured patients had significantly lower odds of
   mechanical thrombectomy utilization compared with privately insured
   patients (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.25-0.95, P = .03), as did Medicare
   patients (OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.41-0.70, P < .0001). Blacks had
   significantly lower odds of mechanical thrombectomy utilization compared
   with whites (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.23-0.51, P < .0001). When considering
   only patients treated at centers performing mechanical thrombectomy,
   multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that insurance
   was not associated with significant disparities in mechanical
   thrombectomy utilization; however, black patients had significantly
   lower odds of mechanical thrombectomy utilization compared with whites
   (OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.27-0.60, P < .0001).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   Significant socioeconomic disparities exist in the utilization of
   mechanical thrombectomy in the United States.

AB Objective. To generate recommendations for framing messages to promote
   HPV vaccination, specifically for African American adolescents and their
   parents who have not yet made a decision about the vaccine (the
   "Undecided" market segment).
   Methods. Focus groups and interviews were conducted with African
   American girls ages 11-18 (N = 34) and their mothers (N = 31), broken
   into market segments based on daughter's vaccination status and mother's
   intent to vaccinate.
   Results. Findings suggested that the HPV vaccine should be presented to
   "Undecided" mothers and adolescents as a routine vaccine (just like
   other vaccines) that helps prevent cancer. Within the "Undecided"
   segment, we identified two sub-segments based on barriers to HPV
   vaccination and degree of reluctance. The "Undecided/Ready If Offered"
   segment would easily accept HPV vaccine if given the opportunity, with
   basic information and a healthcare provider recommendation. The
   "Undecided/Skeptical" segment would need more in-depth information to
   allay concerns about vaccine safety, mistrust of drug companies, and
   recommended age. Some mothers and girls had the erroneous perception
   that girls do not need the vaccine until they become sexually active.
   African American adolescents and their mothers overwhelmingly thought
   campaigns should target both girls and boys for HPV vaccination. In
   addition, campaigns and messages may need to be tailored for pre-teens
   (ages 9-12) versus teens (ages 13-18) and their parents.
   Conclusions. Findings pointed to the need to "normalize" the perception
   of HPV vaccine as just another routine vaccine (e.g., part of pre-teen
   vaccine package). Findings can inform social marketing campaigns
   targeting Undecided or ethnically diverse families. (C) 2014 Elsevier

AB IMPORTANCE Fiscal food policies (eg, taxation) are increasingly proposed
   to improve population-level health, but their impact on health
   disparities is unknown.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate subgroup-specific effects of fast food price
   changes on fast food consumption and cardiometabolic outcomes.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Twenty-year follow-up (5 examinations)
   in a biracial US prospective cohort: Coronary Artery Risk Development in
   Young Adults (CARDIA) (1985/1986-2005/2006, baseline N = 5115).
   Participants were aged 18 to 30 years at baseline; design indicated
   equal recruitment by race (black vs white), educational attainment, age,
   and sex. Community-level price data from the Council for Community and
   Economic Research were temporally and geographically linked to study
   participants' home address at each examination.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Participant-reported number of fast food
   eating occasions per week, body mass index (BMI), and homeostasis model
   assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) from fasting glucose and insulin
   concentrations. Covariates included individual-level and community-level
   social and demographic factors.
   RESULTS In repeated measures regression analysis, multivariable-adjusted
   associations between fast food price and consumption were nonlinear
   (quadratic, P < .001), with significant inverse estimated effects on
   consumption at higher prices; estimates varied according to race
   (interaction P = .04), income (P = .07). and education (P = .03). At the
   10th percentile of price ($1.25/serving), blacks and whites had mean
   fast food consumption frequency of 2.20 (95% CI, 2.07-2.33) and 1.55
   (1.45-1.65) times/wk, respectively, whereas at the 90th percentile of
   price ($1.53/serving), respective mean consumption estimates were 1.86
   (1.75-1.97) and 1.50 (1.41-1.59) times/wk. We observed differential
   price effects on HOMA-IR (inverse for lower educational status only
   [interaction P = .005] and at middle income only [interaction P = .02])
   and BMI (inverse for blacks, less education, and middle income; positive
   for whites, more education, and high income [all interaction P < .001]).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We found greater fast food price sensitivity
   on fast food consumption and insulin resistance among sociodemographic
   groups that have a disproportionate burden of chronic disease. Our
   findings have implications for fiscal policy, particularly with respect
   to possible effects of fast food taxes among populations with
   diet-related health disparities.

AB There is a growing concern about continued impairment of aquatic
   ecosystems resulting from increasing population size, land use, climate
   change, and the feedbacks that may harm human well-being. We describe a
   100 year multi-disciplinary overview of changes in Lake St. Clair, North
   America to identify knowledge gaps and needs to build the foundation for
   creating coupled human and natural system models. Our historical
   analysis indicates that the socioeconomic dynamics are inextricably
   linked to the urban dynamics of the Detroit metropolitan area.
   Environmental degradation and human health issues led to the adoption of
   relevant policies, including construction of wastewater treatment
   facilities by the 1960s. Climate trends during the 100-year period
   indicate a wetter region, which is influencing lake levels. Since the
   mid-1980s and 90s invasive zebra and quagga mussels (Dreissena
   polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugenis) have significantly
   altered the ecological. structure and function of the lake. Waterborne
   illnesses due to contaminated drinking water were once an issue but
   current human health risks have shifted to contaminated recreational
   waters and coastal pollution. Key research needs for building coupled
   models include geo-referencing socioeconomic and ecological data to
   accurately represent the processes occurring within the political and
   watershed boundaries; assessing ecosystem services for human well-being;
   and developing research hypotheses and management options regarding
   interactions among land use, people and the lake. Lake St. Clair has
   gone through extensive changes, both socioeconomically and ecologically
   over the last 100 years and we suggest that it serves as a useful case
   study for the larger Great Lakes region. (C) 2013 International

PD MAR 2014
PY 2014
AB Objective: For the period of almost 75 years, we examined the literature
   for studies regarding the influences of culture on alcohol use and
   misuse. Method: This review is a chronology of research articles
   published from 1940 to 2013. From a structured literature search with
   select criteria, 38 articles were identified and 34 reviewed. Results:
   This analysis revealed a progression across this period of research from
   studies that began as descriptive ethnographic evaluations of one or
   more indigenous societies or cultural groups, evolving to studies using
   complex multivariate models to test cross-cultural effects in two or
   more cultural groups. Major findings across this period include the
   assertions that (a) a function of alcohol use may be to reduce anxiety,
   (b) certain cultural groups possess features of alcohol use that are not
   associated with negative consequences, (c) the disruptive effects of
   acculturative change and the stressors of new demands are associated
   with an increase in alcohol consumption, (d) cultural groups shape
   expectations about the effects of alcohol use and their definition of
   drunkenness, and (e) the hypothesized relationships of culture with
   alcohol use and misuse have been demonstrated in multivariate model
   analyses. Conclusions: Across this 75-year period, the early proposition
   that culture is an important and prominent correlate of alcohol use and
   misuse has persisted. Within the current era of alcohol studies, this
   proposition has been supported by multivariate model analyses. Thus, the
   proposition that culture might affect alcohol use remains prominent and
   is as relevant today as it was when it was first proposed nearly 75
   years ago.

SU 17
PD MAR 2014
PY 2014
AB Objective: This article traces the evolution of alcohol-related social
   policy over the past 75 years. Method: The literature was reviewed and
   is critically discussed. Results: The social history of alcohol policies
   over the last 75 years began with the scientific approach to alcohol in
   the 1930s and later shifted to a central interest in the disease of
   alcoholism. Beginning with the National Council on Alcoholism Education,
   advocates struggled to "mainstream" treatment for this disease into the
   health care system. Major steps included decriminalization of public
   intoxication, emphasis of the social respectability of persons with
   alcohol problems, development of a treatment system that was accompanied
   by health insurance coverage, and work-based programs to identify and
   attract employed patients with health insurance coverage. These
   structures were considerably altered by the War on Drugs, managed dare,
   and the merger of drug and alcohol treatment. The Affordable Care Act,
   however, has the potential for achieving the mainstreaming goals for
   alcohol problems originally conceived in the early 1940s. Conclusions:
   Responsible involvement of the alcoholic beverage industry could greatly
   enhance current activities but is not likely to occur. Stigma persists
   in part because of associations with prevention and treatment of illegal
   drug use problems. The Affordable Care Act offers opportunities and
   challenges to the specialty of treating alcohol use disorders.

AB This paper argues that societal duties of health promotion are
   underwritten (at least in large part) by a principle of beneficence.
   Further, this principle generates duties of justice that correlate with
   rights, not merely "imperfect" duties of charity or generosity. To
   support this argument, I draw on a useful distinction from bioethics and
   on a somewhat neglected approach to social obligation from political
   philosophy. The distinction is that between general and specific
   beneficence; and the approach from political philosophy has at times
   been called equality of concern. After clarifying the distinction and
   setting out the basis of the equality of concern view, I argue that the
   result is a justice-based principle of "specific" beneficence that
   should be reflected in a society's health policy. I then draw on this
   account to criticize, refine, and extend some prominent health care
   policy proposals from the bioethics literature.

AB Background: This study provides binge drinking population estimates for
   California adults by gender and detailed race/ethnicity categories. This
   information may be helpful for planning targeted initiatives to decrease
   binge drinking. Method: Data were from the 2007 and 2009 California
   Health Interview Surveys. The 98 662 respondents represent an annual
   estimated population of 27.2 million adults. Survey adjusted binary
   logistic regression was used to calculate gender-specific binge drinking
   population rates and multinomial logit regression to estimate binge
   drinking frequency. Results: Adjusting for socio-demographics, any binge
   drinking during the past year was reported by 31.0% (95% Confidence
   Interval = 30.5-31.4%) of men and 18.0% (17.7-18.3%) of women. Rates
   among White men and women were 30.5% and 19.6%, respectively. Binge
   drinking rates ranged from 11.9% among Chinese to 42.9% among Mexican
   men and from 4.8% among Vietnamese to 25.7% among "Other Latino" women.
   Five race/ethnicity categories of men and seven categories of women were
   significantly less likely to binge drink compared to Whites. Although
   Whites had the highest overall binge drinking rates, an estimated 12.5%
   of White men binge drank less than monthly, significantly exceeded by
   Mexican and Central American men, 19.9 and 19.6%, respectively. An
   estimated 9.6% of White women binge drank less than monthly, exceeded
   only by "Other Latino" women, 13.6%. Conclusion: These findings
   underscore the importance of detailed gender and race/ethnicity
   breakdowns when examining any binge drinking. Furthermore, there is
   variability across Asian and Latino subgroups in the frequency of binge
   drinking episodes, which is not evident in broad-group population
   studies.

   processes induce an array of motivated and behavioral adjustments termed
   "sickness behaviors". Although withdrawal from social interactions is a
   commonly observed sickness behavior, the relation between social
   behavior and sickness is much more complex. Sickness can suppress or
   stimulate social behavior. Sickness can serve as a social cue. Stressors
   that are social in nature can induce sickness behaviors, and sickness
   behavior can be readily suppressed by meaningful social stimuli. The
   nature, context, and timing of these effects together suggest that
   cytokine-induced behavior may play a role in mediating social

AB Aims: For more than two decades genomic education of the public has been
   a significant challenge. As genomic information becomes integrated into
   daily life and routine clinical care, the need for public education is
   even more critical. We conducted a pilot study to learn how genomic
   researchers and ethical, legal, and social implications advisors who
   were affiliated with large-scale genomic variation studies have
   approached the issue of educating the public about genomics.
   Methods/Results: Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted
   with researchers and advisors associated with the SNP/HAPMAP studies and
   the Cancer Genome Atlas Study. Respondents described approach(es)
   associated with educating the public about their study. Interviews were
   audio-recorded, transcribed, coded, and analyzed by team review.
   Although few respondents described formal educational efforts, most
   provided recommendations for what should/could be done, emphasizing the
   need for an overarching entity(s) to take responsibility to lead the
   effort to educate the public. Opposing views were described related to:
   who this should be; the overall goal of the educational effort; and the
   educational approach. Four thematic areas emerged: What is the rationale
   for educating the public about genomics?; Who is the audience?; Who
   should be responsible for this effort?; and What should the content be?
   Policy issues associated with these themes included the need to agree on
   philosophical framework(s) to guide the rationale, content, and target
   audiences for education programs; coordinate previous/ongoing
   educational efforts; and develop a centralized knowledge base.
   Suggestions for next steps are presented. Conclusion: A complex
   interplay of philosophical, professional, and cultural issues can create
   impediments to genomic education of the public. Many challenges,
   however, can be addressed by agreement on a guiding philosophical
   framework(s) and identification of a responsible entity(s) to provide
   leadership for developing/overseeing an appropriate infrastructure to
   support the coordination/integration/sharing and evaluation of
   educational efforts, benefiting consumers and professionals.

AB To assess how patients perceive various lifestyle behaviors impact IVF
   success.
   Cross-sectional study of heterosexual, English-speaking couples (n =
   138) who completed web-based surveys during IVF treatment cycle.
   Perceived impact of lifestyle choices assessed by multivariable logistic
   regression and p-value tests for linear trend (P-t).
   During the IVF cycle, most patients consider it helpful for women to
   exercise (76 %), avoid stress (87 %) and limit activity after embryo
   transfer (92 %). The majority of patients (62 %) consider rigorous
   exercise (4+ h/week) helpful and nearly one-third (32 %) perceive
   benefit to complete bed rest after transfer. Overall, couples with a
   sex-specific infertility diagnosis are more likely to consider partner's
   lifestyle choices impactful: male-factor couples are more likely to
   consider it helpful for men to limit cellular phone use
   (OR:2.73,CI:1.06-7.04) and diminished ovarian reserve couples are more
   likely to consider it helpful for women to limit exposure to plastics
   (OR:2.38,CI:1.03-5.51). Patients at higher levels of education (P-t <
   0.01) and income (P-t < 0.01) are less likely to consider lifestyle
   impactful.
   Patient perceptions of the impact of lifestyle factors on IVF success
   vary by sex, infertility diagnosis and socioeconomic factors. Despite
   counseling to the contrary, many patients perceive benefit to rigorous
   exercise during the IVF cycle and complete bedrest following transfer.
   Results provide insight into patient beliefs and highlight opportunities
   to improve patient education, alleviate patient anxieties and
   potentially improve IVF outcomes.

AB BACKGROUND Previous studies have found racial and socioeconomic status
   bias in the way clinicians screen for and detect child abuse in patients
   presenting to the emergency department. We hypothesized that
   implementing a guideline for screening would attenuate this bias.
   METHODS An algorithm for child abuse screening in patients younger than
   1 year presenting with fractures was developed for a pediatric trauma
   center emergency department. Data were collected 1.5 years before and
   after implementation of the algorithm to investigate implementation
   success. Data were compared before and after the implementation of the
   algorithm using (2) and univariate logistic regression analysis.
   RESULTS The characteristics of patients with fractures were similar
   before and after the algorithm implementation. Implementation of the
   algorithm was related to a significant increase in algorithm required
   screenings: skeletal survey (p < 0.001), urinalysis (p < 0.001), and
   transaminase levels (p < 0.001). The racial composition of those
   screened did not change after the implementation of the protocol.
   Children with government-subsidized or no insurance were more likely to
   be screened for child abuse via skeletal survey before the algorithm
   implementation compared with those with private insurance (odds ratio,
   2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-6.0; p = 0.017). This relationship did
   not exist after the algorithm implementation (odds ratio, 1.2; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.56-2.46; p = 0.66). Final determination of child
   abuse was related to insurance status both before and after the
   algorithm implementation.
   CONCLUSION A child abuse screening algorithm was successfully
   implemented in an urban trauma center. After implementation, screening
   was no longer associated with socioeconomic status of the patient's
   family, although final determination of child abuse still was.
   Additional research is needed to determine utility of unbiased screening
   on patient outcomes.

AB Objective: Although the optimal treatment of carotid stenosis remains
   unclear, available data suggest that women have higher risk of adverse
   events after carotid revascularization. We used data from the Society
   for Vascular Surgery Vascular Registry to determine the effect of gender
   on outcomes after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery
   stenting (CAS).
   Methods: There were 9865 patients (40.6% women) who underwent CEA (n =
   6492) and CAS (n = 3373). The primary end point was a composite of
   death, stroke, and myocardial infarction at 30 days.
   Results: There was no difference in age and ethnicity between genders,
   but men were more likely to be symptomatic (41.6% vs 38.6%; P < .003).
   There was a higher prevalence of hypertension and chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease in women, whereas men had a higher prevalence of
   coronary artery disease, history of myocardial infarction, and smoking
   history. For disease etiology in CAS, restenosis was more common in
   women (28.7% vs 19.7%; P < .0001), and radiation was higher in men (6.2%
   vs 2.6%; P < .0001). Comparing by gender, there were no statistically
   significant differences in the primary end point for CEA (women, 4.07%;
   men, 4.06%) or CAS (women, 6.69%; men, 6.80%). There remains no
   difference after stratification by symptomatology and multivariate risk
   adjustment.
   Conclusions: In this large, real-world analysis, women and men
   demonstrated similar results after CEA or CAS. These data suggest that,
   contrary to previous reports, women do not have a higher risk of adverse
   events after carotid revascularization.

AB Study Objectives: Short and/or long sleep duration are associated with
   cardiometabolic disease risk and may be differentially experienced among
   minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged. The present study
   examined nationally representative data along multiple dimensions of
   race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Survey.
   Patients or Participants: 2007-2008 NHANES (N = 4,850).
   Interventions: None.
   Measurements and Results: Self-reported sleep duration was classified as
   very short (< 5 h), short (5-6 h), normative (7-8 h) and long (>= 9 h).
   Population-weighted multinomial logistic regression analyses examined
   race/ethnicity, country of origin, language, income, education, health
   insurance, and food security, controlling for all others as well as age,
   sex, marital-status, and overall self-rated health. Outcome was
   self-reported sleep duration, relative to normative sleep duration.
   Blacks/African Americans were more likely than whites to report very
   short (OR = 2.34, P < 0.001) and short (OR = 1.85, P < 0.001) sleep.
   Mexican Americans reported less long sleep (OR = 0.36, P = 0.032). Other
   Hispanics/Latinos reported more very short sleep (OR = 2.69, P = 0.025).
   Asians/ Others reported more very short (OR = 3.99, P = 0.002) and short
   (OR = 2.08, P = 0.002) sleep. Mexico-born adults reported less short
   sleep (OR = 0.63, P = 0.042). Spanish-only speakers reported less very
   short sleep (OR = 0.32, P = 0.030). Lower income groups reported more
   very short sleep versus >$75,000. Compared to college graduates,
   increased very short sleep was seen among all lower education levels.
   Those with public insurance reported more very short (OR = 1.67, P =
   0.31) and long (OR = 1.83, P = 0.011) sleep versus uninsured. Very low
   food security was associated with very short (OR = 1.86, P = 0.036) and
   short (OR = 1.44, P = 0.047) sleep.
   Conclusions: Minority status and lower socioeconomic position were
   associated with shorter self-reported sleep durations.

AB Moving beyond the typical focus on individual injustices, we examine
   individual-level and contextual factors affecting perceptions of justice
   with regard to the environment. Specifically, we examine decision-making
   procedures pertaining to environmental resource use and harms across
   groups of people; the distribution of environmental harms; and the
   direct treatment of the natural environment (i.e., procedural
   environmental justice, distributive environmental injustice, and
   ecological injustice, respectively). To test our hypotheses, we use data
   from a survey administered to a cohort of first-year college students at
   a southeastern university. Results demonstrate that environmental
   identity and perceptions of the extent to which the university context
   encourages sustainability consistently enhance perceptions of all three
   types of justice. Other factors differentially affect each type of
   justice. We discuss the importance of the patterns that emerge for
   environmental and sustainability education and speculate on the
   implications of moving from thinking about (in) justice related to the
   environment as an individual issue to one of the collectivity.

AB The purpose of this review is to look at racial/ethnic disparities in
   the diagnosis of depression and its treatment and to explain the
   dynamics and causes of these racial/ethnic disparities in depression by
   looking at several theories, such as perceived racism, cultural
   competency, and other theories. Perceived racism is that the perceptions
   of an environmental stimulus as being racist affects the coping
   responses of ethnic/racial minorities, which alters psychological and
   physiological stress responses, and finally affects health outcomes
   negatively. A lower level of cultural competence can lead to health
   disparities. In addition, lower socioeconomic status and health care
   providers' beliefs and behaviors about patients' race/ethnicity and
   class can affect depressive symptoms as well as diagnosis and treatment.
   In order to reduce these racial/ethnic disparities in depression,
   diverse interventions should be developed to improve depression outcomes
   for ethnic minority populations based on these theoretical perspectives.

   observational study design was used with a nationally representative
   sample of veterans. Logistic regression models were constructed using
   sociodemographic characteristics, health insurance and benefits, and
   health status as predictors of health service use in both VA and non-VA
   health care systems. A population weighted sample of 19,270 veterans
   from the 2001 National Survey of Veterans was used, which included
   17,004 (88.24 %) White, 1,864 (9.15 %) African American, 414 (2.15 %)
   Native American/Alaskan Native, and 87 (0.45 %) Asian American/Pacific
   Islander veterans. Results showed that use of the VA health care system
   was not associated with race, but was associated with VA disability
   compensation, lack of private health insurance, and greater health care
   need. Contrarily, in non-VA healthcare systems, veterans who were racial
   minorities, less educated, and without private health insurance were
   less likely to use services. Together, these findings demonstrate the
   socioeconomic context in which health disparities exist and suggest the
   influence of health insurance on racial disparities in service
   utilization.

AB Background: Stress hormones have been hypothesized to contribute to the
   social patterning of cardiovascular disease but evidence of differences
   in hormone levels across social groups is scant.
   Purpose: To examine the associations of socioeconomic and psychosocial
   factors with urinary levels of cortisol and catecholamines and determine
   whether these associations are modified by race/ethnicity.
   Methods: Measures of cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine
   were obtained on 12-h overnight urine specimens from 942 White, African
   American and Hispanic participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of
   Atherosclerosis (MESA). Linear regression was used to examine
   associations of income-wealth index, education, depression, anger,
   anxiety and chronic stress with the four hormones after adjustment for
   covariates.
   Results: Higher income-wealth index was associated with lower levels of
   urinary cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine and dopamine, after
   adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, medication use, body mass
   index, smoking, and alcohol use. Education and psychosocial factors were
   not associated with urinary stress hormone levels in the full sample.
   However, there was some evidence of effect modification by race: SES
   factors were more strongly inversely associated with cortisol in African
   Americans than in other groups and anger was inversely associated with
   catecholamines in African Americans but not in the other groups.
   Conclusions: Lower SES as measured by income-wealth index in a
   multi-ethnic sample is associated with higher levels of urinary cortisol
   and catecholamines. Heterogeneity in these associations by
   race/ethnicity warrants further exploration. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Sociologists of (e)valuation have devoted considerable attention to
   understanding differences in evaluative practices across a number of
   fields. Yet, little is understood about how individuals learn about and
   navigate multivalent valid group styles within a single setting. As a
   social phenomenon, many accept how central processes of evaluation are
   to everyday life. Accordingly, scholars have attempted to link research
   on evaluation to processes of inequality. Nevertheless, the sociology of
   evaluation only has tenuous, often implicit connections to literature on
   inequality and disadvantage. This article addresses these two gaps.
   Drawing on over two-hundred hours of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban
   high school debate league, twenty-seven semi-structured interviews with
   league judges, and archival data, we illustrate how high school policy
   debate judges employ evaluative frames and link them to the
   implementation of evaluative practices in a disadvantaged setting. We
   show that the cultural meanings that emerge within the evaluation
   process-in this case, urban uplift and competition-stem from the
   conflicted context in which evaluation is occurring. We also make a
   first step toward applying the conceptual tools within the sociology of
   evaluation to a disadvantaged setting, and more broadly, suggest that
   micro-processes of evaluation are important to the study of urban
   inequality.

AB This article demonstrates precisely how issues of access-in this case
   differential access to informants and the scenes that they populate in
   three sites-can reveal substantive findings. In the case it features, a
   comparative study of small cities with growing populations of lesbian
   couples, actors' disparate and place-specific sexual identities produced
   disparate and place-specific responses to research. Integrationist
   sexual identities impeded access, whereas identity-politics orientations
   facilitated it. The paper identifies three mechanisms via which sexual
   identities influenced access: directly, by shaping informants'
   orientations to the research topic, and, indirectly, by influencing
   local networks and institutions that emerge from and reinforce local
   identities. By explicating one ethnographer's path from methodological
   trouble to substantive insight, the article traces the utility of an
   expansive and flexible reflexivity that begins with but extends beyond
   the researcher's identity and role. This reflexivity, the article
   proposes, encourages identification of substantive findings and the
   development of social theory, and can advance a comparative sociology of
   ethnographic access.

AB Objectives Despite targeted public health efforts, racial disparities
   and poor birth outcomes are still apparent, particularly in the southern
   United States. Previous research through qualitative and modest
   quantitative research demonstrates a possible link between disparities
   in patient-provider conversations during prenatal visits, perceived
   access to prenatal care, and poor birth outcomes.
   Methods A secondary analysis was conducted using data from the 2007-2008
   Louisiana Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System to examine
   perceived access to healthcare services and information received and its
   impact on birth outcomes. Respondents consisted of 2460 white and black
   American women who recently experienced a live birth in the state of
   Louisiana.
   Results Racial disparities among Louisiana mothers were evident, with
   black mothers experiencing significant perceived lack of services or
   access to resources from a healthcare or insurance provider and poorer
   birth outcomes. White mothers reported experiencing less access based on
   the lack of vital prenatal care information from a healthcare provider.
   Self-perceived access was significantly associated with preterm birth
   for black women (odds ratio 2.94, 95% confidence interval 1-8; P < 0.05)
   and infant mortality for white women (odds ratio 340.5, confidence
   interval 36-999); P < 0.05).
   Conclusions Findings support the need for a better understanding of
   discriminatory experiences and their impact on women's experiences
   during prenatal care and poor birth outcomes.

   the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study who were
   examined in 2000, 2005, and 2010 (at ages 33-45 years in 2000), we
   estimated separate logistic regression random-effects models to assess
   whether patterns of exposure to supportive and negative relationships
   were associated with 10% or greater increases in body mass index (BMI)
   (weight (kg)/height (m) 2) and waist circumference. Linear regression
   random-effects modeling was used to examine associations of social
   relationships with mean changes in BMI and waist circumference.
   Participants with persistently high supportive relationships were
   significantly less likely to increase their BMI values and waist
   circumference by 10% or greater compared with those with persistently
   low supportive relationships after adjustment for sociodemographic
   characteristics, baseline BMI/waist circumference, depressive symptoms,
   and health behaviors. Persistently high negative relationships were
   associated with higher likelihood of 10% or greater increases in waist
   circumference (odds ratio = 1.62, 95% confidence interval: 1.15, 2.29)
   and marginally higher BMI increases (odds ratio = 1.50, 95% confidence
   interval: 1.00, 2.24) compared with participants with persistently low
   negative relationships. Increasingly negative relationships were
   associated with increases in waist circumference only. These findings
   suggest that supportive relationships may minimize weight gain, and that
   adverse relationships may contribute to weight gain, particularly via
   central fat accumulation.

   and Health Survey data from 284,281 women in 24 countries collected
   between 2004 and 2011. We performed descriptive analysis and
   multivariate logistic regressions examining characteristics associated
   with reporting to formal sources. Forty percent of women experiencing
   GBV previously disclosed to someone; however, only 7% reported to a
   formal source (regional variation, 2% in India and East Asia to 14% in
   Latin America and the Caribbean). Formerly married and never married
   status, urban residence, and increasing age were characteristics
   associated with increased likelihood of formal reporting. Our results
   imply that estimates of GBV prevalence based on health systems data or
   on police reports may underestimate the total prevalence of GBV, ranging
   from 11- to 128-fold, depending on the region and type of reporting. In
   addition, women who report GBV differ from those who do not, with
   implications for program targeting and design of interventions.

AB Understanding cues to the internal states of others involves a widely
   distributed network of brain regions. Although white matter (WM)
   connections are likely crucial for communication between these regions,
   the role of anatomical connectivity in empathic processing remains
   unexplored. The present study tested for a relationship between
   anatomical connectivity and empathy by assessing the WM microstructural
   correlates of affective empathy, which promotes interpersonal
   understanding through emotional reactions, and cognitive empathy, which
   does so via perspective taking. Associations between fractional
   anisotropy (FA) and the emotional (empathic concern, EC) and cognitive
   (perspective taking, PT) dimensions of empathy as assessed by the
   Interpersonal Reactivity Index were examined. EC was positively
   associated with FA in tracts providing communicative pathways within the
   limbic system, between perception and action-related regions, and
   between perception and affect-related regions, independently of
   individual differences in age, gender, and other dimensions of
   interpersonal reactivity. These findings provide a neuroanatomical basis
   for the rapid, privileged processing of emotional sensory information
   and the automatic elicitation of responses to the affective displays of
   others.

AB Heterogeneous land cover patterns contribute to unique ecological
   conditions in cities and little is known about the drivers of these
   patterns among cities. We studied tree cover patterns in relationship to
   urban morphology (for example, housing density, parcel size),
   socioeconomic factors (for example, education, income, lifestyle
   characteristics), and historical legacies in Baltimore, Maryland, and
   Raleigh, North Carolina. Utilizing a multimodel inference approach and
   bivariate analyses, we analyzed two primary datasets employed in
   previous research predicting urban tree cover-one comprising continuous
   data (US Census), and the other consisting of categorical variables
   (Claritas PRIZM) that incorporate consumer purchasing data. Continuous
   data revealed that urban morphological characteristics were better
   predictors of tree cover patterns than socioeconomic factors in Raleigh
   and Baltimore at the parcel and neighborhood scales. Although the
   categorical dataset provided some evidence for the importance of
   socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics in predicting tree cover
   patterns, the hierarchical nature of these data preclude separating the
   impacts of these factors from levels of urbanization. Bivariate analyses
   of continuous and categorical variables revealed that the highest
   correlation coefficients were associated with variables describing urban
   morphology-parcel size, percent pervious area, and house age. In
   Baltimore, historical census data were better predictors of present-day
   tree cover than census data from recent years. Most notably, parcel
   size, a key predictor of tree cover, has decreased with time in Raleigh
   to sizes consistently seen in Baltimore. Our findings demonstrate that
   urban morphology, the main driver of tree cover patterns in these
   cities, may lead to the homogenization of tree canopy in Raleigh and
   Baltimore in the future.

   called for protection through risk-based standards. However, given the

   assessment techniques may not be sufficient. Instead, there is a
   critical need for an integrated approach in which decision analytic
   techniques are used to assess evidence-based data with the values and
   preferences of decision makers. We point to three examples in the fields
   of nuclear power regulation, nanotechnology, and cybersecurity, where
   risk-based approaches (bottom-up) have been combined with decision
   analysis (top-down) to guide decision makers toward risk management
   policies that manifest both the best available evidence and the

AB BACKGROUND: Patients' trust in healthcare providers and institutions has
   been identified as a likely contributor to racial-ethnic health
   disparities. The likely influence of patients' cultural characteristics
   on trust is widely acknowledged but inadequately explored.
   To compare levels of patients' trust in primary care provider
   (interpersonal trust) with trust in healthcare organizations
   (institutional trust) among older American Indians (AIs), and determine
   associations with cultural identity.
   Patient survey administered following primary care visits.
   Two-hundred and nineteen American Indian patients a parts per thousand
   yen 50 years receiving care for a non-acute condition at two clinics
   operated by the Cherokee Nation in northeastern Oklahoma.
   Self-reported sociodemographic and cultural characteristics. Trust was
   measured using three questions about interpersonal trust and one measure
   of institutional trust; responses ranged from strongly agree to strongly
   disagree. Finding substantial variation only in institutional trust, we
   used logistic generalized estimating equations to examine relationships
   of patient cultural identity with institutional trust.
   Ninety-five percent of patients reported trusting their individual
   provider, while only 46 % reported trusting their healthcare
   institution. Patients who strongly self-identified with an AI cultural
   identity had significantly lower institutional trust compared to those
   self-identifying less strongly (OR: 0.6, 95 % CI: 0.4, 0.9).
   Interpersonal and institutional trust represent distinct dimensions of
   patients' experience of care that may show important relationships to
   patients' cultural characteristics. Strategies for addressing low
   institutional trust may have special relevance for patients who identify
   strongly with AI culture.

   documents the formation of a cross-border sociological intervention
   project and illustrates how sociological research fueled regional
   campaigns that gradually developed into a global campaign. This
   experience confirms the premise that 'social science' should never be
   separated from 'politics.' The authors also shed light on how social and
   economic injustice was creatively challenged by combining the strengths
   of workers, researchers and transnational movement activists. The study
   uses both quantitative (semi-structured questionnaires) and qualitative
   (in-depth interviews and participation observation) methods to gain
   insights concerning the experiences, world views and collective agency
   of Chinese workers who are struggling to make sense of the global

   was beset by the contradictory demands of local pedagogy and global

   problems of building a global sociology.

AB Background: Prior studies have shown racial/ethnic disparities in
   colorectal cancer (CRC) screening but have not provided a full national
   picture of disparities across all major racial/ethnic groups.
   Purpose: To provide a more complete, up-to-date picture of racial/ethnic
   disparities in CRC screening and contributing socioeconomic and access
   barriers.
   Methods: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 2010 were
   analyzed in 2013. Hispanic/Latino participants were stratified by
   preferred language (Hispanic-English versus Hispanic-Spanish).
   Non-Hispanics were categorized as White, Black, Asian, Native
   Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, or American Indian/Alaska Native. Sequential
   regression models estimated adjusted relative risks (RRs) and the degree
   to which SES and access to care explained disparities.
   Results: Overall, 59.6% reported being up-to-date on CRC screening.
   Self-reported CRC screening was highest in the White (62.0%)
   racial/ethnic group; followed by Black (59.0%); Native Hawaiian/Pacific
   Islander (54.6%); Hispanic-English (52.5%); American Indian/Alaska
   Native (49.5%); Asian (47.2%); and Hispanic-Spanish (30.6%) groups.
   Adjustment for SES and access partially explained disparities between
   Whites and Hispanic-Spanish (final relative risk [RR]=0.76, 95% CI=0.69,
   0.83); Hispanic-English (RR=0.94, 95% CI=0.91, 0.98); and American
   Indian/Alaska Native (RR=0.91, 95% CI=0.85, 0.97) groups. The RR of
   screening among Asians was unchanged after adjustment for SES and access
   (0.78, p<0.001). After full adjustment, screening rates were not
   significantly different among Whites, Blacks, or Native Hawaiian/Pacific
   Islanders.
   Conclusions: Large racial/ethnic disparities in CRC screening persist,
   including substantial differences between English-speaking versus
   Spanish-speaking Hispanics. Disparities are only partially explained by
   SES and access to care. Future studies should explore the low rate of
   screening among Asians and how it varies by racial/ethnic subgroup and
   language.

AB Context: Children from low-income and minority families are often behind
   higher-income and majority children in language, cognitive, and social
   development even before they enter school. Because educational
   achievement has been shown to improve long-term health, addressing these
   delays may foster greater health equity. This systematic review assesses
   the extent to which full-day kindergarten (FDK), compared with half-day
   kindergarten (HDK), prepares children, particularly those from
   low-income and minority families, to succeed in primary and secondary
   school and improve lifelong health.
   Evidence acquisition: A meta-analysis (2010) on the effects of FDK
   versus HDK among U.S. children measured educational achievement at the
   end of kindergarten. The meta-analysis was concordant with Community
   Guide criteria. Findings on the longer-term effects of FDK suggested
   "fade-out" by third grade. The present review used evidence on the
   longer-term effects of pre-K education to explore the loss of FDK
   effects over time.
   Evidence synthesis: FDK improved academic achievement by an average of
   0.35 SDs (Cohen's d; 95% CI=0.23, 0.46). The effect on verbal
   achievement was 0.46 (Cohen's d; 95% CI=0.32, 0.61) and that on math
   achievement was 0.24 (Cohen's d; 95% CI=0.06, 0.43).
   Evidence of "fade-out" from pre-K education found that better-designed
   studies indicated both residual benefits over multiple years and the
   utility of educational boosters to maintain benefits, suggesting
   analogous longer-term effects of FDK.
   Conclusions: There is strong evidence that FDK improves academic
   achievement, a predictor of longer-term health benefits. To sustain
   early benefits, intensive elementary school education is needed. If
   targeted to low-income and minority communities, FDK can advance health
   equity.

AB Objective To determine the relationship between child marriage (before

   age in Pakistan beyond those attributed to social vulnerabilities.
   Study design Nationally-representative cross-sectional observational
   survey data from Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey, 2006-2007 was
   limited to children from the past 5 years, reported by ever-married
   women aged 15-24 years (n = 2630 births of n = 2138 mothers) to identify
   differences in infectious diseases in past 2 weeks (diarrhea, acute
   respiratory infection [ARI], ARI with fever), under 5 years of age and
   infant mortality, and low birth weight by early (<18) vs adult (>= 18)
   age at marriage. Associations between child marriage and mortality and
   morbidity of children under 5 years of age were assessed by calculating
   adjusted OR using logistic regression models after controlling for
   maternal and child demographics.
   Results Majority (74.5%) of births were from mothers aged <18 years.
   Marriage before age 18 years increased the likelihood of recent diarrhea
   among children born to young mothers (adjusted OR = 1.59; 95% CI:
   1.18-2.14). Even though maternal child marriage was associated with
   infant mortality and mortality of children under 5 years of age in
   unadjusted models, association was lost in the adjusted models. We did
   not find a relation between girl-child marriage and low birth weight
   infants, and ARI.
   Conclusions Girl-childmarriage increases the likelihood of recent
   diarrhea among children born to young mothers. Further qualitative and
   prospective quantitative studies are needed to understand the factors
   that may drive child morbidity and mortality among those married as
   children vs adults in Pakistan.

   of patients failed to achieve response after 23 weeks on antipsychotic
   drug therapy. Patients with TRS had high rates of smoking (56%), alcohol
   abuse (51%), substance abuse (51%), and suicide ideation (44%). The
   incidence of severe adverse events to treatment was 4% (SD 7%). Mean
   quality of life for patients who were unresponsive or intolerant to
   treatment was approximate to 20% lower than that of patients in
   remission. Annual costs for patients with schizophrenia are $15 500-$22
   300 and are 3-11-fold higher for patients with TRS. TRS remains common
   and costly, despite availability of many treatment options, and
   contributes to a significant loss in patient quality of life. Although
   estimates in the literature vary greatly, TRS conservatively adds more
   than $34 billion in annual direct medical costs in the USA.

   ethics education program for high school students majoring in or
   planning to major in science and engineering. Our education program
   includes the fields of philosophy, history, sociology and ethics of
   science and technology, and other STS-related theories. We expected our
   STS-based science ethics education program to promote students'
   epistemological beliefs and moral judgment development. These
   psychological constructs are needed to properly solve complicated moral
   and social dilemmas in the fields of science and engineering. We applied
   this program to a group of Korean high school science students gifted in
   science and engineering. To measure the effects of this program, we used
   an essay-based qualitative measurement. The results indicate that there
   was significant development in both epistemological beliefs and moral
   judgment. In closing, we briefly discuss the need to develop
   epistemological beliefs and moral judgment using an STS-based science
   ethics education program.

AB The defetishization thesis claims alternative markets can lead to a more
   honest, less mystified relationship with food production and, in turn,
   strengthen civil society. Drawing from Marxian political economic and
   environmental sociological theory, I make three general claims: (1)
   capitalism is inherently ecologically and socially harmful; (2)
   "ethical" commodities derived from alternative markets cannot
   fundamentally counteract the pervasiveness and scale of (1); and,
   because of (1) and (2), (3) ethical consumerism does not defetishize the
   commodity form, but acts as a new layer of commodity fetishism that
   masks the harms of capitalism by convincing society that the harms of
   capitalism can be rehabilitated with the commodity form itself.
   Prescriptively, I argue traditional, large-scale political tactics would
   be needed for "defetishization" to take place.

   if religious variables affect suicide acceptability-attitudes and norms
   regarding the acceptability of suicide; and (2) whether religious
   variables dampen the otherwise strong effects of stress on suicide
   acceptability. We find that Protestantism, religious attendance, and
   religious salience are associated with lower levels of suicide
   acceptability. Yet, the negative impact of Protestantism is entirely
   mediated by religious attendance and salience. Moreover, the effects of
   stress on suicide acceptability are attenuated for those who have higher
   levels of religious attendance and salience. These results have
   important implications for understanding suicide acceptability and

AB The social stratification that takes place during the transition out of
   high school is traditionally explained with theoretical frameworks such
   as status attainment and social reproduction. In our paper, we suggest
   the cumulative dis/advantage hypothesis as an alternative theoretical
   and empirical approach that explains this divergence in institutional
   pathways as the result of the dynamic interplay between social
   institutions (in our case, schools) and individuals' resources.
   We use data from the NLSY79 in order to compute institutional pathways
   (defined by educational and occupational status) of 9200 high school
   graduates. Optimal Matching Analysis and Cluster Analysis generated a
   typology of life course pathways. Our results show that both ascribed
   characteristics and students' high school characteristics and resources
   are predictors of post-high school pathways. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   sexual violence in Nigeria.
   Design A multi-level cross-sectional study. We fit three 3-level random
   intercepts models to examine contextual and individual-level
   characteristics associated with help seeking, simultaneously.
   Setting Nigerian Demographic and Health Survey for 2008.
   Participants 5553 women (15-49years) who reported physical or sexual
   violence, drawn from 23715 women in the Nigerian Demographic and Health
   Survey that responded to questions on violence exposure.
   Main outcome measures Help seeking to prevent future victimisation was
   based on self-report.
   Results In our sample of women exposed to physical and sexual violence,
   39.7% reported that they sought help to stop the perpetrator from
   hurting them again. Rates of help seeking were geographically patterned
   by state (range: 12% to 65%). State-level development, measured by the
   Human Development Index (z-score), was positively associated with help
   seeking (OR=1.30, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.61), after adjusting for
   individual-level characteristics. State-level prevalence of violence
   against women (z-score) was negatively associated with help-seeking
   (OR=0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84), suggesting that service providers who
   may target their programmes to areas with high prevalence of violence,
   may need to simultaneously address barriers to help seeking. Few
   individual-level characteristics were associated with help seeking,
   including wealth, marital status, employment status, ethnicity, history
   of witnessing domestic violence and relationship to perpetrator.
   Conclusions Efforts to support female survivors of violence should
   consider broader social and contextual determinants that are associated
   with help-seeking behaviours.

   Design: Structured interviews.
   Setting: Outpatient pediatric resident and faculty clinic.
   Participants: A convenience sample of 54 low-income urban Latino parents
   of children aged <= 2 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Parent perspectives on text message reminders.
   Results: Most respondents were female (70%), married (63%), and fluent
   only in Spanish (89%). Most (83%) had a health literacy score in the
   adequate range. All (100%) reported being interested in receiving
   immunization reminders by text message, and 81% reported being willing
   to receive general appointment reminders by text message. Parents made
   72 comments regarding benefits of text message immunization reminders.
   The most common sub-category was usefulness of the reminders (53%).
   These comments reflected participants' busy schedules and the beneficial
   nature of text messages in reminding parents of appointments. Fifty-six
   comments were provided regarding barriers to receiving text message
   reminders. Most comments (77%) indicated no identifiable barriers.
   Twenty percent described barriers related to technology, such as costs
   or lack of text messaging service. Parents generated 108 comments
   regarding preferred content of reminders. The topics most frequently
   identified were appointment date and time (32%), names of the vaccines
   (19%), and the child's name (11%).
   Conclusions: Low-income Latino parents perceive text message
   immunization reminders as a feasible alternative to more traditional
   forms of communication.

   estimate the effect of perceived social factors in the community
   environment on the residents' self-reported psychopathology. The study
   sample consisted of 2034 men and women from 16 selected rural counties
   in three provinces of China. The social factors in the village community
   were measured by the World Health Organization Multisite Intervention
   Study on Suicidal Behaviors (WHO SUPRE-MISS) scale of Community Stress
   and Problems. The sychological and mental health of the individuals was
   assessed by (1) suicidal thoughts, plans and attempts (National
   Comorbidity Survey Replication or NCS-R), (2) pro-suicide attitudes
   (General Social Survey or GSS), (3) depression (Center for
   Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale or CES-D) and (4) suicide
   ideation (Scale for Suicide Ideation or SSI). Multiple regressions were
   performed separately for each of the four psychopathologic traits with
   the scale of Community Stress and Problems as the major predicting
   variable and age, gender, education years, marital status, family annual
   income, family status in village and religion as the confounding
   correlates. It is found that community stress and problems generally
   increase rural Chinese residents' psychopathologies, especially issues
   in health care, housing and transportation, which play more important
   roles than others. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB As social scientists have investigated the political and social factors
   influencing public opinion in science-related policy debates, there has
   been growing interest in the implications of this research for public
   communication and outreach. Given the level of political polarization in
   the United States, much of the focus has been on partisan differences in
   public opinion, the strategies employed by political leaders and
   advocates that promote those differences, and the counter-strategies for
   overcoming them. Yet this focus on partisan differences tends to
   overlook the processes by which core beliefs about science and society
   impact public opinion and how these schema are often activated by
   specific frames of reference embedded in media coverage and popular
   discourse. In this study, analyzing cross-sectional, nationally
   representative survey data collected between 2002 and 2010, we
   investigate the relative influence of political partisanship and
   science-related schema on Americans' support for embryonic stem cell
   research. In comparison to the influence of partisan identity, our
   findings suggest that generalized beliefs about science and society were
   more chronically accessible, less volatile in relation to media
   attention and focusing events, and an overall stronger influence on
   public opinion. Classifying respondents into four unique audience groups
   based on their beliefs about science and society, we additionally find
   that individuals within each of these groups split relatively evenly by
   partisanship but differ on other important dimensions. The implications
   for public engagement and future research on controversies related to
   biomedical science are discussed.

AB Why do people help strangers when there is a low probability that help
   will be directly reciprocated or socially rewarded? A possible
   explanation is that these acts are contagious: those who receive or
   observe help from a stranger become more likely to help others. We test
   two mechanisms for the social contagion of generosity among strangers:
   generalized reciprocity (a recipient of generosity is more likely to pay
   it forward) and third-party influence (an observer of generous behavior
   is more likely to emulate it). We use an online experiment with
   randomized trials to test the two hypothesized mechanisms and their
   interaction by manipulating the extent to which participants receive and
   observe help. Results show that receiving help can increase the
   willingness to be generous towards others, but observing help can have
   the opposite effect, especially among those who have not received help.
   These results suggest that observing widespread generosity may attenuate
   the belief that one's own efforts are needed.

AB Cities are increasingly the fundamental socio-economic units of human
   societies worldwide, but we still lack a unified characterization of
   urbanization that captures the social processes realized by cities
   across time and space. This is especially important for understanding
   the role of cities in the history of human civilization and for
   determining whether studies of ancient cities are relevant for
   contemporary science and policy. As a step in this direction, we develop
   a theory of settlement scaling in archaeology, deriving the relationship
   between population and settled area from a consideration of the
   interplay between social and infrastructural networks. We then test
   these models on settlement data from the Pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico to
   show that this ancient settlement system displays spatial scaling
   properties analogous to those observed in modern cities. Our data derive
   from over 1,500 settlements occupied over two millennia and spanning
   four major cultural periods characterized by different levels of
   agricultural productivity, political centralization and market
   development. We show that, in agreement with theory, total settlement
   area increases with population size, on average, according to a scale
   invariant relation with an exponent in the range 2/3 <= alpha <= 5/6. As
   a consequence, we are able to infer aggregate socioeconomic properties
   of ancient societies from archaeological measures of settlement
   organization. Our findings, from an urban settlement system that evolved
   independently from its old-world counterparts, suggest that principles
   of settlement organization are very general and may apply to the entire
   range of human history.

AB Humans in all societies form and participate in cooperative alliances.
   To successfully navigate an alliance-laced world, the human mind needs
   to detect new coalitions and alliances as they emerge, and predict which
   of many potential alliance categories are currently organizing an
   interaction. We propose that evolution has equipped the mind with
   cognitive machinery that is specialized for performing these functions:
   an alliance detection system. In this view, racial categories do not
   exist because skin color is perceptually salient; they are constructed
   and regulated by the alliance system in environments where race predicts
   social alliances and divisions. Early tests using adversarial alliances
   showed that the mind spontaneously detects which individuals are
   cooperating against a common enemy, implicitly assigning people to rival
   alliance categories based on patterns of cooperation and competition.
   But is social antagonism necessary to trigger the categorization of
   people by alliance-that is, do we cognitively link A and B into an
   alliance category only because they are jointly in conflict with C and
   D? We report new studies demonstrating that peaceful cooperation can
   trigger the detection of new coalitional alliances and make race fade in
   relevance. Alliances did not need to be marked by team colors or other
   perceptually salient cues. When race did not predict the ongoing
   alliance structure, behavioral cues about cooperative activities
   up-regulated categorization by coalition and down-regulated
   categorization by race, sometimes eliminating it. Alliance cues that
   sensitively regulated categorization by coalition and race had no effect
   on categorization by sex, eliminating many alternative explanations for
   the results. The results support the hypothesis that categorizing people
   by their race is a reversible product of a cognitive system specialized
   for detecting alliance categories and regulating their use. Common
   enemies are not necessary to erase important social boundaries; peaceful
   cooperation can have the same effect.

AB As punishment can be essential to cooperation and norm maintenance but
   costly to the punisher, many evolutionary game-theoretic studies have
   explored how direct punishment can evolve in populations. Compared to
   direct punishment, in which an agent acts to punish another for an
   interaction in which both parties were involved, the evolution of
   third-party punishment (3PP) is even more puzzling, because the
   punishing agent itself was not involved in the original interaction.
   Despite significant empirical studies of 3PP, little is known about the
   conditions under which it can evolve. We find that punishment reputation
   is not, by itself, sufficient for the evolution of 3PP. Drawing on
   research streams in sociology and psychology, we implement a structured
   population model and show that high strength-of-ties and low mobility
   are critical for the evolution of responsible 3PP. Only in such settings
   of high social-structural constraint are punishers able to induce
   self-interested agents toward cooperation, making responsible 3PP
   ultimately beneficial to individuals as well as the collective. Our
   results illuminate the conditions under which 3PP is evolutionarily
   adaptive in populations. Responsible 3PP can evolve and induce
   cooperation in cases where other mechanisms alone fail to do so.

   between 2001 and 2008.
   Methods. Data on pregnancy intentions from the National Survey of Family
   Growth (NSFG) and a nationally representative survey of abortion
   patients were combined with counts of births (from the National Center
   for Health Statistics), counts of abortions (from a census of abortion
   providers), estimates of miscarriages (from the NSFG), and population
   denominators from the US Census Bureau to obtain pregnancy rates by
   intendedness.
   Results. In 2008, 51% of pregnancies in the United States were
   unintended, and the unintended pregnancy rate was 54 per 1000 women ages
   15 to 44 years. Between 2001 and 2008, intended pregnancies decreased
   and unintended pregnancies increased, a shift previously unobserved.
   Large disparities in unintended pregnancy by relationship status,
   income, and education increased; the percentage of unintended
   pregnancies ending in abortion decreased; and the rate of unintended
   pregnancies ending in birth increased, reaching 27 per 1000 women.
   Conclusions. Reducing unintended pregnancy likely requires addressing
   fundamental socioeconomic inequities, as well as increasing
   contraceptive use and the uptake of highly effective methods.

   relevant covariates.
   Results. GMM yielded a 5-class solution for work trajectories in women.
   Higher work trajectories were associated with higher term birth weight
   and were robust to the inclusion of both education and income. A work
   trajectory that showed a sharp rise after age 24 years was associated
   with marked improvement in birth weight.
   Conclusions. Longitudinal modeling of work characteristics might improve
   capacity to integrate occupation into a life-course model that examines
   antecedents and consequences for maternal and child health.

AB Objectives. We examined the impact of Arizona's "Supporting Our Law
   Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act" (SB 1070, enacted July 29, 2010)
   on the utilization of preventive health care and public assistance among
   Mexican-origin families.
   Methods. Data came from 142 adolescent mothers and 137 mother figures
   who participated in a quasi-experimental, ongoing longitudinal study of
   the health and development of Mexican-origin adolescent mothers and
   their infants (4 waves; March 2007-December 2011). We used general
   estimating equations to determine whether utilization of preventive
   health care and public assistance differed before versus after SB 1070's
   enactment.
   Results. Adolescents reported declines in use of public assistance and
   were less likely to take their baby to the doctor; compared with older
   adolescents, younger adolescents were less likely to use preventive
   health care after SB 1070. Mother figures were less likely to use public
   assistance after SB 1070 if they were born in the United States and if
   their post-SB 1070 interview was closer to the law's enactment.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that immigration policies such as SB 1070
   may contribute to decreases in use of preventive health care and public
   assistance among high-risk populations.

AB Objective. To characterize the impact of hospital and physician ovarian
   cancer case volume on survival for advanced-stage disease and
   investigate socio-demographic variables associated with access to
   high-volume providers.
   Methods. Consecutive patients with stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian
   cancer (1/1/96-12/31/06) were identified from the California Cancer
   Registry. Disease-specific survival analysis was performed using
   Cox-proportional hazards model. Multivariate logistic regression
   analyses were used to evaluate for differences in access to high-volume
   hospitals (HVH) (>= 20 cases/year), high-volume physicians (HVP) (>= 10
   cases/year), and cross-tabulations of high- or low-volume hospital (LVH)
   and physician (LVP) according to socio-demographic variables.
   Results. A total of 11,865 patients were identified. The median ovarian
   cancer-specific survival for all patients was 28.2 months, and on
   multivariate analysis the HVH/HVP provider combination (HR = 1.00) was
   associated with superior ovarian cancer-specific survival compared to
   LVH/LVP (HR = 131, 95%Cl = 1.16-1.49). Overall, 2119 patients (17.9%)
   were cared for at HVHs, and 1791 patients (15.1%) were treated by HVPs.
   Only 4.3% of patients received care from HVH/HVP, while 53.1% of
   patients were treated by LVH/LVP. Both race and socio-demographic
   characteristics were independently associated with an increased
   likelihood of being cared for by the LVH/LVP combination and included:
   Hispanic race (OR = 1.72, 95%CI = 1.22-2.42), Asian/Pacific Islander
   race (OR = 1.57, 95%Cl = 1.07-2.32), Medicaid insurance (OR = 2.51,
   95%Cl = 1.46-4.30), and low socioeconomic status (OR = 2.84, 95%Cl =
   1.90-4.23).
   Conclusions. Among patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, the
   provider combination of HVH/HVP is an independent predictor of improved
   disease-specific survival. Access to high-volume ovarian cancer
   providers is limited, and barriers are more pronounced for patients with
   low socioeconomic status, Medicaid insurance, and racial minorities. (C)

AB Objective. To investigate geographical and socioeconomic variations in
   performance of lymph node dissection for the evaluation of patients with
   early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer.
   Methods. A population-based, retrospective cohort study was conducted
   using data from the National Cancer Institute's SEER Program for 15
   geographic registries and county-level measures. Women with early-stage
   epithelial ovarian cancer registered between 2000 and 2008 with known
   lymph node assessment status were studied. A multiple logistic
   regression analysis was used to evaluate the differences in the
   likelihood of lymph node assessment according to geographic SEER region.
   Results. After adjusting for tumor characteristics, demographics, and
   area-based socioeconomic measures, a significant relationship between
   SEER region and lymph node dissection remained. Compared to the region
   with the highest proportion of lymph node dissection, there is a
   significantly lower probability of surgical assessment of lymph nodes in
   8 of the remaining 14 geographical regions.
   Conclusions. The variation in ovarian cancer surgical care by region
   reported in this study has implications for access and outcomes for
   patients with early-stage disease. Study findings merit further
   investigation and should be characterized to permit targeted
   interventions aimed at reducing the observed disparities. (C) 2013

AB Moving beyond the cultural clash model that treats intergenerational
   relationships as unidirectional, this study, based on in-depth
   interviews with working-class bilingual Korean children from Los
   Angeles, finds that they actively assume class-specific language
   brokering work to ensure family survival. However, because class remains
   as the invisible social force in America, children who learned about
   parental financial and legal problems through language brokering work
   maintained the hidden injury of class. The findings indicate that
   normative notions of carefree childhood, racialized class, and
   essentialized Korean culture, which uniformly uphold quintessential
   middle-class values, can impart a buried sense of inadequacy and desire
   among socially excluded working-class children.

AB Objective: Routine, standardized screening for autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) has been hypothesized to reduce known racial/ethnic and
   socioeconomic status (SES) disparities in age of first diagnosis. This
   study explored demographic differences in toddlers' age and performance
   on developmental measures at the time of ASD assessment. Method:
   Toddlers (16-39 months at evaluation) who screened at-risk for
   developmental delay on the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers
   (M-CHAT) or M-CHAT-Revised (M-CHAT-R) and follow-up interview
   participated in a diagnostic assessment. Of these, 44.7% were
   racial/ethnic minorities and 53.5% were non-minorities. Child
   race/ethnicity, years of maternal education (MEd), and household yearly
   income (YI) were parent-reported. Results: Small but significant
   correlations were observed between MEd or YI and evaluation age and
   adaptive communication, socialization, and motor scores. Controlling for
   MEd and YI, minority racial/ethnic group did not predict child's
   performance on most measures and did not predict likelihood of ASD
   diagnosis. Differences in age at evaluation and receptive language
   skills were small effects. Conclusion: Significant but small effects
   emerged for SES and minority status on toddlers' age at evaluation and
   parent-reported adaptive skills, but these did not predict ASD
   diagnosis. The small magnitude of these effects suggests that routine,
   standardized screening for ASD in toddlers and timely access to
   diagnostic evaluation can reduce disparities in age at diagnosis and
   possibly reduce racial/ethnic disparities in access to services for ASD
   and other developmental delays.

AB Objective: To determine whether preschool-age children's participation
   in family routines is associated with greater likelihood of having high
   social-emotional health (SEH). Methods: Data come from the Early
   Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort preschool wave, a nationally
   representative sample of children born in 2001. Based on the literature
   and distribution of responses, 5 routines were categorized as present if
   children participated in family dinners >= 5 days per week, reading,
   storytelling, or singing >= 3 times per week, and play >= few times per
   week. A total routines score (0-5) was also computed. Mothers rated
   children's SEH on 24 items scored 1 through 5. Items were summed into a
   total score, which was di-chotomized at >1 SD above the mean, to reflect
   low/high SEH. Multivariable analyses assessed associations between SEH,
   routines score, and individual routines, adjusting for confounders.
   Results: Among; 8550 children, 16.6% had high SEH. For each additional
   routine in which a child participated, there was a 1.47 greater odds of
   having high SEH. In adjusted models, participating in dinners: 1.4 (95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.6), storytelling: 1.9 (95% CI, 1.6-2.4),
   singing: 1.5 (95% CI, 1.2-1.9), and play: 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1-1.5) was
   associated with increased odds of high SEH. Reading was not associated
   with greater odds of high SEH (1.2, 95% CI, 0.9-1.5). Conclusions:
   Participation in a higher number of routines and in select routines was
   associated with increased likelihood of having high SEH. Promoting
   family routines may contribute to greater SEH before school entry.

   as beneficial as well as the types of support perceived as unhelpful.
   Through one-on-one interviews with 34 individuals managing eating
   disorders, the transcribed data indicate recurring forms of helpful and
   unhelpful social support received from health care professionals.
   Helpful forms of social support identified include facilitating
   treatment, encouraging elaboration, holding accountable, demonstrating

AB Aims. Several groups have demonstrated the safety of ambulatory cerebral
   angiography, with no patients experiencing complications related to
   early discharge. Although this practice appears to be safe, the
   socioeconomic characteristics factoring in the selection of the patients
   have not been investigated.
   Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study involving 45,226
   patients undergoing outpatient and 159,046 undergoing inpatient cerebral
   angiography, who were registered in the State Ambulatory Surgery
   Databases (SASD) and State Inpatient Databases (SlD) respectively for 4
   US States (New York, California, Florida, North Carolina).
   Results. In a multivariate analysis of diagnostic cerebral angiography,
   Caucasian race (OR 1.36, 95% CI, 1.31, 1.42) and male gender (OR 1.36,
   95% CI, 1.31, 1.41), were significantly associated with outpatient
   procedures. Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (OR 0.60, 95% CI,
   0.54, 0.67), high income (OR 0.70, 95% CI, 0.67, 0.73), high volume
   hospitals (OR 0.69, 95% CI, 0.66, 0.73), and coverage by
   Medicare/Medicaid (OR 0.96, 95% CI, 0.92, 0.99) were associated with a
   decreased chance of outpatient procedures. Institutional charges were
   significantly less for outpatient cerebral angiography. The median
   charge for inpatient diagnostic cerebral angiography was $26,968 as
   compared to $16,151 in the outpatient setting (P < 0.0001,Student's
   t-test).
   Conclusion. Access to ambulatory diagnostic cerebral angiography appears
   to be more common for patients with private insurance and less
   comorbidities, in the setting of lower volume hospitals. Further
   investigation is needed in the direction of mapping these disparities in
   resource utilization.

   nurseries and greenhouses hired an average 2.38 part-time workers per
   horticulture operation or 0.80 part-time workers per acre placed under
   production. Empirical models were estimated to determine the significant
   factors affecting hiring decisions by this industry. Hiring decision
   models covered age groups, racial backgrounds, formal education levels,
   and gender. Analysis of the decision-making process involving the
   employment of hired workers among the participating wholesale nurseries
   and greenhouses provided insights into the hiring decisions in the
   industry. The hiring decisions by demographic characteristics serve as
   benchmarks for assessing impacts of regulations affecting the industry
   in the near future. About 1.9% of all the establishments employed more

AB The current study examines mechanisms of racial differences in symptoms
   of paranoid personality disorder (PPD) in a sample of adults ages 55-64
   from the St. Louis, MO area. Socioeconomic status (SES) and childhood
   trauma were tested as intervening variables in the association between
   race and PPD symptoms using structural equation modeling. PPD symptoms
   were modeled as a latent variable composed of items from the PPD scales
   of the Multi-Source Assessment of Personality Pathology self and
   informant reports and the Structured Interview for the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)
   Personality. Childhood trauma was measured using the Traumatic Life
   Events Questionnaire, and SES was a composite of parent education,
   participant education, and annual household income. Blacks exhibited
   higher levels of PPD symptoms across the 3 personality measures,
   reported significantly lower SES, and reported greater childhood trauma.
   The proposed model was a good fit to the data, and the effect of race on
   PPD symptoms operated mainly through SES. The indirect effect through
   SES was stronger for males. Findings suggest that racial differences in
   PPD symptoms are partly explained by problems more commonly experienced
   by Black individuals.

AB Social Emotional NeuroScience Endocrinology Theatre is a novel
   intervention program aimed at improving reciprocal social interaction in
   youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using behavioral strategies
   and theatrical techniques in a peer-mediated model. Previous research
   using a 3-month model showed improvement in face perception, social
   interaction, and reductions in stress. The current study assessed a
   2-week summer camp model. Typically developing peers were trained and
   paired with ASD youth (8-17 years). Social perception and interaction
   skills were measured before and after treatment using neuropsychological
   and parental measures. Behavioral coding by reliable, independent raters
   was conducted within the treatment context (theatre) and outside the
   setting (playground). Salivary cortisol levels to assess physiological
   arousal were measured across contexts (home, theatre, and playground). A
   pretest-posttest design for within-group comparisons was used, and
   prespecified pairwise comparisons were achieved using a nonparametric
   Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Significant differences were observed in face
   processing, social awareness, and social cognition (P<0.05). Duration of
   interaction with familiar peers increased significantly over the course
   of treatment (P<0.05), while engagement with novel peers outside the
   treatment setting remained stable. Cortisol levels rose on the first day
   of camp compared with home values yet declined by the end of treatment
   and further reduced during posttreatment play with peers. Results
   corroborate previous findings that the peer-mediated theatre program
   contributes to improvement in core social deficits in ASD using a
   short-term, summer camp treatment model. Future studies will explore
   treatment length and peer familiarity to optimize and generalize gains.

AB This study examines the relationship of neighborhood recreational space
   with youth smoking in mid- to low-income areas in the capital of Chile,
   Santiago.
   A unique data set of adolescents (n = 779, mean age = 14, 51 % male)
   provided home addresses of study participants which were geocoded and
   mapped. Satellite maps of neighborhoods were used to identify open
   spaces for recreational use (e.g., soccer fields and plazas). Thiessen
   polygons were generated to associate study participants with the nearest
   available open space using ArcGIS. Regression models, with smoking as a
   dependent variable, were estimated in which age, sex, family
   socioeconomic status, peer substance usage, neighborhood crime, and
   accessibility of open space were covariates.
   The results show that residential proximity to recreational space was
   significantly and inversely associated with tobacco consumption among
   female, but not male, adolescents. Age and neighborhood crime were both
   positively associated with tobacco consumption among both male and
   female adolescents.
   This study suggests that recreational spaces in proximity to residences
   may have a positive impact on reducing adolescents' inclination to
   consume tobacco. The relationship of the accessibility to such spaces
   with smoking appears to vary by adolescents' sex.

AB BACKGROUNDNational Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer centers provide
   high-quality care and are associated with better outcomes. However,
   racial and ethnic minority populations tend not to use these settings.
   The current study sought to understand what factors influence minority
   use of NCI cancer centers.
   METHODSA data set containing California Cancer Registry (CCR) data
   linked to patient discharge abstracts identified all patients with
   colorectal cancer (CRC) who were treated from 1996 through 2006.
   Multivariable models were generated to predict the use of NCI settings
   by race. Geographic proximity to an NCI center and patient
   sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were assessed.
   RESULTSApproximately 5% of all identified patients with CRC (n=79,231)
   were treated in NCI settings. The median travel distance for treatment
   for all patients in all hospitals was 5 miles. A higher percentage of
   minorities lived near an NCI cancer center compared with whites. A
   baseline multivariable model predicting use showed a negative
   association between Hispanic ethnicity and NCI center use (odds ratio,
   0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.79). Asian/Pacific Islander
   patients were more likely to use NCI centers (odds ratio, 1.41; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.28-1.54). There was no difference in use noted
   among black patients. Increasing living distance from an NCI cancer
   center was found to be predictive of lower odds of use for all
   populations. Medicare and Medicaid insurance statuses were positively
   associated with NCI center use. Neighborhood-level education was found
   to be a more powerful predictor of NCI use than poverty or unemployment.
   CONCLUSIONSSelect minority groups underuse NCI cancer centers for CRC
   treatment. Sociodemographic factors and proximity to NCI centers are
   important predictors of use. Interventions to address these factors may
   improve minority attendance to NCI cancer centers for care. Cancer

AB In the western United States, livestock grazing often co-exists with
   recreation, cultural resource management and biodiversity protection on
   federal and state protected rangelands as well as on many local
   government open space areas. While the value of livestock grazing for
   managing rangeland vegetation to reduce fire fuel loads and improve
   wildlife habitat is increasingly recognized by resource management
   professionals, public concerns, and conflict between recreationist and
   livestock have led to reductions in public land grazing. Traditional
   public input methods yield a constrained picture of people's attitudes
   toward cows and public land grazing. Public meetings, hearings, and
   surveys, the most commonly used mechanisms for public land managers to
   solicit public opinion, tend to foster participation of organized
   special interests or, in the case of surveys, focus on a specific topic.
   General public input is limited. This study explored the use of personal
   photography in social media to gain insight into public perceptions of
   livestock grazing in public spaces. Key findings of this study include
   that many recreationist in grazed San Francisco Bay Area parks shared
   views, interests, and concerns about cows and grazing on the
   photo-sharing website, Flickr(TM) that seldom show up at a public
   meeting or in surveys. Results suggest that social media analysis can
   help develop a more nuanced understanding of public viewpoints useful in
   making decisions and creating outreach and education programs for public
   grazing lands. This study demonstrates that using such media can be
   useful in gaining an understanding of public concerns about natural
   resource management.

AB This essay is based on my encounters with Erving Goffman as his student
   at Penn in the 1970s. It concerns Goffman's largely self-orchestrated
   place at Penn in various respects: his uneasy relationship with the Penn
   sociology department despite his academic fame; his disenchantment with
   "mainstream" sociology; his calibrated interactional style as a "profane
   jester," offset by his thoughtful seriousness as a mentor; his classroom
   deportment and no-nonsense teaching style. Goffman's casual classroom
   use of unseemly epithets is discussed as a pedagogical device for
   demonstrating the stigmatizing power of language. Goffman's suggestions
   for possible field-site studies contrast with his commentary on the
   current state of sociology and, by implication, his place in it.

AB Stress associated with concealing sexual orientation is a possible
   mechanism for health disparities among lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB)
   individuals. However, disclosing one's sexual orientation might not be
   uniformly healthy across social contexts.
   The present study tested whether being out is less healthy for gay and
   bisexual men of lower socioeconomic status (SES) relative to higher SES
   men.
   Using longitudinal data on gay and bisexual men (N = 564, ages 18-72),
   we examined whether the association between outness and physical health
   differs by SES.
   SES significantly moderated associations between outness and physician
   visits, nonprescription medication use, and physical symptoms. Outness
   predicted physical health benefits for higher SES men but health
   problems for lower SES men.
   The common assumption that disclosing one's sexual orientation is
   uniformly healthy may be less accurate (or inaccurate) for lower status
   groups. Future research should explore SES as context for minority
   stress and LGB health disparities.

AB Young children dislike getting less than others, which might suggest a

   typically not averse to others receiving less than themselves. These
   results are consistent with two alternatives: young children might not
   have any preferences about others receiving less than themselves, or
   they might have preferences for others receiving less than themselves.
   We test these alternatives with 5- to 10-year-old children. We replicate
   previous findings that children will take a cost to avoid being at a
   relative disadvantage, but also find that 5- and 6-year-olds will
   spitefully take a cost to ensure that another's welfare falls below
   their own. This result suggests that the development of fairness
   includes overcoming an initial social comparison preference for others
   to get less relative to oneself. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Identifying the goal of another agent's action allows an observer to
   make inferences not only about the outcomes the agent will pursue in the
   future and the means to be deployed in a given context, but also about
   the emotional consequences of goal-related outcomes. While numerous
   studies have characterized the former abilities in infancy, expectations
   about emotions have gone relatively unexplored. Using a violation of
   expectation paradigm, we present infants with an agent who attains or
   fails to attain a demonstrated goal, and reacts with positive or
   negative affect. Across several studies, we find that infants' attention
   to a given emotional display differs depending on whether that reaction
   is congruent with the preceding goal outcome. Specifically, infants look
   longer at a negative emotional display when it follows a completed goal
   compared to when it follows a failed goal. The present results suggest
   that infants' goal representations support expectations not only about
   future actions but also about emotional reactions, and that infants in
   the first year of life can relate different emotional reactions to
   conditions that elicit them. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB IMPORTANCE Community-based efforts to prevent adolescent problem
   behaviors are essential to promote public health and achieve collective
   impact community wide.
   OBJECTIVE To test whether the Communities That Care (CTC) prevention
   system reduced levels of risk and adolescent problem behaviors community
   wide 8 years after implementation of CTC.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A community-randomized trial was
   performed in 24 small towns in 7 states, matched within state, assigned
   randomly to a control or intervention group in 2003. All fifth-grade
   students attending public schools in study communities in 2003-2004 who
   received consent from their parents to participate (76.4% of the
   eligible population) were included. A panel of 4407 fifth graders was
   surveyed through 12th grade, with 92.5% of the sample participating at
   the last follow-up.
   INTERVENTIONS A coalition of community stakeholders received training
   and technical assistance to install CTC, used epidemiologic data to
   identify elevated risk factors and depressed protective factors for
   adolescent problem behaviors in the community, and implemented tested
   and effective programs for youths aged 10 to 14 years as well as their
   families and schools to address their community's elevated risks.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Levels of targeted risk; sustained
   abstinence, and cumulative incidence by grade 12; and current prevalence
   of tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use, delinquency, and violence in
   12th grade.
   RESULTS By spring of 12th grade, students in CTC communities were more
   likely than students in control communities to have abstained from any
   drug use (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] = 1.32; 95% CI, 1.06-1.63), drinking
   alcohol (ARR = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.09-1.58), smoking cigarettes (ARR = 1.13;
   95% CI, 1.01-1.27), and engaging in delinquency (ARR = 1.18; 95% CI,
   1.03-1.36). They were also less likely to ever have committed a violent
   act (ARR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.98). There were no significant
   differences by intervention group in targeted risks, the prevalence of
   past-month or past-year substance use, or past-year delinquency or
   violence.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using the CTC system continued to prevent the
   initiation of adolescent problem behaviors through 12th grade, 8 years
   after implementation of CTC and 3 years after study-provided resources
   ended, but did not produce reductions in current levels of risk or
   current prevalence of problem behavior in 12th grade.

AB To secure the interest of the personal self (vs. social others) is
   considered a fundamental human motive, but the nature of the motivation
   to secure the self-interest is not well understood. To address this
   issue, we assessed electrocortical responses of European Americans and
   Asians as they performed a flanker task while instructed to earn as many
   reward points as possible either for the self or for their same-sex
   friend. For European Americans, error-related negativity (ERN)-an
   event-related-potential component contingent on error responses-was
   significantly greater in the self condition than in the friend
   condition. Moreover, post-error slowing-an index of cognitive control to
   reduce errors-was observed in the self condition but not in the friend
   condition. Neither of these self-centric effects was observed among
   Asians, consistent with prior cross-cultural behavioral evidence.
   Interdependent self-construal mediated the effect of culture on the ERN
   self-centric effect. Our findings provide the first evidence for a
   neural correlate of self-centric motivation, which becomes more salient
   outside of interdependent social relations.

AB Purpose: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence rates continue to
   increase in the United States. Geographic variation in rates suggests a
   potential contribution of area-based factors, such as neighborhood
   socioeconomic deprivation, retail alcohol availability, and access to
   health care.
   Methods: Using the National Institutes of Health-American Association of
   Retired Persons Diet and Health Study, we prospectively examined area
   socioeconomic variations in HCC incidence (n = 434 cases) and chronic
   liver disease (CLD) mortality (n = 805 deaths) and assessed contribution
   of alcohol outlet density, health care infrastructure, diabetes,
   obesity, and health behaviors. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
   intervals (CIs) were estimated from hierarchical Cox regression models.
   Results: Area socioeconomic deprivation was associated with increased
   risk of HCC incidence and CLD mortality (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.03-2.14 and
   HR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.79-3.11, respectively) after accounting for age,
   sex, and race. After additionally accounting for educational attainment
   and health risk factors, associations for HCC incidence were no longer
   significant; associations for CLD mortality remained significant (HR,
   1.78; 95% CI, 1.34-2.36). Socioeconomic status differences in alcohol
   outlet density and health behaviors explained the largest proportion of
   socioeconomic status-CLD mortality association, 10% and 29%,
   respectively. No associations with health care infrastructure were
   observed.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a greater effect of area-based factors
   for CLD than HCC. Personal risk factors accounted for the largest
   proportion of variance for HCC but not for CLD mortality. Published by

AB Purpose: Poor and disparate reproductive health outcomes in the United
   States may be related to inadequate and differential receipt of women's
   health care. We investigated trends in and determinants of adult U.S.
   women's health service use, 2006-2010.
   Methods: We analyzed population data from 7897 women aged 25-44 years in
   the National Survey of Family Growth from 2006 to 2010 using
   multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Women's health service use in the past year was reported by 74%
   of the sample. Among noninfertile, sexually active women, 47% used
   contraceptive services; fewer used pregnancy (21%) and sexually
   transmitted infection (14%) services. In multivariable models, the odds
   of service use were greater among older, poor, unemployed women and
   women with less educational attainment than younger and
   socioeconomically advantaged women. Black women had greater odds of
   using pregnancy, sexually transmitted infection and gynecologic
   examination services than white women (odds ratio, 1.4 -1.6). Lack of
   insurance was associated with service use in all models (odds ratio,
   0.4-0.8).
   Conclusions: Although age-related differences in women's health service
   use may reflect fertility transitions, social disparities mirror
   reproductive inequalities among U.S. women. Research on women's health
   service use and outcomes across the reproductive life course and
   forthcoming sociopolitical climates is needed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

   DNA was obtained from 388 African Americans at age 19. Genotype at the
   5HTTLPR was determined, and methylation ratios for C-phosphate-G (CpG)
   residues were assessed. Exposure to cumulative SES risk was determined
   using repeated parental reports at ages 11-13. At high SES risk, CpG
   methylation patterns indicated altered cellular stress response in
   women, but not men, who carried a short allele at the 5HTTLPR. These
   changes in methylation patterns may lead to increases in mental and
   physical health risks. No genotype effect emerged for either women or
   men at low SES risk. Methylation patterns provide guidance in
   identifying pathways by which genetic susceptibility is transformed into

AB The scientific community is developing new global, regional, and
   sectoral scenarios to facilitate interdisciplinary research and
   assessment to explore the range of possible future climates and related
   physical changes that could pose risks to human and natural systems; how
   these changes could interact with social, economic, and environmental
   development pathways; the degree to which mitigation and adaptation
   policies can avoid and reduce risks; the costs and benefits of various
   policy mixes; and the relationship of future climate change adaptation
   and mitigation policy responses with sustainable development. This paper
   provides the background to and process of developing the conceptual
   framework for these scenarios, as described in the three subsequent
   papers in this Special Issue (Van Vuuren et al., 2013; O'Neill et al.,
   2013; Kriegler et al., Submitted for publication in this special issue).
   The paper also discusses research needs to further develop, apply, and

   of the framework design and its future development is to facilitate the

AB The new scenario framework for climate change research envisions
   combining pathways of future radiative forcing and their associated
   climate changes with alternative pathways of socioeconomic development
   in order to carry out research on climate change impacts, adaptation,
   and mitigation. Here we propose a conceptual framework for how to define
   and develop a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) for use within
   the scenario framework. We define SSPs as reference pathways describing
   plausible alternative trends in the evolution of society and ecosystems
   over a century timescale, in the absence of climate change or climate
   policies. We introduce the concept of a space of challenges to
   adaptation and to mitigation that should be spanned by the SSPs, and
   discuss how particular trends in social, economic, and environmental
   development could be combined to produce such outcomes. A comparison to
   the narratives from the scenarios developed in the Special Report on
   Emissions Scenarios (SRES) illustrates how a starting point for
   developing SSPs can be defined. We suggest initial development of a set
   of basic SSPs that could then be extended to meet more specific
   purposes, and envision a process of application of basic and extended
   SSPs that would be iterative and potentially lead to modification of the
   original SSPs themselves.

AB Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) describe alternative outcomes for
   socioeconomic development. Papers describing the conceptual framework
   for SSPs refer to challenges to mitigation and to adaptation as
   fundamental concepts. Identifying which socioeconomic factors are the
   most important determinants of these challenges, and how to combine them
   in an internally consistent manner, is critical to scenario design. Here
   we demonstrate a systematic and traceable approach for identifying and
   prioritizing scenario elements. In this study, we identify 13
   determinants of mitigation and adaptation challenges at a globally
   aggregated scale based on a survey of 25 experts. In addition, we use 19
   expert elicitations and a cross-impact balance analysis to create
   approximately 1.5 million combinations of trends for these determinants
   and rank them in terms of internal consistency. Using the 1,000 most
   consistent combinations, we construct composite metrics for challenges
   to mitigation and adaptation to uncover distinguishable characteristics
   for five types of SSPs: those with Low, Medium, and High challenges to
   both mitigation and adaptation (consistent with SSPs 1-3), and those in
   which adaptation challenges or mitigation challenges dominate
   (consistent with SSPs 4-5). We find a distinguishing characteristic for
   mixed typology SSP4 (low mitigation challenges, high adaptation
   challenges): High trends for innovation capacity could lower challenges
   to mitigation but not necessarily challenges to adaptation. We also find
   that a low trend for quality of governance consistently corresponds to
   higher challenges to adaptation. These findings are suggestive for
   future research on the SSPs in particular, while our analytical approach
   is instructive for scenario development in general.

   (RCI) has increasingly influenced several social sciences. A systematic
   effort to apply findings and concepts borrowed from RCI studies would
   offer three types of benefits to this scenario exercise. First, it would
   increase internal consistency within each of the projected scenarios.
   Second, it would enhance the realism of the entire suite of scenarios.
   Third, it would illuminate a range of factors, trends, and causal

AB The Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) offer benefits for communities

   some challenges need to be overcome in order to facilitate active IAV

   challenges, and possible strategies for enhancing the value of the SSP
   approach for IAV communities.
   Uses of the Shared Socioeconomics Pathways (SSPs) and the new climate
   scenarios by the climate change impact, adaptation, and vulnerability
   (IAV) research communities have been very limited because of a
   combination of the characteristics of most IAV research and the framing
   of SSPs at the outset. Recent refinements of the SSP framework should
   improve IAV receptivity to the SSP perspectives and tools and encourage
   engagement in the scenario development process, and ways can be
   suggested to accelerate this process; but a number of challenges remain
   to be addressed, many of them by the IAV communities themselves rather
   than by the SSP development process per se.

   pathways (SSPs) and the new scenarios that combine SSPs with
   representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for climate change impacts,
   adaptation, and vulnerability (IAV) research. It first provides an
   overview of uses of social-environmental scenarios in IAV studies and
   identifies the main shortcomings of earlier such scenarios. Second, the
   paper elaborates on two aspects of the SSPs and new scenarios that would
   improve their usefulness for IAV studies compared to earlier scenario
   sets: (i) enhancing their applicability while retaining coherence across
   spatial scales, and (ii) adding indicators of importance for projecting
   vulnerability. The paper therefore presents an agenda for future
   research, recommending that SSPs incorporate not only the standard
   variables of population and gross domestic product, but also indicators
   such as income distribution, spatial population, human health and
   governance.

AB The framework for the new scenarios being developed for climate research
   calls for the development of a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways
   (SSPs), which are meant to differ in terms of their challenges to
   mitigation and challenges to adaptation. In order for the scenario
   process to fulfill its goals, the research and policy communities need
   to develop a shared understanding of these concepts. This paper focuses
   on challenges to adaptation. We begin by situating this new concept in
   the context of the rich literatures related to inter alia adaptation,
   vulnerability, and resilience. We argue that a proper characterization
   of challenges to adaptation requires a rich, exploration of the concept,
   which goes beyond mere description. This has a number of implications
   for the operationalization of the concept in the basic and extended
   versions of the SSPs. First, the elements comprising challenges to
   adaptation must include a wide range of socioeconomic and even some
   (non-climatic) biophysical factors. Second, careful consideration must
   be given to differences in these factors across scales, as well as
   cross-scale interactions. Third, any representation of the concept will
   require both quantitative and qualitative elements. The scenario
   framework offers the opportunity for the SSPs and full scenarios to be
   of greater value than has been the case in past exercises to both
   Integrated Assessment Modeling (IAM) and Impacts, Adaptation, and
   Vulnerability (IAV) researchers, but this will require a renegotiation
   of the traditional, primarily unidirectional relationship between the
   two communities.

AB Studies of hunter-gatherer sociopolitical organization consistently
   exclude terrestrial big-game hunterspedestrian bison hunters, in
   particularfrom discussions of emerging complexity. To an important
   extent, this exclusion stems both from the ethology of bison and its
   consequences for mobile hunters and from the character of their
   archaeological record, which lacks conventional indicators of
   organizational complexity such as high-status burials and long-term
   storage facilities. However, this record exhibits stone architecture of
   monumental proportions. We argue that evidence of emerging
   sociopolitical complexity is embodied in the hunters'' ability to (1)
   invest extensively on landscape engineering to amass communal bison
   wealth for consumption, storage, and exchange, and (2) produce and
   reproduce ritual wealth among individuals and restricted sectors of the
   group. Through a multiscalar research design that integrates thousands
   of surface stone features with data recovered from kill site excavation,
   ethnohistorical records, and Blackfoot traditions, we demonstrate that
   Late Prehistoric bison hunters of the northwestern Plains endeavored to
   create conditions for permanence in their hunting territory by
   strategically emplacing and maintaining hunting facilities. These, in
   turn, would be used by ensuing generations of culturally related groups
   for whom the communal hunt was a formal and ritually managed act.

AB This study assesses the social, economic and environmental impacts and
   trade-offs of investment in tobacco in two districts in the Miombo
   woodlands of Malawi. Socioeconomic impacts were analyzed for stakeholder
   groups differentially affected by large-scale tobacco cultivation: those
   losing land to estates, those employed on estates, small-scale growers
   selling to the estates and small-scale wood suppliers. Tobacco growers
   emerge the biggest beneficiaries from the expansion of tobacco, with
   real returns among smallholders depending on the extent to which tobacco
   cultivation constricts or boosts other livelihood activities. Those
   losing land to tobacco estates are the major losers: efforts to
   recuperate their livelihoods prove less than adequate to offset the
   costs of land loss. Smallholder wood suppliers shared more or less the
   same outcome as employees in securing low returns, often inadequate for
   more than basic livelihood needs. The literature and fieldwork also
   document high rates of tobacco-induced deforestation from plantation
   expansion and unsustainable wood sourcing practices for tobacco drying
   and curing. Negative ecological externalities are born by local
   stakeholders and the public alike. We identify opportunities for
   leveraging more equitable and sustainable outcomes from land-based
   investments in forested landscapes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the associations between food environment at the
   individual level, socioeconomic status (SES) and obesity rates in two
   cities: Seattle and Paris.
   METHODS: Analyses of the SOS (Seattle Obesity Study) were based on a
   representative sample of 1340 adults in metropolitan Seattle and King
   County. The RECORD (Residential Environment and Coronary Heart Disease)
   cohort analyses were based on 7131 adults in central Paris and suburbs.
   Data on sociodemographics, health and weight were obtained from a
   telephone survey (SOS) and from in-person interviews (RECORD). Both
   studies collected data on and geocoded home addresses and food shopping
   locations. Both studies calculated GIS (Geographic Information System)
   network distances between home and the supermarket that study
   respondents listed as their primary food source. Supermarkets were
   further stratified into three categories by price. Modified Poisson
   regression models were used to test the associations among food
   environment variables, SES and obesity.
   RESULTS: Physical distance to supermarkets was unrelated to obesity
   risk. By contrast, lower education and incomes, lower surrounding
   property values and shopping at lower-cost stores were consistently
   associated with higher obesity risk.
   CONCLUSION: Lower SES was linked to higher obesity risk in both Paris
   and Seattle, despite differences in urban form, the food environments
   and in the respective systems of health care. Cross-country comparisons
   can provide new insights into the social determinants of weight and
   health.

AB IMPORTANCE Suicidal behavior has increased since the onset of the global
   recession, a trend that may have long-term health and social
   implications.
   OBJECTIVE To test whether suicide attempts among young people signal
   increased risk for later poor health and social functioning above and
   beyond a preexisting psychiatric disorder.
   DESIGN We followed up a cohort of young people and assessed multiple
   aspects of their health and social functioning as they approached
   midlife. Outcomes among individuals who had self-reported a suicide
   attempt up through age 24 years (young suicide attempters) were compared
   with those who reported no attempt through age 24 years (nonattempters).
   Psychiatric history and social class were controlled for.
   SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The population-representative Dunedin
   Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study, which involved 1037
   birth cohort members comprising 91 young suicide attempters and 946
   nonattempters, 95% of whom were followed up to age 38 years.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Outcomes were selected to represent
   significant individual and societal costs: mental health, physical
   health, harm toward others, and need for support.
   RESULTS As adults approaching midlife, young suicide attempters were
   significantly more likely to have persistent mental health problems (eg,
   depression, substance dependence, and additional suicide attempts)
   compared with nonattempters. They were also more likely to have physical
   health problems (eg, metabolic syndrome and elevated inflammation). They
   engaged in more violence (eg, violent crime and intimate partner abuse)
   and needed more social support (eg, long-term welfare receipt and
   unemployment). Furthermore, they reported being lonelier and less
   satisfied with their lives. These associations remained after adjustment
   for youth psychiatric diagnoses and social class.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Many young suicide attempters remain
   vulnerable to costly health and social problems into midlife. As rates
   of suicidal behavior rise with the continuing global recession,
   additional suicide prevention efforts and long-term monitoring and
   after-care services are needed.

AB IMPORTANCE We previously reported a 90% decreased risk in major
   depression, assessed prospectively, in adult offspring of depressed
   probands who reported that religion or spirituality was highly important
   to them. Frequency of church attendance was not significantly related to
   depression risk. Our previous brain imaging findings in adult offspring
   in these high-risk families also revealed large expanses of cortical
   thinning across the lateral surface of the right cerebral hemisphere.
   OBJECTIVE To determine whether high-risk adults who reported high
   importance of religion or spirituality had thicker cortices than those
   who reported moderate or low importance of religion or spirituality and
   whether this effect varied by family risk status.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Longitudinal, retrospective cohort,
   familial study of 103 adults (aged 18-54 years) who were the second-or
   third-generation offspring of depressed (high familial risk) or
   nondepressed (low familiar risk) probands (first generation). Religious
   or spiritual importance and church attendance were assessed at 2 time
   points during 5 years, and cortical thickness was measured on anatomical
   images of the brain acquired with magnetic resonance imaging at the
   second time point.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cortical thickness in the parietal regions by
   risk status.
   RESULTS Importance of religion or spirituality, but not frequency of
   attendance, was associated with thicker cortices in the left and right
   parietal and occipital regions, the mesial frontal lobe of the right
   hemisphere, and the cuneus and precuneus in the left hemisphere,
   independent of familial risk. In addition, the effects of importance on
   cortical thickness were significantly stronger in the high-risk than in
   the low-risk group, particularly along the mesial wall of the left
   hemisphere, in the same region where we previously reported a
   significant thinner cortex associated with a familial risk of developing
   depressive illness. We note that these findings are correlational and
   therefore do not prove a causal association between importance and
   cortical thickness.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A thicker cortex associated with a high
   importance of religion or spirituality may confer resilience to the
   development of depressive illness in individuals at high familial risk
   for major depression, possibly by expanding a cortical reserve that
   counters to some extent the vulnerability that cortical thinning poses
   for developing familial depressive illness.

AB IMPORTANCE Although substance use disorders (SUDs) are prevalent and
   associated with adverse consequences, treatment rates remain low. Unlike
   physical and mental health problems, treatment for SUDs is predominantly
   provided in a separate specialty sector and more heavily financed by
   public sources. Medicaid expansion under the Patient Protection and
   Affordable Care Act has the potential to increase access to treatment
   for SUDs but only if an infrastructure exists to serve new enrollees.
   OBJECTIVE To examine the availability of outpatient SUD treatment
   facilities that accept Medicaid across US counties and whether counties
   with a higher percentage of racial/ethnic minorities are more likely to
   have gaps in this infrastructure.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used data from the 2009 National
   Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services public use file and the
   2011-2012 Area Resource file to examine sociodemographic factors
   associated with county-level access to SUD treatment facilities that
   serve Medicaid enrollees. Counties in all 50 states were included. We
   estimated a probit model with state indicators to adjust for state-level
   heterogeneity in demographics, politics, and policies. Independent
   variables assessed county racial/ethnic composition (ie, percentage
   black and percentage Hispanic), percentage living in poverty, percentage
   living in a rural area, percentage insured with Medicaid, percentage
   uninsured, and total population.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Dichotomous indicator for counties with at
   least 1 outpatient SUD treatment facility that accepts Medicaid.
   RESULTS Approximately 60% of US counties have at least 1 outpatient SUD
   facility that accepts Medicaid, although this rate is lower in many
   Southern and Midwestern states than in other areas of the country.
   Counties with a higher percentage of black (marginal effect [ME], -3.1;
   95% CI, -5.2% to -0.9%), rural (-9.2%; -11.1% to -7.4%), and/or
   uninsured (-9.5%; -13.0% to -5.9%) residents are less likely to have one
   of these facilities.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The potential for increasing access to SUD
   treatment via Medicaid expansion may be tempered by the local
   availability of facilities to provide care, particularly for counties
   with a high percentage of black and/or uninsured residents and for rural
   counties. Although states that opt in to the expansion will secure

AB Patients with low socioeconomic status (low-SES) are at risk for poor
   outcomes during the post-hospital transition. Few prior studies explore
   perceived reasons for poor outcomes from the perspectives of these
   high-risk patients.
   We explored low-SES patients' perceptions of hospitalization, discharge
   and post-hospital transition in order to generate hypotheses and
   identify common experiences during this transition.
   We conducted a qualitative study using in-depth semi-structured
   interviewing.
   We interviewed 65 patients who were: 1) uninsured, insured by Medicaid
   or dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare; 2) residents of five
   low-income ZIP codes; 3) had capacity or a caregiver who could be
   interviewed as a proxy; and 4) hospitalized on the general medicine or
   cardiology services of two academically affiliated urban hospitals.
   Our interview guide investigated patients' perceptions of
   hospitalization, discharge and the post-hospital transition, and their
   performance of recommended post-hospital health behaviors related to: 1)
   experience of hospitalization and discharge; 2) external constraints on
   patients' ability to execute discharge instructions; 3) salience of
   health behaviors; and 4) self-efficacy to execute discharge
   instructions. We used a modified grounded theory approach to analysis.
   We identified six themes that low-SES patients shared in their
   narratives of hospitalization, discharge and post-hospital transition.
   These were: 1) powerlessness during hospitalization due to illness and
   socioeconomic factors; 2) misalignment of patient and care team goals;
   3) lack of saliency of health behaviors due to competing issues; 4)
   socioeconomic constraints on patients' ability to perform recommended
   behaviors; 5) abandonment after discharge; and 6) loss of self-efficacy
   resulting from failure to perform recommended behaviors.
   Low-SES patients describe discharge goals that are confusing,
   unrealistic in the face of significant socioeconomic constraints, and in
   conflict with their own immediate goals. We hypothesize that this goal
   misalignment leads to a cycle of low achievement and loss of
   self-efficacy that may underlie poor post-hospital outcomes among
   low-SES patients.

AB Little is known about how U.S. physicians' political affiliations,
   specialties, or sense of social responsibility relate to their reactions
   to health care reform legislation.
   To assess U.S. physicians' impressions about the direction of U.S.
   health care under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), whether that
   legislation will make reimbursement more or less fair, and examine how
   those judgments relate to political affiliation and perceived social
   responsibility.
   A cross-sectional, mailed, self-reported survey.
   Simple random sample of 3,897 U.S. physicians.
   Views on the ACA in general, reimbursement under the ACA in particular,
   and perceived social responsibility.
   Among 2,556 physicians who responded (RR2: 65 %), approximately two out
   of five (41 %) believed that the ACA will turn U.S. health care in the
   right direction and make physician reimbursement less fair (44 %).
   Seventy-two percent of physicians endorsed a general professional
   obligation to address societal health policy issues, 65 % agreed that
   every physician is professionally obligated to care for the uninsured or
   underinsured, and half (55 %) were willing to accept limits on coverage
   for expensive drugs and procedures for the sake of expanding access to
   basic health care. In multivariable analyses, liberals and independents
   were both substantially more likely to endorse the ACA (OR 33.0 [95 %
   CI, 23.6-46.2]; OR 5.0 [95 % CI, 3.7-6.8], respectively), as were
   physicians reporting a salary (OR 1.7 [95 % CI, 1.2-2.5]) or salary plus
   bonus (OR 1.4 [95 % CI, 1.1-1.9) compensation type. In the same
   multivariate models, those who agreed that addressing societal health
   policy issues are within the scope of their professional obligations (OR
   1.5 [95 % CI, 1.0-2.0]), who believe physicians are professionally
   obligated to care for the uninsured / under-insured (OR 1.7 [95 % CI,
   1.3-2.4]), and who agreed with limiting coverage for expensive drugs and
   procedures to expand insurance coverage (OR 2.3 [95 % CI, 1.8-3.0]),
   were all significantly more likely to endorse the ACA. Surgeons and
   procedural specialists were less likely to endorse it (OR 0.5 [95 % CI,
   0.4-0.7], OR 0.6 [95 % CI, 0.5-0.9], respectively).
   Significant subsets of U.S. physicians express concerns about the
   direction of U.S. health care under recent health care reform
   legislation. Those opinions appear intertwined with political
   affiliation, type of medical specialty, as well as perceived social
   responsibility.

AB Background: Racial differences have been well described for invasive
   pneumococcal disease (IPD), but little information exists on how race
   interacts with community socioeconomic factors.
   Methods: The Active Bacterial Core surveillance/Emerging Infections
   Program performed active surveillance for IPD in the 20-county
   Metropolitan Atlanta area. All IPD cases among children younger than 5
   years from 2001 to 2009 were geocoded and linked to census tract-level
   socioeconomic measures from the 2000 US Census. Race- and
   socioeconomic-specific average annual incidence rates per 100,000
   population were calculated. Trends in IPD incidence were determined by
   (2) tests for trend. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression.
   Results: IPD incidence among the total population of children increased
   as percentage of household poverty increased (P = 0.002), as median
   household income decreased (P < 0.001), as wealth decreased (P = 0.018)
   and as percentage of individuals with less than a high school education
   increased (P = 0.023). After stratifying by race, there was no
   significant linear trend between socioeconomic characteristics and IPD
   incidence among white children; among black children, however, IPD
   incidence decreased as socioeconomic conditions worsened. Despite
   adjusting for sex and socioeconomic factors, the IPD rate remained
   higher among black children compared with white children (RR = 1.60; 95%
   CI: 1.39-1.84). Differences in RR of IPD associated with highest poverty
   and lowest wealth noted in 2001 [RR = 2.71 (95% CI: 2.17-3.39) and 1.80
   (95% CI: 1.09-2.96), respectively] declined in 2009 [RR = 1.33 (95% CI:
   0.90-1.96) and 0.76 (95% CI: 0.48-1.19), respectively].
   Conclusions: Although socioeconomic disparities in IPD incidence exist
   among children, the association between socioeconomic characteristics
   and IPD rates may differ by race and may change over time.
   Community-level socioeconomic factors did not account for racial
   differences in IPD incidence.

AB Objective: Using Swedish nationwide registry data, the authors
   investigated genetic and environmental risk factors in the etiology of
   drug abuse by twin sibling modeling. The authors followed up with
   epidemiological analyses to identify shared environmental influences on
   drug abuse.
   Method: Drug abuse was defined using public medical, legal, or pharmacy
   records. Twin and sibling pairs were obtained from the national twin and
   genealogical registers. Information about sibling pair residence within
   the same household, small residential area, or municipality was obtained
   from Statistics Sweden. The authors predicted concordance for drug abuse
   by years of co-residence until the older sibling turned 21 and risk for
   future drug abuse in adolescents living with parental figures as a
   function of family-level socioeconomic status and neighborhood social
   deprivation.
   Results: The best twin sibling fit model predicted substantial
   heritability for drug abuse in males (55%) and females (73%), with
   environmental factors shared by siblings operating only in males and
   accounting for 23% of the variance in liability. For each year of living
   in the same household, the probability of sibling concordance for drug
   abuse increased 2%-5%. When not residing in the same household,
   concordance was predicted from residence in the same small residential
   area or municipality. Risk for drug abuse was predicted both by family
   socioeconomic status and neighborhood social deprivation. Controlling
   for family socioeconomic status, each year of living in a high social
   deprivation neighborhood increased the risk for drug abuse by 2%.
   Conclusions: Using objective registry data, the authors found that drug
   abuse is highly heritable. A substantial proportion of the shared
   environmental effect on drug abuse comes from community-wide rather than
   household-level influences. Genetic effects demonstrated in twin studies
   have led to molecular analyses to elucidate biological pathways. In a
   parallel manner, environmental effects can be followed up by
   epidemiological studies to clarify social mechanisms.

   significantly weaker socialization skills, including deficits in basic
   social behaviors. The results support the notion that (a) socialization
   deficits in ASD impact foundational social skills typically emerging in

   behaviors contribute to differential diagnosis, and (c) foundational
   social behaviors should be targeted for intervention.

   is in the area of social competence. However, the increasing need to
   provide qualified teachers to deliver evidence-based practices in areas
   like social competence leave schools, such as those found in rural
   areas, in need of support. Distance education and in particular, 3D
   Virtual Learning, holds great promise for supporting schools and youth
   to gain social competence through knowledge and social practice in
   context. iSocial, a distance education, 3D virtual learning environment
   implemented the 31-lesson social competence intervention for adolescents
   across three small cohorts totaling 11 students over a period of 4
   months. Results demonstrated that the social competence curriculum was

AB Effective conservation of biological diversity on private lands will
   require changes in land-use policy and development practice.
   Conservation development (CD) is an alternative form of residential
   development in which homes are built on smaller lots and clustered
   together and the remainder of the property is permanently protected for
   conservation purposes. We assessed the degree to which CD is permitted
   and encouraged by local land-use regulations in 414 counties in the
   western United States. Thirty-two percent of local planning
   jurisdictions have adopted CD ordinances, mostly within the past 10
   years. CD ordinances were adopted in counties with human population
   densities that were 3.0 times greater and in counties with 2.5 times
   more land use at urban, suburban, and exurban densities than counties
   without CD ordinances. Despite strong economic incentives for CD (e.g.,
   density bonuses, which allow for a mean of 66% more homes to be built
   per subdivision area), several issues may limit the effectiveness of CD
   for biological diversity conservation. Although most CD ordinances
   required a greater proportion of the site area be protected than in a
   typical residential development, just 13% (n = 17) of the ordinances
   required an ecological site analysis to identify and map features that
   should be protected. Few CD ordinances provided guidelines regarding the
   design and configuration of the protected lands, including specifying a
   minimum size for protected land parcels or encouraging contiguity with
   other protected lands within or near to the site. Eight percent (n =11)
   of CD ordinances encouraged consultation with a biological expert or
   compliance with a conservation plan. We recommend that conservation
   scientists help to improve the effectiveness of CD by educating planning
   staff and government officials regarding biological diversity
   conservation, volunteering for their local planning boards, or
   consulting on development reviews.

AB This article builds upon classic economic perspectives of financial
   behavior by applying the narrative identity perspective of cultural
   sociology to explain how lower-income families respond to indebtedness.
   Drawing on in-depth qualitative interviews with 194 lower-income
   household heads, we show that debt management strategies are influenced
   by a desire to promote a financially responsible, self-sufficient social
   identity. Families are reluctant to ask for assistance when faced with
   economic hardship because it undermines this identity. Because the need
   to pay on debts is less acute than the need to pay for regular monthly
   expenses like rent or groceries, debts receive a lower priority in the
   monthly budget and families typically juggle their debts in private
   rather than turning to social networks for assistance. In some cases,
   however, debts take on special meanings and are handled differently.
   Respondents prioritize debts when they perceive payment as affirming a
   self-sufficient or upwardly mobile identity, but they reject and ignore
   debts they view as unfair or unjust. Because the private coping
   strategies families employ trap them in costly cycles of indebtedness
   and hinder future mobility prospects, debt management strategies are
   consequential for long-term financial well-being.

AB In this article, we investigate public attitudes toward combat veterans
   returning from Iraq. Using data from a nationally representative survey
   that incorporates an experimental design, we assess the extent to which
   attitudes toward military veterans and private contractors differ, and
   whether public attitudes toward men vary based on combat and war zone
   experience. Drawing on social psychology and military sociology, we test
   hypotheses derived from a conceptual model of stigma and from research
   on the cultural injunction to "support the troops." Consistent with the
   first portion of the stigma model, members of the public are not
   surprised to learn that men who went to a war zone behave according to
   stereotypes that imply that such men have problems with mental health,
   substance abuse, and violent behavior. Yet they do not discriminate
   against these men. Instead they favor men who went to Iraq compared to
   those who stayed in the United States. They also favor veterans compared
   to contractors. While combat veterans may be stereotyped, they are not
   stigmatized. They benefit from symbolic capital, which outweighs the
   effect of stereotypes on discrimination.

AB Objective. This study examined whether a novel indicator of overall
   childhood adversity, incorporating number of adversities, severity, and
   chronicity, predicted central obesity beyond contributions of
   "modifiable" risk factors including psychosocial characteristics and
   health behaviors in a diverse sample of midlife adults. The study also
   examined whether the overall adversity score (number of adversities x
   severity x chronicity) better predicted obesity compared to cumulative
   adversity (number of adversities), a more traditional assessment of
   childhood adversity.
   Materials/Methods. 210 Black/African Americans and White/European
   Americans, mean age = 45.8; +/- 3.3 years, were studied
   cross-sectionally. Regression analysis examined overall childhood
   adversity as a direct, non-modifiable risk factor for central obesity
   (waist hip ratio) and body mass index (BMI), with and without adjustment
   for established adult psychosocial risk factors (education, employment,
   social functioning) and heath behavior risk factors (smoking, drinking,
   diet, exercise).
   Results. Overall childhood adversity was an independent significant
   predictor of central obesity, and the relations between psychosocial and
   health risk factors and central obesity were not significant when
   overall adversity was in the model. Overall adversity was not a
   statistically significant predictor of BMI.
   Conclusions. Overall childhood adversity, incorporating severity and
   chronicity and cumulative scores, predicts central obesity beyond more
   contemporaneous risk factors often considered modifiable. This is
   consistent with early dysregulation of metabolic functioning. Findings
   can inform practitioners interested in the impact of childhood adversity
   and personalizing treatment approaches of obesity within high-risk
   populations. Prevention/intervention research is necessary to discover
   and address the underlying causes and impact of childhood adversity on
   metabolic functioning. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is an indicator of general
   systemic aging, with shorter LTL being associated with several chronic
   diseases of aging and earlier mortality. Identifying factors related to
   LTL among African Americans may yield insights into mechanisms
   underlying racial disparities in health.
   Purpose: To test whether the combination of more frequent reports of
   racial discrimination and holding a greater implicit anti-black racial
   bias is associated with shorter LTL among AfricanAmerican men.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study of a community sample of 92
   African-American men aged between 30 and 50 years. Participants were
   recruited from February to May 2010. Ordinary least squares regressions
   were used to examine LTL in kilobase pairs in relation to racial
   discrimination and implicit racial bias. Data analysis was completed in
   July 2013.
   Results: After controlling for chronologic age and socioeconomic and
   health-related characteristics, the interaction between racial
   discrimination and implicit racial bias was significantly associated
   with LTL (b=-0.10, SE=0.04, p=0.02). Those demonstrating a stronger
   implicit antiblack bias and reporting higher levels of racial
   discrimination had the shortest LTL. Household income-to-poverty
   threshold ratio was also associated with LTL (b=0.05, SE=0.02, po0.01).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that multiple levels of racism, including
   interpersonal experiences of racial discrimination and the
   internalization of negative racial bias, operate jointly to accelerate
   biological aging among African-American men. Societal efforts to address
   racial discrimination in concert with efforts to promote positive
   in-group racial attitudes may protect against premature biological aging
   in this population.

   Purpose: This study examined trends in rural-urban disparities in life
   expectancy at birth in the U.S. between 1969 and 2009.
   Methods: The 1969-2009 U.S. county-level mortality data linked to a

   calculated by age, gender, and race for 3-year time periods between 1969

   Differences in life expectancy were decomposed by age and cause of

   Results: Life expectancy was inversely related to levels of rurality. In
   2005-2009, those in large metropolitan areas had a life expectancy of
   79.1 years, compared with 76.9 years in small urban towns and 76.7 years
   in rural areas. When stratified by gender, race, and income, life
   expectancy ranged from 67.7 years among poor black men in
   nonmetropolitan areas to 89.6 among poor Asian/ Pacific Islander women
   in metropolitan areas. Rural-urban disparities widened over time. In
   19691971, life expectancy was 0.4 years longer in metropolitan than in
   nonmetropolitan areas (70.9 vs 70.5 years). By 2005-2009, the life
   expectancy difference had increased to 2.0 years (78.8 vs 76.8 years).
   The rural poor and rural blacks currently experience survival
   probabilities that urban rich and urban whites enjoyed 4 decades
   earlier. Causes of death contributing most to the increasing rural-urban
   disparity and lower life expectancy in rural areas include heart
   disease, unintentional injuries, COPD, lung cancer, stroke, suicide, and
   diabetes.
   Conclusions: Between 1969 and 2009, residents in metropolitan areas
   experienced larger gains in life expectancy than those in
   nonmetropolitan areas, contributing to the widening gap.

AB Background. Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2) are
   common infections with serious sequelae. HSV-1 is an increasingly
   important cause of genital herpes in industrialized countries.
   Methods. Using nationally representative data from the National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we examined HSV-1 and HSV-2
   seroprevalence among 14- to 49-year-olds in the United States. We
   estimated seroprevalence in 1999-2004 and 2005-2010, stratified by
   sociodemographic characteristics and sexual behaviors. We also reviewed
   HSV-1 and HSV-2 seroprevalence from 1976-1980 to 2005-2010.
   Results. In 2005-2010, the seroprevalence of HSV-1 was 53.9%, and the
   seroprevalence of HSV-2 was 15.7%. From 1999-2004 to 2005-2010, HSV-1
   seroprevalence declined by nearly 7% (P < .01), but HSV-2 seroprevalence
   did not change significantly. The largest decline in HSV-1
   seroprevalence from 1999-2004 to 2005-2010 was observed among
   adolescents aged 14-19 years, among whom seroprevalence declined by
   nearly 23%, from 39.0% to 30.1% (P < .01). In this age group, HSV-1
   seroprevalence declined > 29% from 1976-1980 to 2005-2010 (P < .01).
   Conclusions. An increasing number of adolescents lack HSV-1 antibodies
   at sexual debut. In the absence of declines in HSV-2 infections, the
   prevalence of genital herpes may increase.

AB Purpose: The high costs of fertility care may deter couples from seeking
   care. Urologists often are asked about the costs of these treatments. To
   our knowledge previous studies have not addressed the direct
   out-of-pocket costs to couples. We characterized these expenses in
   patients seeking fertility care.
   Materials and Methods: Couples were prospectively recruited from 8
   community and academic reproductive endocrinology clinics. Each
   participating couple completed face-to-face or telephone interviews and
   cost diaries at study enrollment, and 4, 10 and 18 months of care. We
   determined overall out-of-pocket costs, in addition to relationships
   between out-of-pocket costs and treatment type, clinical outcomes and
   socioeconomic characteristics on multivariate linear regression
   analysis.
   Results: A total of 332 couples completed cost diaries and had data
   available on treatment and outcomes. Average age was 36.8 and 35.6 years
   in men and women, respectively. Of this cohort 19% received noncycle
   based therapy, 4% used ovulation induction medication only, 22%
   underwent intrauterine insemination and 55% underwent in vitro
   fertilization. The median overall out-ofpocket expense was $5,338 (IQR
   1,197-19,840). Couples using medication only had the lowest median
   out-of-pocket expenses at $912 while those using in vitro fertilization
   had the highest at $19,234. After multivariate adjustment the
   out-of-pocket expense was not significantly associated with successful
   pregnancy. On multivariate analysis couples treated with in vitro
   fertilization spent an average of $15,435 more than those treated with
   intrauterine insemination. Couples spent about $6,955 for each
   additional in vitro fertilization cycle.
   Conclusions: These data provide real-world estimates of out-of-pocket
   costs, which can be used to help couples plan for expenses that they may
   incur with treatment.

AB School boards have received little attention in sociology of education.
   Drawing on organizational sociology, a model of school board social
   capital is proposed that treats brokerage (external ties) and closure
   (internal ties) as the key dimensions of board functioning. The model
   brings together insights from limited research on school boards
   concerning members' internal and external ties and recasts them as the
   building blocks of a unifying theoretical framework. It also proposes
   specific performance outcomes at the district level. The model is tested
   using the data from a representative sample of Pennsylvania districts.
   The analysis not only explores brokerage and closure patterns among
   school boards, but also examines their implications for academic
   outcomes. Findings suggest that eighth grade reading and mathematics
   performance are highest in districts, where boards exhibit high levels
   of both brokerage and closure, and lowest in districts, where brokerage
   and closure are both low.

AB While there is considerable research on environmental performance of
   countries, there is very little that focuses on environmental health as
   a component of environmental performance and how environmental health is
   affected by national culture and human development. This study proposes
   and empirically tests three models that examine the effects of cultural
   values and human development on environmental health by incorporating
   different variables from Human Development Index, Hofstede's Cultural
   Dimensions, and Environmental Performance Index. Multiple linear
   regression models were employed to test the hypotheses on a sample of 67
   countries. Empirical results conclude that cultural dimensions of
   individualism and uncertainty avoidance, as well as human development
   components of life expectancy at birth, education, and income
   significantly influence environmental health performance of countries
   when we execute separate models. A combined model of the effects of
   national culture and human development on environmental health, however,
   shows only significant effects of human development components.
   Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

AB Objectives High rates of household participation are critical to the
   success of door-to-door vector control campaigns. We used the Health
   Belief Model to assess determinants of participation, including
   neighbour participation as a cue to action, in a Chagas disease vector
   control campaign in Peru.
   Methods We evaluated clustering of participation among neighbours;
   estimated participation as a function of household infestation status,
   neighbourhood type and number of participating neighbours; and described
   the reported reasons for refusal to participate in a district of 2911
   households.
   Results We observed significant clustering of participation along city
   blocks (p<0.0001). Participation was significantly higher for households
   in new versus established neighbourhoods, for infested households, and
   for households with more participating neighbours. The effect of
   neighbour participation was greater in new neighbourhoods.
   Conclusions Results support a contagion' model of participation,
   highlighting the possibility that one or two participating households
   can tip a block towards full participation. Future campaigns can
   leverage these findings by making participation more visible, by
   addressing stigma associated with spraying, and by employing group
   incentives to spray.

AB Background Low-income and some racial and ethnic subpopulations are more
   likely to suffer from obesity. Inequities in the physical and social
   environment may contribute to disparities in paediatric obesity, but
   there is little empirical evidence to date. This study explored whether
   neighbourhood-level socioeconomic factors attenuate racial and ethnic
   disparities in obesity among youth in the USA and whether
   individual-level socioeconomic status (SES) interacts with neighbourhood
   deprivation.
   Methods This analysis used data from 17100 youth ages 2-18years
   participating in the 2001-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey linked to census tract-level socioeconomic characteristics.
   Multilevel logistic regression models were used to examine neighbourhood
   deprivation in association with odds of obesity (age-specific and
   sex-specific body mass index percentile 95).
   Results The unadjusted prevalence of obesity was 15% among non-Hispanic
   white children and 21% among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-American
   children. Adjustment for individual-level SES neighbourhood deprivation
   and the interaction between these two factors resulted in a 74%
   attenuation of the disparity in obesity between non-Hispanic black and
   non-Hispanic white children and a 49% attenuation of the disparity
   between Mexican-American and non-Hispanic white children. There was a
   significant interaction between individual-level SES and neighbourhood
   deprivation where higher individual-level income was protective for
   children living in low-deprivation neighbourhoods, but not for children
   who lived in high-deprivation areas. Conversely, area deprivation was
   associated with higher odds of obesity, but only among children who were
   above the poverty threshold.
   Conclusions Future research on disparities in obesity and other health
   outcomes should examine broader contextual factors and social
   determinants of inequities.

AB Background Many individuals are subject to the physically and mentally
   detrimental effects of living in substandard housing and inadequate
   neighbourhoods. We propose that better physical neighbourhood quality
   can partially offset some of the negative effects of poor housing
   quality on psychological well-being.
   Methods Interviews and questionnaires were used to collect data in a
   cross-sectional study of housing quality, the state of the surrounding
   environment, and individual health and well-being for 5605 European
   adults from the Large Analysis and Review of European housing and health
   Status conducted by WHO in eight European cities. Multilevel random
   coefficient modelling was used to statistically analyse the main and
   interactive effects of housing quality and neighbourhood quality on
   psychological well-being. Socioeconomic status, employment status,
   gender and marital status were included as statistical controls.
   Results and conclusions Substandard housing quality and poor
   neighbourhood quality each contribute to lower psychological well-being.
   Furthermore better neighbourhood quality buffers against the negative
   effects of poor housing quality on psychological well-being. These
   results fill a gap in research concerning the ability of neighbourhood
   quality to amplify or attenuate housing quality impacts on well-being.

   social and occupational impairment, yet some are able to achieve a
   meaningful degree of functional improvement. A structural model based on
   Proactive Coping Theory was developed and tested in a longitudinal
   context to better understand: (1) the impact of proactive processes On
   functioning for people with SMI, and (2) the stability of the
   theoretical framework over time for this population. A latent path
   analysis examining social support, positive reappraisal, intrinsic
   motivation, and role functioning was tested with 148 severely mentally
   ill individuals receiving psychosocial rehabilitation treatment at
   baseline. An observed path analysis of the model was examined at six
   months post-baseline with 102 people. The baseline model displayed an
   excellent fit to the data and accounted for 54% of the variance in role
   functioning. Results at time 2 also suggest the empirical promise and
   potential longitudinal viability of the model. In line with Proactive
   Coping Theory and a social resources model of coping, social support may
   facilitate proactive coping processes to enhance role functioning, and
   these processes may be stable over time for people with SMI. (C) 2013

AB We document and interpret differences in life evaluation and in hedonic
   experience between those who live with children and those who do not;
   most previous literature has concluded that those with children have
   worse lives. For a sample of 1.8 million Americans of all ages, and
   without controls for other circumstances, we find little difference in
   subjective wellbeing between people with and without children. Among
   those most likely to be parents, life evaluation and all hedonic
   experiences except stress are markedly better among those living with a
   child. However, within this group, people who live with children are
   more likely to be married, richer, better educated, more religious, and
   healthier, all of which have well-documented positive associations with
   evaluative and hedonic wellbeing. With statistical controls for these
   background factors, the presence of a child has a small negative
   association with life evaluation, although it is associated with more of
   both positive and negative hedonics. These patterns are replicated in
   the English-speaking countries of the world, but not in other regions.
   We argue that the causal effect of children on parental wellbeing, which
   is the target for most of the literature, is not well defined. Instead,
   we interpret our rich-country results within a theory of children and
   wellbeing in which adults sort into parenthood according to their
   preferences. In poor, high-fertility countries, we find evidence that at
   least some people have children even when it diminishes their personal
   wellbeing.

   decreased in recent years, whereas the prevalence of obesity among their
   low-socioeconomic status peers has continued to increase. Additional

AB Since late 2010, the Arab world has entered a tumultuous period of
   change, with populations demanding more inclusive and accountable
   government. The region is characterised by weak political institutions,
   which exclude large proportions of their populations from political
   representation and government services. Building on work in political
   science and economics, we assess the extent to which the quality of
   governance, or the extent of electoral democracy, relates to adult,
   infant, and maternal mortality, and to the perceived accessibility and
   improvement of health services. We compiled a dataset from the World
   Bank, WHO, Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Arab Barometer
   Survey, and other sources to measure changes in demographics, health
   status, and governance in the Arab World from 1980 to 2010. We suggest
   an association between more effective government and average reductions
   in mortality in this period; however, there does not seem to be any
   relation between the extent of democracy and mortality reductions. The
   movements for changing governance in the region threaten access to
   services in the short term, forcing migration and increasing the
   vulnerability of some populations. In view of the patterns observed in
   the available data, and the published literature, we suggest that
   efforts to improve government effectiveness and to reduce corruption are
   more plausibly linked to population health improvements than are efforts
   to democratise. However, these patterns are based on restricted
   mortality data, leaving out subjective health metrics, quality of life,
   and disease-specific data. To better guide efforts to transform
   political and economic institutions, more data are needed for
   health-care access, health-care quality, health status, and access to
   services of marginalised groups.

AB Background: Research examining the impact of neighborhoods on asthma has
   shown an increased interest in the role of the psychosocial environment.
   We examined the associations between various measures of neighborhood
   safety, individual and family characteristics, and asthma outcomes among
   children in Los Angeles.
   Methods: Multilevel logistic regression models were used to analyze data
   on 3,114 children across 65 neighborhoods from Wave 1 of the Los Angeles
   Family and Neighborhood Survey (2000 to 2002). Primary caregivers
   reported asthma outcome and all individual covariates; home
   environmental characteristics were observed by the interviewer.
   Results: In fully adjusted models, parents who reported their
   neighborhood fairly safe or somewhat dangerous had lower odds of
   reported lifetime asthma compared to those who reported their
   neighborhood completely safe (OR 0.71; 95% CI 0.52-0.96 and OR 0.60; 95%
   CI 0.42-0.88 respectively). Conversely, parents who reported they could
   not trust their neighbors to keep their children safe had a nearly 40%
   increase in lifetime asthma compared to those who reported they could
   trust their neighbors to keep their children safe (OR 1.39; 95% CI
   1.07-1.81).
   Conclusions: The study demonstrates a complex pattern between various
   measures of neighborhood safety and asthma and suggests that these
   relationships may operate differently in Los Angeles. As an increasing
   proportion of children are growing up in newer Western and Southwestern
   cities, which have different physical layouts and residential
   segregation patterns compared to Northeast and Midwestern cities, future
   studies should continue to examine neighborhood psychosocial stressors
   and asthma in diverse contexts.

AB Though beliefs in Heaven and Hell are related, they are associated with
   different personality characteristics and social phenomena. Here we
   present three studies measuring Heaven and Hell beliefs' associations
   with and impact on subjective well-being. We find that a belief in
   Heaven is consistently associated with greater happiness and life
   satisfaction while a belief in Hell is associated with lower happiness
   and life satisfaction at the national (Study 1) and individual (Study 2)
   level. An experimental priming study (Study 3) suggests that these
   differences are mainly driven by the negative emotional impact of Hell
   beliefs. Possible cultural evolutionary explanations for the persistence
   of such a distressing religious concept are discussed.

AB The current research explored whether perspective-taking increases
   willingness to engage in contact with stereotyped outgroup members.
   Across three studies, we find that perspective-taking increases
   willingness to engage in contact with negatively-stereotyped targets. In
   Study 1, perspective-takers sat closer to, whereas stereotype
   suppressors sat further from, a hooligan compared to control
   participants. In Study 2, individual differences in perspective-taking
   tendencies predicted individuals' willingness to engage in contact with
   a hooligan, having effects above and beyond those of empathic concern.
   Finally, Study 3 demonstrated that perspective-taking's effects on
   intergroup contact extend to the target's group (i.e., another homeless
   man), but not to other outgroups (i.e., a man of African descent).
   Consistent with other perspective-taking research, our findings show
   that perspective-taking facilitates the creation of social bonds by
   increasing contact with stereotyped outgroup members.

AB The Spanish government recently announced an official fast-track path to
   citizenship for any individual who is Jewish and whose ancestors were
   expelled from Spain during the inquisition-related dislocation of
   Spanish Jews in 1492. It would seem that this policy targets a small
   subset of the global Jewish population, that is, restricted to
   individuals who retain cultural practices associated with ancestral
   origins in Spain. However, the central contribution of this manuscript
   is to demonstrate how and why the policy is far more likely to apply to
   a very large fraction (i.e., the vast majority) of Jews. This claim is
   supported using a series of genealogical models that include
   transmissible "identities'' and preferential intra-group mating. Model
   analysis reveals that even when intra-group mating is strong and even if
   only a small subset of a present-day population retains cultural
   practices typically associated with that of an ancestral group, it is
   highly likely that nearly all members of that population have direct
   genealogical links to that ancestral group, given sufficient number of
   generations have elapsed. The basis for this conclusion is that not
   having a link to an ancestral group must be a property of all of an
   individual's ancestors, the probability of which declines (nearly)
   superexponentially with each successive generation. These findings
   highlight unexpected incongruities induced by genealogical dynamics
   between present-day and ancestral identities.

AB China's unprecedented change offers a unique opportunity for uncovering
   relationships between economic growth and environmental pressure. Here
   we show the trajectories of China's environmental pressure and reveal
   underlying socioeconomic drivers during 1992-2010. Mining and
   manufacturing industries are the main contributors to increasing
   environmental pressure from the producer perspective. Changes in urban
   household consumption, fixed capital formation, and exports are the main
   drivers from the consumer perspective. While absolute decoupling is not
   realized, China has in general achieved relative decoupling between
   economic growth and environmental pressure. China's decoupling
   performance has four distinguishable periods, closely aligning with
   nation-wide major policy adjustments, which indicates significant impact
   of China's national socioeconomic policies on its environmental
   pressure. Material intensity change is the main contributor to the
   mitigation of environmental pressure, except for ammonia nitrogen, solid
   wastes, aquatic Cu, and aquatic Zn. Production structure change is the
   largest contributor to mitigate ammonia nitrogen emissions, and final
   demand structure change is the largest contributor to mitigate emissions
   of solid wastes, aquatic Cu, and aquatic Zn., We observe materialization
   trends for China's production structure and final demand structure
   during 2002-2007. Environmental sustainability can only be achieved by
   timely technology innovation and changes of production structure and
   consumption pattern.

AB Early perceptual operations are central components of the dynamics of
   social categorization. The wealth of information provided by facial cues
   presents challenges to our understanding of these early stages of person
   perception. The current study aimed to uncover the dynamics of
   processing multiply categorizable faces, notably as a function of their
   gender and age. Using a modified four-choice version of a mouse-tracking
   paradigm (which assesses the relative dominance of two categorical
   dimensions), the relative influence that sex and age have on each other
   during categorization of infant, younger adult, and older adult faces
   was investigated. Results of these experiments demonstrate that when sex
   and age dimensions are simultaneously categorized, only for infant faces
   does age influence sex categorization. In contrast, the sex of both
   young and older adults was shown to influence age categorization. The
   functional implications of these findings are discussed in light of
   previous person perception research.

AB Economic inequality is at historically high levels in the United States
   and is among the most pressing issues facing society. And yet,
   predicting the behavior of politicians with respect to their support of
   economic inequality remains a significant challenge. Given that high
   status individuals tend to conceive of the current structure of society
   as fair and just, we expected that high status members of the U.S. House
   of Representatives would be more likely to support economic inequality
   in their legislative behavior than would their low status counterparts.
   Results supported this prediction particularly among Democratic members
   of Congress: Whereas Republicans tended to support legislation
   increasing economic inequality regardless of their social status, the
   social status of Democrats - measured in terms of average wealth, race,
   or gender - was a significant predictor of support for economic
   inequality. Policy implications of the observed relationship between
   social status and support for economic inequality are considered.

AB Biomarkers of selenium are necessary for assessing selenium status in
   humans, since soil variation hinders estimation of selenium intake from
   foods. In this study, we measured the concentration of plasma selenium,
   selenoprotein P (SEPP1), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX3) activity and
   their interindividual differences in 383 low-income blacks and whites
   selected from a stratified random sample of adults aged 40-79 years, who
   were participating in a long-term cohort study in the southeastern
   United States (US). We assessed the utility of these biomarkers to
   determine differences in selenium status and their association with
   demographic, socio-economic, dietary, and other indicators. Dietary
   selenium intake was assessed using a validated food frequency
   questionnaire designed for the cohort, matched with region-specific food
   selenium content, and compared with the US Recommended Dietary
   Allowances (RDA) set at 55 mu g/day. We found that SEPP1, a sensitive
   biomarker of selenium nutritional status, was significantly lower among
   blacks than whites (mean 4.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 4.7 +/- 1.0 mg/L, p = 0.006),
   with blacks less than half as likely to have highest vs. lowest quartile
   SEPP1 concentration (Odds Ratio (OR) 0.4, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)
   0.2-0.8). The trend in a similar direction was observed for plasma
   selenium among blacks and whites, (mean 115 +/- 15.1 vs. 118 +/- 17.7 mu
   g/L, p = 0.08), while GPX3 activity did not differ between blacks and
   whites (136 +/- 33.3 vs. 132 +/- 33.5 U/L, p = 0.320). Levels of the
   three biomarkers were not correlated with estimated dietary selenium
   intake, except for SEPP1 among 10% of participants with the lowest
   selenium intake (<= 57 mu g/day). The findings suggest that SEPP1 may be
   an effective biomarker of selenium status and disease risk in adults and
   that low selenium status may disproportionately affect black and white
   cohort participants.

AB There is growing interest in expanding public health approaches that
   address social and structural drivers that affect the environment in
   which behaviour occurs. Half of those living with HIV infection are
   women. The sociocultural and political environment in which women live
   can enable or inhibit their ability to protect themselves from acquiring
   HIV. This paper examines the evidence related to six key social and
   structural drivers of HIV for women: transforming gender norms;
   addressing violence against women; transforming legal norms to empower
   women; promoting women's employment, income and livelihood
   opportunities; advancing education for girls and reducing stigma and
   discrimination. The paper reviews the evidence for successful and
   promising social and structural interventions related to each driver.
   This analysis contains peer-reviewed published research and study
   reports with clear and transparent data on the effectiveness of
   interventions. Structural interventions to address these key social and
   structural drivers have led to increasing HIV-protective behaviours,
   creating more gender-equitable relationships and decreasing violence,
   improving services for women, increasing widows' ability to cope with
   HIV and reducing behaviour that increases HIV risk, particularly among
   young people.

AB Contacts between hosts are essential for transmission of many infectious
   agents. Understanding how contacts, and thus transmission rates, occur
   in space and time is critical to effectively responding to disease
   outbreaks in free-ranging animal populations. Contacts between animals
   in the wild are often difficult to observe or measure directly. Instead,
   one must infer contacts from metrics such as proximity in space and
   time. Our objective was to examine how contacts between white-tailed
   deer (Odocoileus virginianus) vary in space and among seasons. We used
   GPS movement data from 71 deer in central New York State to quantify
   potential direct contacts between deer and indirect overlap in space use
   across time and space. Daily probabilities of direct contact decreased
   from winter (0.05-0.14), to low levels post-parturition through summer
   (0.00-0.02), and increased during the rut to winter levels. The
   cumulative distribution for the spatial structure of direct and indirect
   contact probabilities around a hypothetical point of occurrence
   increased rapidly with distance for deer pairs separated by 1,000 m -
   7,000 m. Ninety-five percent of the probabilities of direct contact
   occurred among deer pairs within 8,500 m of one another, and 99% within
   10,900 m. Probabilities of indirect contact accumulated across greater
   spatial extents: 95% at 11,900 m and 99% at 49,000 m. Contacts were
   spatially consistent across seasons, indicating that although contact
   rates differ seasonally, they occur proportionally across similar
   landscape extents. Distributions of contact probabilities across space
   can inform management decisions for assessing risk and allocating
   resources in response.

AB The growing evidence linking social connectedness and chronic diseases
   such as cancer calls for a better understanding of the underlying
   biophysiological mechanisms. This study assessed the associations
   between social network ties and multiple measures of inflammation in a
   nationally representative sample of adults with a history of cancer (N =
   1,075) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III
   (1988-94). Individuals with lower social network index (SNI) scores
   showed significantly greater inflammation marked by C-reactive protein
   and fibrinogen, adjusting for age and sex. Compared to fully socially
   integrated individuals (SNI = 4), those who were more socially isolated
   or had a SNI score of 3 or less exhibited increasingly elevated
   inflammation burdens. Specifically, the age- and sex-adjusted odds
   ratios (95%CI) for SNIs of 3, 2, and 0-1 were 1.49 (1.08, 2.06), 1.69
   (1.21, 2.36), and 2.35 (1.62, 3.40), respectively (p < .001). Adjusting
   for other covariates attenuated these associations. The SNI gradients in
   the risks of inflammation were particularly salient for the lower
   socioeconomic status groups and remained significant after adjusting for
   other social, health behavioral, and illness factors. This study
   provided initial insights into the immunological pathways by which
   social connections are related to morbidity and mortality outcomes of
   cancer in particular and aging-related diseases in general.

AB Purpose - This study applies theoretical perspectives from urban,
   environmental, and organization studies to examine if "smart growth"
   represents an ecological restructuring of the political economy of
   conventional urban development, long theorized as a "growth machine"
   (Molotch, H. (1976) The city as growth machine: Toward a political
   economy of place. American Journal of Sociology, 82, 309 - 332; Logan &
   Molotch, 2007); the purpose is to determine if there is a "smart growth
   machine."
   Design - Nine smart growth projects (SGPs) in four cities in California
   and Oregon were identified and semistructured interviews were held with
   the respective developers, architects, and civic officials involved in
   their implementation process. Comparative, descriptive, and grounded
   approaches were used to generate themes from interviews and other data
   sources.
   Findings - The findings suggest that an ecological modernization of
   urban political economy occurs through the coordination of
   entrepreneurial action, technical expertise, and "smart" regulation.
   Individual and institutional entrepreneurs shift the organizational
   field of urban development. Technical expertise is needed to make
   projects sustainable and financially feasible. Finally, a "smart"
   regulatory framework that balances regulations and incentives is needed
   to forge cooperative relationships between local governments and
   developers. This constellation of actors and institutions represents a
   smart growth machine.
   Originality - The author questions whether urban growth can become
   "smart" using an original study of nine SGPs in four cities across
   California and Oregon.

AB Purpose - To examine the recent popularity of the tiny house movement
   with a critical eye toward the growing commodification of sustainability
   in a market that continues to shelter economic and class privilege,
   despite that the movement itself emerges from a desire to consume less
   and contribute to community more.
   Methodology/approach - Written from the position of a tiny house builder
   and dweller, this study reads a range of recently published accounts of
   the tiny house movement, informed by contemporary work in environmental
   sociology. Investigates current rhetoric surrounding the movement with
   special attention to issues of mobility, consumption, and the movement's
   romanticism, with particular attention to the movement's invocations of
   Henry David Thoreau.
   Findings - Tiny house living can cultivate correctives to possible
   oversights or entitlements in environmental thought, challenge
   representations of the movement itself, and encourage those inside the
   "tiny" house movement to openly discuss the difficulties and
   capabilities endemic to tiny living.
   Social implications - Tiny houses, while still bound to forms of
   privilege, hold potential to be what some social science researchers
   have seen as best practice. Practices that link the practicality of
   realism with the zeal of romanticism can contribute to what has been
   found to be a positive correlation between conscious consumption and
   political activism.
   Originality/value - This critique offers a gentle corrective to
   unmitigated praise of the current tiny house phenomenon in order to
   highlight the movement's potential for addressing more pressing social
   justice and environmental issues.

   Methodology - We utilized a purposeful sample of pregnant adolescents or
   parenting adolescents (of an infant or toddler) ages 15-19 in a large
   Metropolitan Area in the Midwest. We employed a qualitative research
   design using two focus groups (n = 15) and participant observation (n =
   8) to identify themes. Content analysis was performed to better
   understand the study participants' experiences and perceptions. Findings
   Based on the focus group results, the custom journal was found to be the
   most popular outlet to offer self-expression and social support. Four
   main themes emerged from the data, including teen pregnancy overall is a
   problem, but having their own baby was not; strong desire for more
   health information and health education; perceived stigma from their
   teachers and parents; and frustration with the existing service
   programs.
   Research implications - The implications of the chapter are that the
   teen pregnancy norms fostered stigma and "social disgrace" that the
   pregnant and parenting adolescents experienced and ultimately thwarted
   their perceived and actual receipt of services. Future research should
   better understand the potential influences of internal and external
   pressures brought on by stigmatization as a contributing barrier to
   communicating social and health needs by pregnant and parenting
   adolescents.
   Value of chapter - This chapter developed, implemented, and evaluated
   media communication and found that it could structure social relations
   between pregnant and parenting adolescents and service providers. This
   chapter also extends development communication techniques, with its
   intellectual roots in rural sociology, by focusing on
   communication-oriented solutions and the development of new technologies
   to provide medical information with greater social equality and
   integrated support services for pregnant and parenting adolescents.

AB Traditional ergonomics fits into the continuity of the relationship
   between people, artifacts, which they build, their environment and
   societies. The current unprecedented technological development is
   breaking this continuity. We must think of human evolution and its
   relationship to work in new ways that space exploration has already
   begun to shape. This article outlines elementary strategies that explain
   how and why space exploration is essential for humankind's growth,
   evolution and sustainable development, not only at the individual
   ergonmic level but also at the societal level. Prospective ergonomics
   needs to take into account these strategies. We claim that if we place
   any living entity out of its natural environment - where it is adapted
   to live in-, this entity reacts to the new environment - where it is not
   adapted to live in- in a specific way to defend, adapt and survive. Not
   only such survival boundaries and new adaptation capabilities should be
   discovered, but also life requirements in nominal environments can be
   better understood. During the NASA Apollo program, humans already
   extended their living environment to the Moon. We do adapt to a new
   environment by using a "technological bridge" that facilitates and
   extends our "adaptation" capabilities much more rapidly than what
   natural evolution would require whenever possible. In space for example,
   it is mandatory to extend our living and working environment, but how
   far can we do this? Can we live everywhere? What are the fundamental
   limitations and possibilities that needed to be identified? For example,
   are we limited to habitable zones and regions in our solar system and
   galaxy? Are we able to fully adapt to microgravity? What are the
   technological possibilities needed to develop to have sustainable oxygen
   and water supply? Ultimately, what does it mean to be a human being in
   the Universe and on Earth in particular? We consider that these
   questions are crucial in the beginning of the 21st century because our
   planet Earth is changing rapidly when we consider several para- meters
   such as our global demography, constantly degraded ecology and
   uncontrollable economy. We are facing a blank slate exactly in the same
   way as when we analyze a possible life on Mars. We need to better
   understand human limitations and capabilities in both natural and
   artificial worlds that we have generated, and nature provides either
   nominally or by reaction to our expanding socio-technical ways of
   living.

AB Change in group size and composition has long been an important area of
   research in the social sciences. Similarly, interest in interaction
   dynamics has a long history in sociology and social psychology. However,
   the effects of endogenous group change on interaction dynamics are a
   surprisingly understudied area. One way to explore these relationships
   is through social network models. Network dynamics may be viewed as a
   process of change in the edge structure of a network, in the vertex set
   on which edges are defined, or in both simultaneously. Although early
   studies of such processes were primarily descriptive, recent work on
   this topic has increasingly turned to formal statistical models.
   Although showing great promise, many of these modern dynamic models are
   computationally intensive and scale very poorly in the size of the
   network under study and/or the number of time points considered.
   Likewise, currently used models focus on edge dynamics, with little
   support for endogenously changing vertex sets. Here, the authors show
   how an existing approach based on logistic network regression can be
   extended to serve as a highly scalable framework for modeling large
   networks with dynamic vertex sets. The authors place this approach
   within a general dynamic exponential family (exponential-family random
   graph modeling) context, clarifying the assumptions underlying the
   framework (and providing a clear path for extensions), and they show how
   model assessment methods for cross-sectional networks can be extended to
   the dynamic case. Finally, the authors illustrate this approach on a
   classic data set involving interactions among windsurfers on a
   California beach.

AB Social science research offers critical race theory (CRT) scholars a
   useful methodology to advance core CRT claims. Among other things,
   social science can provide CRT with data and theoretical frameworks to
   support key empirical claims. Social psychology and sociology in
   particular can help to explain how race constructs key aspects of social
   experience-for example, the role of race in suspicion of African
   Americans as potentially criminal and the use of excessive force by law
   enforcement. At the same time, a collaboration between CRT and social
   science risks undermining CRT critiques of objectivity and neutrality
   and potentially limits the theory's ability to combat structural forms
   of racial inequality. CRT scholars can mitigate these risks by choosing
   social science methods carefully and by recognizing that social science
   is only one among several modes of knowledge production.

AB Endogenous selection bias is a central problem for causal inference.
   Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in practice. This
   article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous
   selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernan et al.
   2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to
   highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g.,
   controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider
   variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
   one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is
   (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can
   result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome
   variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable.
   We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias,
   common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous
   examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network
   analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of
   education.

AB Sociologists are adding specific disciplinary accents to the burgeoning
   literature in colonial, imperial, and postcolonial studies. They have
   been especially keen to add explanatory accounts to the historical
   literature on empires. Starting in the 1950s, sociologists pioneered the
   study of colonies as historical formations. Against traditional
   anthropological approaches, sociologists insisted on studying colonizer
   and colonized in their dynamic interactions, asking how both groups were
   being transformed. Like contemporary postcolonial scholars, sociologists
   began asking in the 1950s how metropoles were being remade by overseas
   colonialism and colonial immigration. Echoing discussions in the 1950s
   among sociologists working in the colonies, current discussions of
   postcolonial sociology question the applicability of Western social
   scientific concepts and theories to the global South and ask how
   sociology itself has been shaped by empire. Current sociological
   research on empires focuses on six sets of causal mechanisms: (1)
   capitalism; (2) geopolitics, war, and violence; (3) cultural
   representations and subjectivity; (4) resistance and collaboration by
   the colonized; (5) institutional dimensions of empires and colonies; and
   (6) conflict and compromise among colonizers at the heart of colonial
   states.

   tools. We review the history and current state of visualization in
   sociology. Using examples throughout, we discuss recent developments in
   ways of seeing raw data and presenting the results of statistical
   modeling. We make a general distinction between those methods and tools
   designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present
   results to others. We argue that recent advances should be seen as part
   of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between
   researchers and with wider publics, and we encourage practitioners and
   publishers to work toward a higher and more consistent standard for the
   graphical display of sociological insights.

AB Interorganizational relationships connect people affiliated with
   organizations rather than corporate actors themselves. The managers and
   owners of organizations therefore do not always control these
   connections and consequently often cannot profit from them. We discuss
   the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own
   these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by
   them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the
   extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual
   (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel
   greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c)
   the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We
   discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these
   distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on
   the surface, and call for future research to pay closer attention to
   these issues.

AB The classical sociology of parties was born alongside parties
   themselves. It explored their dynamic interrelationships with states and
   society, as well as the tensions inherent in the fact that parties are
   simultaneously representatives and power seekers. Despite these rich
   foundations, from the 1960s the sociological approach came to be
   narrowly identified with a one-dimensional conception of parties, and
   political sociologists focused their attention elsewhere. This review
   contributes to efforts that began in the 1990s to reclaim the political
   party as a full-fledged sociological object. To this end, we track the
   hourglass-shaped trajectory of the sociology of parties: from broad
   Marxian and Weberian roots, to narrowing and near-eclipse after the
   1960s, to a reemergence that reclaims the breadth of the classical
   traditions. We conclude by suggesting six lines of inquiry that we
   believe would be fruitful, emphasizing both classical concerns that
   deserve more attention and innovative approaches that point in novel
   directions.

AB This article reviews recent research in fiscal sociology. We
   specifically examine contributions to the study of taxation that
   illuminate core issues in the sociology of contemporary capitalism,
   including the causes of poverty and inequality in rich countries and of
   inequality between rich and poor countries. Research on developed
   countries suggests that tax policy changes are important for explaining
   rising income inequality, tax policies may structure durable
   inequalities of race and gender, and earnings-conditional tax subsidies
   may alleviate poverty more effectively and with less stigma than
   means-tested social spending. Scholars also find the most generous
   welfare states rely the most heavily on regressive taxes, although there
   is disagreement over how this association arises. Comparative research
   on developing countries shows consumption taxes are more conducive to
   growth than taxes on income, tax-financed spending benefits growth if it
   is spent on productive investments, and taxation strengthened democracy
   and state building in medieval and early modern Europe. However, there
   is disagreement as to whether taxation contributes to state building in
   contemporary developing countries and whether foreign aid undermines
   democracy by undermining taxation. These questions are the focus of
   considerable current research.

   financial wealth, is extremely high. I describe the demographic traits
   and finances of households who are in the one percent and discuss how
   these have changed in the past decade. I review literature that explains
   rising top incomes, and I propose that future research will usefully
   concentrate more on top wealth owners and on the demographic and life

   individual-level risk; (b) the lived experiences of HIV-positive people;
   and (c) the collective response to HIV/AIDS through community-based
   services, political activism and social movements, and public policy.
   Sociologists have pursued inquiry in all of these areas and have often
   advanced the implicit and explicit use of approaches that reveal the
   epidemic's embedded power relations. Previous research and the dynamics
   of the epidemic suggest a fundamental argument: HIV/AIDS is an epidemic
   of intersectional inequality that is fueled by racial, gender, class,
   and sexual inequities at the macro-structural, meso-institutional, and
   micro-interpersonal levels. These inequalities significantly shape the
   likelihood of exposure to the virus; the realities of living with the
   infection; and medical, programmatic, political, and social-scientific
   responses.

   discuss ways in which women in industrial cities challenged the ideology
   of separate spheres. Next, I suggest that the post-World War II city was

   modernism of the same era, and in the third section, I explore how that
   urban structure limited women's opportunities outside the home. In the

   beyond masculine and feminine categories to include lesbians, gays, and
   transgender individuals. The article ends with a review of how women's
   and gay rights movements, gentrification, and planning practices have
   shaped a more gender-neutral contemporary metropolis.

   of African American students to measure their academic performance when
   faced with the potential of confirming negative stereotype of their
   population (Mosley & Rosenberg 2007). However, it can also be used
   effectively when applied to the study of Asian American population. For
   a number of Asian Americans living in the United States, the "model
   minority" myth has resulted in empirically unsubstantiated opinions and
   misconceptions about the population (Orsuwan 2011). Therefore, there is
   a current lack of literature on the struggles that many Asian American
   students face due to a pervasive belief that they are the excelling
   group in American higher education. This study is aimed to identify some

   discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a
   race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum
   participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use
   color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads
   (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind
   discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric
   of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees
   forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This
   neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance,
   which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby
   participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While
   color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white
   and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to
   include nonwhite immigrants.

AB Glaeser and Vigdor (2012) recently declared 'the end of a segregated
   century'. Because America has returned to 1910 segregation levels, it
   has allegedly achieved transcendence over racism. After all, the authors
   note, government no longer endorses housing discrimination, all-white
   neighborhoods are extinct, and white racial attitudes have liberalized.
   Despite the proclamation, many questions regarding segregation remain
   unanswered by Glaeser and Vigdor. Namely, how can segregation be
   conceptualized and its measurement improved, what might alternative
   methods for analyzing it yield, and why does it matter in the first
   place? To prompt an overdue substantive and methodological discussion,
   we undertake a case study analysis of Cook County, Illinois to address
   these questions. Our analytic goal is to illuminate how segregation is a
   much more complex matter than many analyses reflect, and when this is
   taken into account, it becomes readily apparent that any assertions of
   racial transcendence are quite premature.

AB This article utilizes an auto-ethnographic approach to consider some of
   the tensions inherent in the requirements of sociology as an industry.
   Short production timelines, high expected output, and classical notions
   of objectivity continue to organize sociological inquiry, even as
   critical sociologists continue to question these very relations of
   ruling. This essay contributes to ongoing critical analyses of
   sociology's disciplinary paradigm and offers a consideration of the
   interstitial spaces potentially produced by 'slow sociology' as one
   possible antidote to these limitations. Productive of a borderlands
   epistemology, slow sociology resists the ruling relations of sociology
   and encourages nuanced translation work between cultures of study,
   cultures of habitation, and cultures of disciplined inquiry, fostering
   links between public society and academic endeavors.

AB Recently, there has been an increased interest in using behavioral

   systems. A diversity of software tools are used to implement such
   experiments. We evaluated various publicly available platforms that
   could be used in research and education on the governance of
   social-ecological systems. The aims of the various platforms are
   distinct, and this is noticeable in the differences in their
   user-friendliness and their adaptability to novel research questions.
   The more easily accessible platforms are useful for prototyping
   experiments and for educational purposes to illustrate theoretical
   concepts. To advance novel research aims, more elaborate programming
   experience is required to either implement an experiment from scratch or
   adjust existing experimental software. There is no ideal platform best
   suited for all possible use cases, but we have provided a menu of
   options and their associated trade-offs.

AB Climate change challenges the traditional goals and conservation
   strategies of protected areas, necessitating adaptation to changing
   conditions. Denali National Park and Preserve (Denali) in south central
   Alaska, USA, is a vast landscape that is responding to climate change in
   ways that will impact both ecological resources and local communities.
   Local observations help to inform understanding of climate change and
   adaptation planning, but whose knowledge is most important to consider?
   For this project we interviewed long-term Denali staff, scientists,
   subsistence community members, bus drivers, and business owners to
   assess what types of observations each can contribute, how climate
   change is impacting each, and what they think the National Park Service
   should do to adapt. The project shows that each type of long-term
   observer has different types of observations, but that those who depend
   more directly on natural resources for their livelihoods have more and
   different observations than those who do not. These findings suggest
   that engaging multiple groups of stakeholders who interact with the park
   in distinct ways adds substantially to the information provided by
   Denali staff and scientists and offers a broader foundation for
   adaptation planning. It also suggests that traditional protected area
   paradigms that fail to learn from and foster appropriate engagement of
   people may be maladaptive in the context of climate change.

AB Most rural residents in Arctic communities rely on motorized
   transportation to hunt, fish, trap, and gather subsistence resources.
   Although these technologies have created advantages, one significant
   disadvantage is that peoples' ability to meet their nutritional and
   cultural needs now depends on consistent opportunities for wage
   employment and availability of affordable fuel. Recent qualitative
   research suggested that rising fuel prices have disrupted subsistence
   lifestyles in the Arctic. Our objectives were to collaborate with
   subsistence users in rural Alaskan communities to quantify how rising
   fuel costs have impacted subsistence activities and explore ways local
   residents may adapt to the trajectory of change. We conducted interviews
   with 178 subsistence harvesters in 8 communities. During the last 10
   years, 81% of the harvesters reduced the distance they traveled for
   subsistence and 89% reduced the number of subsistence trips they took
   because of gasoline costs. During the last 10 years, the median distance
   traveled to perform subsistence decreased by 60%, and the median annual
   number of trips taken to perform subsistence decreased by 75%. The
   change in subsistence activity was similar across and within
   communities. Eighty-five percent of the people interviewed reported that
   they were making sacrifices with serious consequences, such as putting
   off paying monthly bills, to buy gasoline for subsistence activities. To
   adapt to high gasoline prices, most participants said that they are
   using more efficient modes of transportation (69%), followed by more
   sharing of gasoline costs with family and friends (37%), and conducting
   more multipurpose subsistence trips (20%). With subsistence practices
   being critical to food security and cultural identity in the Arctic, our
   results suggest that unaffordable fuel has threatened social resilience.
   Because global markets drive gasoline prices, we suggest that future
   research focus on the effectiveness of adaptation options that build
   resilience into subsistence systems.

AB Social-ecological systems are governed by a complex of ecology of games
   featuring multiple actors, policy institutions, and issues, and not just
   single institutions operating in isolation. We update Long's (1958)
   ecology of games to analyze the coordinating roles of actors and
   institutions in the context of the ecology of water management games in
   San Francisco Bay, California. The ecology of games is operationalized
   as a bipartite network with actors participating in institutions, and
   exponential random graph models are used to test hypotheses about the
   structural features of the network. We found that policy coordination is
   facilitated mostly by federal and state agencies and collaborative
   institutions that span geographic boundaries. Network configurations
   associated with closure show the most significant departures from the
   predicted model values, consistent with the Berardo and Scholz (2010)
   "risk hypothesis" that closure is important for solving cooperation

   scales. The importance of so-called social-ecological symbols,
   especially the potent hybrid symbols of trees and their handling after a
   disaster is interrogated. The paper explores the notion of hybridity,
   and applies it to the hybrid symbol of the tree in postdisaster
   contexts. The paper briefly highlights three U.S. cases documenting the
   symbolic roles of trees in a context of significant shock to a
   social-ecological system: the terrorist attacks on New York City in
   2001, the devastating hurricane that struck New Orleans in 2005, and the

AB Communities of Alaska's North Slope face increased stresses from
   cumulative effects of industrial development, resource use, and changing
   cryospheric and socioeconomic conditions. Given these multiple
   pressures, what avenues exist for citizens and decision makers to
   exchange knowledge about impacts of oil resource extraction in Alaska,
   and how do the successes and failures of knowledge exchange affect the
   resilience of the local social ecological system? We focused our
   research on the risk management process of Alaska North Slope oil
   resources, drawing on literature that has grown out of the risk society
   thesis and concepts of resilience science. We surveyed state and federal
   initiatives designed to increase local and indigenous stakeholder
   engagement in science and policy issues because such guidelines and
   regulations impact on the abilities of local peoples and communities to
   adapt sustainability strategies. Perceived risks and desired outcomes of
   stakeholders on the front lines of climate change and resource
   development should inform regulations that aim to anticipate future
   impacts and needed adaptation strategies. Integration of local values
   and perceptions in an adaptive risk management approach is fundamental
   in resilience-based ecosystem stewardship. The three case studies we
   have presented show that current provisions fail to equitably include
   the local and indigenous knowledge of Alaska's North Slope Borough
   communities in environmental risk mediation in proportion to the scope
   of risks inherent in current oil development policies. Our findings
   underscore the need for new, proactive risk management strategies that
   build on local stakeholders' rationalities on the trade-offs of risks
   and opportunities.

AB The Laurentian Great Lakes and the Swedish Great Lakes both have a long
   history of being invaded by non-native species, although the total
   number reported in the former system far exceeds that in the latter.
   Until about the 1980s, non-native species that had the greatest
   ecosystem and/or socioeconomic impacts in both systems were controlled,
   or their negative impacts ameliorated by management actions; most
   prominent of these species were the Sea Lamprey and Alewife in the
   Laurentian Great Lakes, and Crayfish plague in the Swedish Great Lakes.
   In the 1980s, a number of species native to the Ponto-Caspian region
   were introduced into the Laurentian Great Lakes via the ballast water of
   transoceanic ships, and these species had significant ecosystem impacts,
   could not be controlled by management actions, and changed the way these
   lake resources were managed. Similar introductions have not occurred in
   the Swedish Great Lakes, but many of the same species that have impacted
   the Laurentian Great Lakes are spreading in European systems and in the
   Baltic Sea, and thus could pose an invasion risk to lakes in Sweden.
   Based on experiences in the Laurentian Great Lakes, it seems prudent to
   conduct a thorough assessment of these invaders relative to potential
   vectors of introduction for the Swedish Great Lakes. Also, an assessment
   of long-term monitoring programs is in order. Long-term data provides
   baseline information of the ecosystem and tracks ecosystem responses if
   indeed an invader becomes established.

AB Purpose - An inquiry into the constitution of the experience of
   patienthood. It understands "becoming a patient" as a production of a
   subjectivity, in other words as a process of individuation and milieu
   that occurs through an ontology of production. This ontology of
   production can, of course, also be understood as a political ontology.
   Therefore, this is, first of all, an inquiry into a mode of production,
   and, secondly, an inquiry into its relation to the issue of social
   justice - because of effects of digital divisions. In these terms, it
   also reflects on how expert discourses, such as in medical sociology and
   science studies (STS), can
   Approach - An integrative mode of discourse analysis, strongly related
   to discursive institutionalism, called semantic agency theory: it
   considers those arrangements (institutions, informal organizations,
   networks, collectivities, etc.) and assemblages (intellectual equipment,
   vernacular epistemologies, etc.) that are constitutive of how the issue
   of "patient experience" can be articulated form its position within an
   ontology of production.
   Findings - The aim not being the production of a finite result, what is
   needed is a shift in how "the construction of patient experience" is
   produced by expert discourses. While the inquiry is not primarily an
   empirical study and is also limited to "Western societies," it
   emphasizes that there is a relation between political ontologies
   (including the issues of social justice) and the subjectivities that
   shape the experiences of people in contemporary health care systems,
   and, finally, that this relation is troubled by the effects of the
   digital divide(s).
   Originality - A proposal " to interrogate and trouble" some innovative
   extensions and revisions - even though it will not be able to speculate
   about matters of degree - to contemporary theories of biomedicalization,
   patienthood, and managed care.

   understanding, and (iv) re-objectifying conceptualization.
   Design - Both methodological and substantive arguments are guided by the
   constructive principle of mediating interpenetration of polar opposites.
   Findings - Status groups and class interests are conceived as major
   categories of sociological differentiation mediating between the
   abstractions of individuals and society. Three types of class formation
   are discovered in Weber's legacy beyond Marx's property one. Sorokin's
   work in a two-dimensional social stratification and mobility is found to
   have major significance for developing the concept of social classes and
   for reconciling divergent ideas of social stratification. The principle
   of concept formation by mediation of interpenetrating polar opposites is
   found to be of greater complexity and effectiveness than Hegel's logical
   principle of transcendental supersession.
   Originality - The comprehensive method of sociological deconstruction
   and reconstruction seamlessly integrates qualitative and quantitative
   methods in sociology as well as concept formation and research.

AB For the last several decades, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been widely
   regarded as a late life event, but is now being redefined as a chronic
   condition that develops over decades. Concurrently, a preponderance of
   evidence emerging from basic and clinical research in diverse fields
   such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and mental health has suggested that
   the environmental component of clinical AD is not only multifactorial in
   populations and in individuals, but is also modifiable across the
   life-course, from conception until death. Re-conceptualizing the
   environmental component of AD to account for these observations
   necessitates an approach to brain health that eschews singular,
   short-and medium-term methodology and instead reflects long-term
   complexity. Such thinking is consistent with the ecological models of
   public health, which emphasize the development of community
   infrastructure that can foster population and individual health over the
   life-course by minimizing risk through multifaceted, systemic
   approaches.

AB Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are
   severe cutaneous adverse reactions with a high morbidity and mortality.
   Although these reactions are rare, their medical, social and financial
   impact is great. Many cases require intensive care treatment in the
   acute stage of the disease and long lasting sequelaein survivors may
   occur.The majority of cases are caused by medications, whereas
   infections, autoimmune diseases and unknown causes may be responsible as
   well. Risk estimates for medications have been provided by epidemiologic
   studies, but they are often not reflected in drug dictionaries and
   textbooks.Investigations have shown that specific medications taken
   bypatients with a predefined genetic predisposition and certain ethnic
   origin may lead to SJS/TEN. However, a test to detect such a higher risk
   is not available for most drugs.Litigations concerning these reactions
   consume substantial resources, probably far greater than the resources
   devoted to research that could improve treatment and reduce the risk of
   these reactions.

AB I examined the multiple visions of the future of the city that can
   emerge when city actors and organizations reconfigure themselves to
   address sustainability. In various cities worldwide, novel ideas,
   initiatives, and networks are emerging in governance to address social
   and ecological conditions in urban areas. However, cities can be
   contested spaces, bringing a plurality of actors, network
   configurations, preferences, and knowledge that shape the politics over
   desirable pathways for future development. I used the knowledge-action
   systems analysis (KASA) approach to examine the frames and knowledge
   systems influencing how different actors involved in the land governance
   network of the city of San Juan constructed visions for the future of
   the city. Results revealed four visions for the city coexisting in San
   Juan. Although sustainability is a goal that cuts across all four
   visions, they each optimized distinct dimensions of the concept. The
   contrasts in visions can be explained in part by competing frames of the
   urban social-ecological system and power asymmetries in the multiple
   knowledge systems coexisting in the city. I discussed the theoretical,
   methodological, and practical implications of the politics of
   sustainability for adaptive urban governance research and practice. The
   KASA approach can serve as a window into the adaptive capacity of the
   city by disentangling the competing ways that actors 'see' and 'know'
   the urban social-ecological systems. Most importantly, this approach
   offers a way of appraising sustainable pathways by revealing either the
   extent to which dominant social structures and cognitive patterns are
   being reinforced, or whether opportunities for innovative and
   transformative approaches are emerging in the city.

AB We examined how social-ecological factors in the land-change
   decision-making process influenced neighboring decisions and
   trajectories of alternative landscape ecologies. We decomposed
   individual landowner decisions to conserve or develop forests in the
   rapidly growing Charlotte, North Carolina, U. S. region, exposing and
   quantifying the effects of forest quality, and social and cultural
   dynamics. We tested the hypothesis that the intrinsic value of forest
   resources, e. g., cultural attachment to land, influence woodland
   owners' propensity to sell. Data were collected from a sample of urban,
   nonindustrial private forest (U-NIPF) owners using an individualized
   survey design that spatially matched land-owner responses to the
   ecological and timber values of their forest stands. Cluster analysis (n
   = 126) revealed four woodland owner typologies with widely ranging views
   on the ecosystem, cultural, and historical values of their forests.
   Classification tree analysis revealed woodland owners' willingness to
   sell was characterized by nonlinear, interactive factors, including
   sense of place values regarding the retention of native vegetation, the
   size of forest holdings, their connectedness to nature, 'pressure' from
   surrounding development, and behavioral patterns, such as how often
   landowners visit their land. Several ecological values and economic
   factors were not found to figure in the decision to retain forests. Our
   study design is unique in that we address metropolitan forest
   persistence across urban-rural and population gradients using a unique
   individualized survey design that richly contextualizes survey
   responses. Understanding the interplay between policies and landowner
   behavior can also help resource managers to better manage and promote
   forest persistence. Given the region's paucity of policy tools to manage
   the type and amount of development, the mosaic of land cover the region
   currently enjoys is far from stable.

AB In the drylands of northern Kenya, as elsewhere in Africa, traditional
   pastoralist social-ecological systems are undergoing profound
   transformations. Diminishing resource availability, changing social
   values and governance systems, and new resource management institutions
   challenge the capacity of communities for effective common pool resource
   management. Individuals' values and environmental perceptions play a
   substantial role in decision making regarding resource use and
   management. Additionally, social capital within communities can
   influence cooperative and adaptive resource management. We studied five
   Laikipia Maasai communities in Kenya, which share a common natural
   environment, history, and political organization. We surveyed
   pastoralists' perceptions of the adequacy of two ecosystem services,
   forage availability and livestock abundance. We also assessed indicators
   of three forms of social capital: reciprocity, sanctioning, and norms of
   fairness. Four communities established set-aside conservation areas
   through partnership with external organizations. In those communities,
   we examined residents' perceptions of five different potential
   ecological and economic benefits from the conservation areas. We found
   that communities varied in residents' perceptions of grazing resource
   adequacy, the economic sufficiency of their livestock herds, and the
   benefits of conservation areas. Communities also varied in measures of
   social capital. We contextualize our findings in terms of the rules and
   conditions governing each conservation area, the roles of social
   capital, and the challenges of resource-use trade-offs when perceptions
   diverge. We conclude that taking stock of perceptions and values placed
   on ecosystem services is a crucial element of formulating plans for
   sustainable resource management and navigating trade-offs in the future.

AB A growing body of work has emphasized the importance of residential
   areas to the overall green infrastructure of cities and recognizes that
   outcomes related to these areas are best studied using a
   social-ecological approach. We conducted vegetation surveys to evaluate
   yard practices that relate to the state of the yard vegetation,
   including species diversity and abundance, vegetation structure, and the
   percent of green area of yards versus paved areas, at the Rio Piedras
   watershed within the San Juan metropolitan area. We used concomitant
   social household surveys to evaluate the association of social-economic
   and demographic factors at the household scale with these vegetation
   characteristics, as well as with landscape-level characteristics related
   to urban morphology and elevation. Our results for this tropical site
   were consistent with studies elsewhere in that a greater number of
   social factors at the household scale were more important in explaining
   the traits related to how green the yards were. On the other hand, we
   failed to detect the so-called luxury effect on urban vegetation
   encountered at many sites. Instead, we found consistent vegetation
   associations with the age of the residents, housing ownership, and, most
   importantly, with yard size. We have discussed the potential reasons for
   these discrepancies and the potential consequences of the human-natural
   links at the household scale to the future dynamics of this portion of
   the green infrastructure within this urban watershed.

AB The synthesis of the contributions in this special issue about the
   tropical city of San Juan has resulted in five themes. First, the city
   is subject to multiple vulnerabilities, but socioeconomic factors and
   education level affect the perception of citizens to those
   vulnerabilities, even in the face of imminent threat. Second, in light
   of the social-ecological conditions of the city, how its citizens and
   institutions deal with knowledge to respond to vulnerabilities becomes
   critical to the adaptive capacity of the city. Third, the relationship
   between socioeconomic factors and green cover, which in 2002 covered 42%
   of the city, is not what has been reported for other temperate zone
   cities. In San Juan, neighborhoods with households of high socioeconomic
   level were not necessarily associated with greater green cover. However,
   in adjacent neighborhoods within the densely populated zones of the
   city, households of high socioeconomic level did preserve green cover
   better than households in lower socioeconomic-level neighborhoods.
   Fourth, tropical conditions such as climate may explain some of the
   unique aspects of the social-ecological system of San Juan. The most
   obvious is the exuberance of tropical biota in the city that not only
   forms novel species assemblages but also provides many ecological
   services, including food production for up to 60% of the members of
   particular neighborhoods. Ecosystem resilience is particularly high in
   aquatic and terrestrial ecological systems in San Juan. Fifth, it
   appears that the emergence of novel systems in the city represent
   adaptive responses to the social end ecological conditions in the city.
   We conclude that the study of a tropical city provides contrast to the
   prevailing literature on temperate and boreal cities and expands the
   suite of behaviors of urban social-ecological systems, thus advancing
   the dialogue on the functioning of cities in light of environmental
   change.

AB Social-ecological systems are considered resilient when they are capable
   of recovering from externally forced shocks. Thus, whether a given
   system is identified as resilient depends on a number of contested
   definitions: what constitutes a shock, what constitutes a discrete
   system, and what constitutes acceptable performance. Here, I present a
   case study in which outcomes apparent to both the researcher and the
   study subjects demonstrated resilience in effect: a group of farmers in
   the northern Great Plains in the north-central United States realized
   economically sufficient production during a low rainfall year when many
   others in the region did not. However, the researcher's attempt to model
   this case as a resilient system was continually challenged by
   qualitative findings, suggesting that these farmers did not experience
   the officially decreed "drought" year as a shock. Moreover, the social
   and ecological processes that produced a "resilience effect" functioned
   as open systems, and were not readily bounded, even in analytical terms.
   This is not to suggest that resilience is not an operationalizable
   concept. Rather, the series of processes which produce a resilience
   effect may be best understood within a broad framework attentive to
   diversity, flexibility, and relationships at multiple scales-instead of
   quantitative models focused on discrete moments of disturbance and
   adaptation.

AB Understanding cultural dimensions of human/environment relationships is
   now widely seen as key to effective management, yet characterizing these
   dimensions remains a challenge. We report on an approach for considering
   the nonmaterial values associated with ecosystems, i.e., cultural
   ecosystem services. We applied the approach in Kona, Hawai'i, using 30
   semistructured interviews and 205 in-person surveys, striving to balance
   pragmatism and depth. We found spirituality, heritage, and
   identity-related values to be particularly salient, with expression of
   some of these values varying among respondents by ethnicity and duration
   of residence in Hawai'i. Although people of various backgrounds reported
   strong spirituality and heritage-related values, Native Hawaiians rated
   heritage connections as deeper, and lifetime residents portrayed
   ecosystem-identity connections as more integral to their wellbeing than
   did people from other backgrounds. The approach also proved useful in
   identifying concerns not addressed in survey and interview prompts,
   including postcolonial issues, access to ecosystems, and relationships
   between people of different ethnic backgrounds. Although understanding
   these nonmaterial dimensions of human-ecosystem relationships can be
   complex, emerging techniques eliciting qualitative and quantitative data
   provide feasible ways of deepening that understanding.

AB The study of ignorance, or agnotology, has many similarities with
   studies of absence. This paper outlines a framework for agnotology which
   is shaped by interdisciplinary studies of both ignorance and absence,
   and identifies properties such as chronicity, granularity, scale,
   intentionality, and ontology in relation to epistemology as useful for
   studying ignorance. These properties can be used to compare various case
   studies. While not all problems of ignorance are problems of absent
   knowledge, those that are can gain by an examination of the literatures
   on absence and the concept of the privative. The lack of symmetry in
   explanation and representation are methodological challenges to studying
   ignorances and absences.

AB Context: The role of the preceptor requires the athletic trainer to be
   versed in effective instructional techniques, supervisory skills, and
   communication skills beyond his or her competence as an athletic
   trainer, but many have not received formal training in educational
   techniques.
   Objective: To gain a better understanding about the professional
   socialization process for the athletic trainer assuming the role of the
   preceptor.
   Design: Qualitative study.
   Setting: Athletic training education programs.
   Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-four preceptors (11 men, 13
   women; age = 32 6 7 years, clinical experience = 9 6 6 years, preceptor
   experience = 5 6 3 years) employed in the collegiate (n = 12) or
   secondary school (n = 12) setting.
   Data Collection and Analysis: We gathered data using asynchronous,
   in-depth interviewing via QuestionPro. We analyzed data using a general
   inductive approach to uncover the dominant themes. Credibility was
   secured by using consistency and stakeholder checks and a peer review.
   Results: We identified 2 main themes by which preceptors develop in
   their roles as clinical instructors: formal processes and informal
   processes. The participants used observations, previous experiences or
   interactions with role models, and self-reflection and evaluation as
   informal socialization processes. Formal socialization processes
   included preceptor training/workshops, professional development, and
   formal teacher certification.
   Conclusions: Athletic trainers who serve as preceptors learned their
   roles by a combination of informal and formal processes. Preceptor
   training sessions appeared to be effective in initially helping
   preceptors learn their responsibilities, whereby more informal processes
   seemed to help them refine their skills. Furthermore, one socialization
   strategy did not appear to dominate role learning; rather, a combination
   of several processes fostered an understanding.

   literature by examining the associations of fast food restaurant (FFR)
   density around the home and FFR proximity to the home, respectively,
   with body mass index (BMI) among a large sample of African American
   adults from Houston, Texas.
   Methods. We used generalized linear models with generalized estimating
   equations to examine associations of FFR density at 0.5-, 1-, 2-, and
   5-mile road network buffers around the home with BMI and associations of
   the closest FFR to the home with BMI. All models were adjusted for a
   range of individual-level covariates and neighborhood socioeconomic
   status. We additionally investigated the moderating effects of household
   income on these relations. Data were collected from December 2008 to
   July 2009.
   Results. FFR density was not associated with BMI in the main analyses.
   However, FFR density at 0.5, 1, and 2 miles was positively associated
   with BMI among participants with lower incomes (P <= .025). Closer FFR
   proximity was associated with higher BMI among all participants (P <
   .001), with stronger associations emerging among those of lower income
   (P < .013) relative to higher income (P < .014).
   Conclusions. Additional research with more diverse African American
   samples is needed, but results supported the potential for the fast food
   environment to affect BMI among African Americans, particularly among
   those of lower economic means.

AB Objectives. We investigated the association between anticipatory stress,
   also known as racism-related vigilance, and hypertension prevalence in
   Black, Hispanic, and White adults.
   Methods. We used data from the Chicago Community Adult Health Study, a
   population-representative sample of adults (n = 3105) surveyed in 2001
   to 2003, to regress hypertension prevalence on the interaction between
   race/ethnicity and vigilance in logit models.
   Results. Blacks reported the highest vigilance levels. For Blacks, each
   unit increase in vigilance (range = 0-12) was associated with a 4%
   increase in the odds of hypertension (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 1.09). Hispanics showed a similar but
   nonsignificant association (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.99, 1.12), and Whites
   showed no association (OR = 0.95; 95% CI = 0.87, 1.03).
   Conclusions. Vigilance may represent an important and unique source of
   chronic stress that contributes to the well-documented higher prevalence
   of hypertension among Blacks than Whites; it is a possible contributor
   to hypertension among Hispanics but not Whites.

AB Objectives. We assessed how traffic and mobile-source air pollution
   impacts are distributed across racial/ethnic and socioeconomically
   diverse groups in port-adjacent communities in southern Los Angeles
   County, which may experience divergent levels of exposure to
   port-related heavy-duty diesel truck traffic because of existing
   residential and land use patterns.
   Methods. We used spatial regression techniques to assess the association
   of neighborhood racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition with
   residential parcel-level traffic and vehicle-related fine particulate
   matter exposure after accounting for built environment and land use
   factors.
   Results. After controlling for factors associated with traffic
   generation, we found that a higher percentage of nearby Black and
   Asian/Pacific Islander residents was associated with higher exposure, a
   higher percentage of Hispanic residents was associated with higher
   traffic exposure but lower vehicle particulate matter exposure, and
   areas with lower socioeconomic status experienced lower exposure.
   Conclusions. Disparities in traffic and vehicle particulate matter
   exposure are nuanced depending on the exposure metric used, the
   distribution of the traffic and emissions, and pollutant dispersal
   patterns. Future comparative research is needed to assess potential
   disparities in other transportation and goods movement corridors.

AB We used a new conceptual framework that integrates tenets from health
   economics, social epidemiology, and health behavior to analyze the
   impact of socioeconomic forces on the temporal changes in the
   socioeconomic status (SES) gap in childhood overweight and obesity in
   China. In data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey for 1991 to
   2006, we found increased prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity
   across all SES groups, but a greater increase among higher-SES children,
   especially after 1997, when income inequality dramatically increased.
   Our findings suggest that for China, the increasing SES gap in
   purchasing power for obesogenic goods, associated with rising income
   inequality, played a prominent role in the country's increasing SES gap
   in childhood obesity and overweight.

AB Objectives. We examined socioeconomic status (SES) disparities and the
   influence of state Immunization Action Plan-funded vaccination
   coordinators located in low-SES areas of Connecticut on childhood
   vaccination up-to-date (UTD) status at age 24 months.
   Methods. We examined predictors of underimmunization among the 2006
   birth cohort (n = 34568) in the state's Immunization Information System,
   including individual demographic and SES data, census tract SES data,
   and residence in an area with a vaccination coordinator. We conducted
   multilevel logistic regression analyses.
   Results. Overall, 81% of children were UTD. Differences by
   race/ethnicity and census tract SES were typically under 5%. Not being
   UTD at age 7 months was the strongest predictor of underimmunization at
   age 24 months. Among children who were not UTD at age 7 months, only
   Medicaid enrollment (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.6; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 0.5, 0.7) and residence in an area with a vaccination
   coordinator (AOR = 0.7; 95% CI = 0.6, 0.9) significantly decreased the
   odds of subsequent underimmunization.
   Conclusions. SES disparities associated with underimmunization at age 24
   months were limited. Efforts focused on vaccinating infants born in low
   SES circumstances can minimize disparities.

AB Objectives. We linked hospital discharge and American Community Survey
   and US Census data to investigate 2009 H1N1 influenza (H1N1)-related
   outcomes by racial/ethnic groups and socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods. We examined the population discharged from any acute care
   hospital in Massachusetts and calculated rates of intensive care unit
   (ICU) stay by racial/ethnic and SES groups between April 26 and
   September 30, 2009. We used logistic regression models to identify
   predictors of ICU stay.
   Results. Of 4874 H1N1-related hospitalizations, 526 (11%) were admitted
   to the ICU. Those in less affluent SES groups had lower risk of ICU stay
   than the most affluent SES group. Compared with Whites, Hispanics had
   significantly lower risk of 2009 H1N1-related ICU stay (odds ratio =
   0.52; 95% confidence interval = 0.32, 0.86). Only 13% of Whites admitted
   to the ICU were in the lowest SES group, compared with 63% of Hispanics
   and 43% of Blacks.
   Conclusions. To our knowledge, this is the first statewide description
   of 2009 H1N1 influenza-related ICU stays according to racial/ethnic
   group and SES in the United States. Future work should investigate
   evidence related to social determinants of health among racial/ethnic
   groups to reduce disparities in relation to pandemic influenza.

   health should mean not only the health of the public but also health in
   the public and by the public, and I expound on the social contingency of
   health and highlight the importance of the interpersonal dimensions of
   health conditions and health promotion efforts. Promoting public health
   requires activating health-enhancing communicative behaviors (such as
   interpersonal advocacy and mutual responsibility taking) in addition to
   individual behavioral change. To facilitate such communicative
   behaviors, it is imperative to first construct a new discursive

AB The sociology of the South, as a substantive area research interest,
   emerged during the 1800s as a means to rationalize and preserve the
   cultural norms of slavery era whites who would soon experience seismic
   social shocks including the Civil War and emancipation of enslaved
   blacks. The person singularly cited as the architect of this area of
   study is Howard W. Odum. Although Odumis identified as the person most
   responsible for the development of this field, archival data indicate
   that W. E. B. Du Bois and the men and women of the Atlanta Sociological
   Laboratory were its first practitioners. In this paper evidence is
   offered to show that Du Bois's Atlanta University efforts predated
   Odum's North Carolina research program. Additionally, an explanation for
   Du Bois's marginalization in the existing sociology of the South

   In this trilogy, I disentangle the triangular nexus of class

   distribution and punitive management of marginality through the wedding
   of disciplinary social policy and neutralizing criminal justice. I
   signpost how I deployed key notions from Pierre Bourdieu (social space,
   bureaucratic field, symbolic power) to clarify categories left hazy
   (such as the ghetto) and to forge new concepts (territorial
   stigmatization and advanced marginality, punitive containment and
   liberal paternalism, hyper-incarceration and negative sociodicy) as
   tools for the comparative sociology of the unfinished genesis of the
   post-industrial precariat, the penal regulation of poverty in the age of
   diffusing social insecurity, and the building of the neo-liberal

AB The recent 'performative turn' in sociology has meant a renewed interest
   in the dramaturgical aspects of social life. This has appeared in the
   literature on social movements as a concern with the performance of
   opposition, usually within public protest events. This focus on
   performance as a tactic to be used in public displays of meaning by
   political actors misses how social performance is woven into our
   everyday lives. This paper presents a review of relevant literature
   towards the end of creating a theoretical concept, the 'ideological
   performance,' which presents a more holistic approach to understanding
   performativity within social movements, both publicly and privately. I
   suggest that this concept provides a useful lens through which to look
   at the formation and maintenance of collective identity at the level of
   interaction. To demonstrate this theoretical concept, I apply it to
   qualitative data collected on religious organizations that conduct
   social justice work as well as participant observation among Global
   Justice Movement activists in Chicago, IL. I conclude that members of
   the groups I observed use various cultural elements, including humor,
   boundary objects, understandings of the audience, language, and style,
   both consciously and unconsciously, to enact their ideological
   performances, situating performers and audiences within meaning systems
   and formulating collective identities.

   Veterans.
   Research design: Three-stage mixed-methods approach.
   Methods: Stage 1: Consensus conference with stakeholders to revise the
   manual. Stage 2: Pilot study of the revised manual with US Veterans to
   examine acceptability, feasibility and fidelity.
   Stage 3: Review of results with consensus conference attendees and
   further revisions.
   Results: Stage 1: Conference attendees reached 100% consensus regarding
   changes made to the manual. Stage 2: Qualitative results yielded themes
   that suggest that participants benefitted from the intervention and that
   multiple factors contributed to successful implementation (Narrative
   Evaluation of Intervention Interview, User Feedback Survey-Modified,
   Post-Treatment Interviews). Therapists achieved 100% treatment fidelity.
   Quantitative results from the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8
   suggest that the intervention was acceptable. Stage 3: The culturally

   Conclusions: Results of this study suggest that the revised WtoH manual
   is acceptable and feasible. US therapists exhibited adherence to the
   protocol. The three-stage methodology was successfully employed to
   cross-culturally adapt an intervention that is well-suited for a Phase

   being considered as an alternative. Although the biophysical impacts of
   aquaculture on biodiversity have been examined, there is only limited
   understanding of the social and economic impacts of aquaculture on
   biodiversity, and especially the impacts of the shift from intensive to
   semi-intensive systems. The purposes of this article are twofold: (1) to
   identify and discuss the social and economic impacts of aquaculture on
   biodiversity, and (2) to examine the impacts while moving from intensive
   to semi-intensive systems. After discussing the findings of our study,
   we provide some recommendations as to how to minimize social and
   economic impacts of aquaculture on biodiversity by moving to a lower
   intensity aquaculture system. The integrated agriculture-aquaculture
   farming systems, stakeholder involvement in management, and well defined
   basic rights are aquaculture systems that contribute to conservation of

AB This article aims to reorient developmental psychologists' view of
   "ethnicity" and align them more closely with disciplines such as
   sociology and anthropology. Developmental psychologists mostly treat
   ethnicity as apolitical, ahistorical and limited to mutually exclusive,
   homogeneous categories measured by decontextualized self-report
   questionnaires. Moreover, self-report "ethnicity" scales typically fail
   to integrate a full perspective on ethnicity, such as power, inequality,
   class, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, and generation. I take
   issue with the position that ethnic groups constitute fixed natural
   entities based on ethnic identities. In my view, ethnicity emerges in
   social interaction in specific social and political contexts. Hence,
   "ethnicity" is primarily a theory of social relations; it is intensified
   or abated when individuals engage in mutual interaction. I argue that no
   reference to ethnicity is politically impartial. Finally, I present a
   set of recommendations that might have useful theoretical and
   methodological implications for ethnicity research in developmental
   psychology. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel

   barrier to care for vulnerable populations, including HIV-infected,
   people who inject drugs (PWIDs), and men who have sex with men (MSM) in
   multiple clinical contexts and remains unexamined among professional
   health-care students in Malaysia. This cross-sectional, anonymous, and
   Internet-based survey assessed the attitudes of medical and dental
   students toward HIV-infected, PWID, and MSM patients. Survey invitation
   was emailed to 3191 students at 8 professional schools; 1296 (40.6%)
   responded and scored their attitudes toward these patient groups using a
   feeling thermometer, indicating their attitudes on a sliding scale from
   0 (most negative) to 100 (most positive). Compared to general patients
   (mean = 76.50), the mean scores for HIV-infected (mean = 54.04; p <
   0.001), PWID (mean = 37.50; p < 0.001), and MSM (mean=32.13; p < 0.001)
   patients were significantly lower and significantly different between
   each group comparison. Within group differences, most notably religion,
   ethnicity, and personally knowing someone from these populations were
   associated with significant differences in attitudes. No differences
   were noted between pre-clinical and clinical year of training.
   Health-care students represent the next generation of clinicians who
   will be responsible for future HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Our
   findings suggest alarmingly negative attitudes toward these patients,
   especially MSM, necessitating prompt and effective interventions
   designed to ameliorate the negative attitudes of health-care students
   toward vulnerable populations, specifically HIV-infected, PWID, and MSM
   patients in Malaysia.

AB Impairments in social functioning commonly seen in schizophrenia are
   thought to be mediated by deficits in the domains of social cognition.
   Some previous research has explored how social cognitive skills and
   psychotic symptoms are associated with social functioning, however these
   associations are still under debate. The main aim of this study was to
   investigate the relationship between different domains of social
   cognition and psychotic symptomatology, and also to look at the
   relationships with individual subdomains of social functioning within a
   clinically stable schizophrenia population. 45 outpatients were
   recruited and symptoms were assessed with the PANSS, and measures of
   emotion processing, affective and cognitive theory of mind (ToM), mental
   state reasoning attributional biases, and social functioning were taken.
   A correlational analysis was performed with the data. Following this, a
   regression analysis was used to reveal which domains of social cognition
   best predicted psychotic symptoms. In this stable group of patients, our
   results support the suggestion of a likely distinction between affective
   and cognitive components of ToM. The study also demonstrated that ToM
   and mental state reasoning were the best predictors of psychotic
   symptoms. Here we reveal that cognitive ToM had the most widespread
   relationship with social functioning, across multiple subdomains, while
   only some specific subdomains of social functioning correlated with
   other domains of social cognition and symptomatology. Further to this,
   positive symptoms were associated with much fewer subdomains of social
   functioning than negative and general symptoms. These findings imply
   that different aspects of social functioning may be served by different
   domains of social cognition and symptomatology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB Proper engagement with the theory of taste that Bourdieu formulates in
   Distinction [1984] has been marred by an inability to differentiate
   between the theory of the functions of taste and the theory of the
   origins of taste. In this paper, the author shows that the theory of
   taste developed in Distinction is one concerned primarily with the
   origins and only secondarily with the functions of taste. The author
   further argues that this theory is inseparable from Bourdieu's
   practice-theoretical project; it therefore cannot be coherently
   understood or evaluated unless it is presented in those terms (with
   habitus as the centrepiece concept). To that end, the author engages in
   a close reading of the basic argument in Distinction and shows that,
   according to Bourdieu, there is a tight (dynamically adjusting)
   relationship between tastes, conscious preferences, practical
   anticipations, and accumulated competences. Likes and dislikes function
   as partial glimpses into the store of practical capacities for cultural
   appropriation accumulated by a person. Most importantly, tastes operate
   via practical anticipatory action and not by conscious regulation. The
   author closes by outlining the implications of Bourdieu's 'scandalous'
   proposal for future research in the sociology of taste.

AB Objective. To identify social, behavioral, and physiological risk
   factors associated with small for gestational age (SGA) by gestational
   age category in St. Louis City and County. Methods. A retrospective
   cohort study was conducted using birth certificate and fetal death
   records from 2000 to 2009 (n = 142,017). Adjusted associations of risk
   factors with SGA were explored using bivariate logistic regression. Four
   separate multivariable logistic regression analyses, stratified by
   gestational age, were conducted to estimate adjusted odds ratios.
   Results. Preeclampsia and inadequate weight gain contributed
   significantly to increased odds for SGA across all gestational age
   categories. The point estimates ranged from a 3.41 increased odds among
   women with preeclampsia and 1.76 for women with inadequate weight gain
   at 24-28 weeks' gestational age to 2.19 and 2.11 for full-term infants,
   respectively. Among full-term infants, smoking (aOR = 2.08), chronic
   hypertension (aOR = 1.46), and inadequate prenatal care (aOR = 1.25) had
   the next most robust and significant impact on SGA. Conclusion.
   Preeclampsia and inadequate weight gain are significant risk factors for
   SGA, regardless of gestational age. Education on the importance of
   nutrition and adequate weight gain during pregnancy is vital. In this
   community, disparities in SGA and smoking rates are important
   considerations for interventions designed to improve birth outcomes.

AB This article illustrates a clinical sociology approach to psychosocial
   inquiry and a heuristic analytical grid as a methodological guide. Key
   concerns of clinical sociology including the notion of self,
   individual-society relationship, a priority on experience and meaning
   (including implicit language), action/intervention, and other
   theoretical and methodological issues are reviewed. The heuristic
   analytical grid is depicted in seven themes: the individual, the
   society, the time dimension, "levels" or types of communication, social
   representation (of mental health/illness), intervention, and
   organizational dimension of (medical) intervention. Relevance to the
   study of gerontology is indicated by highlighting the similarities
   between the study of personal experience of psychiatric rehabilitation
   and the study of aging. Implications for research and clinical practice
   are discussed.

AB Students of social-ecological systems have emphasized the need for
   effective cross-scale governance. We theorized that discursive barriers,
   particularly between technical and traditional practices, can act as a
   barrier to cross-scale collaboration. We analyzed the effects of
   discursive divides on collaboration on Reducing Emissions from
   Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) policy development in
   Central Kalimantan, an Indonesian province on the island of Borneo
   selected in 2010 to pilot subnational REDD+ policy. We argue that the
   complexities of bridging local land management practices and technical
   approaches to greenhouse gas emissions reduction and carbon offsetting
   create barriers to cross-scale collaboration. We tested these hypotheses
   using an exponential random graph model of collaboration among 36
   organizations active in REDD+ policy in the province. We found that
   discursive divides were associated with a decreased probability of
   collaboration between organizations and that organizations headquartered
   outside the province were less likely to collaborate with organizations
   headquartered in the province. We conclude that bridging discursive
   communities presents a chicken-and-egg problem for cross-scale
   governance of social-ecological systems. In precisely the situations
   where it is most important, when bridging transnational standards with
   local knowledge and land management practices, it is the most difficult.

AB Wetlands in the arid western United States provide rare and critical
   migratory bird habitat and constitute a critical nexus within larger
   social-ecological systems (SES) where multiple changing land-use and
   water-use patterns meet. The Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge in Utah,
   USA, presents a case study of the ways that wetland managers have
   created adaptive management strategies that are responsive to the social
   and hydrological conditions of the agriculture-dominated SES within
   which they are located. Managers have acquired water rights and
   constructed infrastructure while cultivating collaborative relationships
   with other water users to increase the adaptive capacity of the region
   and decrease conflict. Historically, water management involved diversion
   and impoundment of water within wetland units timed around patterns of
   agricultural water needs. In the last 20 years, managers have learned
   from flood and drought events and developed a long-term adaptive
   management plan that specifies alternative management actions managers
   can choose each year based on habitat needs and projected water supply.
   Each alternative includes habitat goals and target wetland water depth.
   However, wetland management adapted to agricultural return-flow
   availability may prove insufficient as population growth and climate
   change alter patterns of land and water use. Future management will
   likely depend more on negotiation, collaboration, and learning from
   social developments within the SES than strictly focusing on water
   management within refuge boundaries. To face this problem, managers have
   worked to be included in negotiations with regional water users, a
   strategy that may prove instructive for other wetland managers in
   agriculture-dominated watersheds.

AB The social-ecological system (SES) framework investigated in this
   special issue enables researchers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds
   working on different resource sectors in disparate geographic areas,
   biophysical conditions, and temporal domains to share a common
   vocabulary for the construction and testing of alternative theories and
   models that determine which influences on processes and outcomes are
   especially critical in specific empirical settings. We summarize changes
   that have been made to this framework and discuss a few remaining
   ambiguities in its formulation. Specifically, we offer a tentative
   rearrangement of the list of relevant attributes of governance systems
   and discuss other ways to make this framework applicable to policy
   settings beyond natural resource settings. The SES framework will
   continue to change as more researchers apply it to additional contexts;
   the main purpose of this article is to delineate the version that served
   as the basis for the theoretical innovations and empirical analyses
   detailed in other contributions to this special issue.
