AB The authors argue that since social activists are often busier
   establishing the unfairness of inequalities than establishing the mere
   existence of those inequalities, a constructionist sociology of
   inequality ought to build upon the scholarship on "victim claiming" and
   "injustice framing." To illustrate, they present the case of the Office
   of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Student Support Services at Indiana
   University-a local controversy in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1994 that was
   also part of the national debate over gay and lesbian rights. The
   central issue in the case was whether treating gays differently from
   heterosexuals was justified, often framed as comparable to
   discrimination against blacks. Among other things, the authors conclude
   that the discourse of black civil rights has spawned a broader cultural
   discourse for inequalities that are also unjust, and hence, it has
   become central to debates about the meaning of inequality, particularly
   in the United States.

AB Objectives: To test associations between individual health outcomes and
   ecological variables proposed in causal models of relations between
   income inequality and health.
   Design: Regression analysis of a large, nationally representative
   dataset, linked to US census and other county and state level sources of
   data on ecological covariates. The regressions control for individual
   economic and demographic covariates as well as relevant potential
   ecological confounders.
   Setting: The US population in the year 2000.
   Participants: 4817 US adults about age 40, representative of the US
   population.
   Main outcome measures: Two outcomes were studied: self reported general
   health status, dichotomised as "fair'' or "poor'' compared with
   "excellent'', "very good'', or "good'', and depression as measured by a
   score on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies depression instrument >
   16.
   Results: State generosity was significantly associated with a reduced
   odds of reporting poor general health (OR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.71 to 0.99),
   and the county unemployment rate with reduced odds of reporting
   depression (OR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84 to 0.97). The measure of income
   inequality is a significant risk factor for reporting poor general
   health (OR 1.98, CI: 1.08 to 3.62), controlling for all ecological and
   individual covariates. In stratified models, the index of social capital
   is associated with reduced odds of reporting poor general health among
   black people and Hispanics (OR 0.40, CI: 0.18 to 0.90), but not
   significant among white people. The inequality measure is significantly
   associated with reporting poor general health among white people (OR
   2.60, CI: 1.22 to 5.56) but not black people and Hispanics.
   Conclusions: The effect of income inequality on health may work through
   the influence of invidious social comparisons (particularly among white
   subjects) and (among black subjects and Latinos) through a reduction in
   social capital. Researchers may find it fruitful to recognise the
   cultural specificity of any such effects.

AB Drawing theoretical insight from political sociology's state-society
   literature and organizational theory's new institutionalism, I examine
   the case of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and its
   relationship with the Citizens' Council to illustrate that the
   state-countermovement relationship can be highly variable - much more so
   than the existing literature often assumes. As different actors came to
   occupy positions of power within the state of Mississippi, they
   responded differently to relevant audiences and affected the degree to
   which the council could exercise leverage with the commission to control
   protest. The analysis focuses on how the state-countermovement ties of
   ideology and funding changed over time, even though membership overlap
   between the commission board and the council remained relatively
   constant. Three relational structures - frustrated, aligned, and stifled
   - are identified and discussed as influencing the degree to which the
   council could gain leverage in Mississippi's multilevel state structure
   where multiple audiences mattered.

AB OBJECTIVE. Our goal was to determine if racial/ethnic disparities in
   adolescent boys' and girls' physical activity participation exist and
   persist once the school attended is considered.
   METHODS. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 17 007 teens in the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using multivariate
   linear regression, we examined the association between adolescent
   self-reported physical activity and individual race/ethnicity stratified
   by gender, controlling for a wide range of sociodemographic,
   attitudinal, behavioral, and health factors. We used multilevel analyses
   to determine if the relationship between race/ethnicity and physical
   activity varied by the school attended.
   RESULTS. Participants attended racially segregated schools; similar to
   80% of Hispanic and black adolescent boys and girls attended schools
   with student populations that were similar to 66% white, whereas nearly
   40% of the white adolescents attended schools that were > 94% white.
   Black and Hispanic adolescent girls reported lower levels of physical
   activity than white adolescent girls. There were more similar levels of
   physical activity reported in adolescent boys, with black boys reporting
   slightly more activities. Although black and Hispanic adolescent girls
   were more likely to attend poorer schools with overall lower levels of
   physical activity in girls; there was no difference within schools
   between black, white, and Hispanic adolescent girls' physical activity
   levels. Within the same schools, both black and Hispanic adolescent boys
   had higher rates of physical activity when compared with white
   adolescent boys.
   CONCLUSIONS. In this nationally representative sample, lower physical
   activity levels in Hispanic and black adolescent girls were largely
   attributable to the schools they attended. In contrast, black and
   Hispanic males had higher activity levels than white males when
   attending the same schools. Future research is needed to determine the
   mechanisms through which school environments contribute to racial/ethnic
   disparities in adolescent physical activity and will need to consider
   gender differences in these racial/ethnic disparities.

AB This essay reviews the concept of "institutions" as used in the recent
   economic literatures on firms and national development and notes its
   limitations. An alternative framework is proposed that draws on classic
   and contemporary sociological theory to position the concept of
   institutions in relation to other basic elements of culture and social
   structure. The framework is used to analyze (1) the failure of attempts
   to transplant institutions of developed countries into the global South
   and (2) the dynamics of massive privatization in Mexico. The bearing of
   this framework on current institutional theories of social change is
   examined, leading to the identification of sources of change at
   different levels of causal significance and scope. This modified theory
   of change is applied to the longstanding demographic debates on
   historical and institutional determinants of fertility transitions. The
   bearing of the proposed "thick institutionalist" framework on social
   theory and future development policies is discussed.

AB It has been proposed that the onset of schizophrenia creates a social
   network crisis, resulting in a dramatic deterioration of social
   resources during the period immediately following a first
   hospitalization from essentially normal pre-hospitalization levels. To
   evaluate this proposal, recent onset patients (n = 89) completed
   comprehensive assessments that examined their social networks in the 12
   months prior to first hospitalization and, in a subset of patients (n =
   34), at a 15-month follow-up. Cross-sectional relationships to social
   functioning and symptoms were examined at both time points. Compared to
   existing research, at he initial assessment patients were characterized
   by several network disturbances, including small network size, a high
   proportion of family members, and highly dense interconnections among
   network members; these disturbances generally remained moderately to
   highly stable at follow-up. Smaller social networks were related to poor
   current and premorbid social functioning and aspects of clinical
   functioning, particularly at the 15-month follow-up assessment. Thus,
   this first repeated assessment of social network characteristics in the
   early course of schizophrenia does not support the social network crisis
   concept. Instead, results suggest that functionally relevant social
   network disturbances often exist by the time of first hospitalization in
   schizophrenia.

AB Objectives. Harris and Sim (2002) recently demonstrated the complexity
   of lived race by exploring patterns of racial self-identification. They
   raised important sociological questions about the role of context in
   racial self-identification, but offered an incomplete picture of ethnic
   fluidity by excluding Hispanics from their analyses. We address this
   limitation with data on Hispanics from the National Longitudinal Study
   of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Methods. Our social-psychological
   approach, using compositional analysis, focuses on the lived experience
   of race and ethnicity as qualitatively similar conceptual categories.
   Results. Informed by the cognitive process of social categorization, we
   find that considerably more individuals show fluidity in racial and
   ethnic self-identification across contexts than suggested by Harris and
   Sim. Conclusions. Harris and Sim's thesis is even more strongly
   supported by these findings than in their original analysis, and our
   findings reinforce their challenge to the assumed stability of racial
   and ethnic measurement in sociology. We conclude by proposing a change
   in the measurement of race/ethnicity in America.

AB Background and Purpose - Timely access to medical treatment is critical
   for patients with acute stroke because acute therapies must be given
   very quickly after symptom onset. We examined the effect of
   socioeconomic status on prehospital delays in stroke and transient
   ischemic attack (TIA) patients within a large, biracial population.
   Methods - By screening all local hospital ICD-9 codes 430 to 436, all
   stroke and TIA patients were identified during the calendar year of
   1999. Cases must have used emergency medical services (EMS), lived at
   home, had their stroke at home, and had documented times of the 911 call
   and arrival to the emergency department. Socioeconomic status was
   estimated using economic data regarding the geocoded home residence
   census tract.
   Results - Only 38% of stroke and TIA patients used EMS. There were 978
   cases of stroke and TIA included in this analysis. The mean times were
   call to arrival on scene 6.5 minutes, on-scene time 14.1 minutes, and
   transport time 13.1 minutes. Lower community socioeconomic status was
   associated with all 3 EMS time intervals; however, all time differences
   were small: the largest difference was 5 minutes.
   Conclusions - Within our population, living in a poorer area does not
   appear to delay access to acute care for stroke in a clinically
   significant way. We did find small, statistically significant delays in
   prehospital times that were associated with poorer communities, black
   race, and increasing age. However, delays related to public recognition
   of stroke symptoms, and limited use of 911, are likely much more
   important than these small delays that occur with EMS systems.

AB Background: Coma has been a theme of screenplays in motion pictures, but
   there is no information about its accuracy. Methods: The authors
   reviewed 30 movies from 1970 to 2004 with actors depicting prolonged
   coma. Accurate depiction of comatose patients was defined by appearance,
   the complexity of care, accurate cause of coma and probability of
   awakening, and appropriate compassionate discussion between the
   physician and family members. Twenty-two key scenes from 17 movies were
   rated for accuracy by a panel of neurointensivists and neuroscience
   nurses and then were shown to 72 nonmedical viewers. Accuracy of the
   scenes was assessed using a Likert Scale. Results: Coma was most often
   caused by motor vehicle accidents or violence (63%). The time in a
   comatose state varied from days to 10 years. Awakening occurred in 18 of
   30 motion pictures (60%). Awakening was sudden with cognition intact,
   even after prolonged time in a coma. Actors personified "Sleeping
   Beauty" (eyes closed, beautifully groomed). Physicians appeared as
   caricatures. Only two movies had a reasonable accurate representation
   (Dream Life of Angels and Reversal of Fortune). The majority of the
   surveyed viewers identified inaccuracy of representation of coma,
   awakenings, and conversations on the experience of being in a coma,
   except in 8 of the 22 scenes (36%). Twenty-eight of the 72 viewers (39%)
   could potentially allow these scenes to influence decisions in real
   life. Conclusions: Misrepresentation of coma and awakening was common in
   motion pictures and impacted on the public perception of coma.
   Neurologic advice regarding prolonged coma is needed.

AB Context More than 45 million individuals in the United States lack
   health insurance, potentially limiting their access to and use of
   appropriate health care services. Although the uninsured comprise a
   range of income levels, little attention has been directed at
   higher-income uninsured adults and their patterns of care.
   Objective To examine whether having higher income attenuates the
   association between being uninsured and using fewer recommended health
   care services.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of data from
   the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, drawn from a
   nationally representative sample of households. Participants were
   community-dwelling adults (n= 194 943; 50% women) aged 18 to 64 years in
   2002.
   Main Outcome Measures Self-reported use of screening for cervical,
   breast, and colorectal cancer; serum cholesterol screening and
   measurement, aspirin use, and tobacco cessation and weight loss
   counseling for cardiovascular risk reduction; and serum cholesterol and
   glycosylated hemoglobin measurement, eye and foot examination, and
   influenza and pneumococcal vaccination for diabetes management.
   Results Among eligible adults, use of cancer prevention services ranged
   from 51% for colorectal cancer screening to 88% for cervical cancer
   screening, while use of cardiovascular risk reduction services ranged
   from 38% for weight loss counseling to 81% for aspirin use, and use of
   services for diabetes management ranged from 33% for pneumococcal
   vaccination to 88% for serum glycosylated hemoglobin measurement. In
   bivariate analyses, health insurance and annual household income were
   both strongly associated with use of nearly all examined health care
   services ( P values <. 01). Using multivariable analysis, increased
   annual household income did not significantly increase the likelihood of
   uninsured compared with insured adults receiving recommended health care
   services for cancer prevention, cardiovascular risk reduction, or
   diabetes management ( P values >. 05).
   Conclusions Even among higher-income adults, lack of health care
   insurance was associated with significantly decreased use of recommended
   health care services; increased income did not attenuate the difference
   in use between uninsured and insured adults. Efforts to improve the use
   of recommended health care services among the uninsured should focus on
   patient education and expanding insurance eligibility for both
   lower-income and higher-income adults.

AB Unmet needs for services, such as housing and psychiatric treatment, are
   relatively common among HIV-infected individuals; however, the effects
   of different types of unmet needs on health-care outcomes are not well
   understood. This study describes unmet psychosocial needs and their
   relationship with health- care outcomes among individuals receiving HIV
   care in the southeastern US (n = 526). We used multivariate logistic
   regression to examine the association of seven categories of unmet needs
   with HIV medication use and adherence. Most participants (84.5%)
   reported at least one service need in the past year. Nearly half (47%)
   of participants with service needs reported that at least one need was
   not met. Participants with one or more unmet needs were less likely to
   be taking any HIV medications (p = 0.007) and reported poorer medication
   adherence (p = 0.013). The specific unmet needs for benefits ( including
   Social Security, health insurance and prescription coverage) (p = 0.006)
   and a support group (p = 0.040) were associated with being less likely
   to be taking any HIV medications. Unmet need for mental health- related
   counseling was associated with poorer medication adherence (p = 0.003).
   Study findings regarding the high level of unmet need and the
   association of unmet need with poorer outcomes illustrate the importance
   of interventions to address these needs.

   Sixty HIV-positive, male and female state prison inmates were
   interviewed approximately three months prior to release, and 30 were
   interviewed again between seven and 21 days after release. Variables
   associated with having utilized primary care at the time of a
   post-release interview (chi(2) p-values < 0.20) included: taking
   anti-HIV medications at the time of release, no alcohol use since
   release, living in the same place as before incarceration and rating of
   housing situation as 'comfortable' or 'very comfortable'. For
   exploratory purposes, these variables were entered into a logistic
   regression model. The model correctly classified 80% of cases overall.
   Future studies are required to ascertain whether these results would
   obtain with a statistically adequate sample size.

AB African American women are at increased risk of HIV transmission through
   heterosexual contact. HIV/AIDS is the leading cause of death among
   African American women between 25 to 34 years of age, and many of these
   women were likely infected while in college. Four focus groups were
   conducted with African American students attending Historically Black
   Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) in order to learn about the college
   dating environment and how it influenced women's risk of HIV infection.
   We used constant comparison techniques and visual display matrixes to
   analyse the data. Students identified the gender ratio imbalance of more
   women to men on campus as a key element of the campus dating environment
   and described how it places women at an increased risk for HIV
   infection. Primary consequences of this gender ratio imbalance were men
   having multiple female sexual partners during the same time period and
   women complying with men's condom use preferences. HIV preventive
   intervention programmes at HBCUs must address the gender ratio imbalance
   and its consequences to reduce women's risk of contracting the
   infection.

AB This article examines the extent to which Temporary Assistance to Needy
   Families (TANF) recipients file income tax returns and take advantage of
   the Earned Income Credit (EIC), a program specifically designed to
   increase the economic self-sufficiency of lower income earners by
   supplementing earned and other income to make working more profitable.
   This study consisted primarily of Black and Hispanic women (n = 317),
   recruited for a longitudinal study designed to examine the effects of
   welfare reform on drug using and non-drug using welfare recipients. At
   the 2-year mark, 70% of the sample reported having ever filed an income
   tax return, of these 76% had received an EIC. Both hours worked and
   earnings were positively associated with EIC receipt. In this
   population, EIC appears to be a successful mechanism for improving
   economic self-sufficiency.

AB Objectives: To examine the role of employment status and the receipt of
   social benefits in the prediction of alcohol use. Methods: Logistic
   regression models were used to analyze panel data from the National
   Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) 1987-88 and 1991-92. A total of
   7,599 respondents who were older than 16 years of age in 1987 and did
   not have a physical or mental condition were included in the analysis.
   The alcohol measures were ( a) total number of drinks in the past 30
   days; and (b) having 5 or more drinks in a day, 4 or more days in the
   past 30 days. Results: Employed welfare recipient women have a greater
   likelihood of heavy drinking than other full-time employed. We do not
   find evidence of an association between not being employed ( with or
   without benefits) and greater likelihood of engaging in heavy drinking
   behaviors. Alcohol drinking among other employment groups is not
   significantly different, with the exception of retired men who drink
   less. Conclusion: It is important to focus attention on women working
   while receiving welfare, and who may need help maintaining their jobs.

   age) and underage (18 - 20 years of age) college students attending
   college near the US/Mexico border. A random telephone survey of graduate

   the southwestern United States was conducted during the 2000 - 2003
   academic years. A university-based social science research laboratory
   conducted the telephone interviews with respondents who reported an
   occasion in the past 28 days where alcohol was being consumed (N =
   4,964). The data were analyzed using ordinary least squares multiple
   regression. The results suggests that drinking settings contributed to
   the amount of alcohol consumed by respondents. Additionally,
   environmental factors contributing to drinking vary by setting. In
   general, having many people intoxicated at an event, BYOB parties,
   playing drinking games, and having illicit drugs available contribute to
   heavier drinking.

AB Background: Access to fresh produce and other healthy foods differs
   between poor ethnic and wealthier non-ethnic neighborhoods. Given the
   need to improve access, emergency food organizations, such as food
   pantries, can provide assistance. Food pantry clients, many living in
   poor ethnic neighborhoods, are at highest risk for inadequate intake of
   fruits and vegetables as emergency food assistance often does not
   include a supply of fresh produce. This study examines the extent to
   which food pantry clients live within reasonable walking distance of
   stores carrying fresh produce, and it proposes a strategy to increase
   accessibility of produce to those clients.
   Methods: Addresses for 3985 food pantry clients residing in Pomona,
   California, in 2003 and 84 food stores categorized as selling a "variety
   of produce" or "limited produce" were geocoded using geographic
   information systems technology in 2004. A 0.8-km network buffer was used
   to measure access to stores. Cluster areas with high densities of food
   pantry clients, or hot spots, were determined.
   Results: Forty-one percent of Pomona food pantry clients were within
   walking distance of a store with fresh produce. Eighty-three percent
   were within walking distance of stores with limited produce, and 13%
   were not within walking distance of either store type. Seventeen cluster
   areas of food pantry clients accounted for 48% of clients with no access
   to a produce store.
   Conclusions: Using individual-level data allowed for the identification
   of significant numbers of food pantry clients with limited access to
   stores carrying a variety of fresh produce. Identification of the
   location of high concentrations of food pantry clients provides a
   potential solution to increase fresh fruit and vegetable access via
   mobile produce trucks.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine symptoms of
   posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a community sample of low-income
   pregnant women who met the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for the disorder.
   Method: Pregnant women (N = 948) were screened for trauma, PTSD,
   depression, and co-occurring illicit substance use. PTSD symptoms were
   compared in traumatized pregnant women and a sample of nonpregnant
   traumatized women from the National Comorbidity Survey.
   Results: Suicidal thoughts and a high degree of psychiatric comorbidity
   were common in pregnant women with PTSD. Pregnant women were selectively
   and significantly less likely to endorse reexperiencing symptoms of PTSD
   (29.5%, N = 82), compared to nonpregnant women (79.4%, N = 464).
   Conclusions: PTSD in pregnancy was associated with comorbidity, poor
   health behaviors, and lower recall of memory-related PTSD symptoms.
   Further prospective study is needed.

AB Objectives. We investigated the odds of hypertension for Black men in
   relationship to their socioeconomic position (SEP) in both childhood and
   adulthood.
   Methods. On the basis of their parents' occupation, we classified 379
   men in the Pitt County (North Carolina) Study into low and high
   childhood SEP. The men's own education, occupation, employment status,
   and home ownership status were used to classify them into low and high
   adulthood SEP. Four life-course SEP categories resulted: low
   childhood/low adulthood, low childhood/high adulthood, high
   childhood/low adulthood, and high childhood/high adulthood.
   Results. Low childhood SEP was associated with a 60% greater odds of
   hypertension, and low adulthood SEP was associated with a 2-fold greater
   odds of hypertension. Compared with men of high SEP in both childhood
   and adulthood, the odds of hypertension were 7 times greater for low/low
   SEP men, 4 times greater for low/high SEP men, and 6 times greater for
   high/low SEP men.
   Conclusions. Greater access to material resources in both childhood and
   adulthood was protective against premature hypertension in this cohort
   of Black men. Though some parameter estimates were imprecise, study
   findings are consistent with both pathway and cumulative burden models
   of hypertension.

AB Objectives. We investigated the contributions of gender, caste, and
   standard of living to inequalities in mortality across the life course
   in India.
   Methods. We conducted a multilevel cross-sectional analysis of
   individual mortality, using the 1998-1999 Indian National Family Health
   Survey data for 529321 individuals from 26 states.
   Results. Substantial mortality differentials were observed between the
   lowest and highest standard-of-living quintiles across all age groups,
   ranging from an odds ratio (OR) of 4.61 (95% confidence interval [CI]
   =2.98, 7.13) in the age group 2 to 5 years to an OR of 1.97 (95% CI =
   1.68, 2.32) in the age group 45 to 64 years. Excess mortality for girls
   was evident only for the age group 2 to 5 years (OR = 1.33, 95% CI =
   1.13, 1.58). Substantial caste differentials were observed at the
   beginning and end stages of life. Area variation in mortality is
   partially a result of the compositional effects of household standard of
   living and caste.
   Conclusions. The mortality burden, across the life course in India,
   falls disproportionately on economically disadvantaged and lower-caste
   groups. Residual state-level variation in mortality suggests an
   underlying ecology to the mortality divide in India.

AB Objectives. We considered whether US Blacks experience early health
   deterioration, as measured across biological indicators of repeated
   exposure and adaptation to stressors.
   Methods. Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data, we
   examined allostatic load scores for adults aged 18-64 years. We
   estimated probability of a high score by age, race, gender, and poverty
   status and Blacks' odds of having a high score relative to Whites' odds.
   Results. Blacks had higher scores than did Whites and had a greater
   probability of a high score at all ages, particularly at 35-64 years.
   Racial differences were not explained by poverty. Poor and nonpoor Black
   women had the highest and second highest probability of high allostatic
   load scores, respectively, and the highest excess scores compared with
   their male or White counterparts.
   Conclusions. We found evidence that racial inequalities in health exist
   across a range of biological systems among adults and are not explained
   by racial differences in poverty. The weathering effects of living in a
   race-conscious society may be greatest among those Blacks most likely to
   engage in high-effort coping.

AB Research on the new managerial regimes has been hampered by its neglect
   of the question of human agency - specifically, the nature of workers'
   responses to the advent of the new forms of work organization. Drawing
   on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the
   author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and
   effects of workers' responses to the changes they confront in their work
   situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on
   structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the
   fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing
   a fourfold typology of workers' responses, the author shows how each
   type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These
   findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a
   relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and
   practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the
   restructuring of their jobs.

AB The author develops the concept of legal framing to expand theoretical
   knowledge on the cultural and symbolic processes that enable, constrain,
   and transform social movements. Merging insights from social movement
   theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the
   author argues that law is a type of " master frame," and that mobilizing
   law's " constitutive" symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely
   overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity,
   and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing
   processes through historical-narrative analysis of the women's movement
   and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical
   evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women's
   movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a
   symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of
   gender ("protective" vs. "equal" treatment) and that this contest was
   waged in explicitly legal terms.

   and less dieting, and specifically negative aspects of religion were
   related to lower body satisfaction and greater dieting. Those utilizing
   more negative religious coping had lower body satisfaction (women: r=-
   0.47; men: r=- 0.58). Self-esteem was a mediator in these relationships.
   In women, those reporting higher negative congregational social support
   were more likely to diet than those reporting lower levels (CI: 2.0;
   1.2, 3.5). Overall, religion was related to body satisfaction and

AB Telephone interviews of 6000 representative adults from France, Germany,

   to variety. One had to do with whether the respondent preferred a choice
   of 10 versus 50 ice cream flavors. Ten choices were preferred by a
   majority of respondents from each country except the United States. A
   second item asked whether one expected a small or large menu choice in
   an upscale restaurant. A majority in all countries expected the small
   number of choices, but this expectation was lowest in the UK and USA.
   High variety expectations and preferences were weakly positively
   correlated (r=0.19). There was no substantial relation between a variety
   of demographic variables and variety preferences or expectations, except
   that older people were less inclined to prefer the high (50) variety in
   ice cream choices (r=0.28). The results suggest that the US, and the UK
   to some extent, focus on providing choices that cater to individual
   differences in preferences, whereas the continental European countries

AB Ecologists, economists and other social scientists have much incentive
   for interaction. First of all, ecological systems and socioeconomic
   systems are linked in their dynamics, and these linkages are key to
   coupling environmental protection and economic growth. Beyond this,
   however, are the obvious similarities in how ecological systems and
   socioeconomic systems function, and the common theoretical challenges in
   understanding their dynamics. This should not be surprising.
   Socioeconomic systems are in fact ecological systems, in which the
   familiar ecological phenomena of exploitation, cooperation and
   parasitism all can be identified as key features. Or, viewed from the
   opposite perspective, ecological systems are economic systems, in which
   competition for resources is key, and in which an evolutionary process
   shapes the individual agents to a distribution of specialization of
   function that leads to the emergence of flows and functionalities at
   higher levels of organization. Most fundamentally, ecological and
   socioeconomic systems alike are complex adaptive systems, in which
   patterns at the macroscopic level emerge from interactions and selection
   mechanisms mediated at many levels of organization, from individual
   agents to collectives to whole systems and even above. In such complex
   adaptive systems, robustness must be understood as emergent from
   selection processes operating at these many different levels, and the
   inherent nonlinearities can trigger sudden shifts in regimes that, in
   the case of the biosphere, can have major consequences for humanity.
   This lecture will explore the complex adaptive nature of ecosystems, and
   the implications for the robustness of ecosystem services on which we
   depend, and in particular examine the conditions under which cooperative
   behavior emerges. It will then turn attention to the socioeconomic
   systems in which environmental management is based, and ask what lessons
   can be learned from our examination of natural systems, and how we can
   modify social norms to achieve global cooperation in managing our common
   future. Of special interest will be issues of intragenerational and
   intergenerational equity, and the importance of various forms of
   discounting.

AB The authors used a representative national sample (N = 777) to test the
   evolutionary hypothesis that men would be more bothered by sexual
   infidelity and women by emotional infidelity, the Jealousy as a Specific
   Innate Module (JSIM) effect. Our alternative conceptualization of
   jealousy suggests that there are distinct emotional components of
   jealousy that did not evolve differently by gender. The authors looked
   for effects of age, socioeconomic status (SES), and type of measure
   (continuous or dichotomous) on jealousy. The authors did not find age or
   SES effects. Forced-choice items provided support for our alternative
   view; both genders showed more anger and blame over sexual infidelity
   but more hurt feelings over emotional infidelity. Continuous measures
   indicated more emotional response to sexual than emotional infidelity
   among both genders.

AB I propose a model for employing photograph-elicitation interviews in
   longitudinal ethnographic research on race and intimacy by drawing upon
   research that I conducted among British interracial families between
   1995 and 2003. I evaluate my use of family photographs in
   photo-elicitation interviews as a methodological tool, a source of
   primary data and as evidence for theory. I used photo-interviews as a
   collaborative methodological tool to clarify and challenge theories that
   I had developed to explain how white birth mothers of African-descent
   children negotiate their "racial profiles" in public and private arenas.
   I analyse a case study of one transracial mother who strategically
   employed family photographs to project respectable "presentations" of
   her interracial familial life.

AB Objective.-Evaluate whether, in a primary care setting, Caucasians (C)
   and African Americans (AA) with moderately to severely disabling
   migraines differed in regards to: utilizing the health-care system for
   migraine care, migraine diagnosis and treatment, level of mistrust in
   the health-care system, perceived communication with their physician,
   and perceived migraine triggers.
   Background.-Research has documented ethnic disparities in pain
   management. However, almost no research has been published concerning
   potential disparities in utilization, diagnosis, and/or treatment of
   migraine. It is also important to consider whether ethnic differences
   exist for trust and communication between patients and physicians, as
   these are essential when diagnosing and treating migraine.
   Methods.-Adult patients with headache (n = 313) were recruited from
   primary care waiting rooms. Of these, 131 (AA = 77; C = 54) had
   migraine, moderate to severe headache-related disability, and provided
   socioeconomic status (SES) data. Participants completed measures of
   migraine disability (MIDAS), migraine health-care utilization, diagnosis
   and treatment history, mistrust of the medical community,
   patient-physician communication (PPC), and migraine triggers. Analysis
   of covariance (controlling for SES and recruitment site), chi-square,
   and Pearson product moment correlations were conducted.
   Results.-African Americans were less likely to utilize the health-care
   setting for migraine treatment (AA = 46% vs. C = 72%, P < .001), to have
   been given a headache diagnosis (AA = 47% vs. C = 70%, P < .001), and to
   have been prescribed acute migraine medication (AA = 14% vs. C = 37%, P
   < .001). Migraine diagnosis was low for both groups, and < 15% of all
   participants had been prescribed a migraine-specific medication or a
   migraine preventive medication despite suffering moderate to severe
   levels of migraine disability. African Americans had less trust in the
   medical community (P < .001, eta(2) = 0.26) and less positive PPC (P <
   .001, eta(2)= 0.11). Also, the lower the trust and communication, the
   less likely they were to have ever seen (or currently be seeing) a
   doctor for migraine care or to have been prescribed medication.
   Conclusions.-Migraine utilization, diagnosis, and treatment were low for
   both groups. However, this was especially true for African Americans,
   who also reported lower levels of trust and communication with doctors
   relative to Caucasians. The findings highlight the need for improved
   physician and patient education about migraine diagnosis and treatment,
   the importance of cultural variation in pain presentation, and the
   importance of communication when diagnosing and treating migraine.

   Overall, high status group members were chosen more than low status
   group members to participate in school activities. Adolescents who
   identified themselves with high status groups, however, were
   significantly more likely to choose a high status target than
   adolescents identifying with low status groups or those listing no group
   at all. Further, these adolescents were more likely than adolescents who
   identified themselves with low status groups or listed no group to use
   conventional reasoning and less likely to use moral reasoning when

AB Researchers have identified specific parenting practices used by parents
   of preschoolers in mainland China (e.g., physical coercion,
   overprotection, shaming, directiveness, encouragement of modesty). Some
   of the intrusive practices have been linked to social withdrawal in
   western societies (e.g., United States, Canada). It seemed important to
   examine these associations in China because recent research suggests
   that young Chinese children who exhibit wariness in peer settings may be
   at risk for negative outcomes such as peer rejection. Therefore, the
   purpose of this study was to examine the relation between Chinese
   parenting practices and preschoolers' social withdrawal. Mothers of
   preschool-age children from mainland China (N = 446) completed
   self-report parenting questionnaires. Teachers rated children's
   reticent, solitary-passive, solitary-active, and modest behaviors.
   Results showed that (a) maternal directiveness was positively associated
   with reticent behavior in girls and negatively associated with
   solitary-passive behavior in boys, (b) maternal overprotection, for
   girls, was positively related to both reticent behavior and
   solitary-passive behavior, and negatively related to modest behavior,
   (c) coercion was positively associated with solitary-active and reticent
   behavior in girls, and (d) shaming was positively related to all forms
   of withdrawn behaviors in boys and girls. as well as positively related
   to modest behavior in boys.

AB This study examined the prospective relations among family history
   density of alcoholism (FHD), adolescent family harmony, and young
   adults' alcohol and drug dependence. Family harmony was rated by mothers
   and fathers in adolescence, and young adults' substance dependence
   diagnoses were obtained through structured inter-views. Higher FHD
   predicted lower adolescent family harmony, which in turn increased young
   adults' odds of being diagnosed with drug dependence (with and without
   alcohol dependence) compared to no diagnoses or to alcohol dependence
   only. Family harmony also interacted with FHD such that the protective
   effect of family harmony on young adults' drug dependence with or
   without alcohol dependence decreased as FHD rose, and was nonsignificant
   at high levels of FHD. The findings suggest the importance of
   distinguishing among alcohol and drug dependence disorders and examining
   their differential etiological pathways, and also suggest that the
   protective effects of harmonious family environments on substance
   dependence may be limited at high levels of FHD.

   asks different questions than does that which views Africans as problems
   or issues to be handled by Eurocentric examinations. Thus, the building
   of departments, the administrative unit for programs and disciplines,
   must begin with the view that African American studies (Africology,
   Africana studies. Black studies, etc.) is not merely history, sociology,
   or literature. What researchers in this field do, by virtue of their
   disciplinary and philosophical orientation, is something entirely
   different and is based on an exposure to a new paradigm that is deeply
   embedded in the notion and practice of African agency.

   spiritualism, which are thought to provide a sense of personal efficacy
   and control, were among the most strongly held beliefs in abused
   subjects, and were significantly higher in abused versus nonabused
   subjects. Superstition and extraordinary life forms, thought to have an
   inverse or no relation to felt control, were the least strongly held
   beliefs in abused subjects, and, along with religious beliefs, did not
   differ between the two abuse groups. Witchcraft was unexpectedly found
   to be the most strongly held belief among those with abuse histories.
   Results suggest that by providing a sense of control, certain paranormal
   beliefs may offer a powerful emotional refuge to individuals who endured

AB Objective: Previous research has found that siblings resemble each other
   in terms of alcohol use but has not examined sibling influence in Young
   adult or high-risk siblings. The Current study tested whether siblings
   prospectively influenced each other's alcohol use and how gender
   matching, age differences, and family conflict might moderate Such
   effects, Method: Data from sibling pairs (n = 169 pairs) in an ongoing
   longitudinal study of children of alcoholics and matched controls were
   collected at two time points 5 years apart. Results: Older sibling
   alcohol use predicted younger sibling alcohol use, even after
   controlling for membership in a shared peer group and for parental
   alcoholism. However, moderator variables qualified this effect, such
   that older sibling influence was significant only among sibling pairs
   who were of the same gender, closer in age, and from higher conflict
   families. Younger sibling influence was significant only for sibling
   pairs close in age, suggesting the presence of reciprocal peer-like
   effects in this subgroup. Conclusions: The current study provides
   evidence for sibling influence oil alcohol use into adulthood, but the
   extent of this influence depends on sibling similarity in age and gender
   and on levels of family conflict. Implications for family-based theory
   and intervention efforts are discussed.

   undergraduate students completed the Campus Alcohol Survey in classroom
   settings. Results: Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that
   student gender and average number of drinks when "partying" were
   significantly related to harmful consequences resulting from drinking.
   Men reported more consequences than did women, and drinking amounts were
   positively correlated with consequences. However, descriptive norm
   perception did not explain any additional variance beyond that
   attributed to gender and alcohol use. Furthermore, there was no
   significant three-way interaction among student gender, alcohol use, and
   descriptive norm perception. Conclusions: Norm perception contributed no
   significant variance in explaining harmful consequences beyond that

AB Objective: The effects of an evening of heavy drinking on next-day
   occupational performance are mixed across studies and have not been
   investigated for ship-handling performance. Furthermore, it is not known
   whether the residual effects of alcohol on next-day performance are due
   to its effects on sleep. Method: Merchant marine cadets (N = 61) who had
   been trained on a diesel power plant simulator and who drank heavily at
   least episodically were given placebo beer one evening and were
   randomized on a second evening to placebo or real beer that resulted in
   a mean breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) of .115 g%. After an 8-hour
   sleep period, a meal, and a return to <=.02 g% BrAC, cadets were
   assessed with self-report measures and the power plant simulator.
   Results: No effects of beverage condition were seen on actual
   performance, although cadets who consumed alcohol rated their
   performance as impaired compared with the placebo conditions. Alcohol
   consumption also increased the Acute Hangover Scale score, improved
   perceived sleep quality, and decreased perceived latency to sleep onset
   while not affecting perceived sleep duration. Conclusions: While
   residual alcohol effects are found on some complex performance tasks,
   residual effects of .11 to .12 g% BrAC were not seen on ship engine
   simulator performance despite increased hangover symptoms and perceived
   impairment from the hangover. Therefore, this level of heavy drinking
   might not be deleterious to next-day routine occupational performance by
   young ship engineers despite the Subjective ill effects. The perception
   that alcohol improves sleep onset might be a motivation for some to
   drink heavily. The effects on older engineers, at higher alcohol levels,
   and on other ship-handling tasks still need to be studied.

PY 2006
AB Objective: In California, driving under the influence (DUI) arrest and
   conviction rates are disproportionately higher among the Hispanic
   population. Acculturation and other factors associated with drinking and
   driving may help explain this disparity. Method: Interviews with
   Hispanic repeat DUI offenders were conducted immediately prior to
   sentencing and 2 years later. Arrest records from these offenders were
   also examined. Analyses were performed to examine the association
   between acculturation and other sociodemographic characteristics at
   baseline with DUI arrests and convictions at a 2-year follow-up.
   Results: Logistic regression modeling showed that acculturation was
   significantly related to self-reported DUI recidivism even after
   controlling for other factors associated with DUI convictions during a
   2-year follow-up. Acculturation was not found to have a statistically
   significant relation to DUI arrest rates during that same period.
   Conclusions: Among a Hispanic sample of repeat DUI offenders, the
   less-acculturated members were more likely to report a repeat DUI
   conviction at 2-year follow-Lip than the more-acculturated ones, even
   after controlling for other characteristics associated with DUI
   behaviors, such as drinking severity and marital status. The same
   pattern was not found between acculturation and arrest rates.
   Acculturation may serve as a risk factor for repeat convictions. Efforts
   to reduce multiple DUI convictions may need to consist of ways to target
   persons who are less acculturated.

AB Background. To describe the prevalence of mammography use, and to
   estimate its association with sociodemograpbics.
   Methods. A sample of 6207 women aged 60 and older from the first
   interview of Health, Well-Being and Aging in Latin America and the
   Caribbean Study (SABE) in seven cities (Buenos Aires, Bridgetown,
   Havana, Mexico, Montevideo, Santiago, and Sao Paulo). The outcome was
   reporting a mammogram within the last 2 years.
   Results. Prevalence of mammography use ranged from 9.8% in Havana to
   34.4% in Sao Paulo. Independent predictors of mammography use across
   cities were older age (lowest odds ratio [OR] = 0.92, 95% confidence
   interval [CI] 0.89-0.95), higher education (highest OR = 1.14, 95% CI
   1.08-1.20), public health insurance (lowest OR = 0.28, 95% CI
   0.11-0.76), or no insurance (lowest OR = 0.08, 95% CI 0.02-0.34)
   compared with private insurance. In a combined sample of six cities,
   higher education was associated with higher mammography use, but older
   age and insurance (public: OR = 0.54, 95% CI 0.45-0.65; no insurance: OR
   = 0.30, 95% CI 0.23-0.40; compared with private insurance) were
   associated with lower mammography use.
   Conclusions. Prevalence of mammography use across cities was lower than
   that reported for Hispanic populations in the US. In the overall sample,
   mammography use was increased in highly educated people and decreased in

AB Objective: A number of studies have documented that acculturation to
   western society is related to an increase in blood pressure (BP).
   Although there is evidence that higher socioeconomic status appears
   related to better cardiovascular health, increasing acculturation to
   western society appears related to worse cardiovascular health. The
   purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between
   acculturation and BP. Methods: Literature searches yielded 125 relevant
   research manuscripts, which were coded by teams of two independent
   raters. This study was conducted in 2003 and 2004, and research
   databases such as MEDLINE and PsychINFO were searched through 2004.
   Measures of association (effect sizes) were extracted for both systolic
   blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) readings. Random
   effects models were used to analyze the resulting data. Results: The
   overall effect sizes associated with acculturation were 0.28 for SBP and
   0.30 for DBP, with increasing acculturation to western society related
   to higher BP. More acculturated individuals bad an average of 4 mm Hg
   higher BP than less acculturated individuals, which is similar to the
   effect sizes of known risk factors for high BP such as diet and physical
   activity. The effects of acculturation on BP appear to be universal,
   with similar effect sizes found across all regions of the world. Change
   in BP due to acculturation was not related to body mass index (BMI) or
   cholesterol but was related to length of residence in the new culture,
   with the largest effect sizes seen on initial entry and then decreasing
   rapidly within the first few years. Sudden cultural changes, such as
   migration from rural to urban settings, resulted in the largest effect
   sizes, which finding supports the hypothesis that the stress of cultural
   change is important role in the acculturation effect. Conclusions:
   Acculturation to western society is associated with higher BP, and the
   distress associated with cultural change appears to be more influential
   than changes in diet or physical activity. Future studies would benefit
   from investigating how cultural change affects health and examining
   whether some nonwestern cultural values and practices are health
   protective.

AB Based on qualitative comparison of three nursing home facilities, the
   idea of organized emotional care is proposed as a complement to the
   concept of emotional labor for understanding care work. It is argued
   that emotional labor and organized emotional care are distinguished
   primarily by the presence or absence of organizational feeling rules and
   affective requirements. Care organizations can be plotted on a continuum
   with emotional labor at the coercive end and organized emotional care at
   the other. The proposed distinction restores a positive vision of
   organizational management of emotion to the sociology of work.

AB Background: Although trust in health care providers ( physicians,
   nurses, and others) may be lower among African Americans compared with
   whites, limited information is available on factors that are associated
   with low trust in these populations. This study evaluated the
   association between trust in health care providers and prior health care
   experiences, structural characteristics of health care, and
   sociodemographic factors among African Americans and whites.
   Methods: National survey of 954 non-Hispanic adult African Americans (
   n=432) and whites (n=522).
   Results: African Americans (44.7%) were more likely than whites (33.5%)
   to report low levels of trust in health care providers ( chi(2)= 12.40,
   P <.001). Fewer quality interactions with health care providers had a
   significant effect on low trust among African Americans ( odds ratio [
   OR], 3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.97-5.29; P <. 001) and whites
   ( OR, 3.99; 95% CI, 2.44-6.50; P <. 001). Among African Americans,
   respondents whose usual source of care was not a physician's office were
   most likely to report low trust ( OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.15-2.61; P=.02),
   whereas among whites, women ( OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.04-2.30; P=.03) and
   respondents with fewer annual health care visits ( OR, 1.52; 95% CI,
   1.02-2.28; P=.04) were most likely to report low trust.
   Conclusions: Compared with whites, African Americans were most likely to
   report low trust in health care providers. While fewer quality
   interactions with health care providers were associated significantly
   with low trust in both populations, usual source of medical care was
   only associated with low trust among African Americans, whereas sex and
   the number of annual health care visits were associated with low trust
   among whites. Different factors may influence trust in health care
   providers among African Americans and whites.

AB A significant number of young, low-income women experiment with ecstasy
   outside of club or rave settings. The current study examined patterns
   and risk factors of ecstasy use among this group of women. A
   cross-sectional survey was conducted among 696 women aged 18 to 31 who
   sought gynecological care from two university clinics in southeast Texas
   between December 1, 2001, and May 30, 2003. Fifteen percent of
   participants reported ever using ecstasy. Of those, over 90% used it at
   a friend's home. Compared with women who used only marijuana or other
   illicit drugs, ecstasy users were more likely to be white, use a larger
   number of other drugs, be willing to use drugs in the future, and have
   more friends who used drugs. Fewer ecstasy users strongly disapproved of
   adult drug use than users of other illicit drugs. Future interventional
   efforts should target young, low-income women to prevent future
   experimentation with illicit drugs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The lack of social integration has predicted coronary heart disease
   morbidity and mortality in prospective observational studies; however,
   the biologic mechanisms by which this may occur are not well understood.
   The objective of this study was to determine whether social integration
   is associated with inflammatory risk factors for coronary heart disease,
   specifically C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6. The study
   participants (aged 70 to 79 years; 380 men and 425 women) were from the
   MacArthur Successful Aging Study, a longitudinal study of 3
   community-based cohorts in the United States of older adults with
   relatively high physical and cognitive functioning at baseline (1988 to
   1989). The plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 and CRP were assessed
   using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Cross-sectional logistic regression analyses were performed.
   Multivariate adjusted analyses indicated that social integration was
   significantly inversely associated with CRP concentration in men after
   adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, alcohol consumption,
   physical activity, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, other major
   or chronic conditions, physical functioning, socioeconomic status, and
   depression (odds ratio 2.23, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 4.76, for
   elevated CRP [> 3.19 mg/L] in the least socially integrated quartile vs
   the most socially integrated quartile). No significant associations were
   found between social integration and interleukin-6 in men or either
   inflammatory marker in women. In conclusion, social integration was
   negatively associated with the plasma CRP concentration in men. These
   findings suggest a potential biologic mechanism for the observed
   associations between social integration and coronary heart disease in
   prospective studies. Differences may exist between women and men in the
   biologic pathways associated with social integration. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Background: Financially disadvantaged populations are more likely to
   live in communities that do not support healthy choices. This paper
   investigates whether certain characteristics of the built environment
   are associated with obesity, or coronary heart disease (CHD) risk among
   uninsured low-income women.
   Methods: Using a sample of 2001-2002 data from 2692 women enrolled in
   the WISEWOMAN program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
   the stud), team performed regression analysis (conducted in
   January-April 2005) to estimate body mass index (BMI) and the log of
   10-year CHD risk as a function of the built environment and
   socioecologic measures.
   Results: For women living in an environment of maximun mixed land use
   (i.e., an environment more conducive to health), living), BMI was lower
   by 2.60 kg/m(2) and CHD risk was lower by 20% than for women living in
   single-use Uniform environments (i.e., environments less conducive to
   health), living). An additional fitness facility per 1000 residents was
   associated with BMI and CHD risk that were lower by 1.39 kg/m(2) and
   15.1%, respectively. Crime was positively associated with BMI and CHD
   risk, whereas neighborhood affluence was negatively associated. Living
   in more racially segregated areas was negatively associated with CHD
   risk among black, Hispanic, and Asian women and positively associated
   with CHD risk among American Indian women.
   Conclusions: The built environment and socioecologic characteristics of
   financially disadvantaged women were associated with BMI and CHD risk.
   More research is needed to understand the effects of racial segregation
   or acculturation oil health for specific subpopulations.

AB Background: African Americans have lower rates of physical activity (PA)
   than Caucasians. Although correlates of PA have been Studied in many
   populations, little is known about the influences on physical activity
   for African Americans, particularly African-American men.
   Methods: Individuals were randomly selected from 20 church rosters and
   participated in a telephone survey (165 men, 407 women) in May to
   September 2003. Participants were classified according to whether they
   were meeting recommendations for moderate to vigorous physical activity,
   walking, and strength training. Sociodemographic, health, psychosocial,
   and physical environment correlates were also assessed. Mixed-model
   logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   Results: For men, explained variance ranged from 20.8% to 33.3%. For
   women, the independent variables explained 10.8% to 23.2% of the
   variance in physical activity behavior. Significant positive correlates
   among men were employment, income, self-rating of health, PA
   self-efficacy, and PA enjoyment, and fruit and vegetable intake, with
   age as a negative correlate. Significant positive correlates among women
   were employment, education, income, self-rating of health, PA
   self-efficacy, PA enjoyment, fruit and vegetable intake, reporting PA
   programs at their Church, and attempting weight loss. Negative
   correlates included age, number of chronic health conditions, and body
   mass index.
   Conclusions: Various factors influenced PA in men and women, suggesting
   a need for gender targeting in addition to cultural adaptations in PA
   interventions for African Americans.

AB Objectives: We investigated how couples' immigration status and
   ethnicity determined the decision to initiate breastfeeding and to
   breastfeed at 6 months.
   Methods: From data collected on 4207 mothers and 3013 fathers
   participating in a longitudinal birth cohort study, we used linear
   regression and covariate-adjusted proportions to estimate the
   determinants of breastfeeding behaviors. The sample was divided by
   immigration status (either foreign born or born in the United States)
   and further subdivided by ethnicity (Mexican Hispanic, non-Mexican
   Hispanic, and non-Hispanic).
   Results: Mothers born in the United States had an 85% reduction in the
   odds of breastfeeding as compared to foreign-born mothers and a 66%
   reduction in the odds of breastfeeding at 6 months. Each additional year
   of US residency decreased the odds of breastfeeding by 4%. These
   differences by immigration status were seen for Mexicans, other
   Hispanics, and non-Hispanics.
   Conclusion: The Hispanic paradox may extend to other non-Hispanic
   immigrants for breastfeeding behaviors, but may not be true for Hispanic
   mothers born in the United States. Low rates of breastfeeding for
   Hispanic American mothers indicate that they should not be overlooked by
   breastfeeding promotion programs.

   proficiency with the English language and explore the association
   between patient-clinician discussions about CAM therapy use and patient
   assessments of quality of care.
   Methods. We surveyed Chinese and Vietnamese Americans who visited 11
   community health centers in 8 major cities throughout the United
   Stateds.
   Results. Of the 4410 patients surveyed, 3258 (74%) returned completed
   questionnaires. Two thirds of respondents reported they had "ever used"
   some form of CAM therapy; however, only 7.6% of these patients had
   discussed their use of CAM therapies with clinicians. Among patients who
   had used CAM therapies during the week before their most recent visits,
   clinician-patient discussions about CAM therapy use were associated with
   better overall patient ratings oi quality of care.
   Conclusion. Use of CAM therapies was common among Chinese and Vietnamese
   Americans who had limited proficiency with the English language.
   Although discussions about CAM therapy use with clinicians were
   uncommon, these discussions were associated with better ratings of
   quality of care.

AB PURPOSE: The aim Of this Study is to assess the geographic proximity of
   cases and controls who share the same "stem" of their telephone number
   (area code, prefix, and next two digits) and compare their socioeconomic
   characteristics.
   METHODS: We compared residential proximity and characteristics of
   case-control sets selected in this way with sets consisting of the same
   cases matched to different controls on all variables except telephone
   number stein.
   RESULTS: Mean distance between telephone stem-matched pairs was much
   less than that between pairs not matched by telephone number stein (3.53
   and 20.14 km, respectively). There was slight agreement between cases
   and controls for some measures of socioeconomic status in both sets. We
   also compared distances between residences of control respondents who
   shared the same telephone number stem with those between residences of
   respondents who shared only the same telephone area code and prefix.
   Mean distances for the two groups were similar.
   CONCLUSIONS: Geographic proximity between cases and controls can be
   achieved by matching on either telephone number stem or only telephone
   area code and prefix. Adjustment for socioeconomic factors may be needed
   even if cases and controls live close to each other.

AB Objective: To examine whether social interactions influence the
   television viewing choices of adolescents in grades 7 through 12.
   Design: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey
   were used to examine the association between individual-level and
   school-level television choices. An instrumental variables approach was
   used to solve the simultaneity problem found in models that examine the
   association between individual and aggregate choices.
   Setting: In-home interviews in the United States collected in 1996.
   Participants: A sample of 4532 students in grades 7 through 12 in 132 US
   public and private schools who participated in the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).
   Main Exposure: The reported television viewing choices of an
   individual's schoolmates. Main Outcome Measure: The number of hours of
   television individuals reported viewing in a week.
   Results: The number of hours of television that adolescents report
   viewing per week was associated with their peers' reported hours of
   television viewing. Adjusted for other covariates, a 1-hour increase in
   average school-level television viewing was associated with an increase
   in almost half an hour of television viewing at the individual level.
   Conclusions: Evidence suggests that social interactions within schools
   influence the hours of television that adolescents report viewing. This
   finding is important for both future attempts at modeling the
   determinants of adolescent television viewing and suggestions for future
   policy interventions. The presence of social interactions implies that
   interventions that affect the social norms of television viewing within
   schools could also change individual television viewing. In reducing the
   number of hours of television watched, these interventions could also
   positively affect adolescent obesity, emotional problems, and academic
   achievement.

AB Objective: To estimate associations between children's peer integration
   and amount of time they spend (1) watching television, (2) watching
   violent television, and (3) co-viewing television with friends.
   Design: Survey using nationally representative data from the Panel Study
   of Income Dynamics-Child Development Supplement Wave 1.
   Setting: Nationwide survey of families with young children performed in
   1997.
   Participants: Of 3562 children, 1356 had sufficient data for inclusion
   in analyses (563 children aged 6 to 8 years and 793 children aged 9 to
   12 years).
   Main Exposure: Total time viewing television, with and without friends
   present, and time viewing violent and nonviolent television content.
   Main Outcome Measure: Amount of time children spent with friends as
   reported in two 24-hour activity diaries.
   Results: Viewing violent programs (but not nonviolent programs) was
   negatively related to time children spent with friends (aged 6-8 years,
   unstandardized regression coefficient [beta] = -0.34, 95% confidence
   interval [CI], -0.59 to -0.08; aged 9-12 years, beta=-0.41, 95% CI,
   -0.65 to -0.18). More time viewing television with friends was
   associated with more time engaging in other activities with friends
   (aged 6-8 years, beta=0.98, 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.36; aged 9-12 years,
   beta=1.03, 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.34).
   Conclusions: The more time that children spent viewing violent programs,
   the less time they spent with their friends. While this study cannot
   determine the direction of effects for this relationship, a cyclical
   process between violent media and peer integration best explains the
   findings. To optimize social development and mental health, children's
   access to violent media should be limited.

AB Objectives: To quantify the depiction of violence, blood, sexual themes,
   profanity, substances, and gambling in video games rated M (for
   "mature") and to measure agreement between the content observed and the
   rating information provided to consumers on the game box by the
   Entertainment Software Rating Board.
   Design: We created a database of M-rated video game titles, selected a
   random sample, recorded at least 1 hour of game play, quantitatively
   assessed the content, performed statistical analyses to describe the
   content, and compared our observations with the Entertainment Software
   Rating Board content descriptors and results of our prior studies.
   Setting: Harvard University, Boston, Mass.
   Participants: Authors and 1 hired game player.
   Main Exposure: M-rated video games.
   Main Outcome Measures: Percentages of game play depicting violence,
   blood, sexual themes, gambling, alcohol, tobacco, or other drugs; use of
   profanity in dialogue, song lyrics, or gestures.
   Results: Although the Entertainment Software Rating Board content
   descriptors for violence and blood provide a good indication of such
   content in the game, we identified 45 observations of content that could
   warrant a content descriptor in 29 games (81%) that lacked these content
   descriptors. M-rated video games are significantly more likely to
   contain blood, profanity, and substances; depict more severe injuries to
   human and non-human characters; and have a higher rate of human deaths
   than video games rated T (for "teen").
   Conclusion: Parents and physicians should recognize that popular M-rated
   video games contain a wide range of unlabeled content and may expose
   children and adolescents to messages that may negatively influence their
   perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors.

AB The purpose of this study was to analyze socioeconomic differences in
   cervical and corpus cancer survival, and to investigate if the
   differences are due to differences in age, cancer stage, histology and
   treatment. A total of 14 055 cases with cervical cancer and 3113 cases
   with corpus cancer were obtained from the Osaka Cancer Registry.
   Municipality-based SES measurements were obtained from the System of
   Social and Demographic Statistics. Survival analysis was carried out
   with Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Three types of Cox proportional
   hazards regression models were tested to assess survival differences
   among groups and effects of SES on survival, controlling for clinical
   factors. SES was related to age and cancer stage for cervical and corpus
   cancer patients, and histology for cervical cancer patients. Differences
   were observed in cumulative 5-year survival for cervical cancer patients
   among low, middle and high unemployment municipalities (68.9%, 64.3% and
   50.9%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Differences in cumulative 5-year
   survival for cervical cancer patients were also observed among high,
   middle and low education municipalities (65.1%, 62.2% and 56.1%,
   respectively, P < 0.0001). Similar patterns in 5-year survival were also
   found for corpus cancer patients. After adjusting for age, cancer stage,
   histology and treatment, survival differences between patients from high
   and low SES areas still remained. In conclusion, our population-based
   analysis of a metropolitan representative sample in Japan has
   demonstrated, for the first time in Japan, SES differences in survival
   following cervical and corpus cancer.

AB Cross-cultural comparisons of categorization often confound cultural
   factors with expertise. This paper reports four experiments on the
   conceptual behavior of Native American and majority-culture fish
   experts. The two groups live in the same general area and engage in
   essentially the same set of fishing-related behaviors. Nonetheless,
   cultural differences were consistently observed. Majority-culture fish
   experts tended to sort fish into taxonomic and goal-related categories.
   They also showed,in influence of goals on probes of ecological
   relations, tending to answer in terms of relations involving adult fish.
   Native American fish experts, in contrast, were more likely to sort
   ecologically. They were also more likely to see positive and reciprocal
   ecological relations. tending to answer in terms of relations involving
   the full life cycle of fish. Further experiments support the view that
   the cultural differences do not reflect different knowledge bases but
   rather differences in the organization and accessibility of knowledge.
   At a minimum the results suggest that similar activities within a
   well-structured domain do not necessarily lead to common
   conceptualizations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB This article calls for an ethnographic and theoretical investigation of
   removal ( and specifically, deportation) that would broaden our
   understanding of the significance of this purportedly routine state
   practice. Based on fieldwork conducted in Somaliland in 2002 and 2003,
   it takes as its text the narratives of a group of Somalis deported from
   the United States and Canada following the events of September 11, 2001.
   As "criminal aliens," the majority of these men ( and one woman) had
   been incarcerated both as prisoners and as administrative detainees
   before being deported unexpectedly to stateless Somalia. Yet, the
   somewhat exceptional nature of this particular deportation highlights
   the various political and social exclusions that might be overlooked in
   the more regular instances of deportation ( e. g., that of "illegal"
   immigrants and rejected asylum seekers). By following the trajectories
   of these Muslim deportees from incarceration in the host state to
   reincorporation/alienation at home, it points to the legal and financial
   domains that underpin present-day practices of deportation and the
   embodied and chronotopic experiences they effect. Further, this article
   outlines how future anthropological work on removal might proceed while
   underscoring the relevance of this field to the studies of citizenship
   and transnationalism, globalization, and governmentality.

   Americans and Arab Americans.
   Design: Qualitative study using semi-structured reproductive histories
   and open-ended ethnographic interviews.
   Setting: Infertile volunteers in a private IVF clinic in Dearborn,
   Michigan, an Arab American ethnic enclave community in metropolitan
   Detroit.
   Patient(s): Arab American men presenting for infertility diagnosis and
   treatment, including assisted reproductive technologies.
   Intervention(S): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Perceived barriers to effective infertility
   care.
   Result(s): Arab Americans and African Americans living in metropolitan
   Detroit are at increased risk of infertility and share similar histories
   of poverty, racism, and cultural barriers to medical treatment. This
   study, which focused on infertile Arab American men living in or near
   Dearborn (an ethnic enclave community composed mainly of recent
   immigrants and war refugees), revealed significant barriers to effective
   infertility care, including economic constraints, linguistic and
   cultural barriers, and social marginalization in mainstream U.S.
   society, particularly after September 11, 2001.
   Conclusion(S): Arab Americans experience disparities in access to
   infertility care, largely because of poverty and social marginalization
   in post-September 11th America.

AB Objective: To determine whether important racial, ethnic, or
   socioeconomic status (SES) health disparities exist in infertility,
   impaired fecundity, or infertility treatment.
   Design: Four waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) were
   pooled. Measures were compared across various race/ethnicity, education,
   and age groups.
   Participant(s): Data for 31,047 women 15-44 years old from the NSFG were
   pooled.
   Intervention(s): Outcomes were compared by whether the women's states of
   residence bad a mandate in place (at least I year before the interview)
   to compel insurers to cover or offer to cover infertility treatment.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Infertility status, impaired fecundity, ever
   having sought infertility treatment.
   Result(s): Infertility is more common for non-Hispanic black women,
   non-Hispanic other race women, and Hispanic women than for non-Hispanic
   white women, and both infertility and impaired fecundity are more common
   for high school dropouts and high school graduates with no college than
   for 4-year college graduates, and for older women compared with women 29
   and younger. Older women, non-Hispanic white women, and women who are
   more educated (with at least some college) are more likely to have ever
   received treatment. No evidence has been found that the racial, ethnic,
   or education disparities are ameliorated by the health insurance
   mandates.
   Conclusion(s): Racial, ethnic, and educational disparities exist in
   infertility status and treatment, and educational disparities in
   impaired fecundity. More study of the impact of infertility treatment
   mandates on these disparities is needed.

   Patient(s): None.

   Result(s): Epidemiological data suggests that approximately 80 million
   people worldwide are infertile. Most countries in the industrial west
   have declining fertility rates marked by late marriage, postponed
   childbearing, and primary infertility. In contrast, in the developing
   world, there is little voluntary effort to postpone childbearing and
   early first marriage is common. However, a high prevalence of sexually
   transmitted infections and infections acquired as a result of inadequate
   health care result in increased rates of secondary infertility. In
   developing societies, childlessness is often highly stigmatized and
   leads to profound social suffering for infertile women in particular,
   yet most infertile people in the developing world have virtually no
   access to effective treatment. Internationally, a minority of countries
   offer IVF, and even where it is available, on average it is
   prohibitively expensive and utilized by a fraction of those who could
   benefit from its use.
   Conclusion(s): Wide disparities exist in the quality. availability, and
   delivery of infertility services between the developed and developing
   nations of the world.

   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: University-hospital-based fertility center.
   Patient(s): A total of 1,500 consecutive women who presented for
   infertility care. Intervention(S): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Self-report questionnaire assessing patient
   race/ethnicity, diagnosis, income, education level, and duration of
   infertility before seeking care.
   Result(S): African American women experienced a significantly longer
   duration of infertility before seeking care compared with Caucasian
   women (4.3 vs. 3.3 years, respectively P=.03). With regard to
   infertility diagnosis, a significantly greater proportion of African
   American and Hispanic women had tubal factor infertility compared with
   Caucasian women (24.0% and 27.3% vs. 5.3%, respectively; P=.001).
   Looking at the highest level of education attained by patients. a
   significantly greater proportion of African American and Hispanic women
   had less than a 4-year college degree compared with Caucasian women (48%
   and 40.9% vs. 13.2%, respectively: P <.001). Examining the gross annual

   African American and Hispanic women had household incomes below $100,000
   compared with Caucasian women (72% and 68.2% vs. 37.3%, respectively; P
   <.01).
   Conclusion(S): African American women are more likely to seek
   infertility treatment after a longer duration of failed conception
   compared with Caucasian women. Furthermore, African American, and
   Hispanic women are more likely to have tubal factor infertility, a lower
   education level. and a lower household income compared with Caucasian

   infertility.
   Intervention(s): Tape-recorded interviews with 88 women and 30 men were
   transcribed and analyzed for emergent themes.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Cultural beliefs regarding fertility and
   infertility, the value placed on having children, access to and use of
   health care resources, and non-biomedical approaches to having children.
   Result(s): Latino women and men believed that children were the basis of
   the marital relationship and that childless marriages were considered a
   failure. No couples had the economic resources to pursue medical
   treatment beyond a basic level. A difference was found in approaches to
   infertility treatment between women raised in the United States and
   those raised elsewhere. with those raised in the United States being
   more assertive in seeking care. Women frequently saw practitioners of
   Western biomedicine and humoral medicine. Women reported that they would
   continue trying to conceive until they reached menopause.
   Conclusion(s): Infertility is a devastating experience for Latinos that
   has far-reaching effects, both on women and men individually and on the

AB Objective: Racial disparity in assisted reproductive technology (ART)
   outcomes has been reported but remains controversial. Reasons for the
   disparity are unclear, and access to care has been suggested as a
   causative factor. In this study, we sought to examine minority
   utilization of ART in the Department of Defense (DoD) compared with
   minority utilization in the U.S. ART population. Outcomes from ART were
   compared between Caucasian (Cau) and African American (AA) patients, and
   etiologies of dispirity were examined.
   Design: Retrospective cohort Study.
   Setting: University-based ART program.
   Patient(S): A total of 1,457 patients undergoing first-cycle fresh,
   nondonor ART.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate,
   implantation rate, spontaneous abortion rate.
   Result(s): Within the DoD population, AA women had a fourfold increase
   in utilization of ART services relative to the U.S. ART population. In
   this equal-access-to-care setting, AA women experienced a clinically
   significant decrease in live birth rate that did not reach statistical
   significance (29.6% vs. 35.8%, risk ratio [RR] 0.83. 95% confidence
   interval [CI] 0.67-1.02) and a statistically significant increase in
   spontaneous abortions compared with Cau women (25% vs. 15.9%, RR 1.57,
   95% CI 1.05-2.36). This might be explained, in part, by a higher
   prevalence of uterine leiomyomas in AA women (30.8% AA vs. 10.7% Cau, RR
   2.85, 95% CI 2.06-3.95). For both AA and Cau women, the presence of
   fibroids at baseline ultrasound was associated with reductions in
   clinical pregnancy rates (35% with leiomyomas vs. 43.2% without
   leiomyomas, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.51-0.98), live birth rates (26.2% vs.
   36.0%. RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.44-0.90), and implantation rates (25.6% vs.
   31.1% RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98).
   Conclusion(s): Utilization of ART services among AA women increased when
   access to care was improved. A clinically significant reduction in live
   birth rate and statistically significant increase in spontaneous
   abortion rate was observed in AA women compared with Cau women.
   Leiomyomas were three times more prevalent in AA women and reduced ART
   success. regardless of race. The persistence of racial differences in an
   equal-accessto-care environment might be explained, in part, by the
   increased prevalence of leiomyomas in AA women.

AB Patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) often
   experience emotional distress, a perceived lack of validation, and an
   unsatisfactory experience with health care providers. A health care
   provider can provide the patient with a framework in which to understand
   and legitimize their symptoms, remove self-doubt or blame, and identify
   factors that contribute to symptoms that the patient can influence or
   control. This framework can be strengthened with the consideration of
   various important factors that impact FGID but are often overlooked.
   These include gender, age, society, culture, and the patient's
   perspective. There is evidence for sex- and gender-related differences
   in FGID, particularly irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Whereas the
   majority of FGID, including IBS, bloating, constipation, chronic
   functional abdominal pain, and pelvic floor dysfunction, are more
   prevalent in women than men, functional esophageal and gastroduodenal
   disorders do not appear to vary by gender. Limited studies suggest that
   sex differences in visceral perception, cardioautonomic responses,
   gastrointestinal motility, and brain activation patterns to visceral
   stimuli exist in IBS. Gender differences in social factors,
   psychological symptoms, and response to psychological treatments have
   not been adequately studied. However, there appears to be a greater
   clinical response to serotonergic agents developed for IBS in women
   compared to men. The impact of social and cultural factors on the
   meaning, expression, and course of FGID are important. The prevalence of
   IBS appears to be lower in non-Western than Western countries. Although
   further studies are needed, the existing literature suggests that they
   are important to consider from both research and clinical perspectives.

AB This report reviews recent research on the psychosocial aspects of the
   functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). A review and evaluation
   of existing literature was conducted by a multidisciplinary committee of
   experts in this field. This report is a synopsis of a chapter published
   in the Rome III book. The committee reached consensus in finding
   considerable evidence supporting the association between psychological
   distress, childhood trauma and recent environmental stress, and several
   of the FGIDs but noted that this association is not specific to FGIDs.
   There is also considerable evidence that psychosocial variables are
   important determinants of the outcomes of global well-being,
   health-related quality of life, and health care seeking. In line with
   these descriptive findings, there is now increasing evidence that a
   number of psychological treatments and antidepressants are helpful in
   reducing symptoms and other consequences of the FGIDs in children and
   adults. The FGIDs are a result of complex interactions between
   biological, psychological, and social factors, and they can only be
   treated satisfactorily when all these factors are considered and
   addressed. Therefore, knowledge about the psychosocial aspects of FGIDs
   is fundamental and critical to the understanding, assessment, and
   treatment of these disorders. More extensive physician training is
   needed if these aspects of treatment are to be used effectively and
   widely in clinical practice.

AB Frank Welz's Kritik der Lebenswelt undertakes a sociology of knowledge
   criticism of the work of Edmund Husserl and Alfred Schutz that construes
   them as developing absolutist, egological systems opposed to the
   "processual'' worldview prominent since the modern rise of natural
   science. Welz, though, misunderstands the work of Schutz and Husserl and
   neglects how their focus on consciousness and eidetic features pertains
   to the kind of reflection that one must undertake if one would avoid
   succumbing to absolutism, that uncovers the presuppositions of the
   processual worldview itself, and that secures a domain distinctive of
   philosophy over against sociology. Finally, Welz's charge that Schutz
   favors a Neo-Kantian social scientific methodology contradictory to his
   phenomenology neglects the levels of Schutz's discourse and ignores how
   the Weberian ideal-typical approach can be subsumed within
   phenomenology.

AB Background A long-held view links higher socioeconomic status (SES) to
   higher rates of childhood leukaemia. Some recent studies exhibit
   associations in the opposite direction.
   Methods We reviewed journal literature through August 2002 for
   associations between childhood leukaemia and socioeconomic measures. We
   determined the direction of each association and its P-value. We
   described the results with regard to study design, calendar period,
   geographic locale, and level of the socioeconomic measures (individual
   or ecological). For measures with sufficient number of results, we
   computed summary P-values across studies.
   Results Case-control studies conducted in North America since 1980 have
   involved subject interviews or self-administered questionnaires and have
   consistently reported inverse (negative) associations of childhood
   leukaemia with individual-level measures of family income, mother's
   education, and father's education. In contrast, associations have been
   consistently positive with father's occupational class in record-based
   case-control studies and with average occupational class in ecological
   studies.
   Conclusions Connections of SES measures to childhood leukaemia are
   likely to vary with place and time. Validation studies are needed to
   estimate SES-related selection and participation in case-control
   studies. Because different socioeconomic measures (such as income and
   education) and individual-level and ecological-level measures may
   represent different risk factors, we advise researchers to report these
   measures separately rather than in summary indices of social class.

AB Background: The prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD) is currently
   considered to be 10-15%. Most studies were performed with a brief
   unidimensional instruments (mostly the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
   Scale-EPDS) with focus on depression and not on other symptoms and
   disorders. Most cited studies were conducted in Western economically
   developed countries.
   Methods: We reviewed the literature on prevalence of postpartum
   depression and depressive symptoms in a wide range of countries.
   Results: 143 studies were identified reporting prevalence in 40
   countries. It is demonstrated that there is a wide range of reported
   prevalence of PPD, ranging from almost 0% to almost 60%. In some
   countries like Singapore, Malta, Malaysia, Austria and Denmark there are
   very few reports of PPD or postpartum depressive symptoms, whereas in
   other countries (e.g. Brazil, Guyana, Costa Rica, Italy, Chile, South
   Africa, Taiwan and Korea) reported postpartum depressive symptoms are
   very prevalent.
   Conclusions: We believe that the widely cited mean prevalence of
   PPD-10-15% is not representative of the actual global prevalence and
   magnitude of the problem, due to the wide range of reports. The
   variability in reported PPD might be due to cross-cultural variables,
   reporting style, differences in perception of mental health and its
   stigma, differences in socio-economic environments (e.g. poverty, levels
   of social support or its perception, nutrition, stress), and biological
   vulnerability factors. The elucidation of the underlying processes of
   this variability as well as the diversity of postpartum normal versus
   abnormal expressions of symptoms may contribute to better understanding
   of the diversified ante, peri- and postpartum phenomena. (c) 2005

   functioning in a sample of 100 individuals in residential care with a
   mean age of 83.11 years old. Study participants resided in skilled care,
   intermediate care, or assisted living facilities. Based on interview
   data collected on site in participants' residential settings,
   hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed that active and
   passive coping and meaning-based coping had separate influences on
   measures of positive psychosocial functioning. Active coping was
   correlated with higher positive affect, whereas passive coping was
   associated with higher negative affect and self-acceptance. Positive
   reappraisal, a meaning-based coping strategy, was uniquely associated
   with higher positive affect, positive social relations, and
   self-acceptance. Positive religious coping was not independently
   associated with positive psychosocial functioning indices, whereas
   negative religious coping was related to higher negative affect. Health
   functioning did not contribute to positive psychosocial functioning in
   this sample. The results confirm the separate importance of
   health-related and meaning-based coping strategies in explaining
   positive psychosocial functioning in older adults living in residential
   care settings.

AB Advances in genomic technology have put the utility of collecting racial

   potential of moving toward '' personalized medicine '' by using a
   person's genome to administer medications. Genetics will not erose the
   importance of race and ethnicity because race and ethnicity do not
   measure genetic composition. Unlike genes, race an ethnicity are social
   constructs; 2 persons with identical genetic makeup may self-identify as
   being of different race or ethnic origin. Race and ethnic categories
   have been subject to change over time; a person's self-identification
   may vary according to the context, wording, and format of the question 0
   0! asked. Despite the fluid nature of the concept, self-identified race
   and ethnicity can capture something that genes cannot, namely, aspects
   of culture, behavior, diet, environment. and features of social status
   that commonly used measures of socioeconomic status, such as income,
   education, and occupation, cannot measure.

   abandon the fight, depending on battlefield losses. Furthermore,
   parameters are introduced to provide a framework for incorporating the

EP 504
PD APR 2006

AB Background: Black American men continue to suffer disproportionately
   from epidemically higher rates of prostate cancer. We hypothesize that
   complex reasons for persistently higher death rates of prostate cancer
   in this group are steeped in social factors associated with health
   access.
   Methods: We utilized data from the It's All About U prostate cancer
   prevention study among black men to investigate: 1) what social
   ecological factors were predictive of prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
   testing and digital rectal examinations (DRE); 2) if block men were
   aware of prostate cancer screening and, if screening was available,
   would they take the PSA and DRE? Quantitative cross-sectional data from
   a cohort of 276 black men with no diagnosis of prostate cancer were
   analyzed to identify characteristics, beliefs, practices and attitudes
   of this group toward prostate cancer screening. We created a social
   ecological model to examine which social factors (i.e., environmental,
   personal, person/environment interplay, black culture and institutional
   policy) were predictive of PSA and DRE, PSA only and DIRE only. To
   reduce data and identify data patterns, factor analyses (tested for
   reliability by calculating Cronbach alpha scores) were performed.
   Variables were standardized with Z scores and analyzed with predictive
   analytic software technology (SPSS, version 12). A multivariate binary
   logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of PSA and DRE.
   Results: A significant predictor of both PSA and DRE was the physician's
   direct prostate cancer communication message (P < 0.010). Significant
   correlations exist in PSA and DRE outcomes with a physician's engaging
   communication style (P < 0.012), encouragement to screen (P < 0.001) and
   sharing prostate cancer information (P < 0.001); as was men
   understanding the serious risk of prostate cancer (P < 0.001), culture
   (P < 0.004), positive interaction with healthcare staff, significant
   other(s) and providers (P < 0.001), and environmental dimensions (P <
   0.006). A profile of four major self-reported barriers to screening were
   identified (i.e., fear, internal locus of health, comfort level and
   external locus of health). Lastly, men who utilized health systems with
   a prostate cancer screening policy had high percentages of PSA and DIRE
   (63.3%), PSA only (70.9%) and DIRE only (81.7%).
   Conclusion: A physician's aggressive, positive engagement in shared
   decision-making, tailored social influences promoting prostate cancer
   prevention among black men, as well as institutional screening policy,
   has the potential to increase early detection and reduce morbidity among
   this group.

AB In this article, we bring together recent findings from developmental
   science and cognitive neuroscience to argue that perception-action
   coupling constitutes the fundamental mechanism of motor cognition. A
   variety of empirical evidence suggests that observed and executed
   actions are coded in a common cognitive and neural framework, enabling
   individuals to construct shared representations of self and other
   actions. We review work to suggest that such shared representations
   support action anticipation, organization, and imitation. These
   processes,along with additional computational mechanisms for determining
   a sense of agency and behavioral regulation, form the fabric of social
   interaction. In addition, humans possess the capacity to move beyond
   these basic aspects of action analysis to interpret behavior at a deeper
   level, an ability that may be outside the scope of the mirror system.
   Understanding the nature of shared representations from the vantage
   point of developmental and cognitive science and neuroscience has the
   potential to inform a range of motor and social processes. This
   perspective also elucidates intriguing new directions and research
   questions and generates specific hypotheses regarding the impact of
   early disorders (e.g., developmental movement disorders) on subsequent
   action processing.

AB Peng and Nisbett (1999) claimed that members of Asian cultures show a
   greater preference than Euro-Americans for proverbs expressing paradox
   (so-called dialectical proverbs; e.g., Too humble is half proud). The
   present research sought to replicate this claim with the same set of
   stimuli used in Peng and Nisbett's Experiment 2 and a new set of
   dialectical and nondialectical proverbs that were screened to be
   comparably pleasing in phrasing. Whereas the proverbs were rated as more
   familiar and (in Set 1) more poetic by Chinese than by American
   participants, no group differences were found in relation to proverb
   dialecticality. Both the Chinese and Americans in our study rated the
   dialectical proverbs from Peng and Nisbett's study as more likable,
   higher in wisdom, and higher in poeticality than the nondialectical
   proverbs. For Set 2, both groups found the dialectical proverbs to be as
   likable, wise, and poetic as the nondialectical proverbs. When
   poeticality was covaried out, dialectical proverbs were liked better
   than nondialectical proverbs across both stimulus sets by the Chinese
   and the Americans alike, and when wisdom was covaried out, the effect of
   dialecticality was reduced in both sets and groups. Our findings
   indicate that caution should be taken in ascribing differences in
   proverb preferences solely to cultural differences in reasoning.

AB "Balance" in the classroom has been the subject of recent debate in
   academic and public spheres, with some calling for legislation to
   prevent instructors from "indoctrinating" students. The debate over
   balance is important to sociology because the discipline is sometimes
   characterized as overtly liberal and activist; but the implications of
   balance for teaching and learning remain unclear. In this article, we
   present the results of a study in which we operationalized balance as
   students' perceptions of whether instructors discussed points of view
   other than their own and invited criticism of their ideas. Using OLS
   regression on undergraduate classes' quantitative evaluations of
   sociology instructors at Indiana University during the 2002-2003
   academic year (N = 99 classes), we asked whether classes perceived their
   sociology instructors to be balanced and whether positive perceptions
   led to better evaluations. We also asked about the relative influence of
   sociology classes' perceptions of balance compared to other influences.
   We found that most classes perceived their instructors as balanced and
   instructors who were perceived as being more balanced received better
   evaluations. However, we also found that balance was not as important as
   other factors in influencing evaluations. We discuss implications.

AB BACKGROUND: To prevent donor loss and improve retention, it is important
   to understand the major deterrents to blood donation and to identify
   factors that can be effectively addressed by blood centers.
   STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS A 30-item self-administered questionnaire was
   completed in 2003 by 1705 first-time and 2437 repeat US donors who had
   not donated in 2 to 3 years. Asian, Hispanic, black, and white
   first-time and repeat donors rated the importance of deterrents to
   donation in their decision to not return with a 1 to 5 scale.
   Categorical analysis of variance methods were used to compare the
   importance of deterrents between first-time and repeat donors of
   different race or ethnicity.
   RESULTS: Not having a convenient place to donate was most commonly cited
   as an important or very important reason for not returning by 32 to 42
   percent of first-time and 26 to 43 percent of repeat respondents.
   Although bad treatment and poor staff skills were less of a barrier than
   convenience, they were more important for minority donors. Other factors
   such as physical side effects, foreign travel, or length of the process
   appeared less important.
   CONCLUSION: Inconvenience is a major barrier to donating, suggesting
   that mobile collections and increased hours of operation might help
   recapture lapsed donors. The finding that lapsed minority donors were

AB OBJECTIVES To quantify expressed stigma in clients of the Kangemi
   program for HIV+ children, and to characterize the association between
   stigma and other population characteristics.
   METHODS By means of a household survey we created a stigma index and
   indices for other social and knowledge domains that influence
   HIV-related healthcare. We used chi(2), anova, and correlation to
   identify associations between domains.
   RESULTS The mean (+/- SD) expressed stigma on a six points scale (6 =
   least stigma) was 3.65 +/- 1.64. Composite scores on knowledge about
   AIDS were skewed toward more knowledge; and analysis of individual
   knowledge items indicates that most respondents reject erroneous
   traditional beliefs and myths about the causes and transmission routes
   of AIDS. Respondents who were younger, had never married, and had less
   education expressed greater stigma. Differences in stigma were
   associated with poor knowledge about AIDS and negative attitudes toward
   testing, but not with gender or tribal affiliation. Condom use at last
   intercourse, unrelated to stigma, was only 40% (n = 218).
   CONCLUSIONS While this population has good knowledge about AIDS and
   appraises risks realistically, it fails to reduce these risks.
   Associations between stigma and other domains can inform interventions
   that improve HIV care and mitigate spread of HIV.

AB BACKGROUND: To prevent donor loss and improve retention, it is important
   to understand the major deterrents to blood donation and to identify
   factors that can be effectively addressed by blood centers.STUDY DESIGN
   AND METHODS A 30-item self-administered questionnaire was completed in
   2003 by 1705 first-time and 2437 repeat US donors who had not donated in
   2 to 3 years. Asian, Hispanic, black, and white first-time and repeat
   donors rated the importance of deterrents to donation in their decision
   to not return with a 1 to 5 scale. Categorical analysis of variance
   methods were used to compare the importance of deterrents between
   first-time and repeat donors of different race or ethnicity.RESULTS: Not
   having a convenient place to donate was most commonly cited as an
   important or very important reason for not returning by 32 to 42 percent
   of first-time and 26 to 43 percent of repeat respondents. Although bad
   treatment and poor staff skills were less of a barrier than convenience,
   they were more important for minority donors. Other factors such as
   physical side effects, foreign travel, or length of the process appeared
   less important.CONCLUSION: Inconvenience is a major barrier to donating,
   suggesting that mobile collections and increased hours of operation
   might help recapture lapsed donors. The finding that lapsed minority
   donors were more likely to give bad treatment and poor staff skills as
   important reasons to not donate is disconcerting in light of the
   changing donor demographics and increased efforts to recruit these
   donors.

AB To interact successfully, individuals must not only recognize one
   another as intentional agents driven primarily by internal mental
   states, but also possess a system for making reliable and useful
   inferences about the nature of those beliefs, feelings, goals, and
   dispositions. The ability to make such mental state inferences (i.e., to
   mentalize or mindread) is the central accomplishment of human social
   cognition. The present article suggests that our understanding of how
   humans go about making mental state inferences will benefit from
   treating social cognition primarily as an information processing system
   that comprises a set of mechanisms for elaborating more basic social
   information into an understanding of another's mind. Following Marr's
   [Marr, D., 1982. Vision. W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, CA] framework for
   the study of such information processing systems, I suggest that
   questions about social cognition might profitably be asked at three
   levels computation, algorithm, and implementation - and outline a number
   of ways in which a description of social cognition at the middle level
   (i.e., the step-by-step processes that give rise to mental state
   inferences) can be informed by analysis at the other two. (c) 2006

AB BACKGROUND. Few studies have examined the outcomes for Hispanic men with
   prostate carcinoma and incorporated socioeconomic factors in association
   with race/ethnicity in affecting survival, adjusting for factors on
   cancer stage, grade, comorbidity, and treatment.
   METHODS. We studied a population-based cohort of 61,228 men diagnosed
   with local or regional stage prostate carcinoma at age 65 years or older
   between 1992 and 1999 in the 11 SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results) areas, identified from the SEER-Medicare linked data with
   up to 11 years of followup.
   RESULTS. Low socioeconomic status was significantly associated with
   decreasing survival in all men with prostate carcinoma. Those living in
   the community with the lowest quartile of socioeconomic status were 31%
   more likely to die than those living in the highest quartile (hazard
   ratio [HR] of all-cause mortality: 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]:
   1.25-1.36) after adjustment for patient age, comorbidity, Gleason score,
   and treatment. The HR remained almost unchanged after controlling for
   race/ethnicity (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.26-1.38). Compared with Caucasians,
   the risk of mortality in African American men was marginally
   significantly higher (HR: 1.06; 95% CI: 1.01-1.11) after controlling for
   education, and no longer significant after adjusting for poverty,
   income, or composite socioeconomic variable; the HR was lower for
   Hispanic men (HR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) after adjustment for
   education and other socioeconomic variables.
   CONCLUSION. Racial disparity in survival among men with local or
   regional prostate carcinoma was largely explained by socioeconomic
   status and other factors. Lower socioeconomic status appeared to be one
   of the major barriers to achieving comparable outcomes for men with
   prostate carcinoma. Cancer 2006;106:

AB The authors examined whether low levels of social engagement in midlife
   and late life were associated with the risk of incident dementia in
   2,513 Japanese-American men who have been followed since 1965 as part of
   the Honolulu Heart Program and the Honolulu-Asia Aging Study. In 1991,
   assessment of dementia began; incident dementia cases (n = 222) were
   diagnosed in 1994 and 1997. Social engagement was assessed in midlife
   (1968) and late life (1991). The relation between social engagement and
   dementia risk was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. No
   level of midlife social engagement was associated with the risk of
   dementia. In late life, compared with participants in the highest
   quartile of late-life social engagement, those in the lowest quartile
   had a significantly increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio = 2.34, 95%
   confidence interval: 1.18, 4.65). However, compared with those who were
   in the highest quartile of social engagement at both midlife and late
   life, only decreased social engagement from midlife to late life was
   associated with an increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio = 1.87, 95%
   confidence interval: 1.12, 3.13). Although low social engagement in late
   life is associated with risk of dementia, levels of late-life social
   engagement may already have been modified by the dementing process and
   may be associated with prodromal dementia.

   conditions and lower-body functional limitations (LBFLs) using data from
   563 subjects of the African-American Health Study. This population-based
   cohort received in-home evaluations. Five items involving LBFL were
   obtained at baseline (2000-2001) and 3 years later. Subjects were
   considered to have LBFL if they reported difficulty on at least two of
   the five tasks. The external appearance of the block the respondent
   lived on was rated during sample enumeration by use of five items (rated
   excellent, good, fair, or poor). Of 563 subjects with 0-1 LBFL at
   baseline, 15% and 14% lived in neighborhoods with 4-5 and 2-3 fair/poor
   conditions, respectively. Logistic regression adjusting for propensity
   scores showed that persons who lived in neighborhoods with 4-5 versus
   0-1 fair/poor condition were 3.07 times (95% confidence interval: 1.58,
   5.94) more likely to develop two or more LBFLs. The odds ratio was 2.24
   (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 4.70) when living in neighborhoods with
   2-3 conditions versus 0-1 fair/poor condition. Odds ratios for
   individual neighborhood characteristics varied from 3.45 (fair/poor
   street conditions) to 2.01 (fair/poor noise level). Sensitivity analyses
   showed the robustness of the findings. Poor neighborhood conditions
   appear to be an independent contributor to the risk of incident LBFLs in
   middle-aged African Americans.

AB Human biologists recognize the centrality of parental feeding beliefs
   and related practices in structuring children's under-nutrition risk in
   food-insecure settings. By contrast, how they might similarly structure
   children's nutrition-related health risks in calorically rich ecologies
   has barely been considered. Using the case of 3- to 6-year-old children
   in a rural Southeastern U.S. community with very high obesity rates, we
   use cognitive methods such as consensus analysis to determine how
   parental cultural models of child eating and feeding are linked to high
   calorie, obesogenic child diets. We find that parental models are very
   consistent with biomedical understandings (reduce fat, reduce sugar,
   portion control, etc.). Regardless, children's diets are extremely high
   in calories overall as well as in high sugar and fat food items. We
   suggest three likely and mutually reinforcing contributing factors to
   persistent and increasing early childhood overweight and obesity:
   parents' ambivalence about modeling healthy eating, children's active
   resistance, and the balance of parents' social against nutritive goals
   at mealtimes. The active role of children as social architects of their
   own biology has been little explored in human biological studies, and
   should provide novel and important understandings of the biocultural
   construction of childhood over-nutrition.

AB This report draws on data from the author's China Study of Midlife Women
   (CSMW) to test the popular notion that East Asian women have a low level
   of midlife symptom reporting compared with North American women.
   Symptom-reporting frequencies from a general population sample of 156
   Chinese women of age 45-55 in China are compared with rates from
   published studies on midlife women in Japan, Canada, and the U.S. While
   the Japanese women's rates of reporting 16 core symptoms are uniformly
   low, the Chinese women's frequencies range from low to moderate. Except
   on hot flashes and headaches, the Chinese women's symptom-reporting
   rates tend to be more similar to the North American than to the Japanese
   sample. This analysis demonstrates that women's midlife symptom
   reporting in China cannot be equated with findings on women in Japan.
   Sources should be more cautious in making generalizations about East
   Asian women in this regard.

AB Background: Although obesity has been associated with socioeconomic
   status among Hispanics living in the United States, little is known
   about whether a similar association exists among Hispanics living in
   Mexico, particularly among those living along the U.S.-Mexico border.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of obesity and its association
   with socioeconomic status in Mexican schoolchildren attending public and
   private schools in Tijuana, Baja California.
   Methods: Anthropometric measurements and socioeconomic status were
   assessed in a cross-sectional study of 1172 school children, aged 6 to
   13 years from 55 schools in Tijuana in 2001-2002. Underweight (body mass
   index [BMI] for age 5th percentile or lower), risk of overweight (BMI at
   85th percentile or higher), and overweight (BMI greater than 95th
   percentile) were assessed using charts published by the Centers for
   Disease Control and Prevention.
   Results: Abnormalities in weight were found in 46.3% of 587 boys and
   43.7% of 585 girls in the study. Undernutrition was found in 3.7% of the
   boys and 3.8% of the girls. The general prevalence of overweight was
   23.2% for boys and 21.7% for girls. Children living in low-income
   neighborhoods had the thickest biceps skinfolds (p < 0.01), while
   children living in moderate-income neighborhoods and attending public
   schools had the thickest triceps skinfolds (p < 0.001). Although boys
   living in high socioeconomic status neighborhoods were at decreased risk
   for being overweight, boys and girls attending private schools had a 75%
   increased risk (odds ratio, 1.75; confidence interval, 1.22-2.52) of
   being overweight than children attending public schools.
   Conclusions: Adiposity varies by type of school and neighborhood
   socioeconomic status. The biphasic curve in risk for being overweight
   associated with neighborhood socioeconomic status suggests that Mexican
   children living along the U.S. border may be experiencing a nutrition
   transition with respect to an increased risk of obesity and related
   chronic disease.

AB Objective: The potential of social cognition as a mediator of relations
   between neurocognition and functional status in schizophrenia has been
   suggested by correlational studies that link neurocognition to social
   cognition or link social cognition to functional status. The authors
   used structural equation modeling to test more directly whether one
   aspect of social cognition (social perception) mediates relations
   between basic visual perception and functional status in patients with
   schizophrenia.
   Method: Seventy-five outpatients with schizophrenia were administered
   measures of early visual processing (computerized visual masking
   procedures), social perception (Half Profile of Nonverbal Sensitivity),
   and functional status (Role Functioning Scale).
   Results: Structural equation modeling supported social perception as a
   mediator of relations between early visual processing and functional
   status in schizophrenia. The mediation model indicated that early visual
   processing is linked to functional status through social perception,
   thereby supporting a significant indirect relationship. The direct
   relationship between early visual processing and functional status was
   significant in a model that did not include social perception but was
   not significant in the mediation model that included social perception.
   Conclusions: Social cognition appears to be a key determinant of
   functional status in schizophrenia. Using a very basic measure of visual
   perception, the present study found that social perception mediates the
   influence of early visual processing on functional status in
   schizophrenia.

   enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence analysis
   to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network resources to
   buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain knowledge and
   legitimacy. During this period, networked property grew, stabilized, and
   involved a growing proportion of foreign capital. Cohesive networks of
   recombinant property were robust, and in fact integrated foreign
   investment. Although multinationals, through their subsidiaries,
   dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
   that they also built durable networks. These findings suggest that
   developing economies do not necessarily face a forced choice between
   networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.

   African American and European American participants viewed a series of
   pleasant and unpleasant pictures portraying either ingroup or outgroup
   members, while physiological, behavioral, and evaluative judgments were
   measured. Two hypotheses were assessed. The outgroup antipathy
   hypothesis predicts that people will respond to outgroup pictures with
   more negative affect than to ingroup pictures. In contrast, the ingroup
   empathy hypothesis predicts that people will show exaggerated (pleasant
   and unpleasant) affective responses to pictures of ingroup members, due
   to group identification or personal relevance. The data provided no
   support for the antipathy hypothesis, whereas facial EMG, skin
   conductance, rating, and viewing time data lent support to the ingroup
   empathy hypothesis, in which greater pleasure and displeasure were
   apparent when viewing ingroup pictures. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   lacking in new theoretical advances, we disagree with this assessment.
   We assert, rather, that the field of deviance offers unparalleled
   insight into society, particularly in current times. Deviance thrives in
   America, from the underbelly of hidden life worlds to the new frontiers
   of discovery and social change. Although groups resist the label of
   deviance and its consequences, the process of deviance-making has become
   so important that it is understood and practiced across a broad spectrum
   of people. In the following pages we offer some examples of the way
   concepts and theories of deviance have filtered into commonsense
   understanding of the world and how they illuminate the stratification,
   dynamics, and turmoil of America.

AB The paper uses the concept strategic flirting, an aspect of emotional
   labor, to challenge the dichotomous view that sex work is either
   exploitative or empowering for exotic dancers. The findings suggest a
   more nuanced understanding of the advantages of sexual power and
   expenditures of emotional labor. Data were gleaned from interviews with
   112 female dancers in several cities. Data from dancers indicate
   significant support for both the sexual radical/libertarian view-that
   she is the dominant party in the sexual transaction-and the radical
   feminist view that exotic dancing has detrimental consequences. Both the
   feminist and sociology of emotions literatures are explored for
   applications to the dancers' work.

AB America is a multi-cultural society. Yet, there are cultural dimensions
   to the clinician-patient relationship that have not been systematically
   addressed in medical education or in clinical practice. Lack of
   diversity and lack of cross-cultural skills in the medical profession
   may contribute to health disparities in America. Cultural competence for
   the medical profession represents a core set of skills that can be
   learned to respectfully and effectively communicate healthcare
   information with diverse patient populations. The authors blended their
   extensive literature review with the knowledge and experience of a
   culturally diverse medical team to develop the CRASH-Course in Cultural
   Compelency training program for medical professionals. CRASH is a
   mnemonic for the following essential components of Culturally competent
   health careconsider Culture, show Respect, Assess/Affirm differences,
   show Sensitivity and Self-awareness, and do it all with Humility. The
   goal of the CRASH-Course in cultural Competency is to build confidence
   and competence in the clinician's ability to communicate effectively
   with diverse patient populations.

AB Objectives: This study investigated the hypothesis that: adherence to
   colon cancer screening guidelines among Chinese women was associated
   with Eastern cultural views and anxiety about developing colon cancer,
   Design: Cross-sectional data from a community-based longitudinal study
   were used to examine the hypothesis of this study. Measures of
   sociodemographics, medical access factors, cultural views of health
   care, cancer worry, and practices of colon cancer screening were
   administered by a computer assisted telephone interview.
   Participants: Four hundred and thirty-three Chinese-American women from
   Metropolitan Washington, DC age 50 years and older and without a history
   of colon cancer completed the telephone interview.
   Main Outcome Measure: Adherence to utilization of either fecal occult
   blood test (FOBT) within a year, sigmoidoscopy within five years, or
   colonoscopy within 10 years was used to define two outcome categories:
   current screeners and noncurrent screeners.
   Results: Controlling for covariates, this study found that: 1) women
   with more Eastern cultural views were less likely to be current
   screeners; 2) women who thought about the chance of getting colon cancer
   had approximately three-fold greater odds of being current screeners
   than women who never thought about colon cancer; and 3) women receiving
   physician recommendation for colon cancer screening had more than
   three-fold increased odds of being current screeners than those who had
   not received a recommendation.
   Conclusions: in addition to the lack of physician recommendation, older
   Chinese women face cultural and psychological barriers to obtaining
   timely colon cancer screening. These barriers may be reduced through
   culturally sensitive intervention studies.

AB In recent years, bison products have been incorporated into the Food
   Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR). This paper examines
   the factors leading up to this particular development and the structural
   problems that have yet to be resolved within the program. Altogether.
   the findings illustrate that cultural traditions, health problems, and
   economic concerns instigated the federal government to embark upon this
   new policy. Unfortunately, while the program has responded to tribal
   demands in certain respects, it has not resolved underlying structural
   inequalities between tribal and nontribal communities. In particular,
   the FDPIR does not acknowledge the problematic nature of product
   ion-consumption networks within the program. These networks currently
   undermine some of the fundamental reasons for including bison in the
   FDPIR.

AB The relationships between blood lead (PbB) and saliva lead (PbSa)
   concentrations and the determinants of PbB and PbSa status in 970
   low-income adults in the city of Detroit, Michigan were explored.
   Average PbB and PbSa values in the sample population were found to be
   2.7 +/- 0.1 mu g/dl and 2.4 +/- 0.13 mu g/l (equivalent to 0.24 +/- 0.13
   mu g/dl), respectively, and a weak but statistically significant
   association was found between the lead levels in the two types of body
   fluid samples. The average PbB level for men (4.0 +/- 0.56 mu g/dl) was
   higher than that for women (2.7 +/- 0.11 mu g/dl); other significant
   predictors of PbB included age, level of education, being employed,
   income level, the presence of peeling paint on the wall at home and
   smoking. There was no gender- or age-dependent difference in blood
   saliva values but statistically significant correlations were Found
   between PbSa and level of education, employment, income level and
   smoking. Dental caries was severe in this population. Only 0.5% of the
   participants had no clinical signs of caries, over 80% had cavitated
   carious lesions (i.e., lesions that had progressed into dentin), and the
   number of lost teeth and carious lesions averaged 3.4 and 30,
   respectively. Weak but significant associations were found between PbB
   as well its PbSa and measures of dental caries in the study population.
   The positive associations are believed to be a reflection of the fact
   that the risk factors for dental caries, especially in low-income
   populations of the US, overlap extensively with those of lead poisoning
   and may not have a causal significance. (C) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All

AB Intimate partner violence is widespread worldwide. While assumed to
   impact women's ability to use contraceptive methods, few data are
   available to support this claim. In this study, eight focus group
   discussions were conducted to guide questionnaire development and to
   provide contextual information. Participants were women who were
   currently using the pill and women who had used the pill previously. In
   addition, 300 women were interviewed who initiated oral contraceptive
   pill use between December 1995 and April 1996. Participants were
   interviewed 3-6 months later to investigate the role intimate partner
   violence played in covert pill use and pill discontinuation. Special
   study procedures for asking women questions about violence were
   employed. Nineteen per cent of the women interviewed were using the pill
   covertly. The odds of covert pill use were four times higher in El Alto
   and La Paz than in Santa Cruz. Women who used the pill covertly were
   more likely to have experienced method-related partner violence
   (OR=21.27) than women whose partners knew of their pill use. One-third
   of the women had discontinued pill use at the time of the interview. In
   the final multivariate analysis, having experienced side-effects
   (OR=2.37) was a significant predictor of pill discontinuation and
   method-related partner violence was marginally predictive (OR=1.91; 95%
   CI 1.0-3.66). While efforts are ongoing to incorporate men into family
   planning programmes, some male partners oppose, and in some situations
   violently oppose, contraceptive use. The needs of women with these types
   of partners must not be overlooked.

   for illicit drugs and 17.7% for cigarettes) in a national survey. Male
   students and those who were employed were more likely to be current
   users (past 30 days) of drugs in general (15%) and marijuana (13.2%),
   and users of wine coolers (76.0%) and cigarettes (6 1.1%) in their

AB The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and factors
   associated with the illicit use of prescription stimulants and to assess
   the relationship between the medical and illicit use of prescription
   stimulants among undergraduate college students. A Web survey was
   self-administered by a random sample of 9,161 undergraduate students
   attending a large public midwestern university in the spring of 2003. A
   total of 8.1% reported lifetime illicit use of prescription stimulants
   and 5.4% reported past year illicit use. The number of undergraduate
   students who reported illicit use of prescription stimulants exceeded
   the number of students who reported medical use of prescription
   stimulants for ADHD. The leading sources of prescription stimulants for
   illicit use were friends and peers. Multivariate logistic regression
   analyses revealed several risk factors for illicit use of prescription
   stimulants such as being male, White, member of a social fraternity or
   sorority, Jewish religious affiliation, and lower grade point average.
   All of these characteristics were also related to medically prescribed
   use of prescription stimulants. Those who initiated medically prescribed
   use of prescription stimulants for ADHD in elementary school were
   generally not at increased risk for illicit use of prescription
   stimulants or other drugs during college as compared to those who were
   never prescribed stimulant medication. The present study provides
   evidence that the illicit use of prescription stimulants is a problem
   among undergraduate college students, and certain subgroups appear to be
   at heightened risk.

   fewer close friends, a more anxious attachment style in the context of
   romantic relationships, and lower social self-esteem in early adulthood.
   Although recalled-teasing was not associated with number of friends
   later in life, it was related to other interpersonal difficulties.
   Specifically, frequent teasing was associated with less comfort with
   intimacy and closeness, less comfort in trusting and depending on
   others, a greater degree of worry about being unloved or abandoned in
   relationships, and poorer social self-esteem. The relationship of these
   difficulties to specific domains of teasing was also explored.

AB Objective: Little research has examined antecedents of specific drinking
   consequences (vomiting, regretted sex, hangover, blackouts) among
   college students. This research examined how students' experiences of
   past consequences relate to their beliefs of experiencing similar
   consequences in the future and how these beliefs relate to current
   drinking patterns. Method: Self-reported past drinking behavior and
   resulting consequences associated with specific occasions were assessed
   among 303 (66% women) college students. Students also estimated number
   of drinks associated with risk of experiencing future similar
   consequences. Results: Paired-samples t tests indicated that students
   significantly overestimated the number of drinks it would take to vomit,
   have unwanted sexual experiences, experience hangovers, and black out in
   comparison with the actual self-reported number of drinks consumed the
   last time identical consequences were experienced. In addition, a series
   of multiple-regression analyses revealed that greater misperceptions
   between the perceived and actual number of drinks associated with each
   type of consequence were consistently associated with heavier drinking.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that heavier-drinking students do not learn
   from their mistakes but instead overestimate the amount of alcohol they
   can consume without experiencing negative consequences. Clinical
   implications of these findings are discussed in terms of augmenting
   brief interventions aimed at heavy-drinking college students.

AB Objective: This study investigates the relationship between marijuana

   negative experiences or problems from alcohol and drug use. It was
   hypothesized that students would overestimate the marijuana use of
   students in general and that perceptions about the prevalence of

   this study, 5,990 participants provided information on the perceptions
   and consequences of drug use via an online survey or via a paper-based
   surveys Results: Although two thirds of participants reported no
   marijuana use, 98% of respondents incorrectly predicted that students in
   general use marijuana at least once per year. Perceptions of use by
   friends and students in general accounted for variance in drug use and
   related problems or experiences. Conclusions: Given the relationship
   between norm misperception and behavior with marijuana use, future
   research could explore the impact of targeting misperceived norms
   through prevention and intervention efforts.

PY 2006
AB Objective: Negative alcohol-related consequences often occur during
   specific events and in specific contexts (e.g., 21st birthday
   celebrations and tailgating par-ties). A lack of available event- and
   context-specific interventions suggests the need to better understand
   factors associated with heavy drinking in these contexts, with an eye
   toward developing specific interventions. The purpose of this research
   was to lay the foundation for developing personalized normative feedback
   interventions for 21st birthday celebratory drinking and tailgating
   drinking by evaluating whether students overestimate norms in these
   specific contexts, as they do more generally. Method: Perceived
   descriptive norms and alcohol consumption were assessed at event- and
   context-specific levels in two studies. Study 1 included 119 students
   turning 21 years old who reported their 21st birthday drinking behavior
   and estimated the typical number of drinks consumed by students
   celebrating their 21st birthday. Study 2 included 140 undergraduates
   drawn from a stratified random sample who reported their behavior
   regarding drinking and tailgating and their perceived norms for typical
   drinking and tailgating behavior. Results: Results from Study I revealed
   that students overestimated peer drinking during 21st birthday
   celebrations, and this overestimation was associated with heavier
   drinking on one's own 21st birthday. In Study 2, students underestimated
   the percentage of tailgaters who drank but overestimated typical
   consumption. Overestimation was consistently associated with heavier
   drinking during tailgating. Conclusions: Successful correction of
   general normative misperceptions has been shown to reduce drinking in
   other research. Documentation of normative misperceptions for specific
   events and contexts provided by these results represents an important
   step in developing event- and context-specific interventions utilizing
   specific normative feedback.

PD MAR 2006
PY 2006
AB Objective: Previous research has shown that students overestimate the
   drinking of their peers, and that perceived norms are strongly
   associated with drinking behavior. Explanations for these findings have
   been based largely on cross-sectional data, precluding the ability to
   evaluate the stability of normative misperceptions or to disentangle the
   direction of influence between perceived norms and drinking. The present
   research was designed to evaluate (1) the stability of normative
   misperceptions and (2) temporal precedence of perceived norms and
   drinking. Method: Participants were college students (N = 164; 94 women)
   who completed assessments of perceived norms and reported behavior for
   drinking frequency and weekly quantity. Most participants (68%)
   completed the same measures again two months later. Results: Results
   indicated large and stable overestimations of peer drinking for
   frequency and weekly quantity. Results also showed that for weekly
   quantity, perceived norms predicted later drinking, but drinking also
   predicted later perceived norms. Results for frequency revealed
   perceived norms predicted later drinking, but drinking did not predict
   later perceived norms. Conclusions: These findings underscore the
   importance of longitudinal designs in evaluating normative influences on
   drinking. The present findings suggest that normative misperceptions are
   stable, at least over a relatively short time period. Findings support a
   mutual influence model of the relationship between perceived norms and
   drinking quantity but are more strongly associated with conformity
   explanations for the relationship between perceived norms and drinking
   frequency. Results are discussed in terms of implications for prevention
   interventions.

AB Objective: Harmful alcohol consumption is a leading cause of death in
   the United States. The majority of people who die from alcohol use begin
   drinking in their youth. In this study, we estimate the impact of
   interventions to reduce the prevalence of drinking among youth on
   subsequent drinking patterns and alcohol-attributable mortality. Method:
   We first estimated the effect of public health interventions to decrease
   harmful drinking among youth from literature reviews and used life table
   methods to estimate alcohol-attributable years of life lost by age 80
   years among the cohort of approximately 4 million U.S. residents aged 20
   in the year 2000. Then, from national survey data on transitions in
   drinking habits by age, we modeled the impact of interventions on
   alcohol-attributable mortality. Results: A tax increase and an
   advertising ban were the most effective interventions identified. In the
   absence of intervention, there would be 55,259 alcohol-attributable
   deaths over the lifetime of the cohort. A tax-based 17% increase in the
   price of alcohol of $1 per six pack of beer could reduce deaths from
   harmful drinking by 1,490, equivalent to 31,130 discounted years of
   potential life saved or 3.3% of current alcohol-attributable mortality.
   A complete ban on alcohol advertising would reduce deaths from harmful
   drinking by 7,609 and result in a 16.4% decrease in alcohol-related
   life-years lost. A partial advertising ban would result in a 4%
   reduction in alcohol-related life-years lost. Conclusions: Interventions
   to prevent harmful drinking by youth can result in reductions in adult
   mortality. Among interventions shown to be successful in reducing
   youthful drinking prevalence, advertising bans appear to have the
   greatest potential for premature mortality reduction.

EP 323
PD MAR 2006
PY 2006
AB Objective: Traditionally, personal contact with an experienced
   interviewer has been thought to facilitate collection of data on alcohol
   use and victimization experiences. Recent studies indicate that
   Web-based surveys may be an efficient alternative for gathering these
   sensitive data. To date, telephone interviewing and Web-based collection
   of data on alcohol-related negative consequences, particularly
   victimization, have not been compared. This study was designed to
   compare data from an interviewer-administered and Web-based survey on
   alcohol use and alcohol-related negative consequences in a sample of
   college women. Method: Seven hundred women from a second semester
   freshmen college class were randomly selected to participate in either
   the telephone interview or Web-based modes of survey administration.
   Results: Fifty-three percent of invited women (N = 370) completed the
   survey. Completion rates were higher, and estimated dollar costs were
   significantly lower, for the Web-based survey. There were no differences
   in reported rates of alcohol or drug use by survey method; however,
   there were differences in several specific alcohol-related negative
   consequences. Conclusions: These findings suggest that, for college
   women, Web-based surveys versus telephone interviews can be an effective
   and more cost-efficient means for collecting data on alcohol use and
   related negative consequences, particularly victimization. In addition,
   we found some evidence that women may be more forthcoming when

AB Objective: This study demonstrates the differences that exist within
   college drinkers identified as high-risk drinkers. Method: The study
   looked at alcohol and other drug (AOD) use patterns of the entire US.
   college student body, using a cross-section of institutions (public,
   private, 2-year, and 4-year) and students that reflected the enrollment
   patterns within geographic regions of the country. A survey that focused
   on safety and violence on college campuses, in addition to more
   traditional questions regarding the prevalence of alcohol and other drug
   use and negative consequences, was mailed to a stratified random sample.
   The final sample consisted of students from 96 institutions of higher
   education (N = 17,82 1; 45.3% males, 54.7% females) and was weighted to
   ensure an accurate representation of the student population in the
   United States. Results: We found there to be a broad range of
   problematic drinkers grouped together within the category "heavy
   drinking," which is defined by a single episode (five or more drinks on
   one occasion). The seriously problematic drinkers can be differentiated
   from those less problematic by the inclusion of frequency in the
   criteria. Comparing heavy drinkers with "heavy and frequent drinkers,"
   we found rates of negative consequences to be almost three times higher
   for the heavy and frequent drinkers. In addition, the heavy and frequent
   drinkers account for nearly half of all negative consequences reported
   by all drinkers. Conclusions: Greater specificity in classification is a
   necessary component of alcohol research and intervention.

AB Policy and programmatic initiatives of the last decade have focused on
   increased coordination of services and expansion of prompt substance
   abuse treatment for mothers initially involved with child welfare
   services (CWS). Yet, little evidence has been amassed concerning the
   implications of this approach on the recurrent need for CWS. Data are
   from a large national probability sample of children and their
   caregivers involved with CWS following an allegation of maltreatment.
   Data include the recurrence of maltreatment reports for this group of
   children who remain at home. Selected from 1,101 caregivers with an
   indicated substance abuse problem, a group of 224 clients who did not
   receive services were compared with 224 treated clients. Event history
   analyses showed that clients who received substance abuse treatment were
   nearly twice as likely to have another child abuse report within 18
   months. Reasons why participation in substance abuse treatment may
   result in greater involvement with CWS are posited. (c) 2006 Elsevier

AB Little research has been published assessing changes in the functional
   health status of children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease
   (CKD). We know little about which clinical parameters influence
   functional status or health-related quality of life in these young
   people. In a prospective study using data from semi-annual visits over a
   4-year period from 78 adolescents with CKD aged 11 years to 18 years, we
   detail the impact of several clinical measures (i.e., kidney function,
   albumin, hematocrit, height) on short-term changes in health-related
   quality of life. The 50-item Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form, a
   validated health-related quality of life measure in children, was used
   to obtain physical and psychosocial functioning summary scores at each
   visit. After adjustment for the variables mentioned above, the physical
   summary score on the Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ) declined as
   glomerular filtration rate declined. Increasing height was associated
   with a positive change in physical and psychosocial summary scores. We
   conclude that decline in kidney function is associated with a subsequent
   decline in health-related quality of life, particularly in terms of
   physical activity.

AB OBJECTIVE. Significant racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities
   have been observed in the rates of perforated appendicitis among
   children, by using large administrative databases. This study evaluated
   whether these factors had an impact on the care of patients with
   appendicitis at a major children's hospital with a well-established,
   comprehensive, primary referral system.
   METHODS. A retrospective analysis was performed for all children between
   the ages of 2 and 20 years who were treated for appendicitis between
   January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2003. Demographic variables included
   patient age, gender, race, insurance status, parental educational
   status, and income level. Coding data were used to identify patients
   with perforated appendicitis. The use of radiologic imaging was also
   analyzed.
   RESULTS. During the 3-year period, 788 patients were treated for
   appendicitis. The racial distribution (white: 81%; black: 12%; other:
   7%) was consistent with the demographic composition of the local
   population. The overall perforation rate was 25%, and the rate was
   significantly greater in the age group of < 6 years, compared with older
   children. However, there were no significant differences in the
   perforation rate with respect to race, insurance status, educational
   level, or income status. Rates of radiologic imaging use were similar
   among all racial and socioeconomic groups.
   CONCLUSIONS. Although racial and socioeconomic disparities in the rates
   of perforated appendicitis among children have been reported, we found
   no significant evidence for such inequality at our institution. This may
   reflect improved access, early diagnosis, and referral by primary care
   physicians in the community. Pooled national and multiple-state
   administrative databases have been used to highlight persistent
   disparities in health care. This study illustrates how
   single-institution data sources can be used to test a local hypothesis
   generated by national data, with surprisingly different results.

AB OBJECTIVES. Channel One is a public-affairs program that includes 10
   minutes of news and 2 minutes of paid product advertising or public
   service announcements. Advocates assert that it increases public-affairs
   knowledge, but critics charge that it garners a captive audience for
   teen-targeted advertising. This experiment analyzed the differential
   effects of Channel One depending on whether early-adolescent viewers
   received a media-literacy lesson in conjunction with viewing the
   program. Outcomes included perceptions of Channel One news programming,
   recall of program content and advertising, materialism, and political
   efficacy.
   METHODS. Researchers used a posttest-only field experiment (N = 240) of
   seventh-and eighth-grade students using random assignment to conditions.
   Conditions included a control group, a group that received a fact-based
   lesson, and a group that received the same lesson content using a more
   emotive teaching style. It was expected that the emotion-added lesson
   condition would be more effective than the logic-only lesson condition
   because of its motivational component.
   RESULTS. On average, students remembered more ads from Channel One than
   news stories. Participants in the control group remembered fewer news
   stories than did the groups that received the lessons. Students reported
   having purchased during the preceding 3 months an average of 2.5 items
   advertised on the program. Both fact-based and affect-added training
   increased student skepticism toward advertisers. As expected, student
   liking of the program enhanced their learning from it and was associated
   with higher levels of political efficacy. Students held misconceptions
   about the role of their school in the production of Channel One.
   CONCLUSIONS. The use of Channel One by schools can have benefits, but
   these come with risk that some may consider unacceptable. On the
   positive side, student liking of the program was associated with their
   political efficacy. Although those who responded positively to program
   content and presentation style learned more from it, they also tended to
   want things that they saw in the advertisements. The data therefore show
   that the program can provide some benefits to young adolescents, but the
   results also provide justification for concerns about the
   commercialization of the classroom.

AB It is surprising that social demography has so little to say on the
   emotional underpinnings of demographic behavior. The central proposition
   of this essay is that emotions are particularly important for
   understanding the problems of reproductive health. This understanding
   allows one to consider the usual determinants of personal autonomy, or
   access to knowledge or services, but also to take into account the fact
   that much sexual and reproductive behavior is motivated by emotional
   states that can suppress prior knowledge, services, or agency. The essay
   draws upon the emerging theoretical literature on emotions in the
   disciplines of sociology and anthropology to explore the role of
   emotions in behavior and outcomes related to reproductive health. It
   looks especially at the cultural meaning, the ideal, and the experienced
   reality of the emotion of "love." All these aspects of what is a
   positive emotion have important positive as well as negative
   implications for the diagnosis and treatment of reproductive tract
   problems and for unsafe sexual activity.

AB Rather than seeking ivory-tower isolation, members of the Rural
   Sociological Society have always been distinguished by a willingness to
   work with specialists from a broad range of disciplines, and to work on
   some of the world's most challenging problems. What is less commonly
   recognized is that the willingness to reach beyond disciplinary
   boundaries can contribute not just to the solution of real-world
   problems, but also to the advancement of the discipline itself. This
   point is increasingly being illustrated in studies of
   environment-society relationships. Most past discussions of humans'
   roles in environmental problems have focused on overall or average human
   impacts, but rural sociologists have played leading roles in identifying
   what I have come to call "the double diversion." First, rather than
   being well-represented by averages, environmental damages are often
   characterized by high levels of disproportionality, with much or most of
   the harm being created by the diversion of environmental rights and
   resources to a surprisingly small fraction of the relevant social
   actors. The disproportionality appears to be made possible in part
   through the second diversion, namely distraction the diversion of
   attention, largely through the taken-for-granted but generally erroneous
   assumption that the environmental harm "must" be for the benefit Of us
   all. There are good reasons why rural sociologists would have been among
   the first to notice both of these "diversions"-and why they will give
   even greater attention to both in the future.

AB Objective: To test the effect of living in group housing rather than
   independent apartments on executive functioning, verbal memory and
   sustained attention among formerly homeless persons with serious mental
   illness and to determine whether substance abuse modifies this effect.
   Method: In metropolitan Boston, 112 persons in Department of Mental
   Health shelters were randomly assigned to group homes ("Evolving
   Consumer Households", with project facilitator, group meetings, resident
   decision-making) or independent apartments. All were case managed. A
   neuropsychological test battery was administered at baseline, at 18
   months (Time 2), with an 81% follow-up rate, and at 48 months (Time 3),
   with a 59% follow-up rate. Hierarchical Linear Modeling was applied to
   executive functioning-assessed with the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test
   (Perseverations)-Logical Memory story recall, and an auditory Continuous
   Performance Test (CPT) for sustained attention. Subject characteristics
   were controlled.
   Results: When moved to group homes, subjects without a lifetime
   substance abuse history improved on Perseverations, while those who
   moved to independent apartments deteriorated on Perseverations. Across
   the two housing conditions, subjects showed no change in Perseverations,
   but improved oil Logical Memory story recall and the CPT.
   Conclusions: Type of housing placement can influence cognitive
   functioning; notably, socially isolating housing is associated with
   weakened executive functioning. Substance abuse significantly diminishes
   environmental effects. These are important factors to consider in
   housing placement and subsequent treatment. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

   comparing couple responses to survey items on the wife's autonomy in
   various domains using data from 23 communities in India, Pakistan,

   show that the level of women's autonomy depends on whether wives or
   husbands are respondents and that the response categories do not have
   the same cognitive or semantic meanings to men and women. The
   disagreement between men and women varies across communities for reasons

AB Background The epidemic of tobacco use is shifting from developed to
   developing countries, including India, where increased use is expected
   to result in a large disease burden in the future. Changes in prevalence
   of tobacco use in adolescents are important to monitor, since increased
   use by young people might be a precursor to increased rates in the
   population.
   Methods 11642 students in the sixth and eighth grades in 32 schools in
   Delhi and Chennai, India, were surveyed about their tobacco use and
   psychosocial factors related to onset of tobacco use. Schools were
   representative of the range of types of school in these cities.
   Results Students who were in government schools, male, older, and in
   sixth grade were more likely to use tobacco than students who were in
   private schools, female, younger, and in eighth grade. Students in sixth
   grade were, overall, two to four times more likely to use tobacco than
   those in eighth grade. 24.8% (1529 of 6165) of sixth-grade students and
   9.3% (509 of 5477) of eighth-grade students had ever used tobacco; 6.7%
   (413 of 6165) and 2.9% (159 of 5477), respectively, were current users.
   Psychosocial risk factors were greater in sixth-grade than in
   eighth-grade students. The increase in tobacco use by age within each
   grade was larger in sixth grade than in eighth grade in government
   schools, with older sixth-grade students at especially high risk.
   Discussion The finding that sixth-grade students use significantly more
   tobacco than eighth-grade students is unusual, and might indicate a new
   wave of increased tobacco use in urban India that warrants confirmation
   and early intervention.

AB We employ a latent class choice model to evaluate the effects of
   alternative ecological characterizations of wetland functions and
   services on individual preferences, and to determine whether
   socioeconomic factors and psychometric measures of environmental
   attitudes can explain differences in individual's preferences and values
   for wetland restoration. This analysis combines a multiattribute choice
   model with information on individual's characteristics to evaluate
   preferences for restoration of the Greater Everglades ecosystem, one of
   the largest and most comprehensive wetland ecosystem restoration
   projects. To identify potential endpoints for Everglades restoration,
   two alternative ecological characterizations of the ecosystem were
   developed using the familiar distinction between function and structure.
   Survey data from a representative sample of the general population were
   used in a split-sample design based on the ecological characterization
   treatment. Within each subsample, the latent class analysis identified
   three groups who varied in their preferences for ecosystem restoration
   and socioeconomic profiles. The ecological characterizations had a
   significant influence on respondents' preferences and willingness to pay
   (WTP). The subsample responding to the structural characterization had a
   significantly larger share of respondents in the group who favored
   proposed restoration plans than the functional attribute subsample. In
   both subsamples, the group who favored restoration had a higher WTP for
   restoration than other groups. The latent class analysis also revealed
   socioeconomic and attitudinal factors that explain some of the
   heterogeneity in preferences and WTP within each subsample; this
   heterogeneity would not be identified with a standard choice model. In
   the context of Everglades restoration, the results provide a baseline
   assessment of public support and WTP that suggests an emphasis on
   structural rather than functional restoration endpoints. The approach
   described in this article can be used in other policy studies of wetland
   ecosystems because multiple ecosystem services can be represented within
   a stated choice survey and differences in preferences and values for
   these services can be measured. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   participatory approaches have been used to engage local people in
   protected area management and conservation action. While participatory
   approaches provide local people a role in telling their own story and
   enable them to contribute to conservation and development processes, it
   is unclear how much consideration local people's opinions receive within
   the framework of a participatory process that exists to meet the

   evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of the participatory approach

   interviewing and other community-level reflection techniques to assess
   the complex interrelationships among population growth, migration,
   tenure regimes, and land-use practices in rural communities bordering
   the reserve. The program also sought to build local capacity and support
   for land-use planning and conservation programs. While the paper
   acknowledges the critical benefits of local participation it also
   questions the compatibility of this approach with conservation programs
   administered by conservation organizations as they are currently
   structured. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A growing body of evidence, almost entirely from North America, has
   found that male testosterone levels are positively associated with
   mating effort (male-male competition and mate-seeking behaviour), while
   lower testosterone levels have been associated with affiliative pair
   bonding and paternal care. To expand the cross-cultural scope of this
   research, here we investigate variation in salivary testosterone levels
   among Chinese men in relation to marital and parenting variables. One
   hundred and twenty-six men drawn from a Beijing university setting
   between the ages of 21 and 38 completed a questionnaire and provided
   both morning and late afternoon saliva samples from which testosterone
   levels were measured. The 66 unmarried men had slightly higher levels of
   testosterone than the 30 married non-fathers, but this difference was
   not statistically significant. However, the 30 fathers exhibited
   significantly lower testosterone levels than both unmarried men and
   married non-fathers. Among married non-fathers, marital relationship
   quality was not significantly related to testosterone levels. Among
   married fathers, men with children aged less than 4 years of age did not
   have lower testosterone levels than men with older children. These data
   are the first outside of North America to show lower testosterone levels
   among fathers, and lend support to the theoretical view that male
   testosterone levels differ according to mating and parenting effort.

AB BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We wished to study the prevalence as well as the
   sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life (QoL) of African
   American patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia (UD) among the
   population at large and compare it to the Caucasians.
   METHODS: A total of 990 adults from nine different sites in the Jackson,
   Mississippi metropolitan area (670 African Americans and 320
   Caucasians), completed self-administered questionnaires providing
   sociodemographic information, and details regarding bowel habits and
   associated symptoms for diagnosing the presence or absence of UD based
   on ROME II criteria. QoL was assessed by the SF-12 questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Of the 990 participants 247 had UD, giving a total sample
   prevalence of 24.9% (African Americans = 24.3%, Caucasians = 26.2%).
   Adjusting for other risk factors in a reduced logistic regression model,
   we found female sex (OR 1.8; CI 1.2-2.6; p < 0.01), lower education (p <
   0.01), and larger size of household (p= 0.01) to be important correlates
   of UD prevalence whereas the lower household income showed a trend
   toward statistical significance (p= 0.057). Using the adjusted odds
   ratio as an estimate of relative risk, Caucasians were 1.5 (95% CI =
   11.1-2.1; p= 0.017) more likely than African Americans to have UD. In
   terms of an index for QoL on SF-12 (possible score = 1-44, with 44 being
   ideal), the adjusted mean score was significantly lower for adults with
   UD compared to non-UD adults (30.4 vs 35.0; p < 0.01). However, there
   was no difference in impairment of life in Caucasians versus African
   Americans (32.9 vs 32.5; p= 0.36).
   CONCLUSIONS: UD occurs less frequently among African Americans. While UD
   affects QoL among both Caucasians and African Americans, the degree of
   impairment is similar.

AB Background: Racial disparities exist, in prostate cancer incidence. All
   important contributor to these disparities may be socioeconomic status.
   Methods: Virginia Cancer Registry data, 1990-1999 (37,373 cases) were
   geocoded to the Census tract and county level. The annualized,
   age-adjusted incidence rates for African Americans and whites were
   caclulated, and crude and smoothed maps of these rates were produced.
   Statistical tests for clustering of cases were conducted. Prostate
   cancer incidence was statistically modeled its a function of arca-based
   measures of poverty, median household income, education, rural status,
   ratio of physicians to population in each county percentage of men in
   each county Obtaining prostate cancer Screening with the
   prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, and percent of households headed
   by Females.
   Results: Prostate cancer incidence was elevated in the eastern and
   central portions of the state. Statistical tests for clustering were
   highly significant (Tango's test, p < 0.008; spatial scan statistic, p <
   0.001). Poverty and lower education were associated with a decreased
   incidence among whites but not African Americans. Median household
   income and Urban status were positively associated with incidence for
   both populations. Among whites, increased percent of female heads of
   households and ratio of physicians per population were associated with
   increased incidence. Associations between predictor variables and
   prostate cancer incidence were seen only in the census tract level
   analyses.
   Conclusions: Overall, the findings support the argument that area
   measures of poverty and education do not explain the increased incidence
   of prostate cancer among African Americans. Other factors, such as
   dietary, practices, may help explain racial disparities in prostate
   cancer incidence. Because of the large differences between tract. and
   county level results, the time and expense of obtaining data geocoded to
   the tract level seems worthwhile.

AB Objectives. We investigated associations between local food environment
   and neighborhood racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition.
   Methods. Poisson regression was used to examine the association of food
   stores and liquor stores with racial/ethnic composition and income in
   selected census tracts in North Carolina, Maryland, and New York.
   Results. Predominantly minority and racially mixed neighborhoods had
   more than twice as many grocery stores as predominantly White
   neighborhoods (for predominantly Black tracts, adjusted stores per
   population ratio [SR] =2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] =2.2, 3.2; and
   for mixed tracts, SR =2.2; 95% CI = 1.9, 2.7) and half as many
   supermarkets (for predominantly Black tracts, SR=0.5; 95% CI=0.3, 0.7;
   and for mixed tracts, SR=0.7; 95% CI=0.5, 1.0, respectively). Low-income
   neighborhoods had 4 times as many grocery stores as the wealthiest
   neighborhoods (SR=4.3; 95% CI=3.6, 5.2) and half as many supermarkets
   (SR=0.5; 95% CI=0.3, 0.8). In general, poorer areas and non-White areas
   also tended to have fewer fruit and vegetable markets, bakeries,
   specialty stores, and natural food stores. Liquor stores were more
   common in poorer than in richer areas (SR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.6).
   Conclusions. Local food environments vary substantially by neighborhood
   racial/ethnic and socioeconomic composition and may contribute to
   disparities in health.

AB Objectives. We used data from the Dental Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities study to examine whether individual- and neighborhood-level
   socioeconomic characteristics were associated with periodontal disease.
   Methods. We assessed severe periodontitis with a combination of clinical
   attachment loss and pocket depth measures. Marginal logistic regression
   modeling was used to estimate the association between individual and
   neighborhood socioeconomic indicators and prevalence of severe
   periodontitis before and after control for selected covariates. Residual
   intraneighborhood correlations in outcomes were taken into account in
   the analyses.
   Results. Individual-level income and education were associated with
   severe periodontitis among Whites and African Americans, and these
   associations remained significant after adjustment for age, gender,
   recruitment center, and neighborhood socioeconomic score. Low-income
   Whites residing in disadvantaged neighborhoods had 1.8-fold (95%
   confidence interval= 1.2, 2.7) higher odds of having severe
   periodontitis than high-income Whites residing in advantaged
   neighborhoods.
   Conclusions. Individual income and education were associated with severe
   periodontitis independently of neighborhood socioeconomic circumstances.
   Although the association between neighborhood socioeconomic status and
   severe periodontitis was not statistically significant, poverty and
   residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood were associated with higher
   odds of severe periodontitis among Whites.

AB Objectives. We determined differences in Medicaid service use and health
   care costs in a rural Indian Health Service (IHS) user population of
   American Indians and Alaska Natives as compared with Whites.
   Methods. California Medicaid eligibility and claims files were linked to
   IHS user files to obtain a sample of Medicaid-eligible American
   Indian/Alaska Native users (n=7910). A random sample of Whites was
   matched for age, gender, aid category, length of eligibility, and county
   of residence (n=15075). We used generalized linear models to compare
   risk-adjusted use of resources-ambulatory visits, prescriptions,
   emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and costs-both adjusting and
   stratifying for dominant source of ambulatory visits.
   Results. American Indians/Alaska Natives had significantly lower use of
   Medicaid-paid ambulatory visits, prescriptions, emergency room visits,
   and hospitalizations and lower associated costs than Whites.
   Medicaid-paid total costs and use of services were lower for those who
   predominantly used Indian health program clinics, as well as for those
   who predominantly used other sources of ambulatory care.
   Conclusions. Barriers to receiving Medicaid services and payments exist
   for American Indians/Alaska Natives in the rural IHS-user population. If
   American Indians/Alaska Natives are to have Medicaid resources
   comparable to those of Whites, these barriers must be reduced.

AB PURPOSE: This study tests whether social integration is associated with
   C-reactive protein (CRP) level, a biologic risk factor for
   cardiovascular disease.
   METHODS: Using data from 14,818 participants aged >= 20 years from the
   Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 to 1994),
   we created a social network index using marital status; number of
   contacts with family, friends, and neighbors; frequency of religious
   service attendance; and participation in voluntary organizations. Serum
   CRP concentration was measured by means of latex-enhanced nephelometry,
   a low-sensitivity assay, and dichotomized into 3 mg/L or less and
   greater than 3 mg/L.
   RESULTS: After adjustment for multiple potential confounders, men aged
   >= 60 years with the fewest ties were more likely to have an elevated
   CRP concentration than men with the most ties (odds ratio = 1.80; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.11-2.92). This occurred in a dose-response
   manner, with each decrease in number of ties associated with an increase
   in the proportion of men with elevated CRP levels. The association
   between social networks and CRP level after multivariate adjustment was
   not significant in women or younger men.
   CONCLUSION: In this nationally representative cohort, CRP level was
   associated with social integration in older men, but not women or
   younger men. There may be sex- and age-related differences in biologic
   processes influenced by social integration,

   scripts, cultural discourse on the biological basis of male sexual
   arousal, and a discourse of therapeutic individualism to narratively
   defetishize autoerotic crossdressing, queer straight sex, refashion

AB The extensive literature on environmental justice has, by now, well
   defined the essential ingredients of cumulative risk, namely,
   incompatible land uses and vulnerability. Most problematic is the case
   when risk is produced by a large aggregation of small sources of air
   toxics. In this article, we test these notions in an area of Southern
   California, Southeast Los Angeles (SELA), which has come to be known as
   Asthmatown. Developing a rapid risk mapping protocol, we scan the
   neighborhood for small potential sources of air toxics and find,
   literally, hundreds of small point sources within a 2-mile radius,
   interspersed with residences. We also map the estimated cancer risks and
   noncancer hazard indices across the landscape. We find that, indeed,
   such large aggregations of even small, nondominant sources of air toxics
   can produce markedly elevated levels of risk. In this study, the risk
   profiles show additional cancer risks of up to 800 in a million and
   noncancer hazard indices of up to 200 in SELA due to the agglomeration
   of small point sources. This is significant (for example, estimates of
   the average regional point-source-related cancer risk range from 125 to
   200 in a million). Most importantly, if we were to talk about the risk
   contour as if they were geological structures, we would observe not only
   a handful of distinct peaks, but a general "mountain range" running all
   throughout the study area, which underscores the ubiquity of risk in
   SELA. Just as cumulative risk has deeply embedded itself into the fabric
   of the place, so, too, must intervention seek to embed strategies into
   the institutions and practices of SELA. This has implications for
   advocacy, as seen in a recently initiated participatory action research
   project aimed at building health research capacities into the community
   in keeping with an ethic of care.

   demonstrates convincingly that fertility contains genetic variance; that
   is, differences between humans in their genetic make-up affects their
   fertility outcomes and fertility-related behaviours. This finding is
   robust using both heritabilities and coefficients of genetic variation,
   and using both direct measures of fertility outcomes and also fertility
   precursors like fecundity, marriage, fertility expectations and attempts
   to get pregnant (proception). Moreover, genetic variance can change over
   short periods of time or across educational levels, specifically for
   females, and the relevance of genetic variance seems to increase during
   times of increasing reproductive choice.

   and nonalcoholic couples (N = 132). Four alcoholic groups (husband
   alcoholic with antisocial personality disorder or not, paired with
   alcoholic or nonalcoholic wives) were compared with each other and with
   a both-spouses-nonalcoholic group. Consistent with the alcoholic
   subtypes hypothesis, couples with an antisocial alcoholic husband had
   higher levels of hostile behavior regardless of wives' alcoholism
   status. In contrast. rates of positive behaviors and the ratio of
   positive to negative behaviors were greatest among couples in which
   either both or neither of the spouses had alcoholic diagnoses and were
   lowest among alcoholic husbands with nonalcoholic wives. Discussion
   focuses on possible mechanisms linking antisocial alcoholism and
   discrepant alcoholic diagnoses to poorer marital outcomes.

AB A sociocultural stress, appraisal, and coping model was developed to
   understand relatives' burden of care and negative affective attitudes
   toward patients with schizophrenia. Ninety-two African American and 79
   White patients and a significant other (80% mothers) completed 2 10-min
   family problem-solving discussions. In addition, the Kreisman Rejection
   Scale and a global self-report rating of family burden were administered
   to relatives, and a self-report rating of substance use was administered
   to patients. Results indicated that subjective burden of care and
   patients' odd and unusual thinking during the family discussion each
   independently predicted relatives' attitudes toward patients, suggesting
   that negative attitudes are based in part on both patients' symptoms and
   perceived burden of care. African American relatives' perceived burden
   was also predicted by patients' substance abuse. Finally, White family
   members were significantly more likely than African Americans to feel
   burdened by and have rejecting attitudes toward their schizophrenic
   relative suggesting that cultural factors play an important role in
   determining both perceived burden and relatives' attitudes toward
   patients.

AB Despite the many benefits of preventive services, they are often
   underutilized. Social factors, such as religion, can figure prominently
   in these discrepancies by either creating barriers or facilitating use.
   Using data from the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS, 1992-1996), the
   current study examines the relationship between religious attendance,
   religious salience, and denomination and three types of female
   preventive services in a sample of middle-age women (N=4253). Findings
   indicate that women who attend religious services more frequently use
   more mammograms, Pap smears, and self-breast exams. In addition, women
   belonging to Mainline Protestant or Jewish denominations use certain
   preventive services more than Evangelical Protestants. Finally, women
   with higher levels of religious salience are more likely to conduct
   self-breast exams. These findings add important information to the
   public health literature concerning factors that influence preventive
   service use. They also add to the growing field of religion and health
   research where preventive health care use is emerging as a possible
   mechanism linking religion to a wide variety of physical health
   outcomes.

   How are these claims assessed? Organizations judge competence and
   effectiveness using metrics, which can be massaged. Using a case study
   of operational meteorology, the author examines the organizational and
   self-presentational politics whereby meteorologists verify their
   predictions. Forecasts of future events are central to occupational work
   in operational meteorology. However, assessing what really happened "on
   the ground" is not unprobleniatic. So, meteorologists and their
   employers construct measures for assessments, even though these
   assessments are social and organizational routines. Verification
   statistics are signals whereby local offices are judged on
   effectiveness, and as a result. workers develop strategies to increase
   their verification scores. The author examines the production of
   verification at three local offices of the National Weather Set-vice
   using ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews. Similar
   strategies operate when workers are judged in accountability systems,
   leading to forms of organizational impression management to demonstrate
   competence.

   combines data gathered from a set of twenty-six intensive interviews and

   psychoanalytic theory, to explore the different ways white men visually
   interpret race and gender within particular social contexts. From the
   data, I offer a theoretical model called "the matrix of vision" that
   addresses how the visual field is constructed within discursive,
   structural, interactive, and geographic contexts. This article
   highlights how the field of vision is especially susceptible to making
   white men feel racialized and/or gendered. It contributes to more recent
   research on whiteness that presents the constructed character of white
   identity formation. It also adds to visual sociology literature by
   highlighting photographic work done by the respondents themselves and
   how Visual sociology can contribute to nonvisual data.

AB BACKGROUND: Prior studies found higher hospitalization rates among
   patients with low literacy, but did not determine the preventability of
   these admissions or consider other determinants of hospitalization, such
   as social support. This study evaluated whether low literacy was a
   predictor for preventability of hospitalization when considered in the
   context of social support, sociodemographics, health status, and risk
   behaviors.
   METHODS: A convenience sample of 400 patients, admitted to general
   medicine wards in a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital
   between August 1, 2001 and April 1, 2003, completed a face-to-face
   interview to assess literacy, sociodemographics, social support, health
   status, and risk behaviors. Two Board-certified Internists independently
   assessed preventability of hospitalization and determined the primary
   preventable cause through blinded medical chart reviews.
   RESULTS: Neither low literacy (< seventh grade) nor very low literacy (<
   fourth grade) was significantly associated with preventability of
   hospitalization. In multivariable analysis, significant predictors of
   having a preventable cause of hospitalization included binge alcohol
   drinking (P <=.001), lower social support for medical care (P<.04), <= 3
   annual clinic visits (P<.005), and >= 12 people talked to weekly
   (P<.023). Among nonbinge drinkers with lower social support for medical
   care, larger social networks were predictive of preventability of
   hospitalization. Among nonbinge drinkers with higher support for medical
   care, lower outpatient utilization was predictive of the preventability
   of hospitalization.
   CONCLUSIONS: While low literacy was not predictive of admission
   preventability, the formal assessment of alcohol binge drinking, social
   support for medical care, social network size, and prior outpatient
   utilization may enhance our ability to predict the preventability of
   hospitalizations and develop targeted interventions.

   parental involvement with adolescents. Adolescent reports (N = 17,330)
   of shared activities, shared communication, and relationship quality
   with both biological parents are utilized. A multidimensional scaling
   analysis reveals that parent gender explains most of the variance in
   parent-adolescent involvement, with residential status playing a
   secondary yet a fundamental role in accounting for these patterns.
   Resident mothers who do not live with adolescents' biological fathers
   engage in the broadest range of activities with their children.
   Unpartnered resident fathers display patterns of parenting that are as

   Study design We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all 38,793
   1-year-old Medicaid-enrolled infants born in Washington state between
   January 1, 1999 and September 30, 2000. The main exposure was
   self-reported primary language of parents. Using multivariate
   regression, we estimated the relative risk of receiving appropriate and
   timely receipt of preventive care visits in the first year as
   recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics and Washington state
   Medicaid.
   Results Fewer than 1 in 6 (15.4%) infants received all 6 recommended
   preventive care visits in their first year of life. Infants of parents
   whose primary language was not English were half as likely to receive
   all recommended preventive care visits Compared with infants of parents
   whose primary language was English (adjusted relative risk = 0.53; 95%
   confidence interval = 0.49 to 0.58). This disparity was seen in white,
   Hispanic, and African-American infants, but not in Asian-American
   infants.
   Conclusions Disparities based on primary language exist in receipt of

   life activities were collected between 1992 and 1996 and used along with
   employer ratings and high school records at the young adult follow-up
   (mean = 20 years, range 19-25) for this large sample of hyperactive (H;
   n = 149) and community control (CC; n = 72) children initially seen in
   1978-1980 and studied for at least 13 years. Age, duration of follow-up,
   and IQ were statistically controlled as needed. Results: The H group had
   significantly lower educational performance and attainment, with 32%
   failing to complete high school. H group members had been fired from
   more jobs and manifested greater employer-rated
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional defiant
   disorder symptoms and lower job performance than the CC group. Socially,
   the H group had fewer close friends, more trouble keeping friends, and
   more social problems as rated by parents. Far more H than CC group
   members had become parents (38% versus 4%) and had been treated for
   sexually transmitted disease (16% versus 4%). Severity of lifetime
   conduct disorder was predictive of several of the most salient outcomes
   (failure to graduate, earlier sexual intercourse, early parenthood)
   whereas attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and oppositional
   defiant disorder at work were predictive of job performance and risk of
   being fired. Conclusions: These findings corroborate prior research and
   go further in identifying sexual activity and early parenthood as
   additional problematic domains of adaptive functioning at adulthood.

AB Introduction: A recent study has shown that the national-scale
   difference in immunization coverage between nonHispanic white
   (abbreviated "white") and non-Hispanic African-American (abbreviated
   "African-American") children aged 19-35.months in the United States has
   increased by about 1 percentage point annually. We examined how this
   widening gap differs with geography and income.
   Methods: We used data from the National Immunization Survey, 1998-2003,
   a national telephone survey. We examined differences between white and
   African-American children in immunization coverage within income groups
   (at or above versus below the federal poverty level) for each census
   region (northeast, south, midwest and west). We tested the hypothesis of
   constant disparity over time..
   Results: Among households at or above the federal poverty level in the
   northeast census region, disparity is widening (white coverage minus
   African-American coverage was -0.5 in 1998 but 15.5 in 2003). Among
   household at or above the federal poverty level in the midwest census
   region, disparity is narrowing (white coverage minus African-American
   coverage was 13.9 in 1998 but 2.5 in 2003). We found no significant
   evidence of a trend in other groups.
   Conclusions: Widening national-level disparity in immunization coverage
   is primarily attributable to trends in the northeast census region.
   Addressing the widening disparity in coverage requires new strategies
   that consider current social and economic contexts.

AB Background: Minorities and those living in the inner city have a higher
   respiratory disease burden than other groups. Yet, influenza vaccination
   rates among all children with chronic medical conditions remain low.
   Methods: Parents of 2-13-year-old children with high-risk medical
   conditions from health centers in low-income urban neighborhoods
   completed a mailed survey. Immunization status from medical records was
   used to calculate validity measures. Survey data ore presented for those
   whose vaccination status was concordant between parental report and the
   medical record (n=183).
   Results: Parent-reported influenza vaccination versus medical record
   review showed 84.9% sensitivity, 68.7% specificity, 49.1% positive
   predictive value and 92.7% negative predictive value, with a kappa of
   0.43. Vaccination rate was 30.6%. Medical record-verified influenza
   vaccination was associated with parental beliefs that the doctor
   recommends a flu shot (OR, 40.9; 95% Cl, 9.0-184.9) and that relatives
   recommend a flu shot (OR, 4.3; 95% Cl, 1.7-10.5), and was less likely if
   the parent believed that the child will get the flu if a household
   member is infected (OR, 0.2; 95% Cl, 0.1-0.6).
   Conclusions: The message that influenza vaccination is important to
   protect children with chronic medical conditions may be relayed through
   physician recommendation or a relative's suggestion and may be more
   effective if it addresses vaccine efficacy issues.

   investigation involving federal, state and local organizations.
   Methods: A descriptive analysis of cases and violent deaths (homicide,
   suicide or firearm-related) among juveniles < 17 years was conducted,
   along with a case-control study using records from the medical examiner,
   police, schools and social service agencies.
   Results: Twenty-nine cases were identified. Median age was 10 years
   (range 1 day-16 years), and 15 (52%) were male. There were 25 homicides,
   two suicides and two unintentional firearm-related deaths. Nine (31%)
   homicides resulted from child abuse and neglect, and eight (28%) were
   among bystanders. The most common mechanism of fatal injury was firearm
   (63%). Victims' families were more likely to have a history of familial

AB Objectives: We examined the associations of residential segregation with
   poor birth outcomes (low birthweight, preterm) and with perinatal risk
   markers (maternal age, education and marital status, prenatal care and
   substance use, presence of paternal information on birth certificate)
   for foreign- and native-born black women in the Minnesota seven-county
   metropolitan area.
   Methods: Data were from 1990-1999 Minnesota birth certificates linked to
   the 1990 U.S. census. We used multivariable logistic regression to
   examine the association of perinatal risk markers, low birthweight and
   preterm birth for foreign- and native-born black women by residential
   black concentration.
   Results: Native-born black women had a higher prevalence of risk markers
   and were at almost 1.5 times the risk of foreign-born blacks for
   delivery of low-birthweight or preterm infants. Risk markers and poor
   birth outcomes were most prevalent in medium and
   high-black-concentration areas than low-concentration areas. Preterm
   birth was slightly positively associated with residential black
   concentration.
   Conclusions: Native-born black women were at higher risk than
   foreign-born women for delivery of preterm and low-birthweight infants.
   Residential black concentration was associated with risk markers and
   only slightly associated with preterm birth. Further study of why birth
   outcome differentials exist by nativity and residential black
   concentration may identify opportunities for community-based public
   health interventions.

AB CONTEXT. Environmental factors are suggested to play a major role in
   physical activity (PA) and other obesity-related behaviors, yet there is
   no national research on the relationship between disparity in access to
   recreational facilities and additional impact on PA and overweight
   patterns in US adolescents.
   OBJECTIVE. In a nationally representative cohort, we sought to assess
   the geographic and social distribution of PA facilities and how
   disparity in access might underlie population-level PA and overweight
   patterns.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS. Residential locations of US
   adolescents in wave I ( 1994 1995) of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health (N = 20 745) were geocoded, and a 8.05-km buffer
   around each residence was drawn (N = 42 857 census-block groups [19% of
   US block groups]). PA facilities, measured by national databases and
   satellite data, were linked with Geographic Information Systems
   technology to each respondent. Logistic-regression analyses tested the
   relationship of PA-related facilities with block-group socioeconomic
   status (SES) ( at the community level) and the subsequent association of
   facilities with overweight and PA ( at the individual level),
   controlling for population density.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Outcome measures were overweight (BMI >= 95th
   percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National
   Center for Health Statistics growth curves) and achievement of >= 5
   bouts per week of moderate-vigorous PA.
   RESULTS. Higher-SES block groups had a significantly greater relative
   odds of having 1 or more facilities. Low-SES and high-minority block
   groups were less likely to have facilities. Relative to zero facilities
   per block group, an increasing number of facilities was associated with
   decreased overweight and increased relative odds of achieving >= 5 bouts
   per week of moderate-vigorous PA.
   CONCLUSIONS. Lower-SES and high-minority block groups had reduced access
   to facilities, which in turn was associated with decreased PA and
   increased overweight. Inequality in availability of PA facilities may
   contribute to ethnic and SES disparities in PA and overweight patterns.

AB Women are not commonly drawn in northern Plains rock art, but they do
   occur in both the Ceremonial and Biographic traditions. When shown in
   Ceremonial rock art they appear in structure and content roles
   equivalent to those of males. In contrast, in later Biographic art they
   appear in various roles-from vanquished enemy to kidnapped wife-but
   these are nearly always subordinate to the male actors in these scenes.
   The newly recorded La Barge Bluffs site in Wyoming contains the most
   complex northern Plains biographic composition yet known that shows
   women. This scene integrates women as war captive, adoptee, and dance
   participants and, as such, illustrates nearly all the female roles of
   Biographic rock art. Although few in number these women are always key
   elements for fully understanding the narratives of the scenes in which
   they participate.

AB The fact that women are more likely than men to participate in
   traditional high status leisure activities constitutes one of the most
   consistent findings in the empirical study of cultural choice. Most
   explanations of this phenomenon point to the role of early socialization
   and society-wide cultural norms, but surprisingly, the more proximate
   influence of labor force participation and embeddedness in gendered
   occupational cultures has not been empirically explored. In this paper I
   fill this gap in the cultural participation and gender literature by
   asking whether extent of involvement in the labor force mediates the
   gender gap in highbrow consumption. I follow [Erickson, Bonnie H., 1996.
   Culture, class, and connections. American Journal of Sociology 102,
   217-252] in considering the relative usefulness of arts-related culture
   at work as an important determinant of individual taste patterns.
   Further, I show how Bourdieu's own theory of class fractions is
   compatible with Erickson's emphasis on highbrow devaluation as a
   byproduct of the pragmatism of workplace "business culture". In tandem
   with an eye toward gender dynamics, this modified Erickson-Bourdieu
   perspective can then be used to solve the puzzle of the gender
   difference in highbrow consumption. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   that the utility an adolescent derives from dating and sexual activity
   is a function of the weight and height of his or her partner, and it
   predicts that heavier and shorter adolescents will be less likely to
   date and have sex. Empirical tests confirm that dating is less likely
   among heavier girls and boys and among shorter girls and boys. In
   adolescent dating, size clearly matters. For sexual activity, the
   results are less consistent.

AB New York City's recycling program began in 1988 with scattered pilot
   programs to collect a restricted number of recyclable categories. Over
   time, the program was made more uniform in its implementation, was
   expanded citywide, and targeted more types of recyclables. Although
   Department of Sanitation surveys have shown that residents in all areas
   of the city have understood the requirements of the recycling program,
   recycling diversion rates vary substantially throughout the city's
   neighborhoods, ranging from 9 to 31% per district, while city-wide the
   diversion rate averages only about 20%.
   This paper explores the possible reasons for the disparity of recycling
   participation rates amongst neighborhoods, using recycling data
   collected by the city and federal census information to characterize the
   city's neighborhoods and show variation in recycling participation
   rates, demographics, socio-economic indicators, and other metrics. Four
   variables were found to be strongly correlated with low diversion rates:
   percentage of persons below poverty level; percentage of households
   headed by a single female with children; percentage of adults without a
   high school diploma; and percentage of minority population.
   A weighted linear model is used to calculate a one-number descriptive
   measure, called the recycling education, awareness, and participation
   (REAP) index, which relates recycling behavior for each of New York
   City's 59 sanitation districts with demographic and socio-economic
   variables that might "predict" recycling rates. This REAP index can then
   be used to help inform decision- and policy-making about strategies for
   increasing recycling education, awareness, and participation, help
   target particular communities for assistance, and prioritize resources.
   The effects of rapid program changes and substandard residential
   recycling environments are also discussed as possible influences on
   recycling participation rates, as well as other attitudinal, physical,
   and knowledge-based factors that may be indirectly associated with low
   socio-economic status communities. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB There is considerable inconsistency in findings regarding the
   relationship between specific cognitive deficits and social impairment
   in patients with schizophrenia. This inconsistency may relate to
   variability across studies in how social functioning is measured and
   preliminary evidence suggests that different indices of social
   functioning (e.g., laboratory test, community assessment) may have
   different cognitive correlates. The present study examined this issue by
   evaluating the relationships between cognitive deficits (including
   social cognitive deficits), role-play test performance, and community
   social functioning in 28 inpatients with schizophrenia. We expected the
   two measures of social functioning to have only modest convergence with
   each other. Moreover, informed by the literature on cognitive
   functioning in schizophrenia, we identified specific cognitive processes
   that were hypothesized to be associated with role-play performance
   (delayed verbal memory and attentional vigilance) and social functioning
   in the community (delayed verbal memory and executive functioning). As
   expected, the two measures of social functioning were modestly
   correlated with each other. Community social functioning was associated
   with a relatively constrained pattern of cognitive deficits and received
   a significant contribution (Delta r(2)=0.24) from specific cognitive
   processes beyond that of general cognitive functioning and symptom
   severity. In contrast to our hypotheses, role-play test performance was
   associated with a wide range of cognitive impairments and received
   little contribution from the specific cognitive processes beyond the
   effects of general cognitive functioning. Community social functioning,
   but not role-play test performance, was significantly associated with
   social cognition. These findings highlight the importance of
   conceptualizing social functioning as a multidimensional construct for
   schizophrenia research. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

AB This study investigated whether family factors, such as criticism,
   emotional over-involvement (EOI), warmth, and positive remarks, as
   measured by the Camberwell Family Interview (CFI), predict symptom
   change and social outcome for individuals identified as at imminent risk
   for conversion to psychosis. Twenty-six adolescent patients were
   administered the Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes and the
   Strauss-Carpenter Outcome Scale at baseline and follow-up assessment
   approximately three months later. Patients' primary caregivers were
   administered the CFI at baseline. After controlling for symptom severity
   at baseline, there were significant associations between caregivers' EOI
   at baseline and improvement in high-risk youths' negative symptoms and
   social functioning at follow-up. Similarly, caregivers' positive remarks
   at baseline were associated with improvement in negative and
   disorganized symptoms at follow-up, and warmth expressed by caregivers
   was associated with improved social functioning at follow-up. Although
   family members' critical comments were not related to patients'
   symptoms, the majority of critical remarks were focused on patients'
   negative symptoms and irritability/aggression, which may be important
   targets for early intervention. These preliminary results provide a
   first glimpse into the relationship between family factors and symptom
   development during the prodrome and suggest that positive family
   involvement predicts decreased symptoms and enhanced social functioning
   at this early stage. The finding that four-fifths of the youth enrolled
   in this early intervention clinical research program have shown
   symptomatic improvement by the three-month assessment point is very
   encouraging from an early detection/early intervention standpoint. (c)

   competition substantially increased saliva cortisol (C) and testosterone
   (T). For women, play-related increases in saliva C and T were similar in
   victory and defeat. For both men and women, saliva T (but not C) was
   highly correlated with teammate ratings of playing abilities-one measure
   of status with teammates-and self-ratings of social connectedness with
   teammates, but the nature of the relationship was different according to

AB The canonical model in economics considers people to be rational and
   self-regarding. However much evidence challenges this view, raising the
   question of when "Economic Man" dominates he outcome of social
   interactions, and when bounded rationality or other-regarding
   preferences dominate. Here we show that strategic incentives are the key
   to answering this question. A minority of self-regarding individuals can
   trigger a "noncooperative" aggregate outcome if their behavior generates
   incentives for the majority of other-regarding individuals to mimic the
   minority's behavior. Likewise, a minority of other-regarding individuals
   can generate a "cooperative" aggregate outcome if their behavior
   generates incentives for a majority of self-regarding people to behave
   cooperatively. Similarly, in strategic games, aggregate outcomes can be
   either far from or close to Nash equilibrium if players with high
   degrees of strategic thinking mimic or erase the effects of others who
   do very little strategic thinking. Recently developed theories of
   other-regarding preferences and bounded rationality explain these
   findings and provide better predictions of actual aggregate behavior
   than does traditional economic theory.

AB A fundamental goal of sociobiology is to explain how complex social
   behaviour evolves(1), especially in social insects, the exemplars of
   social living. Although still the subject of much controversy(2), recent
   theoretical explanations have focused on the evolutionary origins of
   worker behaviour ( assistance from daughters that remain in the nest and
   help their mother to reproduce) through expression of maternal care
   behaviour towards siblings(3,4). A key prediction of this evolutionary
   model is that traits involved in maternal care have been co-opted
   through heterochronous expression of maternal genes(5) to result in
   sib-care, the hallmark of highly evolved social life in insects(6). A
   coupling of maternal behaviour to reproductive status evolved in
   solitary insects, and was a ready substrate for the evolution of
   worker-containing societies(3,4,7,8). Here we show that division of
   foraging labour among worker honey bees ( Apis mellifera) is linked to
   the reproductive status of facultatively sterile females. We thereby
   identify the evolutionary origin of a widely expressed social-insect
   behavioural syndrome(1,5,7,9), and provide a direct demonstration of how
   variation in maternal reproductive traits gives rise to complex social
   behaviour in non-reproductive helpers.

   contributions to the field, as well as recent developments by

   historicization has been a useful corrective to the earlier
   functionalist emphasis on the socially integrative role of drinking.
   Recent studies tend to employ a more strategic/agentive analytical
   framework and treat drinking through the lens of practice, politics, and
   gender. Moreover, alcohol has come to be seen as an important component
   of the political economy, and a commodity centrally implicated in

AB Recent approaches to understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying
   decision processes suggest that simple strategies can result in
   successful and adaptive behaviors. Here, the evolutionary success of
   simple recognition memory is investigated. Agents have a limited memory
   capacity for either agents who have previously cooperated (C-Mem) or
   those that have previously defected (D-Mem). Various aspects of the
   ecological and social environment influence the success of each of these
   strategies. These findings suggest that recognition memory can play a
   role in promoting the evolution of cooperation, but that the
   effectiveness of such a simple recognition memory strategy depends on
   the fit between that strategy and the (ecological and social)
   environment in which that strategy is employed. The D-Mem strategy is
   able to invade only when the memory size of these agents is close to the
   total number of defectors in the population. However, the C-Mem strategy
   can invade a population of defectors when memory size is one, as long as
   the population size is relatively small and the ecological environment
   promotes longer intervals between each reproductive opportunity.

   cooperation has focused primarily on the manipulation of reputations. We
   present a formal model of vicarious information transfer, as a social
   learning strategy, between (potential) cooperative and competitive group
   members. We build on theories that have shown how effective
   communication can solve the adaptive problem of the high costs of
   individual learning. By communicating about the strategies of others,
   individuals can vicariously learn at faster rates and lower cost. The
   costs and benefits of social versus individual learning have been
   modeled extensively. In this article, we focus on the unexplored and
   more basic question of when an individual should initiate the sharing of
   vicarious information that can potentially affect the fitness of a

AB We propose an agent-based model of group foraging, EPICURE, for patchily
   distributed resources. Each agent makes probabilistic movement decisions
   in a gridworld through a linear combination of current perceptual
   information and a reinforcement history. EPICURE captures the empirical
   results from several foraging conditions in previous works, and it leads
   to a reevaluation of findings from those papers. In particular, human
   foragers show contingent usage of information, initially using social
   information to discover resource pools before private sampling
   information has been established. We describe a series of simulations
   that test the sources of resource undermatching often found in group
   foraging experiments. After testing the effects of foragers' starting
   locations, travel costs, the number of foragers, and the size of uniform
   food distributions, we discuss a novel hypothesis for undermatching.
   Spatial constraints lead to inadequate individual and group information
   sampling and cause group undermatching. The foraging group size, food
   rate, spatial distribution of food, and resulting forager reinforcement
   histories interact to produce undermatching, and occasionally
   overmatching, to resources.

AB Aims To estimate age, period. cohort and other demographic influences on
   heavy alcohol consumption and trajectories of heavy drinking in American
   adults. Design Prospective cohort of 14 127 participants. aged 25-74
   years at baseline. Generalized estimating equations to model
   longitudinal change in the probability of heavy drinking and its
   association with demographic factors. Setting National. population-based
   sample of non-institutionalized civilians. Measurements Heavy alcohol
   consumption (usual number of drinks per occasion five for men: four for
   women) at baseline (1971-74) and three follow-ups until 1992. Findings
   Heavy alcohol consumption declined with increasing age (age effect) and
   tracked national average consumption (period effect). There was no
   cohort effect. Higher probability of heavy drinking was associated with
   mate gender (relative risk: RR = 2.4). being not married (RR = 1.4),
   having less than high school education (RR = 1.7). having annual income
   below the median (RR = 1.5). not living in the South-cast (RR = 1.7).
   and smoking (RR = 3.4). Getting married and quitting smoking during the
   study were each associated with reduction in heavy drinking (RR = 0.55
   and 0.61. respectively). Slower age-related decline in the probability
   of heavy drinking was seen in men (P < 0.0001). married individuals (P =
   0.03). and smokers (P = 0.05). Conclusions Demographic predictors of
   trends in heavy drinking are different from those for trends in average
   alcohol consumption. The likelihood of heavy drinking declined more
   slowly with increasing age in men and smokers, suggesting that the
   negative health effects of alcohol in older ages may be greatest in
   these groups.

AB Aims Our study has two goals: to evaluate variation in symptoms of
   substance abuse/dependence by family structure and to examine several
   potential explanations for this association. including differences in
   socio-economic status, social support, social stress and perceived
   approval and use of substances by family and friends. Design Ordinary
   least squares (OLS) regression is used to examine the association
   between family type and problematic substance use and to assess the
   hypothesized mediators. Setting Data were collected between 1998 and
   2000 as part of a study of the prevalence and social distributions of
   psychiatric and substance use disorders. The study involved face-to-face
   interviews with a representative sample of young adults in a South
   Florida community. Participants Respondents (n = 1760) were between 18
   and 23 years of age. Approximately 25% were of Cuban origin, 25% other
   Caribbean basin Hispanic. 25% African American and 25% non-Hispanic
   white. Measurements Four family types are examined: mother-father
   families, single-parent families. single-parent families that include
   other adult relative(s) and stepfamilies. Problematic substance use is
   measured by a set of 22 substance abuse/dependence symptoms. Findings
   Controlling for race-ethnicity and gender. respondents from
   single-parent families report a significantly higher level of
   problematic substance use than those from mother-father families.
   Although nearly all explanations receive support, we find the strongest
   evidence for differential association with deviant peers and exposure to
   stress. Conclusions Our findings suggest that-rather than representing a
   unique and independent predictor of substance use problems-family
   structure can be viewed as a marker of the unequal distribution of
   factors influencing the risk of problematic substance use.

AB Aims To use a novel social epidemic probability model to investigate
   longitudinally the extent to which parents' and older siblings' smoking
   predict children's smoking transitions. Design Parents' and older
   siblings' smoking status was assessed when children were in 3rd grade
   (baseline). Three smoking transitions were assessed over the period of
   child/adolescent smoking acquisition (up to 12th grade): (1) transition
   from never smoking to trying smoking, (2) transition from trying to
   monthly smoking and (3) transition from monthly to daily smoking.
   Setting Forty Washington State school districts participating in the
   long term Hutchinson Smoking Prevention Project (HSPP). Participants and
   measurements Participants were the 5520 families for whom data on both
   parents' and older siblings' baseline smoking status, as well as on
   children's smoking transitions, were available. Findings The probability
   that a smoking parent influenced their child to make the first
   transition to trying smoking was 32% (95% CI: 27%, 36%); to make the
   second transition from trying to monthly smoking, 15% (95% CI: 10%,
   19%); and to make the third transition from monthly to daily smoking,
   28% (95% CI: 21%, 34%). The probability that an older sibling influenced
   a child to make the first transition to trying smoking was 29% (95% CI:
   17%, 39%); to make the second transition from trying to monthly smoking,
   0% (95% CI: 0%, 8%); and to make the third transition from monthly to
   daily smoking, 20% (95% CI: 4%, 33%). Conclusions In contrast to
   previous research, the results provide new evidence suggesting that
   family smoking influences both initiation and escalation of children's
   smoking. Results also quantify, in terms of probabilities, the
   importance of parents' and older siblings' smoking on children's three
   major smoking transitions. Parents' smoking, as well as older siblings'
   smoking, are important behaviors to target in preventing adolescents
   from making smoking transitions.

   study examined the efficacy of an economic empowerment and HIV
   prevention intervention targeting illicit drug-using women (n = 50) who
   were involved in prostitution in Baltimore, Maryland. The intervention
   was comprised of six 2-hour sessions that taught HIV prevention risk
   reduction and the making, marketing and selling of jewellery. Bivariate
   comparisons examined behaviour change pre and 3-months
   post-intervention. The intervention's effect on the change in the number
   of sex trade partners from baseline to follow-up was explored with
   multiple linear regression. Participants were 62.0% African American,
   5.0% were currently employed, and the median age was 39 years old (
   Inter Quartile Range [IQR]: 34 - 45). Women attended an average of six
   (IQR: 4.5 = 6.0) sessions. The women sold over $7,000 worth of jewellery
   in eleven sales. In comparing self-reported risk behaviours pre and
   3-month post intervention participation, we found significant reductions
   in: receiving drugs or money for sex (100% versus 71.0%, p < 0.0005);
   the median number of sex trade partners per month (9 versus 3, p =
   0.02); daily drug use (76.0% vs. 55.0%, p = 0.003); the amount of money
   spent on drugs daily (US$52.57 versus US$46.71, p = 0.01); and daily
   crack use (27.3% versus 13.1.0%, p = 0.014). In the presence of other
   variables in a multivariate linear model, income from the jewelry sale
   was associated with a reduction in the number of sex trade partners at
   follow-up. The pilot indicated effectiveness of a novel, HIV prevention,
   economic enhancement intervention upon HIV sexual risk behaviours and
   drug utilization patterns.

   identify one major HIV-prevention NGO in the capital or a large city in

   Director. Most NGOs are carrying out their programmes with minimal
   funding and few regularly employed personnel. Most are highly dependent
   on international donors, but reliance on small grants with short funding
   periods limits programme development capacity. HIV-prevention activities
   varied by region, with African NGOs most likely to use peer education
   and community awareness events; Eastern European NGOs most likely to
   offer needle exchange; Latin American NGOs to have resource centres and
   offer risk reduction programmes; and Caribbean organizations to use mass
   education approaches. Across regions, NGOs most often targeted the
   general public and youth, although specialized at-risk groups were the
   additional focus of attention in some regions. Limited funding,
   governmental indifference or opposition, AIDS stigma, and social
   discomfort discussing sex were often cited as barriers to new
   HIV-prevention programmes. NGOs are critical service providers. However,
   their funding, programmes, and resource capacities must be strengthened
   if NGOs are to realize their full potential in HIV prevention.

   potential bridges and contributions to contemporary economics. These
   bridges are methodological or epistemological and theoretical or
   substantive ones. A relevant instance of the methodological bridges is
   socioeconomic holism, epitomized in the systems approach to economy and
   society. An important case of the theoretical bridges is sociological
   institutionalism. The holistic systems approach is a pertinent
   methodological bridge in that it treats the economy as an integral
   element of society as a larger system, and consequently treats economics
   as part of the complex of social sciences. Sociological institutionalism
   is an important theoretical bridge to (especially institutional)
   economics by virtue of its emphasis on social institutions and their
   economic significance. Some other methodological and theoretical bridges
   of Parsonian economic sociology to contemporary economics are also
   identified and discussed.

AB Background: Increasing individual preparedness for disasters, including
   large-scale terrorist attacks, is a significant concern of public health
   planners. As with natural disasters, individuals call help protect their
   health and safety by preparing for the emergency situation that may
   follow a terrorist event. Our study describes variations in preparedness
   among the population of Los Angeles County, after the September 11, 2001
   and subsequent anthrax attacks.
   Methods: In 2004, the data were analyzed from the Los Angeles County
   Health Survey, a random-digit-dialed telephone survey of the
   non-institutionalized population in Los Angeles County fielded October
   2002 through February 2003.
   Results: Overall, 28.0% of respondents had emergency supplies, and 17.1%
   developed all emergency plan in the past year in response to the
   possibility of terrorism. Factors associated with having emergency
   supplies included African American (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.8, 95%
   confidence interval [CI]=1.1-3.1) and Latino (AOR=1.5, 95% CI=1.0-2.4)
   race/ethnicity; having a household dependent aged <= 18 years (AOR=1.4,.
   95% CI=1.0-2.0); being born outside the United States (AOR=1.9, 95%
   CI=1.3-2.9); some college or trade school education (AOR=1.9, 95%
   CI=1.3-2.9); and higher perceived likelihood of a bioterrorist attack
   (AOR=2.2, 95% CI=1.6-3.0). Factors associated with having all emergency
   plan included African American (AOR=2.6, 95% CI=1.5-4.6) race/ethnicity;
   having a household dependent aged <= 18 years (AOR=2.4, 95% CI=1.6-3.5);
   and physical disability (AOR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.7).
   Conclusions: Some groups were more likely to adopt some, but not all,
   recommended preparedness activities. Identifying subpopulation
   differences in preparedness is important since different public health
   messages, programs, and distribution channels are required for different
   subgroups.

   Methods. Multilevel modeling was used to explore domestic violence
   outcomes among a sample of 4520 married men.
   Results. Recent physical and sexual domestic violence was associated
   with the individual-level variables of childlessness, economic pressure,
   and intergenerational transmission of violence. A community environment
   of violent crime was associated with elevated risks of both physical and
   sexual violence. Community-level norms concerning wife beating were
   significantly related only to physical violence.
   Conclusions. Important similarities as well as differences were evident
   in risk factors for physical and sexual domestic violence. Higher

   sexual violence. Our results provide additional support for the
   importance of contextual factors in shaping women's risks of physical

AB Background. Research indicates that perceived racism and coping
   responses are associated with basal blood pressure (BP) levels and BP
   reactivity in Black adults. No study could be found, however that has
   explored the independent and interactive effects of perceived racism and
   coping responses in a cohort who probably has the greatest risk of
   developing primary hypertension-Black youth. Purpose: This study
   examined the relationship of perceived racism and coping responses to a
   continuous measure of BP and to a categorical measure of BP status
   (normal vs. high-normal or high). Methods: The convenience sample
   consisted of 217 Black youth (M age = 11.4 years, SD = 1.3).
   Participants reported on perceived racism and coping responses
   (Accepting It, Self-Blame, Taking Action, and Talking to Someone). BP
   was assessed with an automated monitor in school. Results: Approximately
   32% of the sample had average BP levels that were high-normal or high.
   Hierarchical linear and logistic regression analyses were used to assess
   the predictive utility of perceived racism and the four coping responses
   to the continuous and categorical BP assessments. Although perceived
   racism and the coping response variables did not emerge as significant
   independent predictors in the linear or logistic regression. analyses,
   perceived racism interacted with Accepting It (p = .009) in the linear
   regression analysis predicting systolic BP Follow-up linear regression
   analyses indicated that perceived racism was not significantly
   associated with systolic BP among participants low in Accepting It but
   was inversely related to systolic BP among participants high in
   Accepting It. Perceived racism also interacted with Accepting It (p =
   .016) and Talking to Someone (p = .0009) in the logistic regression
   analysis predicting BP status. Follow-up logistic regression analyses
   revealed that (a) perceived racism was not significantly associated with
   BP status among participants low in Accepting It but was inversely
   related to BP status among participants high in Accepting It, and (b)
   perceived racism was inversely associated with BP status among
   participants low in Talking to Someone but was not significantly related
   to BP status among participants high in Talking to Someone. Conclusions:
   The contribution of environmental and psychosocial factors to
   hypertension risk should be considered when exploring correlates of
   continuous and categorical assessments of BP in Black youth.

AB Background: Psychosocial variables, including stress, emotions, and
   social factors, may contribute to the association between socioeconomic
   status (SES) and health. Concepts and methods from interpersonal theory
   (1) could provide a useful framework for research concerning the roles
   of psychosocial factors in socioeconomic health disparities. Purpose: We
   examined the association between SES and psychosocial processes captured
   by the interpersonal circumplex and tested the degree to which
   circumplex ratings explained the association between SES and perceived
   health. Methods: San Diego community residents (N = 304; 51% male; 34%
   Latino; 50% White; 20% Black; 6.8% Asian/Asian American; 2.9% another
   ethnicity) completed a circumplex-based assessment of several social
   contexts (home, work, and community), the SF-12 measure of perceived
   health, and questions concerning demographic characteristics. Results:
   Multilevel models revealed that individuals with lower SES described
   their social worlds as more hostile and less friendly compared with
   their higher SES counterparts. Furthermore, lower SES was associated
   with perceptions of exposure to more dominant or controlling behavior
   from others, compared with higher SES. Appraisals of hostility versus
   friendliness, in particular, helped explain the inverse association
   between SES and some aspects of perceived health. Conclusions:
   Applications of interpersonal theory may be useful in efforts to
   understand the roles of psychosocial factors in SES-related health
   disparities.

   participated in greater household activity. Regression analyses
   demonstrated that recreational, occupational, and household activity
   were significant predictors of overall accelerometer physical activity
   for the complete sample. Among women, recreational and household
   activity were significant predictors; however overall accelerometer
   physical activity was not significantly predicted in men. Additionally,
   it was demonstrated that acculturation was related to occupational
   activity, but not to recreational activity. Conclusions: These results
   suggest that gender differences in physical activity are present among
   Latinos and that acculturation may be a correlate of various types of
   physical activity.

AB This review surveys anthropological and other social research on money
   and finance. It emphasizes money's social roles and meanings as well as
   its pragmatics in different modalities of exchange and circulation. It
   reviews scholarly emphasis on modern money's distinctive qualities of
   commensuration, abstraction, quantification, and reification. It also
   addresses recent work that seeks to understand the social, semiotic, and
   performative dimensions of finance. Although anthropology has
   contributed finely grained, historicized accounts of the impact of
   modern money, it too often repeats the same story of the "great
   transformation" from socially embedded to disembedded and abstracted
   economic forms. This review speculates about why money's fictions

AB Historical ecology is a new interdisciplinary research program concerned
   with comprehending temporal and spatial dimensions in the relationships
   of human societies to local environments and the cumulative global
   effects of these relationships. Historical ecology contains core
   postulates that concern qualitative types of human-mediated disturbance
   of natural environments and the effect of these on species diversity,
   among other parameters. A central term used in historical ecology to
   situate human behavior and agency in the environment is the landscape,
   as derived from historical geography, instead of the ecosystem, which is
   from systems ecology. Historical ecology is similar to nonequilibrium
   dynamic theory, but differs in its postulate of human-mediated
   disturbance as a principle of landscape transformation. Such
   disturbances counterintuitively may involve anthropogenic primary and
   secondary succession that result in net increases of alpha and even beta
   diversity. Applied historical ecology can supply the reference
   conditions of time depth and traditional knowledge to restore past
   landscapes.

AB International law, including human rights law, has expanded enormously
   in the past century. A growing body of anthropological research is
   investigating its principles and practices. Contemporary international
   law covers war and the treatment of combatants and noncombatants in
   wartime; international peace and security; the peaceful settlement of
   disputes; economic arrangements and trade agreements; the regulation of
   the global commons such as space, polar regions, and the oceans;
   environmental issues; the law of the sea; and human rights. This review
   demonstrates how anthropological theory helps social scientists,
   activists, and lawyers understand how international law is produced and
   how it works. It also shows the value of ethnographic studies of
   specific sites within the complex array of norms, principles, and
   institutions that constitute international law and legal regulation.
   These range from high-level commercial dispute settlement systems to
   grassroots human rights organizations around the world.

AB Modernity has helped to popularize,and at the same time threaten,
   indigeneity. Anthropologists question both the validity of the concept
   of indigeneity and the wisdom of employing it as a political tool, but
   they are reluctant to deny it to local communities, whose use of the
   concept has become subject to study. The concept of indigenous knowledge
   is similarly faulted in favor of the hybrid products of modernity, and
   the idea of indigenous environmental knowledge and conservation is
   heatedly contested., Possibilities for alternate environmentalisms, and
   the combining of conservation and development, goals, are being debated
   and tested in integrated conservation and development projects and
   extractive reserves. Anthropological understanding of both state and
   community agency is being rethought, and new approaches to the study of
   collaboration, indigenous rights movements, and violence are being
   developed. These and other current topics of interest involving
   indigenous peoples challenge anthropological theory as well as
   ethics,and suggest the importance of analyzing the contradictions
   inherent in the coevolution of science, society, and environment.

   famine theories, concepts of vulnerability, and household livelihood
   security and responses to recent food crises in the region. The authors
   argue that famine occurrences are linked to historical and contemporary
   socioeconomic processes that have increased over time the vulnerability
   of African households to hunger and reduced their resilience to
   environmental and economic shocks, political conflict, and the rapid
   spread of HIV/AIDS. Approaches to famine need to move away from the
   "emergency relief" framework to better address the underlying conditions
   that make food shortages endemic. Future food security for Africa
   requires an integrated long-term response to household vulnerability on
   the. part of African governments, civil society, and international
   partners by incorporating new technologies, local expertise, and active
   involvement of African communities living with the realities of
   recurrent famine.

AB During recent years, a few scholars have advocated that more attention
   be paid to the intersection of law, economics., and sociology-what may
   be called the economic sociology of law. This review suggests that a
   theoretical foundation for such a field of study, or parts of such a
   foundation, may be found in the work of Max Weber. It also provides an
   introduction to those parts of Weber's work that are relevant in this
   context. Weber especially emphasizes the role that law plays in raising
   the probability that actions will take place, in the economy and
   elsewhere, and that this probability has to be established while taking
   the motives of the actors into account. The main contribution of the
   legal system to modem capitalism, Weber also argues, is to make economic
   life more calculable. This review also discusses which factors account
   for the increasing rationalization of law, including economic factors.

   the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Drawing on
   research in political science and political sociology, it criticizes
   recent debates about emergency powers among legal and constitutional
   scholars for ignoring the institutional dynamics of modem executive
   power, especially in presidential regimes. Constitutional relativists
   (e.g., Harvey Mansfield, Michael Stokes Paulsen, John Yoo), defenders of
   the extralegal model of emergency action (Oren Gross, Mark Tushnet), and
   common lawyers (David Cole, David Dyzenhaus) are criticized for failing
   to consider the pathologies likely generated by their proposals in an
   institutional context in which the executive possesses incentives for
   declaring, perpetuating, and exploiting emergency situations. Only a
   legal formalist perspective on emergency government (e.g., Bruce
   Ackerman) pays sufficient attention to the institutional dynamics of the
   contemporary executive.

AB This chapter begins with a summary of a model, developed half a century
   ago, that distinguishes three qualitatively different processes of
   social influence: compliance, identification, and internalization. The
   model, originally geared to and experimentally tested in the context of
   persuasive communication, was subsequently applied to influence in the
   context of long-term relationships, including psychotherapy,
   international exchanges, and the socialization of national/ethnic
   identity. It has been extended to analysis of the relationship of
   individuals to social systems. Individuals' rule, role, and value
   orientations to a system-conceptually linked to compliance,
   identification, and internalization-predict different reactions to their
   own violations of societal standards, different patterns of personal
   involvement in the political system, and differences in attitude toward
   authorities and readiness to obey. In a further extension of the model,
   three approaches to peacemaking in international or intergroup conflicts
   are identified-conflict settlement, conflict resolution, and
   reconciliation-which, respectively, focus on the accommodation of
   interests, relationships, and identities, and are conducive to changes
   at the level of compliance, identification, and internalization.

   with emphasis on the relevance of today's work for perennial issues. We
   reiterate the distinction between attitude formation and change, and
   show its relevance for persuasion. Single- and dual-process models are
   discussed, as are current views on dissonance theory. Majority and
   minority influence are scrutinized, with special emphasis on integrative
   theoretical innovations. Attitude strength is considered, and its
   relevance to ambivalence and resistance documented. Affect, mood, and
   emotion effects are reviewed, especially as they pertain to fear arousal
   and (un)certainty. Finally, we discuss attitude-behavior consistency,
   perhaps the reason for our interest in attitudes in the first place,
   with emphasis on self-interest and the theory of planned behavior. Our
   review reflects the dynamism and the reach of the area, and suggests a
   sure and sometimes rapid accumulation of knowledge and understanding.

AB Legitimacy is a psychological property of an authority, institution, or
   social arrangement that leads those connected to it to believe that it
   is appropriate, proper, and just. Because of legitimacy, people feel
   that they ought to defer to decisions and rules, following them
   voluntarily out of obligation rather than out of fear of punishment or
   anticipation of reward. Being legitimate is important to the success of
   authorities, institutions, and institutional arrangements since it is
   difficult to exert influence over others based solely upon the
   possession and use of power. Being able to gain voluntary acquiescence
   from most people, most of the time, due to their sense of obligation
   increases effectiveness during periods of scarcity, crisis, and
   conflict. The concept of legitimacy has a long history within social
   thought and social psychology, and it has emerged as increasingly
   important within recent research on the dynamics of political, legal,
   and social systems.

AB In this essay, I draw on a professional life history to suggest how
   sociological knowledge is generated by encounters with changing research
   opportunities, here called targets of opportunity. In my case, a study
   of rural communities led to unanticipated conclusions concerning
   buffering mechanisms that protected authorities by absorbing
   dissatisfactions and rebellions. Wartime research in a military setting
   identified sources of group solidarity and effective performance under
   stress. Major societal changes in racial/ethnic relations provided
   opportunities to develop new concepts and empirical findings. Synoptic
   studies of post-World War II American society led to extensive research
   on values and institutions. These macrosociological analyses of
   ethnicity and social systems, in turn, led me to a new sociology of war
   and interstate relations. I also offer here some critical reflections on
   recurrent issues and chronic controversies in American sociology. Final
   sections of the review deal with the continuing search for conceptual
   clarity and cumulative knowledge. I note the obstacles of disciplinary
   fragmentation, but my closing judgment is that sociology now has the
   base of substantial scientific knowledge and methodological expertise
   necessary for investigating crucial twenty-first century problems.

   dramaturgical theories, symbolic interactionist theories, interaction

   review each of these approaches. Despite the progress made by these
   theories, several issues remain unresolved: the nature of emotions,
   feeling, and affect; the degree to which emotions are biologically based
   or socially constructed; the gap between social psychological theories
   on emotions and macrostructural theorizing; and the relatively narrow
   range of emotions theorized, coupled with an equally narrow focus on the
   structural and cultural conditions producing these emotions.

   operate interdependently with social institutions and with other units
   of social structure. Because such relationships channel flows of
   resources, opportunities are granted or withheld from social actors
   depending in part on their organization connections. Such considerations
   encourage analyses of organizations in ways that spread the relevance of

AB Sociology can be an important disciplinary bridge between the study of
   what demographers call forced migration and mortality and what legal
   sociologists and criminologists understand as war crimes. The challenge
   is to develop a critically informed sociological synthesis that joins
   our understanding of the frequently politicized health and violence
   dimensions of what are also diplomatically called "complex" humanitarian
   emergencies. The frequency of these emergencies is growing, and there is
   an increasing amount of data collected by governmental and
   nongovernmental organizations exposing large-scale violations of human
   rights and war crimes. Yet analyses of these data are often inadequate.
   Although the humanitarian emergency in Kosovo marked a high point in
   collaborative human rights research, the circumstances that allowed this
   collaboration are probably atypical. We consider how, in increasingly
   challenging circumstances such as the Darfur region of Sudan, population
   health and legal and criminological surveys can be joined to provide
   more comprehensive estimates of deaths resulting from violent attacks as
   well as from disease and starvation. The discipline of sociology, with
   its expertise in population-based surveys and other measurement and
   analytic techniques, has the capacity to bridge differences and to
   provide more meaningfully synthesized conclusions.

AB Context: We examined the relationship between socioeconomic status and
   response to treatment for depression among older adults.
   Methods: Secondary analysis of pooled data from the open-label phase of
   2 National Institute of Mental Health-funded clinical trials of
   nortriptyline hydrochloride or paroxetine combined with interpersonal
   psychotherapy (N=248). We used Cox proportional hazards regression
   analyses to examine the association between socioeconomic status,
   indexed by census tract median annual household income and the subject's
   educational attainment, and treatment response and remission according
   to the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The association between
   socioeconomic status and suicidality or depressed mood reported at each
   week of treatment was examined using repeated-measures generalized logit
   models.
   Results: Subjects residing in middle-income census tracts were
   significantly more likely to respond to antidepressant treatment than
   subjects residing in low-income census tracts (adjusted hazard ratio,
   1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.75]). Throughout the course
   of antidepressant treatment, subjects in the middle- and high-income
   census tracts were significantly less likely to report suicidal ideation
   (adjusted odds ratios, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.27-0.94] and 0.39 [95% CI,
   0.16-0.94], respectively). No association was found between
   socioeconomic status and remission.
   Conclusion: Residence in a low-income census tract is associated with a
   less favorable course of depression among older adults receiving a
   combination of pharmacologic and psychosocial treatment.

AB OBJECTIVE
   To determine the impact of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms on issues
   related to employment, social interactions, and emotional well-being in
   a population aged 40-64 years.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS
   The study comprised a cross-sectional population-based survey of 11 521
   individuals aged 40-64 years, conducted in France, Germany, Italy,
   Spain, Sweden, and the UK. The survey involved a two-stage screening
   procedure. Initially, individuals with any lower urinary tract symptoms
   were identified. Those whose only symptom/(s) was suggestive of a
   urinary tract infection, stress incontinence, or prostate obstruction
   were excluded from further study. Respondents were asked questions about
   the impact that their symptoms had on their emotional well-being, social
   interactions and productivity at home and at work.
   RESULTS
   Of those with OAB, approximate to 32% (1272) reported that having these
   symptoms made them feel depressed, and 28% reported feeling very
   stressed. There were statistically significant differences in reported
   feelings of stress and depression when OAB symptoms were stratified by
   OAB with incontinence (OAB+) vs those with OAB with no incontinence
   (OAB-), with values for emotional stress of OAB+ 36.4% vs OAB- 19.6%,
   for depression of OAB+ 39.8% vs OAB- 23.3%. Participants with OAB+were
   significantly more likely than those with OAB- to express worry about
   having accidents and concern about participating in activities away from
   home because of their bladder symptoms. In addition, those with OAB+
   were significantly more likely to report that these bladder symptoms
   were a source of great concern and made them feel uncomfortable in
   social situations compared to those with OAB-. Men were significantly
   more likely than women to report OAB+ having an impact on their daily
   work life, including worry about interrupting meetings, impact on
   decisions about work location and hours, and voluntary termination or
   early retirement. This effect was primarily in men reporting OAB+.
   CONCLUSION
   OAB symptoms have a significant effect on the emotional well-being and
   productivity of those affected, both at home and at work.

   medical confidentiality and patient privacy. For an extensive discussion
   of Jewish medical ethics and an in-depth presentation of the Jewish view
   of 39 major issues in medical ethics, the reader is referred elsewhere
   [15]. Briefly, the Jewish view toward medical ethical subjects is
   predicated on the general principle of the supreme value of human life.
   In Judaism, all biblical and rabbinic laws are temporarily waived in
   order to save a human life. Physicians are obligated to heal patients
   from their illness, to induce remission and cure of disease whenever
   possible. Similarly, patients are obligated to lead healthy lifestyles,
   to consult physicians when they are sick and to be compliant with the
   physician's therapeutic recommendations. The Jewish view on medical
   confidentiality and patient privacy as presented in this essay flows
   from these general principles of Jewish medical ethics.

PY 2006
AB Caribbean archaeologists have long assumed that the art of pottery
   making was introduced to the West Indies by the Arawak (Saladoid)
   peoples who first entered the islands around 500 BC. After their
   expansion stalled in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and
   Hispaniola, a new pottery series called Ostionoid developed, and a
   second wave of expansion supposedly began to the west and north
   resulting in the introduction of pottery to the other islands of the
   Greater Antilles and the Bahamas. Over the past 80 years evidence has
   accumulated that so-called "preceramic" Archaic peoples actually were
   making and using pottery in Cuba, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico long before
   Saladoid peoples arrived. This "Pre-Arawak Pottery Horizon" has largely
   been ignored because it does not fit the conventional model of island
   colonization. The presence of pottery among Archaic groups calls for a
   reinterpretation of the origins and development of the ethnohistoric
   Tainos. It is here argued that the Ostionoid developed among Archaic
   groups in Hispaniola, and that Ostionoid pottery styles then spread east
   to Puerto Rico, west to Jamaica and north to the Bahama archipelago.
   According to this hypothesis the origins of the Tainos are to be found
   in the Archaic cultures of Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba.

AB Socio-economic status (SES) may affect health status in airway disease
   at the individual and area level.
   In a cohort of adults with asthma, rhinitis or both conditions,
   questionnaire-derived individual-level SES and principal components
   analysis (PCA) of census data for area-level SES factors were used.
   Regression analysis was utilised to study the associations among
   individual- and area-level SES for the following four health status
   measures: severity of asthma scores and the Short Form-12 Physical
   Component Scale (SF-12 PCS) (n-404); asthma-specific quality of life
   (QoL) scores (n=340); and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)
   per cent predicted (n=218).
   PCA yielded a two-factor solution for area-level SES. Factor 1 (lower
   area-level SES) was significantly associated with poorer SF-12 PCS and
   worse asthma QoL. These associations remained significant after adding
   individual-level SES. Factor 1 was also significantly associated with
   severity of asthma scores, but not after addition of the
   individual-level SES. Factor 2 (suburban area-level SES) was associated
   with lower FEV1 per cent predicted in combined area-level and individual
   SES models.
   In conclusion, area-level socio-economic status is linked to some, but
   not all, of the studied health status measures after taking into account
   individual-level socio-economic status.

AB Background: Cognitive aging research, as well as cross-cultural
   research, often relies on pictorial stimuli to address how perceptions
   of common objects vary by population group. Objective: We investigate
   naming specificity - the degree of detail elicited for object labels -
   across age (younger-older) and culture (American-Chinese). Methods:
   Using latent class analysis techniques, we segregated picture-item
   responses into multiple specificity levels. The analysis was conducted
   for 260 pictures, across four groups of younger (aged 17-25 years) and
   older (aged 59-76 years) adults in the US and mainland China. Results:
   Overall, three naming specificity classes were supported. Age
   differences were modest compared to those across culture. In particular,
   Chinese groups showed far greater variation, naming more items both with
   high and with low specificity than age-matched American counterparts.
   Our results differed from prior studies using familiarity and latency
   measures. Moreover, approximately 28% of commonly-used picture items
   differed across all four groups. Conclusion: These results highlight the
   need to select appropriate pictorial stimuli for studies involving
   populations diverse in age and cultural background.

AB Background: The present study investigates the possibility that culture
   affects age differences in context memory. There is evidence that
   East-Asians process scenes more holistically and show better context
   memory than Americans. Objective:We examined evidence for differences in
   binding source to context in young and old Americans and native Chinese.
   We hypothesized that age effects on source memory could be mitigated due
   to these cultural differences in processing style. Methods: During
   incidental encoding, younger and older Chinese and Americans watched a
   video with statements spoken by four distinct speakers. After a brief
   interval, participants identified source (experiment 1) or item and
   source (experiment 2). Results: We observed substantial age-related
   deficits in source memory in both cultures but little evidence for
   cultural differences in source or item memory. Conclusion: Basic source
   memory processes operate similarly across culture and age. The source of
   holistic processing differences observed between cultures may occur in
   cognitive operations that are more highly bound to a social context.

AB Background: Cross-cultural differences in cognition suggest that
   Westerners use categories more than Easterners, but these differences
   have only been investigated in young, adults. Objective: The
   contributions of cognitive resource and the extent of cultural exposure
   are explored for free recall by investigating cross-cultural differences
   in categorical organization in younger and older adults. Cultural
   differences in the use of categories should be larger for elderly than
   young because categorization is a well-practiced strategy for
   Westerners, but age-related cognitive resource limitations may make the
   strategy difficult for elderly Easterners to implement. Therefore, we
   expect that cultural differences in categorization will be magnified in
   elderly adults relative to younger adults, with Americans categorizing
   more than Chinese. Methods: Across two studies, 112 young and 112
   elderly drawn from two cultures (American and Chinese) encoded words
   presented in their native language. One word list contained
   categorically-unrelated words and the other, categorically-related
   words; both lists were presented in the participants' native language.
   In experiment 1, the words were strong category associates, and in
   experiment 2, the words were weak category associates. Participants
   recalled all the words they could remember, and the number of words
   recalled and degree of clustering by category were analyzed. Results: As
   predicted, cultural differences emerged for the elderly, with
   East-Asians using categories less than Americans during recall of
   highly-associated category exemplars (experiment 1). For recall of
   low-associate exemplars, East-Asians overall categorized less than
   Americans (experiment 2). Surprisingly, these differences in the use of
   categories did not lead to cultural differences in the number of words
   recalled. The expected effects of age were apparent with elderly
   recalling less than young, but in contrast to previous studies, elderly
   also categorized less than young. Conclusion: These studies provide
   support for the notion that cultural differences in categorical
   organization are larger for elderly adults than young, although culture
   did not impact the amount recalled. These data suggest that culture and
   age interact to influence cognition.

AB Background. It is commonly assumed that age-related stereotypes are more
   positive in East Asian cultures compared to Western cultures. However,
   research conducted in Western cultures has demonstrated that age-related
   stereotypes are multidimensional and their valence is content-dependent.
   Objective: In this study we investigated stereotypes about young and old
   adults, held by both young and old in the US and in China by focusing on
   the valence of age stereotypes across two content domains:
   social/emotional and mental/physical. The goal was to identify whether
   there were any cultural differences in age-related stereotypes in
   Chinese and American cultures. Methods: Both young and old Chinese and
   American participants were asked to describe typical young and typical
   old people. All responses were then coded for valence
   (positive/negative/neutral) and for content (mental/physical,
   social/emotional, other). Descriptors about young and old people were
   initially analyzed separately; then data were integrated to examine
   group tendencies to be more positive or negative for each target age
   group. Results: In both cultures, stereotypes reflected a shift from
   more positive to increasingly negative views of mental and physical
   traits as a function of aging. In social and emotional domains,
   stereotypes regarding old and young adults were relatively neutral,
   except for a small positive bias found among the young Chinese adults
   for both target age groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that
   age-related beliefs regarding typical older adults are similar across
   East-Asian and Western cultures and that a global positive bias for old
   age in East-Asia is absent.

AB Based on the position that cultural ideologies shape child development,
   many developmental analyses have focused on analyzing cultural
   conceptions of independence and interdependence. Less attention has been
   paid to charting the developmental sequences of children's independent
   and interdependent behavior that are ostensibly shaped by cultural
   conceptions of independence and interdependence. Taking a systems view,
   this paper offers a theoretical framework for conceptualizing
   independence and interdependence as individual behavioral processes that
   recognizes the simultaneous separateness and connectedness of all human
   beings, as well as cultural variability in conceptions of human
   separateness and connectedness. It is also argued that development
   involves the increasing differentiation and integration of multiple and
   inseparable independence and interdependence processes. The theory is
   illustrated empirically with a consideration of attachment formation
   during infancy. This approach provides a cohesive framework for guiding
   developmental analyses of the complexities of children's independent and
   interdependent behavior in varied cultures. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger

AB The literature on globalization and social movements emphasizes the
   ability of international non-governmental organizations to influence
   states and foster domestic social change. This article examines the
   dynamics of this process in an early international movement to combat
   prostitution in the late 1800s. Why did reformers succeed in their goal
   of abolishing the state regulation of prostitution earlier in some
   countries compared to others? A qualitative comparative-historical
   approach is used to outline local social movement dynamics and
   consequent paths to abolition in a subset of European countries (i.e.
   the Netherlands, France and Germany), as influenced by two international
   voluntary associations. The findings show that contestation between the
   associations - one more transnational than the other in practice -
   hampered abolitionist successes. International voluntary associations'
   organization, alliances and cultural framings, as they operated in local
   settings, affected the form of local movements as well as their
   outcomes. Rather than challenging state interests, international
   associations sometimes help to reinforce them.

AB Based on the assumption that sexual minority individuals are
   particularly sensitive to the possible rejection of others, the present
   study examined the occurrence and correlates of social anxiety
   symptomatology in gay and heterosexual men. Eighty-seven heterosexual
   and 87 gay undergraduate men between the ages of 18 and 24 completed
   common measures of social anxiety, self-esteem, boyhood gender
   conformity, and a modified S-R Inventory of Anxiousness. Results reveal
   that gay men reported greater fear of negative evaluation and social
   interaction anxiety and lower self-esteem than heterosexual men. Gay men
   who are less open about their sexual orientation and those who are less
   comfortable with being gay were more likely to experience anxiety in
   social interactions. The modified S-R Inventory of Anxiousness was
   useful in revealing that relatively innocuous situations for
   heterosexual men can be anxiety-provoking for gay men. The hypothesis
   that gay men who were gender nonconforming as children would report a
   higher degree of social interaction anxiety was not supported. Results
   are discussed in terms of the socialization experiences of gay men and
   are explicated using a minority stress framework. Implications are
   offered for the treatment of social anxiety in this population. (c) 2006

AB Objective: To estimate the degree to which the proportion of homicides
   and suicides committed with a gun is associated with reported
   availability of firearms across Chicago neighbourhoods.
   Methods: Data were collected as part of the Project on Human Development
   in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a combined neighbourhood and
   individual level study of the city of Chicago. The study used data from
   837 PHDCN participants between the ages of 17 and 22, residing in 170
   different neighbourhoods. Gun availability was measured via participant
   reports on whether they had carried a gun and whether they perceived gun
   access to be easy in their community. Data on suicides and homicides
   were obtained from the Chicago Department of Health.
   Results: A 10% change in the proportion of homicides committed by a gun
   in a neighbourhood was associated with a 20% increase in both the odds
   of reported gun access and reported gun carrying ( p = 0.002 and 0.048,
   respectively). The proportion of firearm related suicides was not
   associated with either of those self reported measures.
   Conclusions: The proportion of firearm related homicides, but not the
   proportion of firearm related suicides, is a useful predictor of gun
   availability across small areas such as neighbourhoods.

AB BACKGROUND: General internists commonly provide medical care for older
   adults and geriatric education to trainees, but lack the necessary
   knowledge and skills to fulfill these tasks.
   OBJECTIVE: Assess the geriatric training needs of academic general
   internists in 3 hospital systems in Portland, OR.
   DESIGN: Ten focus groups and 1 semi-structured interview. Interview
   transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. a well-recognized
   qualitative technique.
   PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of 22 academic general internists and
   8 geriatricians from 3 different teaching hospitals.
   MEASUREMENTS: We elicited stories of frustration and success in caring
   for elderly patients and in teaching about their care. We asked
   geriatricians to recount their experiences as consultants to general
   internists and to comment on the training of Internists in geriatrics.
   RESULTS: In addition to deficits in their medical knowledge and skills.
   our Internists reported frustration with the process of delivering care
   to older adults. In particular, they felt ill prepared to guide care
   transitions for patients, use multidisciplinary teams effectively. and
   were frustrated with health care system issues. Additionally. general
   internists' approach to medical care, which largely relies on the
   medical model, is different from that of geriatricians, which focuses
   more on social and functional issues.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings may not be broadly representative,
   improving our general internists' abilities to care for the elderly and
   to teach learners how to do the same should address deficits in medical
   knowledge and skills, barriers to the processes of delivering care, and
   philosophical approaches to care. Prioritizing and quantifying these
   needs and measuring the effectiveness of curricula to address them are
   areas for future research.

AB BACKGROUND: Homelessness and hunger are associated with poor health
   outcomes. Housing instability and food insecurity describe less severe
   problems securing housing and food.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between housing instability and
   food insecurity and access to ambulatory health care and rates of acute
   health care utilization.
   DESIGN. Secondary data analysis of the National Survey of American
   Families.
   PARTICIPANTS: 16,651 low-income adults.
   MEASUREMENT: Self-reported measures of past-year access: (1) not having
   a usual source of care, (2) postponing needed medical care. or (3)
   postponing medication; and past-year utilization: (1) not having an
   ambulatory care visit, (2) having emergency department (ED) visits, or
   (3) inpatient hospitalization.
   RESULTS: 23.6% of subjects had housing instability and 42.7% had food
   insecurity. In multivariate logistic regression models, housing
   instability was independently associated with not having a usual source
   of care (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI]
   1.08 to 1.59), postponing needed medical care (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.46 to
   2.31) and postponing medications (AOR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70 to 2.74).
   increased ED use (AOR: 1.43, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.70), and hospitalizations
   (AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.67). Food insecurity was independently
   associated with postponing needed medical care (AOR 1.74. 95% CI 1.38 to
   2.21) and postponing medications (AOR 2.15. 95% CI 1.62 to 2.85),
   increased ED use (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17 to 1.66). and hospitalizations
   (AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.85).
   CONCLUSIONS: Housing instability and food insecurity are associated with
   poor access to ambulatory care and high rates of acute care. These
   competing life demands may lead to delays in seeking care and predispose
   to acute care.

AB There is increasing evidence that racial and ethnic minority patients
   receive lower quality interpersonal care than white patients.
   Therapeutic relationships constitute the interpersonal milieu in which
   patients are diagnosed, given treatment recommendations, and referred
   for tests, procedures, or care by consultants in the health care system.
   This paper provides a review and perspective on the literature that
   explores the role of relationships and social interactions across racial
   and ethnic differences in health care. First, we examine the social and
   historical context for examining differences in interpersonal treatment
   in health care along racial and ethnic lines. Second, we discuss
   selected studies that examine how race and ethnicity influence
   clinician-patient relationships. While less is known about how race and
   ethnicity influence clinician-community, clinician-clinician, and
   clinician-self relationships, we briefly examine the potential roles of
   these relationships in overcoming disparities in health care. Finally,
   we suggest directions for future research on racial and ethnic health
   care disparities that uses a relationship-centered paradigm.

AB This study investigated racial/ethnic preferences, sex preferences, and
   perceived discrimination related to end-of-life care. Ten focus groups
   and a follow-up survey were conducted to obtain in-depth information on
   end-of-life preferences across five racial/ethnic groups in Michigan
   stratified by sex. There were 73 focus group participants, including
   Arab Muslims, Arab Christians, Hispanics, blacks, and whites. The mean
   age +/- standard deviation was 67 +/- 8.5 (range 50-83). A focus group
   screener was used to recruit participants. A moderator discussion guide
   was used to guide the focus groups. A take-home questionnaire asked
   about demographic information and end-of-life issues.
   Arab Americans were in favor of making peace on earth and were against
   assisted suicide, extending life artificially, nursing homes, and
   telling the patient "bad news." Hispanic and black women were against
   assisted suicide and in favor of extending life, whereas the men in
   these groups felt the opposite. Hispanic women spoke of not wanting a
   feeding tube and would consider alternative medicine. Blacks were least
   opposed to nursing homes. For whites, it was important to have choices.
   When asked about discrimination related to end-of-life care, Muslim
   women spoke of cultural barriers, blacks spoke of inequities in the
   past, and whites spoke of age discrimination and abandonment when dying.
   As the population becomes more diverse and continues to age, it will be
   important to provide culturally and sex-sensitive end-of-life
   interventions to increase patient/family satisfaction and allocate
   resources appropriately.

TI African-American community attitudes and perceptions toward

SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
VL 98
IS 1
BP 18
EP 27
PD JAN 2006
PY 2006
AB Introduction: Ensuring adequate representation of all demographic groups
   in medical research is necessary in order to ensure that the benefits
   associated with participation are equitably shared. Mental health
   research is unique in that the stigma associated with mental illness,
   such as schizophrenia, further hinders participation. Using focus
   groups, we set out to explore the attitudes and views of African
   Americans with regard to schizophrenia and medical research.
   Methods: Four focus group discussions were conducted, with 23
   participants divided into two groups of working and retired adults, and
   two groups of full- and part-time students selected from inner-city
   residents of Birmingham, AL, and surrounding counties. Data obtained
   were analyzed using the content analysis method.
   Results: Diverse views were expressed about the cause of mental illness,
   and much of this was influenced by cultural beliefs. There was
   considerable misunderstanding of schizophrenia, and the majority of
   participants described the disease in terms of positive symptoms only.
   Whereas for older participants the Tuskegee syphilis study experience
   was an important factor in their reluctance to participate in medical
   research, younger participants expressed no knowledge of the study.
   Among younger participants an assumed level of social distrust was
   evident, with prominent fear of participating in research that employs
   physically intrusive methods.
   Conclusion: The provision of accurate information through trusted
   community sources and open dialogue will help to dispel myths, correct
   faulty assumptions and increase African-American participation in
   schizophrenia research.

PD JAN 2006
PY 2006
AB Objectives: Hispanic Americans have a substantial need for organ
   transplants and are underrepresented among organ donors, yet very little
   is known about how to increase available donors in this community. This
   study assesses the impact of a Spanish-language media campaign targeting
   organ donation among Hispanic Americans in two urban Arizona counties.
   Methods: The study collected data via four surveys conducted before and
   after implementation of a Spanish-language media campaign targeting
   organ donation among Spanish-dominant Hispanic Americans in Pima and
   Maricopa counties in Arizona. The main intervention consisted of four
   Spanish-language television advertisements and two Spanish-language
   radio advertisements.
   Results: The media campaign was successfully implemented and attained
   substantial exposure among the target audience. Postintervention beliefs
   were more prodonation, and there was more family discussion
   postintervention. In both counties, residents exposed to the campaign
   reported more prodonation beliefs and family discussion. Exposed
   Maricopa residents were also more likely to be potential donors.
   Conclusions: Study data indicate a positive impact of a media campaign
   targeting organ donation beliefs and behaviors among Spanish-dominant
   Hispanic Americans in Arizona. It is hoped that these findings will
   stimulate further research in this important area.

AB Purpose - To present the contributions of sociocybernetics, particularly
   as developed by Felix Geyer, and to compare sociocybernetics; with
   social entropy theory (SET).
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper first outlines the problems
   with earlier approaches, and then briefly discusses the four approaches
   constituting the "new" social systems theory: sociocybernetics,
   social-autopoiesis theory, living systems theory (LST), and SET. Next
   the six chief contributions of sociocybernetics are discussed. Then
   sociocybernetics is compared with SET. The paper ends with a brief
   comparison of Geyer's sociocybernetics with the other two new
   approaches, social autopoiesis and LST.
   Findings - Sociocybernetics is found to be a context-specific,
   observer-dependent approach that relies heavily on second-order
   cybernetics. The comparison of sociocybernetics with SET also finds that
   the latter complements the former in valuable ways. Geyer's approach to
   sociocybernetics is also found to be compatible with both social
   autopoiesis and LST.
   Practical implications - A very useful source of information for
   scholars interested in the comparative analysis of the new
   social-systems theory.
   Originality/value - This paper provides the first comparison of
   sociocybernetics with the other new social-systems theories - SET,
   social autopoiesis, and LST. It clearly shows the value of Geyer's
   approach to sociocybernetics. It is valuable to all scholars interested
   in modem social-systems theory. Sociocybernetics will be recognized as
   one of the great theoretical contributions of twentieth century
   sociology. It will also be forever linked with the names of its
   principal founders, Geyer and van der Zouwen. The numerous contributions
   of sociocybernetics are all the more impressive when it is recognized
   that they were made against a backdrop of widespread misunderstanding,
   mistrust, and outright rejection of its precursor approaches in social
   systems theory.

AB Purpose - To conceptualize a new approach to economic development that
   fully embraces its fractal complexity, providing a basis for sustained
   socioeconomic welfare within cultures that encourage collaborative
   democracy and social learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - Following the premise that healthy
   development must follow the natural laws of growth that apply to all
   ecosystems, the paper examines fractal intricacy as the basis of
   economic systems that are able to sustain sufficient flows of energy and
   information to all sub-systems. Two methodological approaches that
   emerge for planning are called hierarchical (fractal) coherence and
   fractal connectivity. The first refers to sufficient density and variety
   of nodes (firms, economic processes, customers, etc.) at all scales in
   the hierarchy of an economic system; and the second denotes multiple
   paths of connection between the nodes, to handle the necessary flows.
   Findings - This approach highlights the fundamental importance of
   locally-based entrepreneurship and democratic control, and also suggests
   new methods for measuring system interconnectedness at all scales,
   supplementing economic growth measures such as GDP.
   Research limitations/implications - The paper indicates the need for
   empirical research to calibrate and further refine the approach in
   real-world settings.
   Practical implications - The paper outlines a fresh planning strategy
   for dealing with the geometrically worsening dimensions of uneven
   economic development and poverty, at all levels of scale from the local
   to the global.
   Originality/value - The paper articulates a viable cybernetic
   alternative to prevailing economic development approaches that are based
   on the neo-classical, neo-liberal, and neo-conservative models embodied
   in our present system of economic globalization.

   some aspects of existing analytical approaches in historical sociology
   and comparative politics to elucidate our understanding of the role and

   preferred, typical leisure activities were then identified by consulting
   lists of common leisure activities, surveying adults in surrounding
   communities, and interviewing support staff and family members. Next,
   in-home staffs were trained to provide the identified leisure activities
   in a repeated, paired-choice manner. Results indicated increased leisure
   engagement for each participant when staff provided leisure choices
   along with brief prompting. Social validation surveys Suggested the
   choice procedures were well received by the staff and participants.
   Comparison observations of nine adults in other SIL arrangements in two
   states indicated the low levels of engagement initially observed in the
   three target homes may be quite common among people with severe
   disabilities in SIL. Results are discussed regarding use of behavioral
   procedures to evaluate and improve aspects of quality of life in SIL.

   failed attempts provide invaluable data on the necessary underpinnings
   of online commodity markets and the social dynamics that drive them.
   Focusing on the US market for propane as our case, we discuss the model
   that drove the development of many business-to-business exchanges, the
   social dynamics of the propane industry and the attempts to create an
   online propane market, the role of informal risk management, and some
   initial lessons about the design of markets. Ignoring the behavioral
   realities of markets led to designs and technology that in many cases

AB The idea of social character has a long and important history within
   sociological thought. The concept addresses the fundamental question of
   the relationship between society and the individual, structure and
   agency. Tracing the development of the idea of social character from the
   classical sociology of Marx and Weber to more contemporary writings
   within American sociology by figures such as Fromm, Reisman, and Mills
   reveals ideas and perspectives central to the development of social
   theory. Although many argue that the idea of social character is no
   longer important in sociology, it has in fact resurfaced in Pierre
   Bourdieu's notion of habitus. Habitus specifies the original idea of
   social character without the biological or essentialist traits found in
   most of the earlier work. Habitus marks a substantial advance beyond
   earlier ideas of social character, providing a more purely sociological
   answer to the structure/agency (society/individual) problematic. (c)

AB This paper provides a recent profile of the gender and race-ethnicity of
   faculty in top research departments of economics, political science, and
   sociology. Most faculty are male, although there appear to be critical
   masses of women in political science and sociology. Blacks and Hispanics
   are underrepresented among faculty relative to their shares of the
   population. Within each racial-ethnic group examined, there are more
   male than female faculty members, with a smaller gender gap for Blacks
   than for other racial-ethnic groups. In general, the higher the rank,
   the greater the proportion of males than females, especially for Whites
   and Asians. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This address is a retrospective of the past 25 years of Sociological
   Spectrum, journal of the Mid South Sociological Association (MSSA). It
   is divided into three sections: some descriptive notes, a brief
   examination of challenges presented by previous MSSA presidents, and my
   recommendations for considerations of gender and globalization that I
   hope will appear in future research published in the journal. The
   descriptive notes contain a discussion of who publishes in Spectrum,
   what topical themes are found in the publications, and a brief
   consideration of how these themes reflect sociology as a whole, and
   particularly the MSSA. In the section on challenges, I discuss
   recommendations and concerns from past presidential addresses and
   whether or not subsequent research has "listened" to the presidents. The
   final section is a brief consideration of how gender is being defined
   within much of current sociological research and some recommendations
   for moving beyond these definitions, including integration with concepts
   of race and globalization.

AB This paper examines the articulation of goals and means of sociological
   instruction in course syllabi. Three questions guide this inquiry.
   First, do sociology instructors articulate common learning goals? Second
   what pedagogical means do instructors commonly employ to meet these
   goals? Third to what extent have sociology instructors incorporated the
   recommendations presented in Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major
   (Eberts et al. 1990) and in its updated version (McKinney et al. 2004)?
   To answer these questions, we analyzed syllabi from 418 courses
   published by the American Sociological Association's Teaching Resource
   Center. We found that aside from course-specific goals, most syllabi
   shared only a few general, abstract goals in common. The pedagogical
   methods or requirements of students tended to be fairly traditional
   (readings, writing, and exams). Requirements that required more active
   types of learning were less common. While these goals and means do seem
   to reflect what sociologists consider to be important, they do not
   correspond closely to the American Sociological Associations Taskforce
   on the Undergraduate Major's recommendations for the sociology major.

AB Sociologists can make meaningful contributions to quantitative literacy
   by teaching sociological research skills in sociology classes, including
   introductory courses. We report on the effectiveness of requiring a
   research module in a large introductory class. The module is designed to
   teach both basic research skills and to increase awareness of race and
   gender inequality. We find that a majority of students are able to
   interpret basic percentage tables with a minimum of instruction. Under
   the condition that students are willing to acknowledge inequality in our
   occupational system, completing the research assignment increases their
   awareness of race and gender inequality. We argue that one of
   sociology's most powerful contributions to quantitative literacy is that
   our core content provides a challenging and relevant context in which to
   learn quantitative skills.

AB Santiago, Chile's semi-arid climate arid urbanized environment poses a
   severe limitation for the establishment and maintenance of urban
   forests. Municipalities, or comunas, are the main stakeholders in the
   management of Santiago's public Urban forests. A tenable hypothesis
   would be that as the socioeconomic level of a comuna increases, the
   better the condition of a comuna's urban forest. Unfortunately, there is
   little comprehensive information on management, public expenditure, arid
   structure of Santiago's public arid private urban forests. To examine
   this hypothesis, Santiago was divided into socioeconomic strata, then
   using air photo interpretation and stratified field sampling, urban
   forest structures were quantified by socioeconomic strata. In addition,
   interview surveys were used to determine municipal urban forest
   management arid expenditures for different public urban forests based on
   socioeconomic strata. Urban forests in the high socioeconomic strata had
   fewer public trees, greater tree cover, tree arid leaf area density, and
   leaf area index than lower socioeconomic strata. The percentage of total
   municipal budget allocated to public urban forest management was
   consistent among strata, but the total public urban forest budgets were
   greater in the high socioeconomic strata. Public urban forest structure
   is related to the socioeconomic strata of Santiago's different comunas.

AB Evacuation of rural communities threatened by wildfires is occurring
   more often, particularly in the western United States. Residents, public
   safety officials, community leaders, and public land managers are facing
   the issues and problems of this news experience. We used semi-structured
   interviews to elicit the evacutation experience from the viewpoint of
   evacuees and public safety officials in three case studies of wildfire
   evacuations in the western United States during 2000 and 2002. (Our
   interviews were conducted only with Teller County, residents and
   officials.) We identify and describe the stages of the evacuation
   process as experienced by evacuees, and the dynamics and dilemmas
   associated with each stage. We analyze these perceptions and dynamics
   using the sociological lenses of social construction of meaning and
   structuration. The results indicate that evacuees and public safety
   officials have different perceptions and concerns about the evacuation
   process. We derive lessons learned from these three cases for use in
   planning future wildfire ejacuations.

   Design College students practised pouring alcohol into a standard glass
   before pouring into larger glasses; bartenders poured alcohol for four
   mixed drinks either with no instructions or after being told to take
   their time.
   Setting University town and large city, United States.
   Participants 198 college Students and 86 bartenders.
   Main outcome measures Volume of alcohol poured into short, wide and
   tall, slender glasses.
   Results Aiming to pour a "shot" of alcohol (1.5 ounces, 44.3 ml), both
   students and bartenders Poured more into short, wide glasses than into
   tall slender glasses (46.1 ml v 44.7 ml and 54.6 ml v 46.4 ml,
   respectively). Practice reduced the tendency to overpour, but not for
   short, wide glasses. Despite an average of six years of experience,
   bartenders poured 20.5% more into short, wide glasses than tall, slender
   ones; paying careful attention reduced but did not eliminate the effect.
   Conclusions To avoid overpouring, use tall, narrow glasses or ones on
   which the alcohol level is premarked. To avoid underestimating die
   amount Of alcohol consumed, studies using self reports of standard
   drinks should ask about the shape of the glass.

   television programme that may promote or inhibit health related or risky
   behaviours.
   Design Coding visual and verbal references to alcohol, tobacco, and
   other drug (ATOD) use in The Osbournes.
   Review methods Three reviewers watched all 10 episodes of the first
   season and coded incidents of substance use according to die substance
   used (alcohol, tobacco, or drugs), the way use was portrayed (visually
   or verbally), the source of the message (the character in the show
   involved in the incident), and the slant of the incident (endorsement or
   rejection).
   Main outcome measures The variation in number of messages in an average
   episode, the slant of messages, and message source.
   Results The average number of messages per episode was 9.1 (range 2-17).
   Most drug use messages (15, 54%) implied rejection of drugs, but most
   alcohol messages (30, 64%) and tobacco messages (12, 75%) implied
   endorsements for using these substances. Most rejections (34, 94%) were
   conveyed verbally, but most endorsements (36, 65%) were conveyed
   Visually. Messages varied in frequency and slant by source.
   Conclusions The reality television show analysed in this study contains
   numerous messages on Substance use that imply both rejection and
   endorsement Of use. The juxtaposition of verbal rejection messages and
   visual endorsement messages, and the depiction of contradictory messages
   about substance use from show characters, may send mixed messages to
   viewers about substance use.

AB Biosocial models are preeminent in the study of schizophrenia, yet there
   has been little empirical testing of these models.
   Objective: This study provided the first test of a biosocial causal
   model of functional outcome in schizophrenia, using neurocognition,
   social cognition, social competence and social support as predictors of
   both global and specific domains of functional outcome.
   Method: The design used baseline variables to predict both concurrent
   functional status and prospective 12-month functional outcome. Subjects
   were recruited upon admission to outpatient community-based psychosocial
   rehabilitation programs shown in previous studies to be effective in
   improving functional outcomes. 139 individuals diagnosed with
   schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder participated in the study; 100
   participants completed the 12-month assessments. Face-to-face interviews
   assessed neurocognitive functioning (with five neuropsychological
   measures), social cognition (as perception of emotion), social
   competence, social support, and functional outcome which consisted of
   items coveting the domains of social, independent living, and work
   functioning.
   Results: Path analysis modeling showed that the proposed biosocial
   models had strong fit with the data, for both concurrent and 12-month
   global functional outcomes, with fit indices ranging from .95 to .98.
   The model explained 21% of the variance in concurrent global functional
   outcome, and 14% of the variance in 12-month prospective outcome.
   Conclusions: The support for this model was strong, and it has
   implications for understanding the causal factors related to functional
   outcome, as well as for intervention strategies for improving functional
   outcomes in schizophrenia. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Problems with measuring socioeconomic status (SES-frequently included in
   clinical and public health studies as a control variable and less
   frequently as the variable(s) of main interest-could affect research
   findings and conclusions, with implications for practice and policy. We
   critically examine standard SES measurement approaches, illustrating
   problems with examples from new analyses and the literature. For
   example, marked racial/ethnic differences in income at a given
   educational level and in wealth at a given income level raise questions
   about the socioeconomic comparability of individuals who are similar on
   education or income alone. Evidence also shows that conclusions about
   nonsocioeconomic causes of racial/ethnic differences in health may
   depend on the measure eg, income, wealth, education, occupation,
   neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, or past socioeconomic
   experiences-used to "control for SES," suggesting that findings from
   studies that have measured limited aspects of SES should be reassessed.
   We recommend an outcome- and social group-specific approach to SES
   measurement that involves (1) considering plausible explanatory pathways
   and mechanisms, (2) measuring as much relevant socioeconomic information
   as possible, (3) specifying the particular socioeconomic factors
   measured (rather than SES overall), and (4) systematically considering
   how potentially important unmeasured socioeconomic factors may affect
   conclusions. Better SES measures are needed in data sources, but
   improvements could be made by using existing information more
   thoughtfully and acknowledging its limitations.

   2 sources of social support (coparents and friends/neighbors) among
   low-income African American single mothers. Mothers' ratings of
   neighborhood violence were associated with monitoring both concurrently
   and longitudinally; however, this association was qualified by each
   source of social support. When neighborhood violence is perceived as
   being high by mothers, high levels of social support from coparents and
   from friends and neighbors are associated with more maternal monitoring.
   The findings point to the importance of understanding the social context

AB Objective: To explore the prevalence and correlates of maternal

   screened for anxiety before hospital discharge with the State-Trait
   Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Recent medical and social life events, stress,
   resiliency (mastery, social support, and marital satisfaction), length
   of stay, discharge readiness, anticipatory medical care, and history of
   psychiatric illness and depression were assessed by questionnaire and
   medical record review. Results: 24.9% of mothers had moderate and 1%
   severe anxiety. Higher anxiety was observed among young, unmarried,
   primiparous mothers with male infants, and anxiety correlated with
   medical and negative social life events, stress, history of depression,
   and duration of postpartum stay. Inverse correlations were observed with
   maternal education and household income, pregnancy planning, prenatal
   class attendance, infant healthcare provider identification, and with
   all resiliency factors. In multivariate models, pre-discharge anxiety
   was significantly associated with medical life events and the maternal
   perception of perinatal stress, and negatively associated with mastery,
   marital satisfaction, and choice of infant healthcare provider.
   Conclusion: Moderate maternal anxiety is common prior to perinatal
   hospital discharge, especially among women with low mastery and marital
   satisfaction, stressful perinatal courses, and failure to identify an
   infant healthcare provider.

AB Background: Fundamental limitations have hampered conclusions
   surrounding acculturation's effects among Latinos. This research
   re-examines associations between acculturation and alcohol use,
   addressing the most troubling of these limitations. The research also
   explores mediators of the association, and the dimensional structure of
   acculturation.
   Methods: Linear regressions and scale analyses were used to analyze data
   from Latino adults in the U.S. (825 women, 761 men) sampled in the 1995
   National Alcohol Survey. Analyses used a standard, reliable
   acculturation scale and well-validated drinking measures; systematically
   accounted for demographic covariates; and analyzed men and women
   separately.
   Results: As expected, higher acculturation was positively associated
   with a higher probability of drinking (vs. abstinence) among women, and
   higher average volumes and more frequent drunkenness among female
   drinkers. Acculturation was unrelated to alcohol use among men. Also as
   expected, mediational analyses of average volume supported expectations
   that gender-specific drinking norms would mediate acculturation's
   effects (though norms did not explain acculturation's associations with
   either drinking status or frequency of drunkenness). Analyses
   investigating depressive symptoms showed no support for the
   acculturationstress model. Factor analyses of the acculturation scale
   supported the hypothesized distinctions between linguistic
   acculturation, attitudinal acculturation, and the social environment of
   acculturation. Further, items implying more intimate exposure to Anglo
   culture (i.e., language use) were most strongly related to drinking
   outcomes among women, supporting the normative interpretation of
   acculturation's effects on drinking.
   Conclusions: Results underline acculturation's influence on alcohol
   consumption among Latina women, and highlight the role of drinking norms
   in mediating this association. Results also suggest a multidimensional
   view of acculturation. The article recommends further research on
   drinking norms and other potential mediators of acculturation's effects
   among Latina women.

AB Background: Recent serious alcohol-related events have raised public
   awareness of the prevalence of at-risk alcohol use among college
   undergraduates, but heavy alcohol consumption during late adolescence
   and young adulthood is not limited to college students. Alcohol
   consumption typically peaks in young adulthood regardless of education
   level, and risks related to alcohol misuse are shared by young adults,
   regardless of their educational choices. Differences in alcohol risk
   between college-attending and non-college-attending young adults are
   generally small, and emphasize the need for research examining the
   drinking patterns of both of these groups.
   Methods: To better understand patterns of at-risk alcohol use and its
   association with education, this study compared at-risk alcohol use from
   12(th) grade to young adulthood (age 24) in a sample of never-married
   young adults. Three groups were formed based on completed education when
   the survey was administered in young adulthood: high school or less,
   postsecondary education without a four-year college degree, and
   completed college.
   Results: Men who completed college experienced the greatest increase in
   at-risk drinking from grade 12 to young adulthood; however, their
   at-risk alcohol use did not differ markedly from men in the other
   education groups in young adulthood. Men who did not complete college
   had high levels of alcohol risk in 12(th) grade and maintained or
   increased those levels in young adulthood, demonstrating a pattern of
   prolonged risk. Women whose completed education was high school or less
   experienced the fewest increases in at-risk alcohol use. Education group
   differences were not explained by place of residence or employment
   status.
   Conclusions: These results emphasize the need to intervene early to
   prevent at-risk alcohol use, and emphasize that at-risk alcohol use is
   neither unique, nor necessarily the highest among individuals who
   complete college.

AB A conceptual model of the relationship between well-known
   individual-level behavioral and biomedical risk factors for heart
   disease and stroke and community-level social environmental risk
   factors, which may be less familiar to professionals working in
   cardiovascular health promotion, is presented. The social environment
   paradigm holds that programs and interventions should focus "upstream"
   and attempt to directly modify social environmental conditions in order
   to positively influence human behaviors, and consequently disability and
   disease. For each of the "big five" cardiovascular risk factors (poor
   diet, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, high blood pressure, and
   high blood cholesterol), social environmental barriers and promoters are
   described. This conceptual model should be a useful tool in explaining
   and justifying the ways in which social environmental change can improve
   risk factor distributions for entire populations, and subsequently
   reduce disability and death from heart disease and stroke.

AB Why do countries differ so much in the extent to which they adopt
   neoliberal, market-oriented reform in their infrastructure industries?
   Building on world-society and neo-institutional theories in sociology,
   this paper argues that international pressures of coercion, normative
   emulation, and competitive mimicry strongly influence the domestic
   adoption of market-oriented reform. The paper considers the effect of
   such pressures on the adoption of four reform elements: the
   privatization of state-owned firms, the formal separation of the
   regulatory authority from the executive branch, the de facto elimination
   of executive political influence on the regulatory authority, and the
   opening of the retail market to multiple service providers. It finds
   generally robust support for its arguments using a multivariate probit
   analysis of reform adoption in the telecommunications and electricity
   industries of as many as 71 countries and territories between 1977 and
   1999. The results also suggest that the coercive effect of lending by
   the IMF and World Bank differs for each reform element. The paper
   discusses the possibility that, by leading countries to adopt some
   reform elements but not others, international coercion may not produce
   ideal outcomes.

PD DEC 2005
PY 2005
AB Drawing insights from the ethnographies in the natural sciences, which
   have focused on the role of technical instruments in laboratory
   practices, this article asks, "What role do technical instruments play
   in the humanities?" Editions of La Comedie humaine, written by Honore de
   Balzac, are taken as a case study. Primarily based on ethnographic
   research with Balzac scholars, this article traces the evolution of
   Balzac text from a unified and unadorned text in the 1930s, to a single
   annotated text in the critical edition of the 1970s, and to a searchable
   electronic format of different versions. The author shows that the
   different schools of interpretation in Balzac criticism (traditional,
   semioticians, socio-critics) constructed these diverse editing
   technologies to influence the evolution of literary theories. For
   instance, traditional scholars' theory of authorship entertains en
   elective affinity with the critical edition of La Comedie humaine.
   Socio-critics challenged its assumptions and constructed electronic
   editions to develop their own theories, particularly on the genesis and
   reception of Balzac texts. By focusing on the epistemic cultures in
   which research practices are embedded, this case study complements
   purely institutionalist perspectives on knowledge-production in the
   academic field and highlights the presence of diverse epistemic cultures
   in literary criticism.

AB This article gauges the progress that sociologists of gender and

   examining four recent monographs that have utilized aspects of queer
   theory in their empirical work: Rupp and Taylor (2003), Seidman (2002),
   Bettie (2003), and Schippers (2000). The article uses the insights of
   queer theory to push the monographs in art even "queerer" theoretical
   direction. This direction involves taking more seriously the
   nonnormative alignments of sex, gender sexuality, resisting the tendency
   to essentialize identity or conflate it with the broad range of gender
   and sexual expression and treating the construction of intersectional
   subjectivities as both performed and performative in nature. The
   analysis of these texts also insists that a queer sociological theory
   situate its emphasis on discursive power more firmly in economic,
   political, and other institutional processes. Ethnographic methods are
   proposed as the most useful way of combining queer theory with
   sociological analysis.

AB Introduction. In partnership with ail African American church, we
   developed an educational booklet on breast cancer early detection from
   within a spiritual framework. This booklet included religious themes and
   biblical scripture supporting the early detection message, for women
   ages 40 and over to have regular mammograms.
   Methods. The spiritually based booklet was compared against a
   demographically targeted booklet (for African American women, but with
   no spiritual or religious content) for communication effectiveness. One
   hundred and eight African American women were randomly assigned to read
   one of the booklets and complete a series of questionnaires about the
   booklet.
   Results. Both those in the spiritually based and the secular groups
   reported significant increases in knowledge about breast cancer
   treatment and decrease in perceived barriers to mammography. Those in
   the spiritually based group additionally increased knowledge about
   mammograms.
   Conclusions. This small study suggests that spiritually based approaches
   may be more effective than secular based. Our future studies will
   explore these and other spiritually based interventions in larger sample
   sizes of patients. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   addition we explore other forms of ecological dominance in regard to
   perceptions of fishing dependence. A key idea is that residents and
   sometimes researchers confuse forms of ecological dominance with
   economic dependence. Our study relied upon secondary and key informant
   data for six Florida coastal communities. In addition, we conducted a

AB Environmental history is a multidisciplinary enterprise united by shared
   interests in ecological change and the complex interactions between
   people and the environment. Its practitioners include expertise in the
   natural sciences, ill history or archaeology, or in political ecology
   and related social sciences; but there is no agreement on a common
   agenda and limited success in bridging methodological and
   epistemological divisions that impede integrative and interdisciplinary
   research. World-systems history and environmental history also have
   overlapping interests in long-term change and matters of sustainability.
   The Mediterranean world sustained agricultural lifeways across some 8000
   years, yet its environment has repeatedly been described as degraded,
   suggesting conceptual confusion between transformation and destruction.
   This paper is didactic in purpose and uses landscape histories for the
   Peloponnese and eastern Spain to show that the impact of recurrent,
   excessive precipitation events and of reduced quality of land cover are
   difficult to unravel, because they commonly appear to work in tandem. As
   a result (a) environmental change cannot be assumed or "predicted", but
   must be studied inductively by experts with science skills, and (b)
   cause-and-effect relationships demand an understanding of ecological
   behavior, for which humanistic insights are indispensable. Social
   science models highlight systemic relationships from socioeconomic and
   structural perspectives., but are less suited to deal with the
   complexity of environmental change or the contingencies exemplified by
   human resilience. Near Eastern.. Greek and Roman agronomic writings
   offer elite "voices" that speak to cumulative technological change,
   scientific understanding, and the context of intensification. Rural
   voices can be heard through ethnography, and in eastern Spain are
   extended into the past by archaeology and archival research. In the
   absence of structural constraints, they reveal collective
   decision-making with respect to a shifting repertoire of agricultural
   strategies that take into account market opportunities, demographic
   growth, finite resources and environmental problems. Such adaptability
   spells resilience, and "good farming" is culturally embedded as a civic
   responsibility, both in the ethnographic present and in the older, elite
   agronomic writings. But if the "moral economy" erodes in the wake of
   food stress, tax extortion, instability, insecurity, or ideological
   oppression, there is little incentive to pursue long-term strategies, so
   that behavior focuses on short-term survival. The context for this
   dialectic of poor versus good ecological management may be structural,
   but cause-and-effect in the traditional Mediterranean world ultimately
   depended on ecological and human resilience. Long-term sustainability is
   similarly non-predictive. It depends on people, rather than social
   theory. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Study objective: To test whether college youth smoking risks are
   independently associated with community patterns of alcohol availability
   and control.
   Design: Hierarchical multilevel multivariable modelling of cross
   sectional survey data. Outcomes included self reported current (past 30
   day) cigarette smoking and heavy episodic (binge) drinking.
   Setting: 120 nationally representative US colleges.
   Participants: 10 924 randomly selected students.
   Main results: Individual risks for smoking and binge drinking are
   independently associated with community patterns of alcohol
   availability, policy enforcement and control over and above individual
   perceptions about these factors, student and college characteristics,
   and school binge drinking rates. Youth exposed to high levels of alcohol
   availability are at higher risk of smoking (OR 3.61, 95% CI 1.75, 7.44)
   and binge drinking (OR 4.22, 95% CI 2.25, 7.93) than youth not so
   exposed; youth exposed to strongly enforced alcohol policy environments
   are at lower risk for smoking (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.16, 0.57) and binge
   drinking (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.10, 0.31) than youth not so exposed; youth
   exposed to communities with strong parental controls are at lower risk
   for smoking (OR 0.05, 95% CI 0.01, 0.23) and binge drinking (OR 0.06,
   95% CI 0.01, 0.21) than youth not so exposed. Individual risks related
   to environmental exposures differ for youth with varying perceptions
   about alcohol availability and policy control.
   Conclusions: Drinking environments in US college communities comprise
   strong independent risks for smoking. Smoking prevention models should
   be tested that include environmental drinking prevention strategies
   tailored to underlying perceptions and experiences of college youth.

AB Background: Detailed information regarding the work history of heart
   transplant patients is limited. Therefore, the work history and factors
   associated with return to work at 1 year after heart transplantation
   were examined in 237 heart transplant patients as pan of a longitudinal
   quality-of-life study at two university medical centers. Patient
   characteristics were as follows: 81% male; 89% white; mean age 54 years
   (range 24 to 71); mean level of education 13 years; and 84% were
   married.
   Methods: Data were collected using the following instruments: Work
   History tool; Rating Question Form; Heart Transplant Stressor Scale;
   Quality of Life Index; Sickness Impact Profile; Jalowiec Coping Scale;
   Social Support Index; Heart Transplant Symptom Checklist; and Chart
   Review Form. Frequency distributions, chi-square, t-tests and stepwise
   regression were used to examine the work history of patients.
   Results: Pre-transplant, only 17% of patients were working as compared
   with 26% (61 of 237) working by I year after transplant (p = 0.003).
   Pre-transplant non-working patients (n = 197) were hospitalized more
   frequently, were more physically disabled, had more symptom distress,
   and rated their health as poorer. After heart transplant non-working
   patients (n = 176) had more rejection, infection and medical
   complications and more hospital days. Patients who were working either
   pre- or post-transplant were more likely to hold jobs that were less
   physically demanding. Factors significantly associated with return to
   work by 1 year after heart transplant were better functional ability,
   higher education, fewer endocrine problems, fewer acute rejection
   episodes and shorter heart transplant waiting time.
   Conclusions: Clinical and demographic variables influence return to work
   after heart transplantation. Knowledge of these variables provides the
   health-care team with information to assist patients in securing gainful
   employment.

AB This article analyzes nongovernmental organization (NGO) "market
   campaigns" that seek to motivate changes in global consumption and
   production patterns. Through campaigns targeting products as diverse as
   paper, shoes, and computers, advocacy groups seek to use existing
   concerns of consumers to influence producers, and simultaneously, to
   expand and deepen consumer demand for more sustainable products and
   services. NGOs deploy both negative information to critique leading
   brands, and positive information to help build new markets for improved
   products. Successful market campaigns construct networks of actors that
   identify points of leverage within global production and trading
   -egimes; coordinate research, exposure, direct action, and negotiations
   with brands; identify solutions; advance new multi-stakeholder standards
   and monitoring and certification schemes; build new nongovernmental
   regulatory institutions; and occasionally attempt to strengthen state
   regulation. Through an assessment of three market campaigns focused on
   Staples, Nike, and Dell, this article describes the nature of these
   campaigns, discusses how they function, assesses their central
   strategies and tactics, and they are actually having an impact. The
   article concludes by discussing the relevance and implications of these
   campaigns for the field of industrial ecology, and how industrial
   ecology might support future efforts to advance more sustainable

AB This article summarizes results from a survey on social-contextual risk

   students. Retrospective alcohol use was a primary predictor for
   prospective heavy alcohol use and drinking game participation was a
   primary predictor for prospective alcohol occurrences, while
   social-contextual factors were primary predictors for prospective drug
   use. Primary and secondary predictors differed for prospective alcohol
   severity, alcohol frequency and drug use, suggesting that there are
   specific risk factors associated with each type of drinking and
   drug-using pattern. There were also significant differences in monthly
   over-the-counter medication, prescription medication and drug use among
   students who participated in drinking games, collegiate sports, and
   Greek organizations. These results suggest that students who have
   experimented with alcohol and drug use prior to entering college may be
   more likely to engage in social and recreational activities where
   alcohol and drugs are available; therefore college prevention programs
   should focus on increasing alternative activities to deter alcohol and
   drug use.

AB Although experiences of racism in day-to-day life may affect minority
   patients' interaction with the health system and may influence health
   outcomes, little is known about these experiences in patients with
   chronic diseases. The goal of this study was to explore the frequency
   and correlates of perceived societal racism in 42 African Americans aged
   50 and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   Twenty-seven items of the McNeilly Perceived Racism Scale were used to
   assess exposure to racist incidents in employment and public domains and
   emotional and coping responses to perceived racism in general. Mean age
   was 62, 71% were women, and more than half rated their health as
   fair/poor (55%). Overall, 95.2% of the participants reported at least
   some exposure to perceived societal racism. Higher mean lifetime
   exposure to societal racism, based on summary scores on the perceived
   racism scale, was reported by men (35.0 +/- 19.1) than women (19.7 +/-
   14.4) (P <.01) and by those with higher household income (30.7 +/- 17.3)
   than those with lower household income (18.6 +/- 15.1) (P <.05). Greater
   passive coping (e.g., "avoiding it," "ignoring it") was associated with
   being female and having lower household income and fair/poor self-rated
   health.
   The findings that perception of racism and a range of emotional and
   coping responses were common in older African-American patients
   attending two diabetes clinics suggest that physicians and other
   healthcare providers may need to be more aware of patients' day-to-day
   experiences of societal racism and the influence these experiences may

AB The purpose of this research is to use Census data to examine trends in
   employment and the foreign-born among Ohio's largest cities between 1940
   and 2000. The observed trends are linked to economic changes in the
   cities. In 1940, many Ohio cities attracted significant numbers of
   foreign-born due to job opportunities in manufacturing. However, since
   1940, employment and spatial restructuring has eroded the manufacturing
   base of most Ohio cities, making them less appealing to the newer
   immigrant streams. Another change is that Columbus has overshadowed
   Cleveland as the primary location of the foreign-born population since
   1940. Columbus is now more attractive to immigrants because it has a
   greater concentration of jobs in the growing service and information
   employment sectors than does Cleveland. Columbus' large foreign-born
   population is also partly due to the refugee resettlement policies of
   the US government, especially in the case of Somalis. Columbus is now
   the second largest center of Somalis in the US. Ohio cities' ability to
   attract immigrants, who are critical to population and economic growth,
   depends on the cities' ability to nurture industries that will generate
   the jobs that will draw immigrants. in addition, some researchers
   believe that amenities, such as cafes, museums, and diversity, are
   critical to attract migrants, both domestic and foreign-born. Thus,
   investments in the cultural environment and human talent cannot be
   overlooked.

AB Objective. Despite voluntary restrictions prohibiting direct and
   indirect cigarette marketing to youth and paid product placement,
   tobacco use remains prevalent in movies. This article presents a
   systematic review of the evidence on the nature and effect of smoking in
   the movies on adolescents ( and others).
   Methodology. We performed a comprehensive literature review.
   Results. We identified 40 studies. Smoking in the movies decreased from
   1950 to similar to 1990 and then increased rapidly. In 2002, smoking in
   movies was as common as it was in 1950. Movies rarely depict the
   negative health outcomes associated with smoking and contribute to
   increased perceptions of smoking prevalence and the benefits of smoking.
   Movie smoking is presented as adult behavior. Exposure to movie smoking
   makes viewers' attitudes and beliefs about smoking and smokers more
   favorable and has a dose-response relationship with adolescent smoking
   behavior. Parental restrictions on R-rated movies significantly reduces
   youth exposure to movie smoking and subsequent smoking uptake. Beginning
   in 2002, the total amount of smoking in movies was greater in
   youth-rated ( G/PG/PG-13) films than adult-rated ( R) films,
   significantly increasing adolescent exposure to movie smoking. Viewing
   antismoking advertisements before viewing movie smoking seems to blunt
   the stimulating effects of movie smoking on adolescent smoking.
   Conclusions. Strong empirical evidence indicates that smoking in movies
   increases adolescent smoking initiation. Amending the movie-rating
   system to rate movies containing smoking as "R" should reduce adolescent
   exposure to smoking and subsequent smoking.

AB Straw men play a major role in the debate over racial disparity in
   American medicine. Most have been deployed by the disparities-denying
   right, but progressives intent on "outing" racism have sent forth their
   share. This essay flushes out the straw men while attempting to
   understand the competing moral premises that drive the politics of
   health care disparity. At bottom, arguments about the scope of disparity
   and discrimination in medical care are disputes about the appropriate
   scope of personal responsibility for life circumstances. Further
   research into the factors that correlate with racial differences in
   health care can shed light on the circumstances that bring about these
   differences. Whether these circumstances, once understood, should be
   deemed acceptable is a moral and political matter, and sharp differences
   over the scope of personal and public responsibility for these
   circumstances are inevitable. Such disagreements, however, distract us
   from efforts to reach common ground solutions to agreed-upon inequities
   in health care.

   connection to second-order causal claims. I explain how mechanisms can
   resolve this difficulty, but argue that this does not provide support
   for methodological individualism since it is not necessary that the

   just a consequence of social interactions that occur under these

AB If feminists argue for the irreducibility of the social dimensions of
   science, then they ought to embrace the idea that feminist and
   non-feminist scientists are not in collaboration, but in fact defend
   different interests. Instead, however, contemporary feminist science
   studies literature argues that feminist research improves particular,
   existing scientific enterprises, both epistemically (truer claims) and
   politically (more democratic methodologies and applications). I argue
   that the concepts of empirical success and democracy at work in this
   literature from Longino (1994) and Harding (1996), to Longino (2002),
   Gilbert and Rader(2001), and Keller(2001) are not sufficiently critical,
   and fail to do justice to the truly revolutionary work done by feminist
   scientists. I offer the beginnings of an epistemology of dissensus (as
   opposed to consensus), using the work of Haraway (1978), Lyotard (1984,
   1998), and Ziarek (2001). How would such an epistemology relate to
   feminist discussions of the possibility of democratic, responsible
   knowledge?

AB There has been little serious work to integrate the constructionist
   approach and the cognitive/evolutionary approach in the domain of race,
   although many researchers have paid lip service to this project. We
   believe that any satisfactory account of human beings' racialist
   cognition has to integrate both approaches. In this paper, we propose to
   move toward this integration. We present an evolutionary hypothesis that
   rests on a distinction between three kinds of groups-kin-based groups,
   small scale coalitions, and ethnies. Following Gil-White (1999,-2001a,
   2001b), we propose that ethnies have raised specific evolutionary
   challenges that were solved by an evolved cognitive system. We suggest
   that the concept of race is a byproduct of this mechanism. We argue that
   recent theories of cultural transmission are our best hope for
   integrating social constructionists' and cognitive/evolutionary
   theorists' insights.

   claimed, tend to have adverse effects on people who are already
   disadvantaged. A recent argument by Philip Kitcher both clarifies and
   generalizes this charge to cover a wider genre of scientific projects.
   In this paper I try to spell out and analyze Kitcher's argument. The
   argument fails, I suggest, because some of its key premises fail to
   convince. My analysis focuses on relevant facts about the role of

AB Previously, we observed that without using prior information about
   individual sampling locations, a clustering algorithm applied to
   multilocus genotypes from worldwide human populations produced genetic
   clusters largely coincident with major geographic regions. It has been
   argued, however, that the degree of clustering is diminished by use of
   samples with greater uniformity in geographic distribution, and that the
   clusters we identified were a consequence of uneven sampling along
   genetic clines. Expanding our earlier clataset from 377 to 993 markers,
   we systematically examine the influence of several study design
   variables-sample size, number of loci, number of clusters, assumptions
   about correlations in allele frequencies across populations, and the
   geographic dispersion of the sample-on the "clusteredness" of
   individuals. With all other variables held constant, geographic
   dispersion is seen to have comparatively little effect on the degree of
   clustering. Examination of the relationship between genetic and
   geographic distance supports a view in which the clusters arise not as
   an artifact of the sampling scheme, but from small discontinuous jumps
   in genetic distance for most population pairs on opposite sides of
   geographic barriers, in comparison with genetic distance for pairs on
   the same side. Thus, analysis of the 993-locus clataset corroborates our
   earlier results: if enough markers are used with a sufficiently large
   worldwide sample, individuals can be partitioned into genetic clusters
   that match major geographic subdivisions of the globe, with some
   individuals from intermediate geographic locations having mixed
   membership in the clusters that correspond to neighboring regions.

AB Scholars have long sought to find the differences in the ways men and
   women communicate. Also, researchers have studied the field of religious
   conversion. This first-of-a-kind study has sought to find if gender
   differences arise when men and women communicate the story of their
   religious conversion. Forty, structured in-depth interviews with 20 male
   and 20 female undergraduate students at a small, private Christian
   liberal arts university in the Midwest were used to address the stated
   research question. Five male and five females were selected from each
   grade level. A non-probability sampling procedure was used to select
   subjects. The final sample consisted of two Hispanics, one Black, and 37
   White non-Hispanic participants. The average age of each participant was
   20. Although some authors have suggested that conversion stories of men
   and women would be similar due to a rhythmic narrative formula and
   common structural elements, this study has found that significant gender
   differences in the communication of such narratives do arise in certain
   specific areas. The majority of men used adventurous metaphors, while
   the majority of women used peaceful metaphors to describe their
   conversion experiences. It was also found that the majority of men
   focused on themselves as the central character while most women focused
   on someone else. And, men described themselves as clever whereas women
   described themselves as foolish in their narratives.

AB Change in art is all understudied topic in sociological research. This
   article examines protest artworks (arpilleras) produced by shantytown
   women during and shortly after the dictatorship in Chile, to explore the
   question Why political art that is for sale changes over time. This
   research is based oil 136 semi-structured and in-depth interviews with
   various members of the art world in Chile, Europe, and the United
   States, a year's worth of participant observation of art groups in
   Santiago and over five hundred photographs of arpilleras, taken by the
   author and analyzed thematically. Political art that is for sale call
   change because the intermediary (the organization connecting producers
   and buyers) becomes less or more politically conservative, develops a
   precarious financial situation, grows more afraid of repression, and has
   the power to enforce the changes it desires; because the original
   buyer,,; are replaced with new buyers with different motivations; and
   because new artists with new ideas begin making the art, one artist in
   the group produces something different and the idea spreads, artists
   censor themselves, and artists have new experiences or learn about new
   events. Through these sources of change, international social movements,
   local and international political and economic developments, and global
   institutions impact the art. Meanings attached to the art by the
   different parties (intermediaries, buyers, and artists) and class
   differences between artists and intermediaries are also important in
   facilitating change. These findings, based as they are oil political art
   made in a repressive context, not only contribute to our understanding
   of artistic evolution bill they help correct the bias in the sociology
   of art toward "art" made in democratic countries of the "First World."
   They are not just applicable to authoritarian regimes but also to art by
   politicized minority groups in democratic contexts, and to other
   cultural products such as newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and
   books.

   argues that, during the period of this study, these weekly masses served
   to reinforce Worker identity by guiding participants' experiences along
   specific lines. Ritual symbolism and the moment-to-moment attention of
   the participants combined to move participants from despair at the state
   of the world to an experience of a community of solidarity and hope. A
   second phase of the ritual then expanded that community to include
   homeless people, by means of a symbolic second 'mass' of soup, bread,
   and water, delivered in the streets. The article demonstrates the need
   for sociology to consider the experiential dimension, along with the
   symbolic, in understanding rituals' role in religious life.

AB Background: Physicians are encouraged to provide counseling regarding

   disciplinary practices and factors that affect these practices.
   Methods: One hundred and eighty two parents of 12- to 19-month-old
   children from general pediatric clinics in North Carolina and Alabama
   were inter-viewed regarding discipline using the Discipline Survey.
   Measures of contextual factors were analyzed to see which predicted
   disciplinary practices.
   Results: Ninety-two percent of the participants were mothers; 6% were
   fathers; participation rate: 78%. Monitoring was the most common type of
   discipline used and time out was the least common. Parent, child, and
   family characteristics were all importantly associated with a broad
   array of disciplinary practices and modes of administration. However,
   the situation in which discipline occurred was found to be significant
   for most disciplinary practices even after controlling for other
   factors. Our study found that the specific misbehavior was most likely,
   and the presence of the other parent was least likely, to affect the
   type of discipline which was utilize.
   Conclusions: When counseling families about discipline, practitioners
   should incorporate the fact that misbehavior happens in various
   contexts.

   social support, religiosity, and southern residence are protective
   factors against suicidality for Black people. This hypothesis was tested
   among 5,125 participants from the National Comorbidity Survey; 299 were
   African American males. In this study we hypothesized that there would
   be significantly lower suicidality in the South, and social support and
   religiosity would mediate this relationship. Our results indicate that
   Southern region is indeed a significant predictor of suicidal symptoms
   in African American men, such that suicidal symptoms were lower in the
   South, but religiosity and social support did not account for this
   effect. Other potential mediators were also examined.

AB I make use of this reply to McLennan to offer an overall perspective on
   the development of my work, normatively, empirically and theoretically,
   and in its earlier neofunctionalist and later cultural-sociological
   phase. I argue that, despite periodic suggestions that my cultural
   sociology seeks to push sociology towards an absolute subjectivity, the
   social-epistemological framework of 'multidimensionality' around which I
   organized my first work, Theoretical Logic in Sociology, still holds.
   Cultural sociology introduces a method and theory for understanding a
   dimension of social life, it is not an attempt to explain every part of
   social life. There is still structural power according to this
   perspective, but the nature and force of this power must be understood
   differently. It is a mistake for social science to take a 'realist'
   path, either in its epistemology or in its mode of explanation.

AB Octavio Paz has been known worldwide as a talented poet and essayist,
   but not as a sociologist. And yet his seminal work, The Labyrinth of
   Solitude, published in 1950 and containing Pazs interpretation of
   Mexican history and identity, arrived at via his analysis of Mexican
   'myths' or cultural forms, is rich in sociological content-particularly
   sociology of culture and sociology of knowledge. The author of this
   article, after noting that very few of the experts on Pazs work have
   tried to analyze in a serious and sustained manner its sociological
   content, has determined not only to decipher Pazs method but to reveal
   its strong links to the sociology of form and content produced by the
   German sociologist and philosopher Georg Simmel. Thus, the main goal of
   this article is to apply Simmel's methods to The Labyrinth of Solitude
   and to thereby (1) shed some light on the sociological aspects of Paz's
   seminal work, thus bringing him the credit he deserves as an early
   Mexican sociologist, and (2) reveal the extent of Simmel's
   influence-hitherto ignored or at least very much minimized-upon The
   Labyrinth.

AB While the influence of networks in conversion is among the most
   established findings in the sociology of religion, relatively little is
   known about how and why they have their influence. In this study the
   author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in
   network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently
   influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter
   and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, "structural
   availability" works not only by freeing an actor from
   conformity-inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative
   absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates
   individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location
   strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life
   problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number
   of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations.

AB Background: Over the past decade, concerns about bullying and its role
   in school violence, depression, and health concerns have grown. However,
   no large studies in the United States have examined the prevalence of
   bullying during elementary school or its association with objective
   measures of school attendance and achievement.
   Objective: To determine the prevalence of bullying during elementary
   school and its association with school attendance, academic achievement,
   disciplinary actions, and self-reported feelings of sadness, safety, and
   belonging.
   Design: Cross-sectional study using 2001-2002 school data.
   Setting: Urban, West Coast public school district.
   Participants: Three thousand five hundred thirty (91.4%) third, fourth,
   and fifth grade students. Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported
   involvement in bullying.
   Results: Twenty-two percent of children surveyed were involved in
   bullying either as a victim, bully, or both. Victims and bully-victims
   were more likely to have low achievement than bystanders (odds ratios
   [ORs], 0.8 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.7-0.9] and 0.8 [95% CI,
   0.6-1.0], respectively). All 3 bullying-involved groups were
   significantly more likely than bystanders to feel unsafe at school
   (victims, OR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1-4.2]; bullies, OR, 2.5 [95% CI, 1.5-4.1];
   bully-victims, OR, 5.0 [95% CI, 1.9-13.6]). Victims and bully-victims
   were more likely to report feeling that they don't belong at school
   (ORs, 4.1 [95% CI, 2.6-6.5] and 3.1 [95% CI, 1.3-7.2], respectively).
   Bullies and victims were more likely than bystanders to feel sad most
   days (ORs 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.91 and 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.8],
   respectively). Bullies and bully-victims were more likely to be male
   (ORs, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.91 and 3.0 [95% CI, 1.3-7.01, respectively).
   Conclusions: The prevalence of frequent bullying among elementary school
   children is substantial. Associations between bullying involvement and
   school problems indicate this is a serious issue for elementary schools.
   The research presented herein demonstrates the need for evidence-based
   antibullying curricula in the elementary grades.

AB Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is an important cytokine
   associated with tumor regression and increased survival time for cancer
   patients. Research evidence relates immune factors (e.g., natural killer
   (NK) cell counts, NK cell lysis, lymphocyte profile, and lymphocyte
   proliferation) to the frequency and quality of social relations among
   cancer patients. We hypothesized that disruptions in social relations
   would be associated with lower TNF-alpha responses, and conversely, that
   reports of positive changes in social relations correlate with stronger
   responses. A prospective design measured changes in social activity and
   relationship satisfaction with a partner in 44 breast cancer patients at
   the time of cancer diagnosis, and initial surgery and 12 months later.
   Results indicated that patients reporting increased social activities or
   satisfaction exhibited stronger stimulated TNF-alpha responses. This is
   the first study to link changes in patient social relations with a
   cancer-relevant immune variable. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Background: Little is known about the predictors of adherence to
   mammography guidelines by African-American women. We assessed
   individual-level and group-level socioeconomic predictors of regular
   mammography use in a large cohort of African-American women.
   Methods: We included 14,706 participants in the Black Women's Health
   Study who were 40 to 69 years of age at baseline in 1995. Data were
   obtained through mail questionnaires at entry and biennially during
   three 2-year followup periods until 2001. We linked the women's
   addresses to census block (neighborhood) socioeconomic data. With
   multilevel multivariable regression analysis, we assessed the relation
   of individual-level and neighborhood socioeconomic factors to "regular"
   mammography use (use in all three follow-up periods) relative to
   nonregular use, with control for other predictors.
   Results: Most participants had health insurance and almost half had
   graduated college. Having health insurance was the socioeconomic
   variable most strongly associated with regular mammography use (odds
   ratio, 3.59; 95% confidence interval 3.02-4.28); the association was
   present at all levels of educational attainment, household income, and
   neighborhood socioeconomic status. Regular mammography use increased
   with individual household income: odds ratio, 2.00 (95% confidence
   interval, 1.58-2.53) for household income >$100,000 relative to
   <$15,001. Regular mammography use did not vary across level of
   education. Higher neighborhood socioeconomic status was significantly
   associated with regular mammography use before, but not after, control
   for household income.
   Conclusions: Access to health insurance is strongly associated with
   regular mammography use among African-American women, even at higher
   levels of educational attainment and socioeconomic status. Neighborhood
   socioeconomic characteristics do not materially influence regular use.

AB Because children's ability to support themselves falls below their
   consumption, human young are subsidized by others throughout much of
   their growth and development. Mothers, however, who often have multiple
   dependents of different ages, are faced with an allocation problem (Fig.
   1). This has led to important debate about the evolution of a long
   period dependence and the development of nonmaternal strategies to
   provision young. This article focuses on the critical role that children
   themselves play. Because the human subsistence niche incorporates a
   broad diversity of resources that require variable procurement and
   processing costs, dependent children can also be important producers,
   furthering both a need and an opportunity for cooperative breeding.

AB This article reviews studies that have examined whether Baumrind's

   where independence is said to be emphasized versus cultures where
   interdependence is said to be emphasized. I present evidence showing
   that Baumrind's parenting styles have similar function in both
   collectivist and individualist cultures. Based on these studies, I argue
   against the claim of some researchers that authoritarian parenting is
   not detrimental or authoritative parenting beneficial to the development
   of young people in cultures that are said to emphasize interdependence.
   However, more research is needed before conclusions can be reached about
   the extent to which the culture construct explains child-rearing effects
   on child development. Future directions for research, which include the
   importance of identifying diverse forms of parenting within
   interdependent cultures so as to distinguish the influence of functional
   and dysfunctional forms of parenting on child outcomes, are suggested.

   being married, depression, and time residing in polluted neighborhoods.
   For men, the frequency of binge eating is negatively associated with
   age. The frequency of binge eating was not affected by education, race,
   obesity, or current dieting.
   Conclusion: The frequency of binge eating is highest among adults

   participation and landscape preference. African Americans, more than
   Whites, prefer developed facilities and services; Whites more likely
   than Blacks prefer undeveloped and more nature-based settings. It is
   also reasonable to assume that racial discrimination can exist in the
   landscapes of urban parks and forests and affect decision making and
   participation. Urban forests and parks can be planned, managed, and
   maintained to foster diversity of racial and ethnic participation and
   relationships much in the saute way they can foster biological diversity
   among flora and fauna. Today, it is vital for urban foresters and

   carried out a decade or more ago and/or most focused on specific parks
   or localized areas. Data from a recent survey of residents in two
   metropolitan areas in the eastern United States allowed for updating of
   this research record. Using analysis of variance and covariance,
   consideration was given to racial differences between Blacks and Whites,
   regional differences between cities, and the effects of various
   socio-demographic characteristics on residents' park preferences and
   participation. Racial differences were similar to those reported by
   previous researchers, and these differences did not vary markedly
   between the two metropolitan study sites. These distinctions, combined
   with racial differences in subjects' expressed willingness to volunteer
   time to develop/maintain local park settings, suggest the importance of
   understanding the differing perspectives and actions of multi-ethnic
   user groups in urban park and forest management and maintenance.

   Mistrust-distrust that the system or providers put patients first, (3)
   Fear-fear of cancer, the system, and of CRC screening procedures, (4)
   Fatalism-the belief that screening and treatment may be futile and
   surgery causes spread of cancer, (5) Accuracy-a preference for the most
   thorough and accurate test for CRC, and (6) Knowledge-lack of CRC
   knowledge and a desire for more information. The Fear and Knowledge
   themes were most frequently noted in transcript theme counts. The Hope
   and Accuracy themes were crucial moderators of the influence of all
   barriers. The largest number of participants preferred either

   singles to engage in any alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking or
   experience negative consequences and reported less alcohol use at age
   29. Women who married in adolescence reported fewer negative
   consequences at age 29 than did singles and (if they had not divorced)
   were less likely to engage in heavy episodic drinking or experience any
   negative consequences, reported fewer consequences and consumed less
   alcohol. The protective effects of marriage in young adulthood were
   observed whether or not women divorced. Parenthood and college
   attendance before age 23 did not explain the marriage effect.
   Conclusions: Results support role theory, which posits that individuals
   who marry are socialized into conventional adult roles that discourage
   deviant behavior.

TI Incidence rates for alcohol dependence among adults: Prospective data

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 66
IS 6
BP 795

PD NOV 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: Using prospectively gathered data, we assessed cumulative
   incidence of alcohol dependence using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule
   (DIS) based on criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition (DSM-III-R). Method: Probability
   samples of area residents were selected by census tracts and households
   in five communities of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey program.
   The baseline interview for the Baltimore site was completed in 1981, and
   between 1993 and 1996 the original Baltimore site cohort was traced.
   After excluding individuals with current or prior history of alcohol
   dependence at the time of the baseline interview, we identified a cohort
   of 1,642 individuals who were at risk for alcohol dependence.
   Person-years of risk were calculated, cumulative incidence obtained, and
   survival analyses completed. Results: Several principal findings that
   confirm some from studies of shorter follow-up intervals are as follows:
   (1) incidence of alcohol dependence is consistently greater for men and
   generally decreases with age; (2) problem drinkers have the highest
   incidence of dependence, and the male-to-female ratio is attenuated in
   this group; (3) no differences were found for risk of dependence by
   racial group; and (4) predictors of alcohol dependence include male
   gender, young age, not being married and having a history of tobacco
   smoking. Conclusions: The current study supplies data on the rate of
   development of DIS/DSM-III-R alcohol dependence in a population-based
   sample with an extended interval of follow-up. Methodological
   considerations in the analysis and interpretation of this type of
   prospectively gathered data are discussed.

TI Perceived social status, language and identified dental home among

AB Background. The authors conducted a study to examine the extent to which
   perceived social status in communities and in U.S. society in general
   and primary language are associated with having a dental home among four
   Hispanic groups.
   Methods. The authors used random-digit-dialing technology to select a
   probability sample of Hispanic adults in Miami-Dade County, Fla., for a
   telephone-based survey. Trained interviewers administered the pretested
   survey instrument in Spanish or English. The authors used bivariate
   contingency tables and multiple logistic regression modeling to analyze
   the data.
   Results. Eight hundred ten adults participated, and their nationality
   groups were as follows: Cuba (n = 450), Nicaragua (n = 139), Colombia (n
   = 132) and Puerto Rico (n = 89). After controlling for nationality
   group, the authors found that respondents who perceived themselves to be
   at a higher social status in the United States than in their own
   community were significantly more likely to have a dental home; those
   who reported having a higher community status were significantly less
   likely to have a dental home compared with respondents who perceived
   their national and community social status to be equal. Respondents who
   primarily spoke a language other than English at home were less likely
   than those who primarily spoke English to have a dental home. Female
   respondents were more likely than male respondents to have a dental
   home. Respondents with dental insurance were more likely to have a
   dental home than were those without dental insurance.
   Conclusion. Perceived social status and acculturation may influence
   whether Hispanics have a dental home. However, because of the sample
   design, the findings may not be generalizable to all Hispanic
   populations in Florida or the United States.
   Clinical Implications. Reducing disparities in oral health status and in
   use of dental services among Hispanics relative to non-Hispanic whites
   may require attention to cultural factors such as language, community
   structure and immigrants' degree of acculturation.

AB Objective: Low SES and a conflict-ridden, neglectful, or harsh family
   environment in childhood have been linked to a high rate of physical
   health disorders in adulthood. The objective of the present
   investigation was to evaluate a model of the pathways that may help to
   explain these links and to relate them to metabolic functioning (MF) in
   the Coronary Artery Risk Development In Young Adults (CARDIA) dataset.
   Methods: Participants (n = 3225) in the year 15 assessment of CARDIA,
   age 33 to 45 years, completed measures of childhood socioeconomic status
   (SES), risky early family environment (RF), adult psychosocial
   functioning (PsyF, a latent factor measured by depression, hostility,
   positive and negative social contacts), and adult SES. Indicators of the
   latent factor MF were assessed, specifically, cholesterol, insulin,
   glucose, triglycerides, and waist circumference. Results: The overall
   prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 9.7%. Structural equation modeling
   indicated that childhood SES and RF are associated with MF via their
   association with PsyF (standardized path coefficients: childhood SES to
   RF -0.13, RF to PsyF 0.44, PsyF to MF 0.09, all p < .05), but also
   directly (coefficient from childhood SES to MF -0.12,p < .05), with good
   overall model fit. When this model was tested separately for race-sex
   subgroups, it fit best for white women, fit well for African-American
   women and white men, but did not fit well for African-American men.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that childhood SES and early family
   environment contribute to metabolic functioning through pathways of
   depression, hostility, and poor quality of social contacts.

   perceptual chimera, but area feature of everyday talk and social action;
   (2) a disability such as autism can be treated in terms of the
   intelligence it may gloss as comprising analyzable
   practices-in-interaction; and (3) the sociology of deviance and social
   problems can benefit from studies of the intrinsic orderliness of
   everyday talk and social interaction in both regular, or ordinary, and
   more specialized settings such as clinics. The data are two segments
   from a testing and diagnostic center for developmental disabilities in
   the United States. Each segment involves a child who is diagnosed with
   autism and is being administered a test that poses questions such as,
   "What do you do when you're hungry?" The puzzle this test presents is to
   account for the patterns of both standard (commonsensical) and
   non-standard (autistic) answering. In accounting for patterns of
   answering, I use ordinary conversational instances of "what do you do
   when x happens?" to reveal the logic required in the test, and to
   describe both commonsense and autistic intelligence. Interactionally,
   autistic answering may reverse a structural preference for gestalt or
   global interpretation of utterances in favor of stimulus-bound, local
   understandings.

AB In his popular introductory sociology text, Stark identifies W. E. B. Du
   Bois and Albion Small as important cornerstones of the U.S. sociological
   tradition. While the work of the "Chicago School" is well known in
   sociological circles, Do Bois' sociological legacy is not. The
   Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996) is a classic empirical sociological
   study that is rarely included in discussions of the development of
   scientific sociology. Likewise, The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003)
   represents one of the first empirically based sociological studies of a
   religious institution. Sociologists of religion routinely discuss the
   contributions of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel while virtually ignoring Du
   Bois. This is ironic because Du Bois' work on religion was based on
   ethnographic data, field inter-views, surveys, and census data. This
   article provides an overview of Do Bois' sociological study of the Black
   Church in the United States by identifying some of the main themes
   developed in The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996), The Souls of Black
   Folk ([1903a] 1994), and The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003). These studies
   reveal that Du Bois was a pioneer in the areas of evaluation research,
   public sociology, service learning, and congregational studies.

AB As originally developed by Charles Ragin in The Comparative Method
   (1987), qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) has been used extensively
   by comparative and historical sociologists as an effective tool for
   analyzing data sets of medium-N populations. Like many other methods,
   however, QCA is a temporal and obscures the sequential nature of paths
   of causation. QCA ignores the order of events by treating combinations
   of attributes as though they occur simultaneously rather than as
   unfolding over time. While preserving the essential strengths of QCA,
   the authors present a modification that is capable of capturing the
   temporal nature of causal interactions. This modification involves a
   hybrid of Boolean algebra and sequence analysis to create a parsimonious
   set of solutions. This technique is referred to as temporal qualitative
   comparative analysis, or TQCA.

AB Three developments have created challenges for political representation
   in the U.S. and particularly for the use of territorially based
   representation (election by district). First, the demographic complexity
   of the U.S. population has grown both in absolute terms and in terms of
   residential patterns. Second, legal developments since the 1960s have
   recognized an increasing number of groups as eligible for voting rights
   protection. Third, the growing technical capacities of computer
   technology, particularly Geographic Information Systems, have allowed
   political parties and other organizations to create election districts
   with increasingly precise political and demographic characteristics.
   Scholars have made considerable progress in measuring and evaluating the
   racial and partisan biases of districting plans, and some states have
   tried to use Geographic Information Systems technology to produce more
   representative districts. However, case studies of Texas and Arizona
   illustrate that such analytic and technical advances have not overcome
   the basic contradictions that underlie the American system of
   territorial political representation.

AB Background. There are known racial disparities in renal graft survival.
   Data are lacking comparing associations of race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status with graft failure and functional status after
   transplantation. Our goal was to test if African-American and Hispanic
   race/ethnicity and poverty are associated with worse outcomes following
   renal transplantation.
   Methods. We performed a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide
   registry (United Network for Organ Sharing). We studied 4,471 adults who
   received renal transplants in 1990. Outcomes were graft failure and
   functional status over 10 years.
   Results. Cumulative incidence of graft failure was higher among
   African-Americans and Hispanics than whites (77% vs. 64% vs. 60 %; P <
   0.001) and among transplant recipients living in the poorest areas (70%
   vs. 58% in the richest; P < 0.001). African-American and Hispanic
   race/ethnicity were independently predictive of graft failure (RR 1.8,
   95% CI 1.6-1.9; RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.2-1.6, respectively) in multivariate
   analyses but poverty status was not (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9-1.1). Days with
   impaired functional status were higher for African-Americans compared to
   whites (RR 1.6,95% CI 1.3-1.9) but not independent of poverty. Poverty
   was independently associated with impaired functional status (RR 1.3,
   95% CI 1.0-1.6).
   Conclusions. African-Americans and Hispanics had higher rates of graft
   failure compared to whites after adjustment for poverty and other
   covariates whereas poverty, but not race/ethnicity, was related to
   functional status following renal transplantation. National datasets
   should include individual-level measures of socioeconomic status in
   order to improve evaluation of social and environmental causes of
   disparities in renal transplant outcomes.

AB Aim: This study explored maternal history of perinatal loss relative to
   risk of child physical abuse and neglect. Methods: The 518 study
   participants included 118 abusive mothers, 119 neglecting mothers, and
   281 mothers with no known history of child maltreatment. Interviews and
   observations were conducted in the participants' homes, and comparisons
   were made between women without a history of perinatal loss and women
   with one and multiple losses relative to risk for child maltreatment.
   Results: Compared to women with no history of perinatal loss, those with
   one loss (voluntary or involuntary) had a 99% higher risk for child
   physical abuse, and women with multiple losses were 189% more likely to
   physically abuse their children. Compared to women with no history of
   induced abortion, those with one prior abortion had a 144% higher risk
   for child physical abuse. Finally, maternal history of multiple
   miscarriages and/or stillbirths compared to no history was associated
   with a 1237% increased risk of physical abuse and a 605% increased risk
   of neglect.
   Conclusion: Perinatal loss may be a marker for elevated risk of child
   physical abuse, and this information is potentially useful to child
   maltreatment prevention and intervention efforts.

AB Aims We explore young children's attitudes toward, beliefs about, and
   life-style associations with cigarette smoking using direct and indirect
   measures.
   Design, setting and participants Second (n = 100) and fifth grade (n =
   141) elementary school students (i.e. 7-8 and 10-11-year-olds) were
   excused from class and individually interviewed.
   Methods Participants selected pictures in response to the questions: who
   would like to smoke cigarettes the most and who would like to smoke
   cigarettes the least? Their picture choices were probed using open-ended
   prompts designed to elicit the beliefs and life-style associations
   underlying their choices. Survey-based measures of attitudes and beliefs
   were also collected.
   Findings Second graders reported life-style associations with cigarette
   smoking that were consistent with those of fifth graders. While their
   associations with smoking are generally negative, children appear to
   perceive that others feel that smoking makes them look cool and feel
   cool and also helps them to fit in. By fifth grade, many children
   believe that smoking can help to reduce stress and alleviate negative
   mood states. The presence of a smoker in the household does not appear
   to affect these associations, suggesting that they may be being shaped
   by external socialization agents.
   Conclusion Young children appear to be developing understandings of
   cigarette smoking that go beyond knowing that cigarettes are products
   that are smoked. As some of their perceptions appear likely to
   predispose them for future experimentation, young children need to be
   included in prevention research so that age-appropriate interventions
   can be developed.

   earlier age than older individuals.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of cigarette use provides further
   evidence that the excess burden of tobacco-related disease among
   low-income African-American families may be on the rise. This is of
   great concern, and if confirmed by further research, indicates an urgent
   need for preventive intervention.

AB The American system of prisons and prisoners-described by its critics as
   the prison-industrial complex-has grown rapidly since 1970. Increasingly
   punitive sentencing guidelines and the privatization of prison-related
   industries and services account for much of this growth. Those who enter
   and leave this system are increasingly Black or Latino, poorly educated,
   lacking vocational skills, struggling with drugs and alcohol, and
   disabled. Few correctional facilities mitigate the educational and/ or
   skills deficiencies of their inmates, and most inmates will return home
   to communities that are ill equipped to house or rehabilitate them. A
   more humanistic and community-centered approach to incarceration and
   rehabilitation may yield more beneficial results for individuals,
   communities, and, ultimately, society.

AB Each year, more than 10 million people enter US jails, most returning
   home within a few weeks. Because jails concentrate people with
   infectious and chronic diseases, substance abuse, and mental health
   problems, and reentry policies often exacerbate these problems, the
   experiences of people leaving jail may contribute to health inequities
   in the low-income communities to which they return.
   Our study of the experiences in the year after release of 491 adolescent
   males and 476 adult women returning home from New York City jails shows
   that both populations have low employment rates and incomes and high
   rearrest rates. Few received services in jail. However, overall drug use
   and illegal activity declined significantly in the year after release.
   Postrelease employment and health insurance were associated with lower
   rearrest rates and drug use. Public policies on employment, drug
   treatment, housing, and health care often blocked successful reentry
   into society from jail, suggesting the need for new policies that
   support successful reentry into society.

AB Objectives. We describe behavioral health diagnoses and community
   release patterns among adult male and female inmates in New Jersey
   prisons and assess their implications for correctional health care and
   community reentry.
   Methods. We used clinical and classification data on a census of
   "special needs" inmates (those with behavioral health disorders) in New
   Jersey (n=3189) and a census of all special needs inmates released to
   New Jersey communities over a 12-month period (n=974).
   Results. Virtually all adult inmates with special needs had at least 1
   Axis I mental disorder, and 68% of these had at least 1 additional Axis
   I mental disorder, a personality disorder, or addiction problem (67% of
   all male and 75% of all female special needs inmates). Of those special
   needs inmates released, 25% returned to the most disadvantaged counties
   in New Jersey (27% of all male and 18% of all female special needs
   inmates).
   Conclusions. Two types of clustering were found: gender-specific
   clustering of disorders among inmates and spatial clustering of
   ex-offenders in impoverished communities. These findings suggest a need
   for gendered treatment strategies within correctional settings and need
   for successful reentry strategies.

AB Objectives. We examined risk factors for long-term homelessness among
   newly homeless men and women who were admitted to New York City shelters
   in 2001 and 2002.
   Methods. Interviews were conducted with 377 study participants upon
   entry into the shelter and at 6-month intervals for 18 months.
   Standardized assessments of psychiatric diagnosis, symptoms, and coping
   skills; social and family history; and service use were analyzed.
   Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression were used to examine
   the association between baseline assessments and duration of
   homelessness.
   Results. Eighty-one percent of participants returned to community
   housing during the follow-up period; the median duration of homelessness
   was 190 days. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that a shorter
   duration of homelessness was associated with younger age, current or
   recent employment, earned income, good coping skills, adequate family
   support, absence of a substance abuse treatment history, and absence of
   an arrest history. Cox regression showed that older age group (P < .05)
   and arrest history (P < .01) were the strongest predictors of a longer
   duration of homelessness.
   Conclusions. Identification of risk factors for long-term homelessness
   can guide efforts to reduce lengths of stay in homeless shelters and to
   develop new preventive interventions.

AB Objectives. We analyzed whether a method for identifying latent
   trajectories-latent class growth analysis (LCGA)-was useful for
   understanding outcomes for individuals subject to an intervention.
   Methods. We used LCGA to reanalyze data from a published study of
   mentally ill homeless men in a critical time intervention (CTI) program.
   In that study, 96 men leaving a shelter's onsite psychiatric program
   were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The former
   received CTI services and the latter usual services. Each individual's
   housing circumstances were observed for 18 months after program
   initiation. Our outcome measure was monthly homelessness: a person was
   considered homeless in a month if he was homeless for even 1 night that
   month.
   Results. Four latent classes were found among the control group, but
   just 3 among the experimental group. Control, but not experimental,
   group individuals showed a small class of chronically homeless men. The
   size of the never-homeless class was 19 percentage points larger for the
   experimental than for the control group. J- and inverted-U-shaped
   patterns were also found among both groups, but with important
   differences in timing of patterns.
   Conclusions. Our results reveal effects not apparent in the original
   analysis, suggesting that latent class growth models improve
   intervention evaluation.

AB Antigay bias is a well-documented social problem among heterosexual men,
   though heterosexual women display a lesser tendency toward this bias.
   Startle eye blink has been established as a valid measure of the
   affective component of antigay bias in heterosexual men. In the current
   study, a sample of 91 heterosexual women and 87 heterosexual men were
   exposed to a variety of sexual photographic stimuli accompanied by
   startle probes. Heterosexual men who expressed more bias against gay men
   using a social distance measure (i.e., discomfort with being in close
   quarters with a gay man) displayed a startle response consistent with
   greater negative affect (e.g., fear and disgust) toward gay male
   stimuli, while those with less self-reported antigay bias did not
   display a physiological bias against gay men, and none of these men
   showed a relationship between bias against lesbians and physiological
   responses while viewing lesbian images. There were no such physiological
   manifestations of antigay bias in heterosexual women while viewing
   lesbian or gay male images, even among those who self-reported such
   bias. It appears that heterosexual women do not tend to have the same
   affective response toward homosexuals that some heterosexual men
   experience.

AB Socioecological models relate differences in feeding strategies to
   variation in the nature of female social relationships. Among the
   African forest guenons, females consume large quantities of fruit and
   other plant reproductive parts, resources which are thought to promote
   contest competition, yet these monkeys have been characterized as having
   agonistically undifferentiated relationships in which rank, if
   discernible at all, does not correlate with fitness benefits. To
   determine whether female relationships become more hierarchical under
   relevant ecological conditions, we monitored the adult females of two
   blue monkey groups (Cercopithecus mitis stuhlmanni) over a complete
   annual cycle in the Kakamega Forest, Kenya. Females competed
   aggressively for plant reproductive parts more often than any other
   resource type, and in both groups we detected linear dominance
   hierarchies. Nonetheless, agonism rates remained low throughout our
   study, and did not vary with changes in ecological conditions. Rather,
   when plant reproductive parts were scarce, subordinate females spent
   more time feeding and less time resting in an apparent attempt to
   compensate for a reduced efficiency of food intake. The effects of rank
   and food abundance were not reflected, however, in the distribution of
   grooming. The use of alternative feeding strategies appeared to blunt
   competition - females of all ranks were unlikely to be near others while
   feeding and spent more time consuming alternative resources when plant
   reproductive parts were scarce. The diverse diet of this species may
   allow females to avoid conflict so that dominance has only subtle
   effects that are difficult to detect. While socioecological models often
   simplify the connection between resources and female interactions, our
   results emphasize that the behavior of animals consuming particular
   resources, and not the resources themselves, are critical predictors of
   social patterns.

AB Purpose of review
   Despite the socioeconomic and personal health costs directly attributed
   to smoking, over one-half of high school seniors have used cigarettes,
   and over 15% of seniors are daily smokers. This review summarizes the
   recent research concerning the psychosocial and physiologic risk and
   protective factors associated with adolescent smoking.
   Recent findings
   Studies of the psychosocial risk factors have added to the evidence that
   stress, peers and family influences, ethnicity, and depression all serve
   as risk factors for the development and maintenance of smoking in
   adolescents. Protective factors include parental expectations and
   monitoring religious activity and sociopolitical factors, such as
   tobacco related marketing bans and higher cigarette taxes. Adolescent
   smoking trajectories have been further defined and can be used to
   classify smokers in terms of dependence symptoms. Finally,
   neurobiological research has focused to a large extent on the concept of
   disinhibition as a risk factor for smoking in adolescents.
   Summary
   While rates of smoking in adolescents have declined since 1997, millions
   of adolescents initiate or continue smoking each year with deleterious
   health and psychosocial consequences. Research into the risk and
   protective factors for adolescent smoking, particularly that which ties
   psychosocial and neurobiological factors together, is necessary to
   inform the development of tailored and maximally efficacious treatments
   for this population.

AB Background: To date, there have been no published data on 12-month
   comorbidity of DSM-IV alcohol and drug use disorders in the general U.S.
   population. The purposes of the present study were to examine the
   prevalence and comorbidity of alcohol and specific drug use disorders,
   and to identify sociodemographic and psychopathologic correlates and
   treatment seeking among three groups of respondents: (1) those with
   alcohol use disorders only; (2) those with drug use disorders only; (3)
   those with comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders.
   Methods: Information on 12-month alcohol and specific drug use disorders
   in the United States was derived from face-to-face interviews in the
   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism's (NIAAA) 2001-2002
   National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC:
   n = 43,093).
   Results: Prevalences were 7.35% for alcohol use disorders only, 0.90%
   for drug use disorder only and 1.10% for comorbid alcohol and drug use
   disorders. Sociodemographic and psychopathologic correlates of these
   three groups were quite different, with the drug use disorder and
   comorbid groups significantly more likely to be young, male, never
   married and of lower socioeconomic status than the alcohol use disorder
   only group. Associations between current alcohol use disorders and 25
   specific drug use disorders were generally positive and statistically
   significant. The 12-month prevalence of treatment seeking significantly
   increased from 6.06% for those with an alcohol use disorder only to
   15.63% for those with a drug use disorder only, and to 21.76% for those
   with comorbid alcohol and drug use disorders.
   Conclusions: This study provides detailed data on the homotypic
   comorbidity of alcohol use disorders and 25 different drug use disorders
   and confirms the high levels of association seen in previous studies
   based on lifetime measures. Implications of this study are discussed in
   terms of integrating alcohol and drug treatment services and refining
   prevention and intervention efforts. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Objective: To summarize the existing literature regarding the social
   implications of embryo cryopreservation and outline areas in need of
   further study.
   Result(s): The potential social impact of oocyte cryopreservation has
   not been investigated. Embryo cryopreservation has been increasingly
   used to improve the cost-effectiveness of in vitro fertilization (IVF)
   and expand the options available to infertile couples, yet its
   widespread adoption has occurred more rapidly than our ability to study
   the social consequences for the couples and health professionals
   involved. For maintaining cryopreserved embryos, the existing literature
   is fragmented and incompletely explores the effects on an infertile
   couple's psychosocial health and personal relationships, their family
   planning strategies, or their preferences for the disposition of the
   embryos. Managing unclaimed embryos continues to create challenges for
   assisted reproduction professionals,
   Conclusion(s): We currently lack a thorough understanding of the
   numerous social implications of cryopreservation. Major areas for future
   research include the impact of stored embryos on couples' fertility
   intentions and psychosocial health, factors that affect couples'
   decisions about embryo disposition, strategies to minimize unclaimed
   embryos, and the consequences of oocyte/ovarian cryopreservation.

AB Somatic complaints of children in primary care settings often go
   unexplained despite attempts to determine a cause. Recent research has
   linked violence exposure to stress symptomatology and associated somatic
   problems. Unknown, however, is whether specific physical symptom
   complaints can be attributed, at least in part, to violence exposure.
   Urban African-American 6- and 7-year-old children (N = 268), residing
   with their biological mothers, recruited before birth, and without
   prenatal exposure to hard illicit drugs participated. Children and
   mothers were evaluated in our hospital-based research laboratory, with
   teacher data collected by mail. Community violence exposure (Things I
   Have Seen and Heard), stress symptomatology (Levonn), and somatic
   complaints (teacher-and self-report items) were assessed. Additional
   data collected included prenatal alcohol exposure, socioeconomic status,
   domestic violence, maternal age, stress, somatic complaints and
   psychopathology, and child depression, abuse, and gender. Community
   violence witnessing and victimization were associated with stress
   symptoms (r = .26 and .25, respectively, p < .001); violence
   victimization was related to decreased appetite (r = .16, p < .01),
   difficulty sleeping (r = .21, p < .001), and stomachache complaints (r =
   .13, p < .05); witnessed violence was associated with difficulty
   sleeping (r = .13, p < .05) and headaches (r = .12, p < .05). All
   associations remained significant after control for confounding.
   Community violence exposure accounted for 10% of the variance in child
   stress symptoms, and children who had experienced community violence
   victimization had a 28% increased risk of appetite problems, a 94%
   increased risk of sleeping problems, a 57% increased risk of headaches,
   and a 174% increased risk of stomachaches. Results provide yet another
   possibility for clinicians to explore when treating these physical
   symptoms in children.

AB Survey methods were used to collect cross-sectional data on PTSD
   symptoms in the context of resources, risks, and strengths of a
   convenience sample of 315 low income women of Mexican descent. Women
   were compared by generation in the US, including Mexico-born women who
   immigrated as adults (cage 18), as teens (age 12-17), or as children (<=
   age 12), and US-born women whose parents and/or grandparents were
   Mexico-born. Results showed that US-born women reported significantly
   more types of trauma than women who immigrated as adults or teens, and
   more PTSD symptoms than women who immigrated as adults. Also, one to
   three times as many women who were exposed to the United States before
   age 18 reported sexual trauma exposure compared with women who
   immigrated as adults. In a three-step multiple regression analysis, lack
   of intrinsic strength factors (13%) accounted for more variance in PTSD
   symptoms than resources (6%) or risks (10%; p < 0.001).

AB The incidence of ADHD appears to be similar in African Americans and
   white populations. However, fewer African-American than white children
   are diagnosed and treated for ADHD. Reasons for this disparity have not
   been fully elucidated; causes are most likely complex. Whereas certain
   barriers to treatment are driven by patients and their families, others
   are due to limitations in the healthcare system. Patient-driven
   obstacles to care include inadequate knowledge regarding the symptoms,
   treatment and consequences of untreated ADHD and fear of overdiagnosis
   and misdiagnosis. A survey conducted to explore cultural differences
   between African-American and white respondents found that African
   Americans were more likely than whites to be unfamiliar with ADHD. In
   addition, African Americans felt that they were diagnosed with ADHD more
   often than whites and that teachers blamed ADHD for learning or behavior
   problems more often in African Americans. Health system barriers include
   a lack of culturally competent healthcare providers, stereotyping/biases
   and failure of the clinician to evaluate the child in multiple settings
   before diagnosis. Strategies to overcome these challenges include
   increased dissemination of ADHD information through community events;
   improved training of clinicians in cultural competence; and open
   communication among parents, clinicians and school personnel.

AB Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is diagnosed less often
   in Hispanics than in Caucasian patients. Furthermore, Hispanic patients
   with ADHD are undertreated. The reasons for these disparities are
   unknown, although difficulties with access to care among this population
   may offer a partial explanation. In order to improve treatment outcomes
   in Hispanic patients with ADHD, healthcare providers must reflect on the
   diversity of the Hispanic population, which consists largely of persons
   of Mexican, Puerto Rican and Cuban descent. In spite of the fact that
   Hispanics share a similar language, religion and belief system, there
   are other significant cultural differences among these subgroups. In
   addition, English-language proficiency and socioeconomic variables,
   factors that are known to influence healthcare outcomes, may also differ
   markedly among Hispanic subgroups. Therefore, strategies to improve the
   treatment of ADHD in the Hispanic population must include overcoming
   language barriers by increasing the availability of Spanish-speaking
   professionals and medical translators and using culturally sensitive
   diagnostic instrumentation. Furthermore, improving knowledge of cultural
   practices of particular Hispanic subgroups may improve the therapeutic
   relationship between patients and clinicians, facilitate the diagnosis
   of ADHD and allow healthcare providers to make appropriate treatment
   recommendations.

AB As providers of primary care for children, we are highly knowledgeable
   about how families are created-or are we? Although most caregivers with
   whom we interact become parents in the old-fashioned way, in North
   America and Western Europe, adoption plays a significant role in the
   formation of kinships. Neither domestic nor international adoption is
   well addressed during medical training. Inspection of five major
   pediatrics texts revealed from none to six pages (0%0.2% of total pages)
   devoted to the topic [1-5], despite the fact that among children less
   than 18 years of age living with families in the United States, 1 of 40
   children is adopted [6].
   Adoption is a broadly accepted method of building a family and is part
   of our shared experience in the United States. The 2002 National
   Adoption Attitudes Survey [7] revealed that more than 90% of Americans
   had "very favorable" or "somewhat favorable" opinions about adoption,
   and 64% of respondents reported that a family member or close friend had
   been adopted. Thirty-nine percent of Americans had quite seriously or
   somewhat seriously considered adopting at some point in their lives, and
   86% believed that adoptive parents derive the same amount or more
   satisfaction from raising an adopted child as they derive from raising a
   birth child. In addition to society's approval, adoption advocates have
   powerful bipartisan political allies, because 160 members of the US
   House of Representatives and Senate (30%) belong to the Congressional
   Coalition on Adoption [8].
   International adoption is a growing component of adoption in the United
   States. In 2001, the most recent period for which accurate data are
   available, international adoptions made up 15% of all adoptions (127,407
   total adoptions) [9]. This percentage has tripled since 1992. The 2000
   US Census reported 199,136 international adoptees younger than 18 years
   of age living with families in the United States (12.5% of adopted
   children) [6]. In 2001, the rate of children who joined families through
   international adoption was 4.7 for every 1000 children born in the
   United States and 5.6 for every 1000 children born in Canada [9-12]. In
   some US states, Canadian provinces, and Western European countries, the
   rates were twice that high ( Figs. 1 and 2) [9-13]. Therefore, it is
   virtually inevitable that providers of primary pediatric care are going
   to come into contact with families in their practice who are considering
   or who have adopted internationally.
   On the surface, international adoption seems to be a win-win situation.
   On first encounter, you see elated parents with their newly arrived,
   scrubbed, well-fed, and immaculately dressed child. Parents with room
   for a child in their hearts matched with a needy orphan-what could be
   better? On closer examination, however, international adoption is a
   series of juxtapositions: separation and loss with dreams fulfilled,
   poverty with wealth, colonialism with self-determination, exploitation
   with altruism, religious law with secular law, and best interest of the
   group with best interest of the individual to mention but a few. The
   polar viewpoints of two contemporary figures in this debate illustrate
   this best. Mother children is not widely accepted in many countries. In
   addition, children who are older, have mental or physical handicaps, or
   are members of ethnic or racial minorities are likely to be difficult to
   place in permanent homes. Placement abroad must, and thankfully does,
   remain an option for these children if timely permanent placement cannot
   be achieved in the child's birth country [97].
   Finally, developing appropriate expectations is a recurring theme for
   families who adopt internationally and should apply to the international
   community as well. A screening system has never been developed that can
   predict human behavior with absolute certainty. Clearly, we must focus
   on placing children in the best possible environment, but no amount of
   preadoption scrutiny or postadoption follow-up can ever prevent the
   isolated cases of abuse that are trumpeted in the media. Policy must be
   based on evidence and not on tabloids, and the data available leave no
   doubt regarding the positive effects of adoption. Out of calamity and
   loss, children recover and progress to become functionally and
   emotionally competent adults [40]. As stated by the distinguished
   adoption researcher Richard Barth [98]:.

AB When Robert and Betty decided to adopt, they never imagined that their
   journey would take them 8000 miles from home to a small industrialized
   city in a remote region of Russia. "Except for one trip to Europe, we'd
   never been out of the US before." The legal requirements for foreigners
   adopting Russian children in the region necessitated two trips for the
   couple. On the first trip, they had the opportunity to meet their
   11-month-old child, Anton, and to spend several hours playing with him
   in the director's office. They videotaped every moment they had with
   Anton. Otherwise, their time was occupied with meetings with lawyers and
   agency representatives and lots of paperwork needed to permit the legal
   adoption of the child to take place. Six weeks later, they returned to
   collect their son and to finalize the court proceedings. This time, the
   trip was easier, because everything was familiar. They knew that there
   were friendly people waiting at the end of their journey, and most
   importantly, they would be able to reunite with their son. They had
   looked at their videotape of their time with Anton "hundreds of times,"
   and had prepared his room in their house. They came fully prepared with
   a suitcase full of cute outfits received as baby shower gifts, toys, and
   lots of baby gear. Excited and giddy, they entered the orphanage
   director's office and presented her with several gifts. Moments later,
   Anton was brought in by one of his caregivers. He solemnly looked at all
   the excited adults in the room and burst into tears, burying his head in
   his caregiver's shoulder.
   This is just one of many ways in which new adoptive parents encounter
   their children. For some, the first time they meet their child is the
   day of the court proceedings to finalize the adoption in the child's
   birth country. For others, adoptive parenthood begins at the end of a
   jet way as their child, escorted from his or her country of origin, is
   entrusted to them. Although the parents have had months or even years to
   prepare for these moments, little preparation is possible for the
   infants and young toddlers who are adopted. As described in elsewhere in
   this issue (see the article by Johnson), many children have lived in
   difficult circumstances before their adoptive placement. Most were born
   to mothers who did not receive prenatal care [1]. Some were exposed
   prenatally to drugs, alcohol, smoking, or sexually transmitted diseases
   (syphilis most commonly). Many experienced neglect or suboptimal care,
   malnutrition, infectious diseases, and other medical problems [2-9]. At
   the time of adoption, growth and developmental delays are common, along
   with disorders of sensory and emotional regulation and "orphanage
   behaviors" (self-comfort and/or self-soothing behaviors) [10-15]. These
   factors all conspire to make the initial transition of the child to his
   new adoptive family potentially difficult.
   Many children and their parents weather this amazing change easily and
   readily move ahead together in their lives together as a family.
   Understandably, however, others experience some difficulties during the
   transition. It is common for children to display some emotional or
   behavioral issues during this time, which are often related to eating,
   sleeping, bathing, diapering, or playing.
   In this article, the immediate behavioral and developmental issues of
   newly adopted children after placement are discussed. Because there has
   been little systematic evaluation published about these issues, most of
   this discussion is based on clinical and research experience in the
   International Adoption Clinic at the New England Medical Center, which
   as been assisting families before, during, and after adoption since
   1988. Some strategies that we have found helpful to ease the transition
   for the parents and the child are also reviewed.
   The transition of a new child into the family may be divided into
   several phases (Table 1). First is the actual moment when the child is
   placed into the physical care of the new adoptive parent(s). Next is the
   period of initial adjustment, usually while the parent(s) are still in
   the child's birth country finalizing the adoption and necessary legal
   requirements to allow the child to travel to the United States. The
   third phase is the trip back to the United States with the child. The
   final part of the transition period is the adjustment of the child and
   family into a routine in their home together. As indicated previously,
   some families whose children are escorted to the United States (South
   Korea and, occasionally, Guatemala and India) plunge directly into the
   final phase. Most families, however, travel to meet and bring home their
   children. Some families travel "blindly," that is, with no information
   about the child before arrival in the birth country. For example,
   parents who adopt from Ukraine typically identify their dreams,
   unexpected reactions to strangers or environments (reminding them of
   someone or something), sudden tears, moodiness, irritability,
   distractibility, grieving, or sadness may all reflect this task.

AB High school teachers of sociology have long been neglected by academic
   sociologists and the ASA. Recent developments are encouraging, however.
   In 2001, the ASA appointed a Task Force on the Advanced Placement Course
   for Sociology in High School, and Teaching Sociology has published three
   articles on high school sociology since that year. Still, there is a
   dire need for research on the characteristics and experiences of
   teachers themselves, and for empirically-based recommendations for
   assisting them. The current study uses questionnaire data to examine the
   personal and professional characteristics of the teachers who offered a
   sociology course in Connecticut public high schools during academic year
   2000-01. The results indicate that teachers have little formal education
   in sociology, are not involved in the professional activities of the
   discipline, and have virtually no exposure to sociology outside of their
   own courses. The paper concludes with recommendations for future
   research and action.

   paper describes one model for creating an international, Web-based,
   distance-learning classroom that can be used as a guide for those who
   might wish to pursue similar endeavors. Our replicated experiences
   teaching a sociology course on social control, twice under slightly
   different conditions, provide the basis for identifying the conditions
   and practices that optimize the goals of providing a forum for
   international education and enhancing reading and writing skills. A
   content analysis of the online Student-Led Discussions provides evidence
   that cross-national knowledge and understanding can be enhanced in this
   learning environment. Enrolling students from the United States,
   Belarus, Russia, and Australia, our course demonstrates how instructors
   can create a successful virtual classroom that truly encircles the
   globe.

AB Objectives: Youth are increasingly at risk for contracting HIV
   infection, and community-level interventions are needed to reduce
   behavioral risk.
   Design: A randomized, controlled, multi-site community-level
   intervention trial was undertaken with adolescents living in 15
   low-income housing developments in five US cities.
   Methods: Baseline (n = 1172), short-term follow-up (n = 865), and
   long-term follow-up (n = 763) risk assessments were conducted among
   adolescents, ages 12-17, in all 15 housing developments. The
   developments were randomly assigned in equal numbers to each of three
   conditions: experimental community-level intervention (five
   developments); 'state-of-the-science' skills training workshops (five
   developments); and, education-only delayed control intervention (five
   developments).
   Results: At long-term follow-up, adolescents living in the housing
   developments receiving the community-level intervention were more likely
   to delay onset of first intercourse (85%) than those in the control
   developments (76%), while those in the workshop developments (78%) did
   not differ from control condition adolescents. Adolescents in both the
   community-level intervention (77%) and workshop (76%) developments were
   more likely to use a condom at last intercourse than those in control
   (62%) developments.
   Conclusions: Community-level interventions that include skills training
   and engage adolescents in neighborhood-based HIV prevention activities
   can produce and maintain reductions in sexual risk behavior, including
   delaying sexual debut and increasing condom use. (c) 2005 Lippincott

AB Migrants often have lower mortality than natives in spite of relatively
   unfavorable social and economic characteristics. Although migrants have
   a short-run advantage due to the selective migration of healthy workers,
   persistent health and mortality differences between migrants and natives
   may be long-run effects of different experiences in childhood. We made
   use of a natural experiment resulting from rural-to-urban migration in
   the mid-19th century. Mortality was much higher in urban areas,
   especially in rapidly growing industrial cities. Migrants usually came
   from healthier rural origins as young adults. Data used in this study is
   available from 19th-century Belgian population registers describing two
   sites: a rapidly growing industrial city and a small town that became an
   industrial suburb. We found evidence of three processes that lead to
   differences between the mortality of migrants and natives. First, recent
   migrants had lower mortality than natives, because they were
   self-selected for good health when they arrived. This advantage
   decreased with time spent in the destination. Second, migrants from
   rural backgrounds had a disadvantage in epidemic years, because they had
   less experience with these diseases. Third, migrants from rural areas
   had lower mortality at older (but not younger) ages, even if they had
   migrated more than 10 years earlier. We interpret this as a long-run
   consequence of less exposure to disease in childhood.

   examine obese women's experiences with weight-loss methods. Six themes
   emerged: failure of weight maintenance, use of psychological and
   spiritual approaches, role of family influences and societal
   expectations, role of African American subculture, method affordability,
   and racial differences in weight-loss methods. Tailored
   weight-management interventions for women, particularly African
   Americans and those of low socioeconomic status, should account for
   features of African American subculture and address affordability
   concerns, include maintenance, strategies that incorporate psychological
   and spiritual principles, and target family attitudes and behaviors.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether race differences in weight gain over
   34 years were because of socioeconomic position (SEP) and psychosocial
   and behavioral factors (physical activity, cigarette smoking, alcohol
   consumption, depression, marital status, number of children). We used a
   life-course approach to SEP with 4 measures of SEP (childhood SEP,
   education, occupation, income) and a cumulative measure of SEP.
   Methods. We used mixed models and data collected from the Alameda County
   Study to examine the association between race and weight change slopes
   and baseline weight in men (n=1186) and women (n=1375) aged 17 to 40
   years at baseline (in 1965).
   Results. All subjects gained weight over time. African American women
   weighed 4.96 kg (P <.001) more at baseline and gained 0.10 kg/year
   (P=.043) more weight than White women. Black men weighed 2.41 kg
   (P=.006) more at baseline but did not gain more weight than White men.
   The association of race with weight gain in women was largely because of
   cumulative SEP score.
   Conclusions. Interventions to prevent overweight and obesity should
   begin early in life and target the socioeconomically disadvantaged.

AB Objectives. To better understand health disparities, we compared US
   weight gain trends across sociodemographic groups between 1986 and 2002.
   Methods. We analyzed mean and 80th-percentile body mass index (BMI),
   calculated from self-reported weight and height, for subpopulations
   defined by education, relative income, race/ethnicity, and gender. Data
   were from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a
   random-digit-dialed telephone survey (total sample =1.88 million adult
   respondents).
   Results. Each sociodemographic group experienced generally similar
   weight gains. We found no statistically significant difference in
   increase in mean BMI by educational attainment, except that individuals
   with a college degree gained less weight than did others. The
   lowest-income group gained as much weight on average as the
   highest-income group, but lowest-income heavier individuals (80th
   percentile of BMI) gained weight faster than highest-income heavier
   individuals. We found no differences across racial/ethnic groups except
   that non-Hispanic Blacks gained more weight than other groups. Women
   gained more weight than men.
   Conclusions. We found fewer differences, especially by relative income
   and education, in weight gain across subpopulations than we had
   expected. Women and non-Hispanic Blacks gained weight faster than other
   groups.

AB Objective: To examine preschoolers' attitudes, expectations, and
   perceptions of tobacco and alcohol use.
   Design: Structured observational study. Children used props and dolls to
   act out a social evening for adults. As part of the role play, each
   child selected items from a miniature grocery store stocked with 73
   different products, including beer, wine, and cigarettes, for an evening
   with friends.
   Setting: A behavioral laboratory at the Department of Psychological and
   Brain Sciences, Dartmouth College.
   Patients: One hundred twenty children, 2 to 6 years old, participated
   individually in the role-playing.
   Results: Children purchased a mean of 17 of the 73 products in the
   store. Thirty-four children (28.3%) bought cigarettes and 74 (61.7%)
   bought alcohol. Children were more likely to buy cigarettes if their
   parents smoked (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.90; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.20-12.63). Children were more likely to buy beer or wine if
   their parents drank alcohol at least monthly (adjusted OR, 3.04; 95% Cl,
   1.02-9.10) or if they viewed PG13- or R-rated movies (adjusted OR, 5.10;
   95% Cl, 1.1422.90). Children's play behavior suggests that they are
   highly attentive to the use and enjoyment of alcohol and tobacco and
   have well-established expectations about how cigarettes and alcohol fit
   into social settings.
   Conclusions: The data suggest that observation of adult behavior,
   especially parental behavior, may influence preschool children to view
   smoking and drinking as appropriate or normative in social situations.
   These perceptions may relate to behaviors adopted later in life.

   early symptoms of marital deterioration but have not yet suffered
   irreversible damage to their marriage. It is during this "at-risk" stage
   when couples might benefit most from early intervention. In response to
   this need we have developed an indicated intervention program called the
   Marriage Checkup (MC) based on the principles of motivational
   interviewing. The current randomized study provides preliminary evidence
   for the attractiveness, tolerability, efficacy, and mechanisms of change

AB It remains unclear whether social anxiety interferes with the generation
   of closeness during initial encounters. We addressed the question of
   whether perceived closeness between strangers differs as a function of
   dyad characteristics (i.e., self and partner levels of social anxiety)
   and social context. We conducted an experiment with 90 participants
   randomly assigned to either a 45-minute personal disclosure or
   small-talk dyadic conversation. Multilevel modeling results yielded a
   3-way interaction, such that the effect of social anxiety on closeness
   generated during the interaction was moderated by social anxiety
   reported by interaction partners and social context. In the personal
   disclosure condition, perceived closeness was greatest when the most
   socially anxious individuals interacted with each other. In the
   small-talk condition, perceived closeness was greatest when the least
   socially anxious individuals interacted with each other. Across
   conditions, partners with substantial differences in social anxiety
   (i.e., mixed dyads) reported relatively less closeness than partners
   with similar levels of social anxiety. Social anxiety effects were not
   attributable to depressive symptoms or physical attraction to partners.
   These findings suggest that neglecting specific qualities of interaction
   partners and social situational factors may lead to spurious conclusions
   in understanding interpersonal outcomes related to social anxiety.

   older who received a diagnosis of breast cancer from 1991 to 1995.
   Information available through 1998 allowed for 3 years of follow-up.
   Results showed that unmarried women were more likely to be diagnosed
   with breast cancer stage II-IV versus stage I and in situ (OR 1.17; CI95
   1.12, 1.23). Unmarried women diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer
   were less likely to receive definitive therapy (OR 1.24; CI95 1.17,
   1.31). Even after controlling for cancer stage and size at diagnosis and
   treatment received, unmarried women were at an increased risk of death
   from breast cancer (HR 1.25; CI95 1.14, 1.37). Socioeconomic variables
   and comorbidity had little impact on the relationship between marital
   status and survival. Older married women were at decreased risk for
   mortality after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Many of the health
   benefits enjoyed by married women are likely derived from increased
   social support and social networks.

AB Study objectives: To determine the effect of an asthma intervention
   program targeted to a predominantly Latino population of inner-city,
   adult asthma patients with a recent emergency department (ED) visit for
   asthma care.
   Design: A prospective study measuring changes in asthma quality of life
   (QOL), asthma knowledge, and ED and hospital utilization in a group of
   patients enrolled in an outpatient asthma intervention program. Setting:
   Academic medical center located in New York City (NYC) and a local
   community-based organization.
   Participants: One hundred ninety-eight patients with asthma > 18 years
   of age and residing in Washington Heights/Inwood, a predominantly,
   Latino community in NYC.
   Measurements: Changes were assessed by hospital and ED utilization and
   mini-juniper QOL score before and after the intervention.
   Results: From July, 2000 through December 2002, 198 patients agreed to
   be enrolled into an asthma intervention program. The mini-juniper QOL
   score improved by 0.67 points. There was a 40% reduction in ED visits
   and a 36% reduction in hospitalizations over 1 year, compared with a 10%
   reduction in ED visits and no reduction in hospitalization rate for a
   control group who declined the intervention.
   Conclusion: A culturally targeted asthma intervention program in adult
   individuals living in a predominantly Latino area of NYC is effective in
   reducing ED and hospital utilization for asthma, and improving overall
   asthma-related QOL.

   changed, according to qualitative analyses, and its use became more
   prevalent in the lower as compared to the upper social strata. In this
   paper, we use national data to investigate the association of education
   and adult cocaine use to test whether this trend represents either a
   'historical period' process that occurred concurrently across adults of
   all age groups or a cohort process that started with younger cohorts and
   only extended to older age groups as these younger cohorts aged. We also
   estimate the extent to which the emergence of crack cocaine use accounts
   for trends in the socioeconomic distribution of cocaine use over
   historical time. To address these questions we analyze data from each
   survey of the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse from 1979 to 1998
   inclusive. The results point to a 'historical period' process that is
   explained in large part - but not entirely - by the emergence of crack
   cocaine. Important differences are apparent across racial and ethnic
   groups, as well as age groups. Cocaine use joins a growing list of
   potentially addictive drugs that have become more prevalent in the lower
   as compared to the upper social strata over historical time. (c) 2005

   was to capture the voices of African-American women telling their
   experiences of stress and support and to have their voices inform the
   development of an identity stress measure representing the realities of
   being Black and female. in this paper, we describe the components of a
   race and gender-specific stress measure emerging from a
   multidisciplinary iterative process that employed qualitative and
   quantitative methods.
   Method: The research was initiated by focus groups and interviews where
   women were asked to share their experiences of stress and support. Four
   hundred seventy-four (474) African-American women from the metropolitan
   Atlanta area collaborated in the study by participating in one or more
   phases of the research. Content analysis of the qualitative data
   informed the development of a 71-item race and gender-specific stress
   measure for African -American women. The scale and a battery of validity
   measures (Spielburger Anger and Anxiety, John Henryism, and
   NHIS-depression) were administered twice over a 30-day period followed
   by group discussions and interviews.
   Results: Content and factor analysis resulted in the development of six
   subscales: racism, burden, personal history, work, support/coping, and
   stress states. The measure has been validated with established measures
   of anger, anxiety, depression. Significant correlations were established
   for all of the stress subscales and measures of anger (trait anger,
   anger-in, anger-out, and anger expression). Findings indicate
   significant correlations for the burden subscale and anger-in (r=.33,
   <.01) and stress states and trait anxiety (r=.57, <.01).

   average body dimensions of women, within the context of an ostensive

   Results: Exposure to the thin-ideal confederate resulted in an increase

   thin-ideal internalization, perceived sociocultural pressure,

AB Based on three principles from theories of human ecology, this study
   examines the response of downtown churches in metropolitan Columbus,
   Ohio to a changing environment. Over 150 years, churches grew in number,
   stabilized, contracted sharply, and restabilized, changing increasingly
   from neighborhood to niche churches. Better-funded larger and older
   churches survived by developing heterogeneous religious and other ties
   with diverse weekday populations of downtown residents, employees,
   shoppers, and transients. Churches closer to the city center had more
   opportunities to develop these relationships. Sociological factors such
   as theology, leadership, and external resources from the metropolis,
   state, and nation also played a role. The interaction of sociological
   and ecological frameworks on both macro and micro levels explains the
   response of religious organizations to specific urban environments.

   and insight in the prediction of violence in a psychiatric inpatient
   sample. Violence history, demographic information, symptomatology,
   neuropsychological functioning, social cognition (i.e., attributional
   style), and insight were assessed in 29 inpatients with severe mental
   illness. Greater posttest violence was associated with greater pretest
   violence, less education, greater psychiatric distress,
   neuropsychological impairment, and hostile attributional and
   personalizing biases. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed
   that history of violence contributed the most variance to posttest
   violence. Hostile attributional and personalizing biases were also
   uniquely associated with posuest violence. Overall, this study supported
   the modest utility of attributional style measures in the prediction of
   inpatient violence. The predictive value of insight in this context

AB Many gay American Indian (GAI) men feel alienated from their tribal,
   ceremonial and social communities because of homophobia and
   heterosexism. As a result, they often turn to their local gay community
   for social participation and sex opportunities. It is no secret that a
   significant aspect of some gay communities is socializing in local bars
   and clubs. The gay bar scene makes healthy living difficult for Native
   American gay men. This is especially the case for those who are in
   alcohol or drug recovery. In response, gay Native men's support groups
   are attempting to make available a cultural alternative to the double
   bind of alienation from one's Native community and exposure to substance
   abuse by providing alcohol and substance free opportunities for
   ceremonial and social involvement. The hope is that the men will go to
   bars less frequently and instead turn to Native cultural activities in
   men's groups for social, spiritual and emotional support. The logic of
   this approach assumes that individuals who are culturally invested in a
   community will gain a level of self and social acceptance, making them
   less likely to abuse substances and put themselves at risk for HIV
   infection. The information presented in this article comes from over six
   years of ethnographic research among GAI men concerning self and social
   acceptance, HIV/AIDS and American Indian GLBT identity.

AB Objective. Pain and psychological distress are associated with fatigue,
   and social support may play a buffering role in the adjustment to a
   chronic disease. Investigations of the relationship between fatigue and
   disease activity in chronic diseases have provided inconclusive
   findings. The influence of medications on perceived fatigue remains
   unclear. We investigated the relationship between pain, depression,
   fatigue, and disease activity in patients with systemic lupus
   erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods. Participants (n = 127) completed a psychosocial questionnaire
   during routine clinic visits. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis
   was conducted to predict the contribution of disease activity, pain,
   depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and perceived social support to
   fatigue.
   Results. Disease activity as measured by SLE Disease Activity Index
   (SLEDAI) did not significantly predict self-reported levels of fatigue.
   Medication usage did not predict fatigue levels. Pain and depression
   were both unique positive predictors of fatigue. Controlling for pain
   and depression, perceived social support contributed negatively to the
   variance in fatigue scores, suggesting a buffering effect. This model
   reliably explained 42% of the variance in fatigue scores.
   Conclusion. Our results emphasize the importance of depression, pain,
   and perceived social support in predicting reported fatigue levels in
   patients with SLE. In contrast, disease activity measured by SLEDAI does
   not appear to account for fatigue in SLE. Understanding the effect of
   psychosocial factors on fatigue in SLE may improve patient outcomes
   through psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing pain and increasing
   coping skills and social support.

AB In the United States, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and in particular
   end-stage renal disease (ESRD), represent a growing problem. Many other
   countries also have an increasing number of ESRD cases. Racial/ethnic
   disparities have been documented globally in the prevalence, incidence,
   and treatment of CKD, most extensively in the United States, but also in
   the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, among others. In many
   circumstances, these disparities are of a negative nature, that is,
   certain racial/ethnic groups fare worse than their white counterparts
   with respect to the treatment or outcome of CKD. However, in a few
   circumstances, they are of a positive nature, such as the survival
   advantage seen in minorities with ESRD compared with whites. The reasons
   for racial disparities in the prevalence, incidence, and treatment of
   CKD are not fully understood, although they are explained partly by
   coexisting medical conditions and modifiable risk factors, such as
   socioeconomic, lifestyle, and cultural. It is likely, however, that the
   complete picture incorporates a complex interaction between these
   sociocultural, genetic, and environmental factors. In a global society
   that prides itself on a high level of sensitivity and equality, there is
   an ethical and moral imperative to address the continuing racial/ethnic
   disparities in CKD and many of the factors underlying this epidemic. We
   review data highlighting the racial/ethnic disparities that exist in the
   incidence and treatment of CKD, with particular emphasis on ESRD. A
   better understanding of both the negative and positive racial/ethnic
   disparities may yield important insights, which can inform future
   research strategies and improve health outcomes for all patients
   afflicted with CKD.

AB Background. Rapid health and nutrition transitional changes are
   resulting in greater prominence of non-communicable disease (NCD) in
   Latin America, particularly among the poor.
   Objective. The study aims to examine the extent to which NCD pxfsrevails
   in Peru and the socioeconomic status (SES) as a risk factor.
   Design. Between 1998 and 2000, health surveys and clinical assessments
   were completed on 2337 adults in six cities, 18 to 60 years of age.
   Stratified by social class, multi-staged random sampling was used.
   Anthropometric data, blood pressure and serum samples were collected.
   Results. Adjusting for age, hypertension, low HDL cholesterol, high
   total cholesterol and diabetes was found in 47%, 40%, 21% and 17% of
   women and in 44%, 38%, 27% and 19% of men, respectively. Over one
   quarter of the population exhibited multiple risk factors, not including
   overweight and obesity. Across all study sites, lowest SES revealed
   highest burden of NCD and appeared as an independent risk factor for
   associated NCD indicators.
   Conclusion. The high prevalence of NCD in urban areas of Peru is not
   only associated with excess body weight, but also with poverty itself.
   The greater burden of NCD in the poorest areas of society requires a
   better understanding of causal determinants and may have implications in
   terms of public health policies and interventions. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB Objective: Attempt to replicate a report that people whose names have
   positive initials (such as ACE or VIP) live much longer than do people
   with negative initials (such as PIG or DIE). The primary analysis in the
   original 1969 to 1995 study grouped decedents by year of death; however,
   average-age-at-death calculations for decedents grouped in this way can
   be misleading if the frequency of initials changes over time. Grouping
   the decedents by birth year solves this problem and provides a more
   natural test of whether there is a statistical relationship between
   initials and longevity. Methods: The California Department of Health
   Services mortality database was used to identify the birth year and age
   at death of decedents with positive or negative initials, as defined by
   the original study and as chosen by a new survey. Results: There is no
   substantial or statistically significant relationship between either set
   of initials and longevity when decedents are grouped by birth year,
   either for the original study period 1969 to 1995 or for the longer
   period 1905 to 2003. Conclusion: These data do not indicate that
   mortality is affected by one's initials.

   statistical significance testing flourished in the 20th century.
   Contagion processes and the suitability of significance testing given a
   study's data characteristics encourage the diffusion of significance
   testing, whereas institutional factors such as department prestige and
   particular editorships help explain growing popularity of the. 05 alpha

AB Environmental harms involve a "double diversion" - two forms of
   privilege that deserve greater attention. The first involves
   disproportionality, or the privileged diversion of rights/resources:
   Contrary to common assumptions, much environmental damage is not
   economically "necessary" - instead, it represents privileged access to
   the environment. It is made possible in part by the second diversion -
   the diversion of attention, or distraction - largely through
   taken-for-granted or privileged accounts, which are rarely questioned,
   even in leftist critiques. Data show that, rather than producing
   advanced materials, major polluters tend to be inefficient producers of
   low-value commodities, and rather than being major employers, they can
   have emissions-to-jobs ratios a thousand times worse than the economy as
   a whole. Instead of simply focusing on overall/average levels of
   environmental problems, sociologists also need to examine
   disproportionalities, analyzing the socially structured nature Of
   environmental and discursive privileges. Doing so can offer important
   opportunities for insights, not just about nature, but also about the
   nature of power, and about the power of the naturalized.

AB Objectives. Wright and Perrone (1977) was an outstanding empirical
   analysis of social stratification, a major contribution to Marxist
   analysis of classes in modern capitalism, and an important contribution
   to popular discourse and academic research on "social class" in the
   United States. Since 1977, however, debates with "bean counters" in
   sociology and "epistemological and ontological purists" within Marxism
   have yielded a multidimensional game-theoretic exploitation model that
   falls far short of Wright and Perrone (1977) on standards of social
   science, Marxism, commonsense, and the potential for inspiring future
   scholarship. Thus I propose moving away from game theory and toward
   Tilly's (1998) model of durable inequality, which might accommodate the
   dialectic of life and work. Methods. An OLS regression analysis of
   income inequality among white men in the United States illustrates the
   benefits of this reconceptualization in capturing the interactive
   effects of occupational titles, educational credentials, and class
   relations. Results. Specifically, we find that the professional earnings
   advantage is associated with J.D. and M.D. credentials and small-scale
   proprietorship, rather than supervisorial authority or ownership in
   large-scale corporate practice. Conclusions. These results suggest that
   we should reconsider the Wright (1997) conceptualization of Marxist
   class categories.

AB Much of our knowledge about police behavior "on the street" is based on
   in-person observation of the police. However, little research has
   examined how the observers can potentially bias observational data. In
   this paper, anecdotal accounts from a variety of field settings are
   categorized into four potential sources of observer bias. Secondary
   analyses of data from a large-scale observational study of police are
   used to assess the impact of three out of the four type of observer bias
   (reactivity, going native, and burnout). There is evidence of reactivity
   for arrest, but not use of force behavior and little support for going
   native and burnout. More generally, observer bias is categorized as: (1)
   threats to the validity of observational data collected at different
   stages of fieldwork; and (2) the potential for human error implicit in
   observational data. The incorporation of a semi-structured field diary
   is suggested to more systematically document all four types of observer
   bias in future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   several features, including political and economic systems,
   publicly-funded universal healthcare and favourable health outcomes,
   these countries nevertheless have distinct maternity care systems. We
   use the profession of midwifery, found in all four countries, as a
   'touchstone' for exploring the sources of this diversity. Our analysis
   focuses on three key dimensions: (1) welfare state approaches to
   legalising midwifery and negotiating the role of the midwife in the
   division of labour; (2) professional boundaries in the maternity care
   domain; and (3) consumer mobilisation in support of midwifery and around
   maternity issues.

AB We live in a "small world," where two arbitrary people are likely
   connected by a short chain of intermediate friends. With scant
   information about a target individual, people can successively forward a
   message along such a chain. Experimental studies have verified this
   property in real social networks, and theoretical models have been
   advanced to explain it. However, existing theoretical models have not
   been shown to capture behavior in real-world social networks. Here, we
   introduce a richer model relating geography and social-network
   friendship, in which the probability of befriending a particular person
   is inversely proportional to the number of closer people. In a large
   social network, we show that one-third of the friendships are
   independent of geography and the remainder exhibit the proposed
   relationship. Further, we prove analytically that short chains can be
   discovered in every network exhibiting the relationship.

   Results. Despite being better educated, subjects with RA ages 55-64
   years had lower employment rates than individuals of the same age in the
   US (women 40% versus 53% and men 54% versus 66%). These older subjects
   with RA had stopped working more often than younger subjects with RA,
   and more worked part time (40% versus 34%; P < 0.01). However, the older
   subjects used sick time less often than younger subjects (35% versus
   41%; P < 0.01) and were similarly limited in job demands, e.g., physical
   demands (mean WLQ subscale score 27.0 versus 26.6; P = 0.65). Median
   household income of older employed subjects was $20,000 greater than
   that of retired subjects; 56% of retired subjects had incomes lower than
   US median income versus 32% of employed subjects, and 11% had income
   below the poverty level.
   Conclusion. Premature work cessation in persons with RA ages 55-64 years
   is a serious problem that needs to be addressed.

AB Recent years have seen a number of challenges to social stability and
   order, ranging from terrorist attacks and natural disasters to epidemics
   such as AIDS and SARS. Such challenges have generated specific policy
   responses, such as enhanced security at transportation hubs and planned
   deployment of a global tsunami detection network. However, the range of
   challenges and the practical impossibility of adequately addressing each
   in turn argue for adoption of a more comprehensive systems perspective.
   This should be based on the principle of enhancing social and economic
   resiliency as well as meeting security and emergency response needs and,
   to the extent possible, developing and implementing dual-use
   technologies that offer societal benefits even if anticipated disasters
   never occur.

AB Background Understanding of local knowledge and practices relating to
   the newborn period, as locally defined, is needed in the development of
   interventions to reduce neonatal mortality. We describe the organisation
   of the neonatal period in Sylhet District, Bangladesh, the perceived
   threats to the well-being of neonates, and the ways in which families
   seek to protect them.
   Methods We did 39 in-depth, unstructured, qualitative interviews with
   mothers, fathers, and grandmothers of neonates, and traditional birth
   attendants. Data on neonatal knowledge and practices were also obtained
   from a household survey of 6050 women who had recently given birth.
   Findings Interviewees defined the neonatal period as the first 40 days
   of life (chollish din). Confinement of the mother and baby is most
   strongly observed before the noai ceremony on day 7 or 9, and involves
   restriction of movement outside the home, sleeping where the birth took
   place rather than in the mother's bedroom, and sleeping on a mat on the
   floor. Newborns are seen as vulnerable to cold air, cold food or drinks
   (either directly or indirectly through the mother), and to malevolent
   spirits or evil eye. Bathing, skin care, confinement, and dietary
   practices all aim to reduce exposure to cold, but some of these
   practices might increase the risk of hypothermia.
   Interpretation Although fatalism and cultural acceptance of high
   mortality have been cited as reasons for high levels of neonatal
   mortality, Sylheti families seek to protect newborns in several ways.
   These actions reflect a set of assumptions about the newborn period that
   differ from those of neonatal health specialists, and have implications
   for the design of interventions for neonatal care.

AB Effectiveness of HIV-related mental health practice in inner cities has
   not been adequately documented despite an urgent need for interventions
   for populations disproportionately affected by the epidemic. Practices
   must take into account and respond to cultural issues of people of
   colour and the needs of those infected through injection drug use or
   heterosexual sex with IDUs. We report the effectiveness of an HIV mental
   health programme integrated with primary care and emphasizing cultural
   responsiveness. A sample of 47 of 188 patients who received psychiatric
   and psychotherapy services was compared with other subjects. The 47 had
   an average of 8.34 encounters over an average of 36.23 weeks. Consumers
   of project services used mental health care at a higher rate than did
   comparison subjects. Regression analyses indicated that utilization was
   related to reduction in reported mental health problems, HIV-related
   physical symptoms, and use of alcohol and powdered cocaine, as well as
   to improvement in social functioning. Our clients, individuals often
   viewed as not likely to avail themselves of or benefit from mental
   health care, were highly motivated for self-improvement and, given
   access to competent, convenient and culturally respectful services,
   improved their well-being in significant domains.

AB There is a growing movement in medical genetics to develop, implement,
   and promote a model of race-based medicine. Although race-based medicine
   may become a widely disseminated standard of care, messages that
   advocate race-based selection for diagnosing, screening and prescribing
   drugs may exacerbate health disparities. These messages are present in
   clinical genetic counseling sessions, mass media, and everyday talk.
   Messages promoting linkages among genes, race, and health and messages
   emphasizing genetic causation may promote both general racism and
   genetically based racism. This mini-review examines research in three
   areas: studies that address the effects of these messages about genetics
   on levels of genetic determinism and genetic discrimination; studies
   that address the effects of these messages on attitudes about race; and,
   studies of the impacts of race-specific genetic messages on recipients.
   Following an integration of this research, this mini-review suggests
   that the current literature appears fragmented because of methodological
   and measurement issues and offers strategies for future research.
   Finally, the authors offer a path model to help organize future research
   examining the effects of messages about genetics on socioculturally
   based racism, genetically based racism, and unaccounted for racism.
   Research in this area is needed to understand and mitigate the negative
   attitudinal effects of messages that link genes, race, and health and/or
   emphasize genetic causation.

AB Objective: To investigate individual level determinants of self rated
   health and happiness, as well as the extent of community level
   covariation in health and happiness.
   Design: Multivariate multilevel regression analysis of self rated poor
   health and unhappiness at level 1, nested within 24118 people at level
   2, nested within 36 communities at level 3. Data were obtained from the
   2000 social capital benchmark survey.
   Setting: USA communities.
   Participants: 24118 adults.
   Main outcome measures: Self reported fair/poor health; and a single item
   measure of subjective wellbeing.
   Results: Controlling for demographic markers, a strong income and
   education gradient was seen for self rated poor health and unhappiness,
   with the gradient being stronger for poor health. Community level
   correlations between self rated poor health and happiness were stronger
   (0.65) than the individual level correlations (0.16) between the two
   outcomes.
   Conclusion: Poor health and unhappiness are highly positively correlated
   within individuals, and communities that are healthier tend to be
   happier and vice versa.

AB BACKGROUND: While older individuals who are homeless tend to be in
   poorer health, it is less clear how they view their health care needs
   and whether their self-reported patterns for accessing health services
   differ from younger homeless counterparts.
   METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based survey of homeless adults in
   Pittsburgh and Philadelphia using face-to-face interviews from
   population proportionate sampling of sites and random sampling of
   subjects. Survey questions included physical and mental health
   comorbidities, self-reported health care, social services and personal
   needs, means of economic support, and sources for usual health care. For
   analysis purposes, respondents were grouped by age 18 to 49 years old
   and 50 years old or older.
   RESULTS: Overall, 531 adults were interviewed, with 74 respondents 50
   years old or older (13.9%). Older homeless persons were 3.6 times more
   likely to report a chronic medical condition, 2.8 times more likely to
   have health insurance, and 2.4 times more likely to be dependent on
   heroin than homeless persons less than 50 years old. However, they also
   tended to use shelter-based clinics and street outreach teams more
   commonly as their source of usual care (20.9% vs 10.6%, P = .02) and
   were significantly less likely to report a need for substance abuse
   treatment despite high rates of abuse.
   CONCLUSION: Older homeless adults have a greater disease burden than
   their younger counterparts. However, it is unclear whether these needs
   are being appropriately identified and met. There is a need for specific
   and targeted outreach to connect them to appropriate services.

AB Objectives. We identified psychosocial, structural, and cultural
   barriers to seeking dental care among nonutilizing caregivers of
   Medicaid-enrolled children.
   Methods. We used Medicaid utilization records to identify utilizing and
   nonutilizing African American and White caregivers of Medicaid-enrolled
   children in Jefferson County, Kentucky. We conducted 8 focus groups
   (N=76) with a stratified random sample of responding caregivers;
   transcripts were qualitatively analyzed.
   Results. Psychosocial factors associated with utilization included oral
   health beliefs, norms of caregiver responsibility, and positive
   caregiver dental experiences. Utilizing groups reported higher
   education; health beliefs included identifying oral health with overall
   health and professional preventive dental care with caregiver
   responsibility for children's overall health. These beliefs may mediate
   shared structural barriers, including transportation, school absence
   policies, discriminatory treatment, and difficulty locating providers
   who accept Medicaid. Expectation of poor oral health among some
   low-income caregivers was among factors identified with nonutilization.
   Conclusions. Disadvantaged caregivers reported multiple barriers to
   accessing dental care for their children. Providers, Medicaid
   administrators, and schools must coordinate steps to encourage
   caregiver-controlled dental care, build trust, and link professional
   preventive dental care with caregiver responsibility for children's
   overall health.

AB Objectives. We examined the ways in which levels of preventive dental
   care and unmet dental needs varied among subgroups of low-income
   children.
   Methods. Data were drawn from the 2002 National Survey of America's
   Families. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses, including
   logistic regression analyses, to assess relationships between
   socioeconomic, demographic, and health factors and receipt of preventive
   dental care and unmet dental needs.
   Results. More than half of low-income children without health insurance
   had no preventive dental care visits. Levels of unmet dental needs among
   low-income children who had private health insurance coverage but no
   dental benefits were similar to those among uninsured children. Children
   of parents whose mental health was rated as poor were twice as likely to
   have unmet dental needs as other children.
   Conclusions. Additional progress toward improving the dental health of
   low income children depends on identifying and responding to factors
   limiting both the demand for and the supply of dental services. In
   particular, it appears that expanding access to dental benefits is key
   to improving the oral health of this population.

AB Context: Since deinstitutionalization, most persons with severe mental
   illness (SMI) now live in the community, where they are at great risk
   for crime victimization.
   Objectives: To determine the prevalence and incidence of crime
   victimization among persons with SMI by sex, race/ethnicity, and age,
   and to compare rates with general population data (the National Crime
   Victimization Survey), controlling for income and demographic
   differences between the samples.
   Design: Epidemiologic study of persons in treatment. independent
   master's-level clinical research interviewers administered the National
   Crime Victimization Survey to randomly selected patients sampled from 16
   randomly selected mental health agencies.
   Setting: Sixteen agencies providing outpatient, day, and residential
   treatment to persons with SMI in Chicago, III.
   Participants: Randomly selected, stratified sample of 936 patients aged
   18 or older (483 men, 453 women) who were African American (n=329),
   non-Hispanic white (n=321), Hispanic (n=270), or other race/ethnicity (n
   = 22). The comparison group comprised 32449 participants in the National
   Crime Victimization Survey.
   Main Outcome Measure: National Crime Victimization Survey, developed by
   the Bureau of justice Statistics.
   Results: More than one quarter of persons with SMI had been victims of a
   violent crime in the past year, a rate more than 11 times higher than
   the general population rates even after controlling for demographic
   differences between the 2 samples (P <.001). The annual incidence of
   violent crime in the SMI sample (168.2 incidents per 1000 persons) is
   more than 4 times higher than the general population rates (39.9
   incidents per 1000 persons) (P <.001). Depending on the type of violent
   crime (rape/sexual assault, robbery, assault, and their subcategories),
   prevalence was 6 to 23 times greater among persons with SMI than among
   the general population.
   Conclusions: Crime victimization is a major public health problem among
   persons with SMI who are treated in the community. We recommend
   directions for future research, propose modifications in public policy,
   and suggest how the mental health system can respond to reduce
   victimization and its consequences.

AB Objective To examine the costs of complementary information generation
   activities in a resource-constrained setting and compare the costs and
   outputs of information subsystems that generate the statistics on
   poverty, health and survival required for monitoring, evaluation and
   reporting on health programmes in the United Republic of Tanzania.
   Methods Nine systems used by four government agencies or ministries were
   assessed. Costs were calculated from budgets and expenditure data made
   available by information system managers. System coverage, quality
   assurance and information production were reviewed using questionnaires
   and interviews. Information production was characterized in terms of 38
   key sociodemographic indicators required for national programme
   monitoring.
   Findings In 2002-03 approximately US$ 0.53 was spent per Tanzanian
   citizen on the nine information subsystems that generated information on
   37 of the 38 selected indicators. The census and reporting system for
   routine health service statistics had the largest participating
   populations and highest total costs. Nationally representative household
   surveys and demographic surveillance systems (which are not based on
   nationally representative samples) produced more than half the
   indicators and used the most rigorous quality assurance. Five systems
   produced fewer than 13 indicators and had comparatively high costs per
   participant.
   Conclusion Policy-makers and programme planners should be aware of the
   many trade-offs with respect to system costs, coverage, production,
   representativeness and quality control when making investment choices
   for monitoring and evaluation. In future, formal cost-effectiveness
   studies of complementary information systems would help guide
   investments in the monitoring, evaluation and planning needed to
   demonstrate the impact of poverty-reduction and health programmes.

AB Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death for the U.S.

   behavioral correlates of smoking behavior among urban, multiethnic
   Latino primary care patients seen in community clinics. Spanish-language
   interviews were completed with 141 current smokers and 158 former and
   nonsmokers. Twenty countries of origin were represented. Eighty-three
   percent of participants were from Central or South America and 71% spoke
   primarily Spanish. Current smokers were more likely than nonsmokers or
   former smokers to originate from South America (38% versus 26%) and to
   be single (63% versus 42%). Current smokers also were more likely to use
   alcohol on a regular basis (59% versus 31%) and to experience daily
   symptoms of depression (29% versus 19%). Logistic regression analysis
   suggested a moderating effect of depression on the relationship between
   alcohol use and smoking, such that current users of alcohol who reported
   depression were more likely to smoke (82%) than were current users of
   alcohol who did not report depression (56%). As both social and
   behavioral factors were uniquely associated with smoking, country of
   origin, marital status, and comorbid alcohol use and depression should
   be considered in designing and implementing tobacco control
   interventions targeted to this community.

AB Sicily has long been represented in literature and in historical and
   social science texts as a place that is burdened by cultural values and
   practices that resist modernity: clientelism and corruption, familism,
   patriarchy, and lack of trust are said to condemn the island to
   backwardness. Sicily's association with the mafia adds a further
   negative image to these representations, an image of organized
   criminality that is conflated with Sicilian culture in general. Much as
   in the "Southern Question" discourse in Italy and similar constructions
   of otherness elsewhere, novelists, scholars, and public intellectuals
   present these characteristics as essential traits - as if there were a
   homogenized "Sicilian culture" that reproduced itself consistently
   through time. Eric R. Wolf was a brilliant critic of this way of
   thinking about culture, insisting, rather, that complex historical
   processes produce differentiated sociocultural forms over time in any
   given location. Inspired by his example, we trace the differentiated
   histories of the mafia and antimafia forms in Sicily, analyzing the
   contrasting values and practices that are specific to each. Our purpose
   is to represent Sicily as culturally plural and to generate a framework
   for recognizing and combating the all too common tendency to criminalize
   entire populations believed to have a common culture.

AB Purpose: Two earlier population-based studies provide conflicting
   information on the association between low socioeconomic status (SES)
   and risk for epilepsy. Seizure etiologies (e.g., head injury, stroke)
   associated with low SES were not addressed in prior analyses. We assess
   the relation between SES indices and incident epilepsy separately for
   children and adults and in subgroups defined by seizure etiology.
   Methods: In this population-based case-control study, a surveillance
   system identified incident unprovoked seizure or first diagnosis of
   epilepsy throughout Iceland (n = 418). Controls were selected from the
   population registry as the next two same-sex births alive, residing in
   Iceland at the time of the index seizure, and without a history of
   unprovoked seizure on the date of the case's incident seizure (n = 835).
   The odds ratio measured the association between SES and epilepsy.
   Results: An association was found between epilepsy and SES among adults,
   but not among children. Among adults, low education was associated with
   an increased risk for epilepsy [odds ratio (OR), 2.29; 95% confidence
   interval (CI), 1.21-4.34), and home ownership was protective (OR, 0.63;
   95% CI, 0.43-0.92). When analyses were repeated by seizure etiology,
   this association remained only in the group with epilepsy of unknown
   cause, even after adjusting for alcohol consumption.
   Conclusions: Low SES, indexed by low education or lack of home
   ownership, is a risk factor for epilepsy in adults, but not in children,
   suggesting a cumulative effect of SES on risk for epilepsy. This
   association is not explained by established risk factors for epilepsy
   (e.g., head injury, stroke). We find no evidence of a downward social
   drift among cases whose parents had epilepsy.

AB There are several compelling reasons to expect that gender equality may
   serve to foster state environmentalism. However, most previous research
   on environmental politics has neglected gender To help further our
   understanding of the connection between gender and environmental
   politics, the authors empirically assess the association between the
   representation of women in national Parliament and environmental treaty
   ratification, using a large sample of nations. The findings indicate
   that nations with higher proportions of women in Parliament are more
   prone to ratify environmental treaties than are other nations. The
   results point to the importance of considering the role of gender in
   analyses of state behavior and environmental politics and art consistent
   with the argument of some feminist theorists that the exploitation of
   nature and the exploitation of women are interconnected.

AB Background This study examines how changes in cognition over time are
   related to participation in social activities and the extent of social
   networks.
   Methods Data are drawn from a population-based, longitudinal study that
   began in 1989 among elderly Taiwanese. An over-dispersed Poisson model
   is used to regress the number of failed cognitive tasks (0-5) in 1996,
   1999, and 2000 on prior measures of cognitive impairment, social
   activities, social networks, health status, and sociodemographic
   characteristics. The analysis sample comprises 2387 individuals, who
   contribute a total of 4603 observations across three survey intervals
   (1993-96, 1996-99, 1999-2000).
   Results After adjusting for prior cognitive impairment, baseline health
   status, and sociodemographic factors, respondents who participated in
   one or two social activities failed 13% fewer cognitive tasks (P < 0.01)
   than those with no social activities; those who engaged in three or more
   activities failed 33% fewer cognitive tasks (P < 0.001). In contrast,
   none of the social network measures was related to cognitive impairment.
   Conclusions Despite a social structure where elderly persons often live
   with their children and social interaction is likely to be more
   family-centered than in western countries, data from Taiwan suggest that
   participation in social activities outside the family may have a bigger
   impact on cognitive function than social contacts with family or
   non-relatives.

AB Background Though associations between income inequality and birth
   outcome have been suggested, mechanisms underlying this relationship are
   not known. in this analysis, we examined the relationship between income
   inequality and preterm birth (PTB) and post-neonatal mortality (PNM) to
   explore two potential mechanisms-the proposed psychosocial stress and
   neo-material pathways.
   Methods Data on singleton births from 1998 to 2000 were obtained from
   the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics' Linked Birth and Infant
   Death files. The Gini Index was utilized to measure income inequality
   and was divided into tertiles representing high, medium, and low
   county-level inequality. To determine the association between the birth
   outcomes and county income inequality and to account for clustering
   within counties, we employed generalized estimating equation (GEE)
   modelling.
   Results PTB increased from 8.3% in counties with low income inequality
   to 10.0% in counties with high inequality. The Gini Index remained
   modestly associated with PTB after adjusting for individual level
   variables and mean county-level per capita income within the total
   population (AOR: 1.06; 95% Cl 1.03-1.09) as well as within most of the
   racial/ethnic groups. PNM increased from 1.15 deaths per 1000 live
   births in low inequality counties to 1.32 in high-inequality counties.
   However, after adjustment, income inequality was only associated with
   PNM within the non-Hispanic black population (AOR: 1.20; 95% Cl
   1.03-1.39).
   Conclusions These findings may provide some support for the association
   between income inequality and PTB. Further research is required to
   elucidate the biological mechanisms of income inequality.

AB Background The ratio of male to female live births (i.e. the sex ratio)
   reportedly falls when populations suffer rare and extreme ambient
   stressors such as the collapse of national economies. This association
   has been attributed to the death of male fetuses and to reduced
   conception of males. We assess the validity of the first of these
   mechanisms by testing the hypothesis that the fetal death sex ratio
   varies positively over time with the unemployment rate. Using the
   unemployment rate also allows us to determine if ambient economic
   stressors less extreme than collapsing national economies affect the
   fetal death sex ratio.
   Methods We test our hypotheses by applying time-series methods to
   monthly counts of fetal deaths and the unemployment rate from the state
   of California beginning January 1989 and ending December 2001. The
   methods control for trends, seasonal cycles, and other forms of
   autocorrelation that could induce spurious associations.
   Results Results support the fetal death mechanism in that male fetal
   deaths increased above the values expected from female deaths and from
   history in months in which the unemployment rate also increased over its
   expected value.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that ambient stressors as common as
   increasing unemployment elevate the risk of fetal death among males. We
   discuss the social, economic, and health costs borne by parents and
   communities afflicted with these fetal deaths.

AB Background: Effective on January 1, 2001, New York State enacted the
   Expanded Syringe Access Demonstration Program (ESAP), which allows
   syringes to be sold in pharmacies without a prescription or dispensed
   through doctors, hospitals, and clinics to persons 18 years of age or
   older and permits the possession of those syringes for the purposes of
   injecting drugs.
   Objective: To assess changes in receptive syringe sharing since the
   inception of the ESAP
   Methods: Sociodemographic characteristics and syringe use data regarding
   the last injection episode were combined from 3 projects (n = 1181)
   recruiting injection drug users in ongoing studies in Harlem and the
   Bronx in New York City from January 2001 through June 2003. These data
   were analyzed as serial cross sections by calendar quarter.
   Results: Receptive sharing decreased significantly over time, from 13.4%
   in the first quarter to 3.6% in the last quarter. Obtaining the last
   injection syringe from an ESAP source (mostly pharmacies) increased
   significantly over time, from 7.5% in the first quarter to 25.0% in the
   last quarter. In multiple logistic regression analysis, variables that
   were significantly associated with less receptive sharing were syringe
   exchange and ESAP syringe source as well as time since ESAP inception.
   Female gender and white race/ethnicity were significantly associated
   with greater receptive sharing.
   Conclusions: The increase in the use of pharmacies and other ESAP
   syringe sources in this sample has been accompanied by a decline in
   receptive sharing.

   utilization among 141 low-income, predominantly African American family
   practice patients. Subjects completed one year of stress assessments
   including major and minor life events. Four years of prospective medical
   utilization was collected, including outpatient, inpatient, and
   emergency department visits. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to
   assess the predictive value of minor life events for utilization, after
   controlling for demographic variables and major life events. The impact
   of minor life events was a significant predictor of outpatient
   utilization, accounting for 3.6% of the variance. Minor life events were
   unrelated to emergency department and inpatient visits. The relationship
   between minor life events and some types of utilization suggests
   traditional stress management techniques may be beneficial in reducing
   utilization for some patients, although such conclusions are tempered by
   the modest relationship between stress and utilization.

   existing population of English-language workplace ethnographies and find
   that relative to interviews, observation and especially participant
   observation consistently yield more information. Participant observation
   provides greater informational yield as well as more detailed
   descriptions of workplace behaviors and group dynamics. Interviews,
   however are more likely to provide information on basic organizational
   characteristics, such as organization size and product market
   conditions. The authors' findings have important implications for
   university institutional review boards, which have in recent years made
   it increasingly difficult for projects based on participant observation
   to receive human subjects clearance. Our conclusions caution against

   using a nationally representative, longitudinal sample of 1361 children.
   Parental emotional support was assessed using the Home Observation for
   the Measurement of the Environment, incorporating both parent report and
   interviewer observation. We found that, controlling for child
   externalizing problems at age 6 years, parental emotional support at age
   6 years was negatively related to child externalizing problems at age 8
   years. A developmental model that assessed the timing of the emergence
   of this relationship was then analyzed by including parental emotional
   support at ages 2, 4, and 6 years as predictors of child externalizing
   problems at age 8 years. The developmental model suggested that less
   parental emotional support as early as age 2 years is associated with
   later externalizing problems in children. This study discusses the
   importance of very early parental emotional support in promoting
   positive child development.

AB It is well known that nonwhite minority participation in clinical
   research is lower than their representation in the community. The goal
   of this study was to assess satisfaction of minority community members
   in Omaha with the care received and cultural competency of healthcare
   providers. We sought input from Omaha minority communities on how to
   improve the care they received and asked why they did not participate in
   healthcare research. Seventy-two minority members representing African
   Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Sudanese, and
   Vietnamese; and eight whites were surveyed, The results of this study
   indicated that the majority of our respondents were satisfied with the
   care they received, but for a small percentage, language, communication
   and/or culture contributed to dissatisfaction. In addition, some
   respondents did not think the provider was culturally competent, i.e.,
   not sufficiently knowledgeable about their racial, ethnic and/or
   cultural background. Some participants indicated that they preferred a
   provider of similar racial, ethnic and/or cultural background, and/or
   thought some diseases were better treated by a provider of the same
   racial, ethnic and/or cultural background. Regardless of the cultural
   competency of the provider, the overwhelming majority of our respondents
   (with the exception of African Americans) indicated a willingness to
   participate in healthcare research. In conclusion, this study found that
   satisfaction with healthcare providers was not associated with perceived
   cultural competency and that the cultural competency of the provider did
   not affect patient willingness to participate in healthcare research;
   however, we acknowledge that the Hawthorne effect may be in operation.

AB A convergence of issues suggests that protecting child health is not so
   much a matter of research, but rather a matter of policy and advocacy.
   First, we have well-articulated views of a vision for child health.
   Second, we have experience and toxicological research findings
   demonstrating the adverse health effects of hazardous chemicals on
   children and recognize that children are more sensitive than adults to
   chemical exposures. Results from toxicology research have motivated many
   regulatory and legal actions, and public policy decisions, including the
   banning of some pesticides, reducing exposures in the workplace, and
   lowering of acceptable blood lead levels in children. We also know that
   childhood disabilities from chemical exposure during developmental are
   often not treatable and therefore must be prevented. Finally, we have an
   increasingly well-defined framework for discussing social and ethical
   responsibility to our children. New discoveries in the basic biological
   and toxicological sciences have challenged our bioethical thinking and
   societal decision-making. This paper will explore the ethical, legal,
   and social issues raised by the toxicological sciences first by
   examining some hard lesson learned about childhood effects of chemicals
   and then by examining the difficult policy and research decisions that
   must be made as we address our need for additional information about the
   health effects of chemicals on adults and children and the impact of
   having this information. The precautionary principle will be considered
   as an alternative decision-making approach as well as exploring the
   concept of the citizen toxicologist (CT). As Garrett Hardin pointed out
   many years ago, the problems we face often have no technical solutions,
   but rather require a policy-based approach. This paper will be of
   interest to the, public and health professionals concerned about the
   broader impact of toxicological research on bioethical and societal
   decision -making. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives. We examined the characteristics of uninsured children from
   low-income households whose parents reported that health insurance
   coverage was not needed.
   Methods. With data from the 2001 National Survey of Children With
   Special Health Care Needs, we used logistic-regression analyses to
   investigate the odds of reporting that uninsured children do not need
   insurance for various sociodemographic groups and children of varying
   health status. We also explored the odds of health care use, awareness
   of Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program ( SCHIP),
   and desire to enroll according to the reported need for insurance.
   Results. Parents of 6.8% of uninsured children from low-income
   households reported that their children did not need insurance. Rates
   were highest for American Indian/Alaska Native children (15.2%) and
   children whose parents completed the interview in a non-English language
   (10.6%). Rates were lowest for children with special health care needs
   (2.8%) and children with >= 7 school absences attributable to illness or
   injury in the past year (2.6%). Relative to children with another reason
   for lacking insurance, children who reportedly did not need insurance
   were less likely to have needed ( adjusted odds ratio: 0.49) or used
   (adjusted odds ratio: 0.45) health care services in the past year and
   their parents were less likely to have heard of Medicaid or SCHIP (
   adjusted odds ratio: 0.58) or to have a desire to enroll their children
   if their children were eligible for Medicaid or SCHIP ( adjusted odds
   ratio: 0.25).
   Conclusions. Increasing participation among uninsured children whose
   parents do not perceive a need for insurance coverage may require more
   than simply increasing knowledge about the availability of public
   insurance programs.

AB Objectives/Goal: We compared risk behaviors and HIV testing between
   recent (in the U.S. < 5 years) and established (in the U.S. > 5 years)
   Hispanic immigrant men (N = 410).
   Study: This study was a population-based, cross-sectional survey of
   HIV/sexually transmitted disease markers and risk behaviors in men age
   18 to 35 years residing in low-income census block groups in 3 northern
   California counties.
   Results: Recent immigrants were less likely to currently have a main
   sexual partner (45.3% vs. 67.2%, P < 0.01)) and more likely to have ever
   used commercial sex workers (40.0% vs. 27.6%, P < 0.01). Recent
   immigrants were less likely to receive medical care in the last 6 months
   (21.2% vs. 31.3%, P = 0.04) or had ever been HIV tested (26.0% vs.
   43.3%, P < 0.01). Established immigrants more likely reported
   unprotected sex, hallucinogen or ecstasy use.
   Conclusions: Recent Hispanic immigrants have less stable sexual
   partnerships and less health-seeking behavior, including HIV testing.
   Established immigrants report HIV test rates comparable to the national
   average.

AB Background/objectives: Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a common
   infection among HIV infected people. HSV type specific serologies permit
   the diagnosis of previously unrecognised HSV-2 infection. While
   substantial psychosocial morbidity has been associated with a clinical
   diagnosis of genital herpes, the burden associated with a serological
   diagnosis of HSV-2 is unclear. This study prospectively measured the
   psychosocial response to a new serological HSV-2 diagnosis in patients
   receiving care at an urban HIV clinic.
   Methods: At entry, sera were tested for HSV-1 and HSV-2 antibodies by
   western blot. Participants completed a 90 item psychosocial and life
   quality questionnaire at enrolment, and at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6
   months after receiving test results.
   Results: Of 248 HIV infected participants, 172 (69.4%) were HSV-2
   seropositive and 116 (67.4%) seropositive people did not have a previous
   history of genital herpes. After correction for multiple comparisons, no
   statistically significant differences were detected on the psychosocial
   and life quality scales between those who received a new HSV-2
   serological diagnosis compared with those who were HSV-2 seropositive
   with a history of genital herpes, or those who tested HSV-2
   seronegative. Additionally, no significant changes in scores were
   observed during follow up.
   Conclusions: HSV-2 was a common but often unrecognised infection in this
   urban HIV clinic and participants coped well with a positive HSV-2
   result. Concerns about psychosocial burden should not deter serological
   testing for HSV-2. Given the epidemiological and clinical interaction
   between HSV-2 and HIV, these data support routine HSV-2 testing of HIV
   infected people.

AB This article examines fecal matters-namely, the social concerns that can
   accompany defecation and flatulence. Researching 172 university
   students, we show how aspects of the socio-cultural context as
   "embodied" in four groups of participants (heterosexual women and men
   and non-heterosexual women and men) mediate the operation of the "fecal
   habitus "-that part of culture that interprets and organizes fecal
   events (Inglis 2000). The study finds that the heterosexual women and
   the non-heterosexual men show the greatest commitment to the habitus and
   the heterosexual men the least. It provides some evidence that the
   non-heterosexual women also show a decreased commitment. Theoretical
   contributions show how the concept of embodiment can highlight everyday
   "social problems prevention work" by paying attention to the role of the
   different senses, the emotional components involved in bodily mishaps,
   gender discrimination and the privileging of male status, and the
   elaboration of stigma theory.

AB Using ethnographic research, this paper explores the experiences of
   elite women athletes on a Division-I college soccer team. I draw on
   existing literature in the sociology of sport, sociology of the body,
   and interactionism to inform my analysis. With this approach, I
   illustrate the complicated relationship women athletes have with their
   bodies in relation to physical competition and dominant notions of
   femininity today. Key reference groups influenced the players'
   self-perceptions and encouraged the women to closely monitor their own
   appearances and actions. While undoubtedly affected by these
   interactions as well as their place in the gender hierarchy, many women
   athletes subtly resisted notions of idealized bodies and constructed
   their own meanings about their bodies and experiences. Investigating the
   day-to-day body awareness and negotiations of women athletes reveals the
   gendered nuances of sport and the complicated relationship between
   cultural ideals and female embodiment.

AB This paper is an inquiry into how a new truth about sleepiness is being
   produced in a society increasingly organized around the primacy of
   expertise and its representation in print and visual media. Sleepiness
   originally described a benign, naturally occurring corporeal moment, a
   precursor to sleep. Increasingly, however, a new and disturbing meaning
   of somnolence is found in a juncture of medical and epidemiological
   research, social movements, and popular culture. Alongside the idea that
   sleepiness is a tranquil promise of repose is another, emerging truth.
   Sleepiness, we are told, is hazardous to self and others, and,
   importantly, it is each person's responsibility to resist this seductive
   call of the body. How, we ask, is a private, routinely occurring state
   of partial consciousness deprivatized, linked to public health
   vernaculars, and transformed into a reprobate condition? This
   alternative, disturbing truth about sleepiness is shown to be emerging
   from several disparate, seemingly unrelated caches of scientific
   studies, social movement literatures, magazines and newspapers, and web
   sites. The ideas of Michel Foucault, who pioneered the contemporary
   study of discourse, are shown to be particularly apropos to this
   inquiry, though not without some modification to make them more amenable
   to a contemporary society shaped increasingly by what Zygmunt Bauman
   calls "liquid modernity."

AB There has been little in-depth theoretical study in sociology of the
   motives of women and men who are childless by choice. This article
   begins to remedy this deficiency by analyzing the motives articulated by
   twenty-three childless women and men using Weber's typology of social
   action and distinction between primary and end motives. In-depth
   interview and focus group data reveal that, compared to men, women more
   often were affected by the parenting models of significant others, saw
   parenting as conflicting with career and leisured identities, and
   claimed the lack of a "maternal instinct" or disinterest in children as
   dominant influences. Men more explicitly than women rejected parenthood
   because of its perceived sacrifices, including financial expense. Both
   women and men were motivated by personality traits that they deemed
   incongruent with good parenting. Declared motives especially
   demonstrated instrumentally rational action in Weber's schema, although
   affectual and value-rational actions also were present. Respondent
   motives are compared to those that they, and empirical studies, have
   attributed to parents.

AB A case-control study was conducted to examine a broad array of potential
   social risk and protective factors for suicide attempt among 200 African
   American men and women receiving care at a large, public, urban
   hospital. Specifically, we examined the effect of the following
   potential risk factors for suicide attempt: life hassles, partner abuse,
   partner dissatisfaction, and racist events; as well as the following
   potential protective factors: effectiveness of obtaining resources,
   social embeddedness, and social support. Using logistic regression,
   suicide attempter status was predicted by two independently significant
   social variables: one risk factor (life hassles) and one protective
   factor (social support). Male versus female suicide attempters were not
   distinguished by the social variables. These findings, which support the
   utility of an ecological conceptualization of risk and protective
   factors for suicide attempt, help to clarify the independently
   significant social environment risk and protective factors for suicide
   attempts among economically disadvantaged African Americans in
   particular. Research on both risk factors and protective factors provide
   a basis for culturally competent interventions aimed at reducing both
   the risk of future suicide attempts and completions.

AB Objectives. To investigate as the primary objective changes over time in
   general and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HROOL)
   among low-income men treated for prostate cancer in a longitudinal
   prospective study.
   Methods. Study participants were recruited from a state-funded program
   providing free prostate cancer treatment to impoverished men. We
   included men who completed telephone interviews and self-administered
   questionnaires at study enrollment and 6 months of follow-up. Covariates
   univariately associated with HROOL change scores were included in
   multivariate linear regression models. All HROOL models were controlled
   for age at enrollment, race, baseline HRQOL, and treatment effects at
   baseline and follow-up.
   Results. Subjects with greater baseline Gleason scores experienced more
   negative changes in their physical health than did men with lower
   Gleason scores. Men with less than a high school education experienced
   greater improvement in their mental well-being than did men with more
   than a high school education. Those experiencing treatment effects at
   baseline displayed greater positive changes in their urinary function
   than did those without treatment effects at baseline. Finally, men
   experiencing treatment effects at follow-up were characterized by
   profound reductions in sexual function compared with those free of
   treatment effects at follow-up.
   Conclusions. This work provides new insights into HROOL over time in a
   low-income, multiethnic group of patients with prostate cancer.

AB Classical fear conditioning investigates how animals learn to associate
   environmental stimuli with an aversive event. We examined how the
   mechanisms of fear conditioning apply when humans learn to associate
   social ingroup and outgroup members with a fearful event, with the goal
   of advancing our understanding of basic learning theory and social group
   interaction. Primates more readily associate stimuli from certain
   fear-relevant natural categories, such as snakes, with a negative
   outcome relative to stimuli from fear-irrelevant categories, such as
   birds. We assessed whether this bias in fear conditioning extends to
   social groups defined by race. Our results indicate that individuals
   from a racial group other than one's own are more readily associated
   with an aversive stimulus than individuals of one's own race, among both
   white and black Americans. This prepared fear response might be reduced
   by close, positive interracial contact.

AB Recent applications of social capital theories to population health
   often draw on classic sociological theories for validation of the
   protective features of social cohesion and social integration.
   Durkheim's work on suicide has been cited as evidence that modern life
   disrupts social cohesion and results in a greater risk of morbidity and
   mortality-including self-destructive behaviors and suicide.
   We argue that a close reading of Durkheim's evidence supports the
   opposite conclusion and that the incidence of self-destructive behaviors
   such as suicide is often greatest among those with high levels of social
   integration. A reexamination of Durkheim's data on female suicide and
   suicide in the military suggests that we should be skeptical about
   recent studies connecting improved population health to social capital.

   are purportedly neutral terms commonly used in public health discourse.
   However, they are problematic because they obscure social dimensions of
   sexuality; undermine the self-labeling of lesbian, gay, and bisexual
   people; and do not sufficiently describe variations in sexual behavior.
   MSM and WSW often imply a lack of lesbian or gay identity and an absence
   of community, networks, and relationships in which same-gender pairings
   mean more than merely sexual behavior. Overuse of the terms MSM and WSW
   adds to a history of scientific labeling of sexual minorities that
   reflects, and inadvertently advances, heterosexist notions.
   Public health professionals should adopt more nuanced and culturally
   relevant language in discussing members of sexual-minority groups.

   Results. Women in our welfare recipient sample had higher rates of
   elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (>= 6%; prevalence ratio [PR] =4.87;
   95% confidence interval [Cl]=2.69, 7.04), hypertension (systole >= 140

AB Objectives. Housing typically is not provided to homeless persons during
   drug abuse treatment. We examined how treatment outcomes were affected
   under 3 different housing provision conditions.
   Methods. We studied 196 cocaine-dependent participants who received day
   treatment and no housing (NH) housing contingent on drug abstinence
   (ACH), or housing not contingent on abstinence (NACH). Drug use was
   monitored with urine testing.
   Results, The ACH group had a higher prevalence of drug abstinence than
   the NACH group (after control for treatment attendance), which in turn
   had a higher prevalence than the NH group. All 3 groups showed
   significant improvement in maintaining employment and housing.
   Conclusions. The results of this and previous trials indicate that
   providing abstinence-contingent housing to homeless substance abusers in
   treatment is an efficacious, effective, and practical intervention.
   Programs to provide such housing should be considered in policy
   initiatives.

TI The role of cultural diversity climate in recruitment, promotion, and

AB BACKGROUND: Ethnic diversity among physicians may be linked to improved
   access and quality of care for minorities. Academic medical institutions
   are challenged to increase representation of ethnic minorities among
   health professionals.
   OBJECTIVES: To explore the perceptions of physician faculty regarding
   the following: ( 1) the institution's cultural diversity climate and (2)
   facilitators and barriers to success and professional satisfaction in
   academic medicine within this context.
   DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups and semi-structured
   interviews.
   PARTICIPANTS: Nontenured physicians in the tenure track at the Johns
   Hopkins University School of Medicine.
   APPROACH: Focus groups and interviews were audio-taped, transcribed
   verbatim, and reviewed for thematic content in a 3-stage independent
   review/ adjudication process.
   RESULTS: Study participants included 29 faculty representing 9 clinical
   departments, 4 career tracks, and 4 ethnic groups. In defining cultural
   diversity, faculty noted visible (race/ethnicity, foreign-born status,
   gender) and invisible ( religion, sexual orientation) dimensions. They
   believe visible dimensions provoke bias and cumulative advantages or
   disadvantages in the workplace. Minority and foreign- born faculty
   report ethnicity-based disparities in recruitment and subtle
   manifestations of bias in the promotion process. Minority and majority
   faculty agree that ethnic differences in prior educational opportunities
   lead to disparities in exposure to career options, and qualifications
   for and subsequent recruitment to training programs and faculty
   positions. Minority faculty also describe structural barriers ( poor
   retention efforts, lack of mentorship) that hinder their success and
   professional satisfaction after recruitment. To effectively manage the
   diversity climate, our faculty recommended 4 strategies for improving
   the psychological climate and structural diversity of the institution.
   CONCLUSIONS: Soliciting input from faculty provides tangible ideas
   regarding interventions to improve an institution's diversity climate.

AB BACKGROUND: Patients' religious commitments and religious communities
   are known to influence their experiences of illness and their medical
   decisions. Physicians are also dynamic partners in the doctor patient
   relationship, yet little is known about the religious characteristics of
   physicians or how physicians' religious commitments shape the clinical
   encounter.
   OBJECTIVE: To provide a baseline description of physicians' religious
   characteristics, and to compare physicians' characteristics with those
   of the general U. S. population.
   DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: Mailed survey of a stratified random sample of
   2,000 practicing U. S. physicians. Comparable U. S. population data are
   derived from the 1998 General Social Survey.
   MEASUREMENTS/ RESULTS: The response rate was 63%. Fifty- five percent of
   physicians say their religious beliefs influence their practice of
   medicine. Compared with the general population, physicians are more
   likely to be affiliated with religions that are underrepresented in the
   United States, less likely to say they try to carry their religious
   beliefs over into all other dealings in life (58% vs 73%), twice as
   likely to consider themselves spiritual but not religious (20% vs 9%),
   and twice as likely to cope with major problems in life without relying
   on God (61% vs 29%).
   CONCLUSIONS: Physicians' religious characteristics are diverse and they
   differ in many ways from those of the general population. Researchers,
   medical educators, and policy makers should further examine the ways in
   which physicians' religious commitments shape their clinical
   engagements.

AB Background. The U.S. surgeon general's report, Oral Health in America,
   stated that people living below the poverty level and those with mental
   retardation and/or physical disabilities have poorer oral health than
   the general population.
   Methods. The calibrated examiners (volunteer dentists and dental
   students) assessed the oral health status of intellectually disabled
   people with or without a physical disability via screening examinations
   provided to 12,099 Special Olympics athletes at 53 sites, including
   1,891 people from seven states in the southeastern United States.
   Measurements of gingivitis, untreated decay, missing molars, sealants,
   restorations and treatment urgency were recorded.
   Results. The authors found that athletes from the very poor southeastern
   states were 1.6 times (odds ratio [OR] = 1.64; 95 percent confidence
   interval [CI]: 1.10 to 2.46) more likely to have restorations and almost
   one-third as likely (OR = 0.35; 95 percent CI: 0.21 to 0.60) to have
   sealants than were athletes from the poor states, after restricting the
   analysis by age.
   Conclusions. Among intellectually disabled people in this study, oral
   health disparities were associated with poverty. Special Olympics
   athletes from the poorest states were significantly more likely to have
   restorations and less likely to have received preventive treatment.

AB In recent years, there have been considerable developments in
   international law with respect to the normative definition of the right
   to health, which includes both health care and healthy conditions. These
   norms offer a framework that shifts the analysis of issues such as
   disparities in treatment from questions of quality of care to matters of
   social justice.
   Building on work in social epidemiology, a rights paradigm explicitly
   links health with laws, policies, and practices that sustain a
   functional democracy and focuses on accountability. In the United
   States, framing a well-documented problem such as health disparities as
   a "rights violation" attaches shame and blame to governmental neglect.
   Further, international law offers standards for evaluating governmental
   conduct as well as mechanisms for establishing some degree of
   accountability.

AB Background. Adolescents in the United States are engaging in sexual
   activity at early ages and with multiple partners. The mass media have
   been shown to affect a broad range of adolescent health- related
   attitudes and behaviors including violence, eating disorders, and
   tobacco and alcohol use. One largely unexplored factor that may
   contribute to adolescents' sexual activity is their exposure to mass
   media.
   Objective. We sought to determine of what is and is not known on a
   scientific basis of the effects of mass media on adolescent sexual
   attitudes and behaviors.
   Method. We performed an extensive, systematic review of the relevant
   biomedical and social science literature and other sources on the sexual
   content of various mass media, the exposure of adolescents to that
   media, the effects of that exposure on the adolescents' sexual attitudes
   and behaviors, and ways to mitigate those effects. Inclusion criteria
   were: published in 1983 - 2004, inclusive; published in English; peer-
   reviewed ( for effects) or otherwise authoritative ( for content and
   exposure); and a study population of American adolescents 11 to 19 years
   old or comparable groups in other postindustrial English- speaking
   countries. Excluded from the study were populations drawn from college
   students.
   Results. Although television is subject to ongoing tracking of its
   sexual content, other media are terra incognita. Data regarding
   adolescent exposure to various media are, for the most part, severely
   dated. Few studies have examined the effects of mass media on adolescent
   sexual attitudes and behaviors: only 12 of 2522 research-related
   documents (< 1%) involving media and youth addressed effects, 10 of
   which were peer reviewed. None can serve as the grounding for evidence-
   based public policy. These studies are limited in their generalizability
   by their cross- sectional study designs, limited sampling designs, and
   small sample sizes. In addition, we do not know the long- term
   effectiveness of various social- cultural, technologic, and media
   approaches to minimizing that exposure ( eg, V- Chips on television,
   Internet- filtering-software, parental supervision, rating systems) or
   minimizing the effects of that exposure ( eg, media- literacy programs).
   Conclusions. Research needs to include development of well- specified
   and robust research measures and methodologies; ongoing national
   surveillance of the sexual content of media and the exposure of various
   demographic subgroups of adolescents to that content; and longitudinal
   studies of the effects of that exposure on the sexual decision- making,
   attitudes, and behaviors of those subgroups. Additional specific
   research foci involve the success of various types of controls in
   limiting exposure and the mitigative effects of, for example, parental
   influence and best- practice media- literacy programs.

AB Post-9/11, concern about bioterrorism has transformed public health from
   unappreciated to a central component of national security. Within the
   War on Terror, bioterrorism preparedness has taken a back seat only to
   direct military action in terms of funding. Domestically, homelessness,
   joblessness, crime, education, and race relations are just a few of a

   the biomedical sciences and healthcare, issues surrounding the fact that
   more than 40 million Americans lack health insurance, the rising cost of
   prescription medications, and the use of government funds for research
   using embryonic stem cells remain unresolved. Should we prioritize a
   hypothetical threat (bioterrorism), or existing conditions that have
   implications for identifiable individuals? Even more fundamentally,
   should we prioritize research aimed at defense from bioterrorism ( or
   even terrorism in general) when there are so many pressing social

AB BACKGROUND. Low socioeconomic status (SES) is a reported risk factor for
   cervical carcinoma, but few studies have taken into account adequately
   the possibly confounding effects of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)
   infection as well as access to screening and subsequent treatment.
   METHODS. Women (n = 5060 women) with a mean age of 27.5 years and with
   equivocal or mild cytologic cervical abnormalities were enrolled in the
   Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low- Grade Squamous
   Intraepithelial Lesion (ASCUS-LSIL) Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical
   trial that evaluated management strategies. The women were seen every 6
   months for 2 years. The enrollment questionnaire assessed three
   indicators of SES: race/ethnicity, education, and source of payment for
   medical care. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to
   identify predictors of oncogenic HPV DNA positivity at enrollment and to
   assess associations between the SES indicators and risk of cervical
   intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 (precancer) and carcinoma (>= CIN3)
   identified throughout the study (n = 506 women) among oncogenic
   HPV-positive women (n = 3133 women).
   RESULTS. SES indicators were not associated significantly with oncogenic
   HPV infection after adjustment for age at enrollment, recent and
   lifetime number of sexual partners, study center, and smoking history.
   Among women with oncogenic HPV, the risk of >= CIN3 increased with
   decreasing education (less than high school education: odds ratio [OR],
   2.4; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.5-3.7 vs. completed college).
   Black women (OR, 0.5; 95%CI, 0.4-0.7) and white/Hispanic women (OR, 0.4;
   95%CI, 0.2-0.8) were at decreased risk for >= CIN3 compared with
   white/non-Hispanic women. The source of payment for medical care was not
   associated with risk.
   CONCLUSIONS. Factors associated with lower SES, such as low education,
   may serve as a surrogate for unknown factors that influence progression
   to ! CIN3 among women with oncogenic HPV infection. In this controlled
   setting with equalized follow-up and treatment, the decreased risk of
   CIN3 associated with black and white/Hispanic race/ethnicity could be
   further examined. Ongoing efforts should emphasize methods for
   equalizing screening and follow-up among women of varying SES,
   regardless of race or ethnicity. Published 2005 by the American Cancer

AB Socioemotional selectivity theory (SST; Carstensen, 1995, Current

   social partners are preferred in open-ended situations, whereas familiar
   social partners are preferred in future-limited situations. The authors
   attempted to generalize past research to new familiar and novel partner
   options. Studies 1 (N=144; undergraduates, community-dwelling adults
   ages 65 to 95) and 2 (N=336 community-dwelling participants ages 11 to
   89) indicated that young and older participants in a future-limited
   situation preferred familiar partners. However, with different social
   partner options than have been used in previous research, young
   participants in an open-ended situation also preferred a familiar
   partner, contrary to the predictions of SST.

AB The paper aims to provide evidence on consistent condom use dynamics
   among sex workers in Central America between 1997 and 2000, and to
   examine the most important predictors of use behaviour important for
   policy and programme interventions in the region. Data on 3500 sex
   workers, 1500 from 1997 and 2000 from the year 2000, were analysed. The
   samples represented sex workers in low socioeconomic neighbourhoods who
   met their clients at known sex establishments or by the roadside. Sex
   workers were more likely to have used condoms consistently in 2000 than
   in 1997 (Odds Ratio (OR)=1(.)4, p <= 0(.)05). Sex workers who discussed
   condoms with their partners or lovers used them consistently with all
   clients more than those who did not (OR=1(.)3, p <= 0(.)10). Knowledge
   of condom advantages had a positive influence on consistent use. Sex
   workers who reported using condoms to prevent pregnancy or STDs used
   them consistently with all clients more than those who did not
   (OR=1(.)2, and 1(.)3 respectively, p <= 0(.)10). The source of condoms
   is an important predictor of consistent condom use. Sex workers who
   bought condoms from health establishments or from brothels used them
   consistently more than those who did not (both OR = 1(.)3, p <= 0(.)10,
   and p <= 0(.)05, respectively). Self-efficacy had a positive effect on
   consistent condom use. Sex workers who reported that they would use
   condoms even if clients offered to pay more for unprotected sex used
   them consistently with all clients more than those who did not
   (OR=1(.)8, p <= 0(.)001). The findings suggest that having condom skill
   is positively related to condom use. Sex workers who had all four skills
   used condoms more consistently than those who had none (OR=1(.)6, p <=
   0(.)01). In order to increase consistent condom use and avert more
   incidences of HIV/AIDS and other STIs, programme interventions need to
   use the most efficient way to provide quality information, and provide
   repeated training on condom negotiation and use skills to sex workers.

AB Curbside recycling is a tool that communities use to reduce the need for
   landfill space. This study provides contingent valuation estimates of
   household willingness to pay (WTP) to continue a curbside recycling
   prograrn in the face of budget cuts. Comparisons of two forms of the
   contingent valuation method (CVM) are provided: a single bounded
   referendum and a payment card. Neither approach emerges as unambiguously
   superior. Response rates were virtually identical. Both approaches show
   that support for curbside recycling is highly sensitive to price.
   Regression results from the payment card provided a more thorough
   identification of socio-demographic variables associated with WTP than
   the referendum, but the explanatory power of the two regressions did not
   differ significantly. The referendum estimates of mean WTP exceed those
   from the payment card, although the disparities are less than those
   typically reported in the CVM literature. Local policy makers cited the
   CVM results as influencing their decisions regarding funding options for
   the future of the program. and seemed to appreciate the fact that the
   two approaches provided a fairly narrow range of estimates of WTP. In
   ail era when more of the burden of financing of environmental programs
   is being shifted to the local level, use of CVM to estimate the WTP of
   consumers for highly disaggregated goods and services designed to
   achieve environmental improvement will likely become more relevant to
   local decision makers who are interested in understanding their
   constituents' views. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB An understanding of the experience of food insecurity by children is
   essential for better measurement and assessment of its effect on
   children's nutritional, physical, and mental health. Our qualitative
   study explored children's perceptions of household food insecurity to
   identify these perceptions and to use them to establish components of
   children's food insecurity experience. Children (n = 32; 11-16 y old)
   from after school programs and a middle school in low-income areas
   participated in individual semistructured in-depth interviews. Children
   as young as 11 y could describe behaviors associated with food
   insecurity if they had experienced it directly or indirectly. Using the
   constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis, children's
   descriptions of behaviors associated with food insecurity were
   categorized into components of quantity of food, quality of food,
   psychological aspects, and social aspects described in the household
   food insecurity literature. Aspects of quantity included eating less
   than usual and eating more or eating fast when food was available.
   Aspects of quality included use of a few kinds of low-cost foods.
   Psychological aspects included worry/anxiety/sadness about the family
   food supply, feelings of having no choice in the foods eaten, shame/fear
   of being labeled as poor, and attempts to shield children. Social
   aspects of food insecurity centered on using social networks to acquire
   food or money and social exclusion. These results provide valuable
   information in understanding the effect of food insecurity on children's
   well-being especially relative to the social and emotional aspects of
   well-being.

   and LR from the Self-Rating of the Effects of Alcohol (SRE)
   questionnaire. Results: Drinking was reported by 80 (7.3% of all
   subjects) boys and girls. Boys comprised 62.5% of the sample; the mean
   (SD) age of subjects was 12.9 (0.16) years. Among those 80 drinkers,
   alcohol had been consumed on an average of 5.4 occasions over the prior
   6 months, the average maximum drinks ever imbibed was about 3.3, and
   23.8% had any of 26 possible alcohol-related problems. In this group,
   36.3% had smoked cigarettes, and 12.5% had used marijuana. The First 5
   SRE score among drinkers correlated with the maximum number of drinks
   consumed at one time at .61 (p < .001), the number of alcohol problems
   at .25 (p < .01) and the frequency of drinking at .29 (p < .01). When
   considered along with smoking and marijuana histories, sex and weight,
   the SRE score contributed significantly to the prediction of maximum
   drinks per occasion (P = .60, p < .001) and drinking frequency (beta =
   .24, p < .05), with a trend (beta = .17, p = .08) for alcohol problems.
   Conclusion: These results support the conclusion that a low LR to
   alcohol correlates well with the maximum number of drinks consumed even
   early in the drinking career among individuals for whom acquired
   tolerance or other factors were unlikely to have explained the
   relationship.

PD JUL 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: This study used experienced sampling methodology to examine
   the relationship between affective functioning and alcohol consumption
   and problems. Method: Fifty-six college students provided baseline data
   on measures of impulsivity and distress tolerance and provided
   experience sampling data for 2 weeks on measures of negative affect,
   positive affect, and alcohol consumption and problems. Women made up 54%
   of the sample. The sample ranged in age from 21 to 23 (mean [SD] = 21.50
   [0.57]); 98% were white and 2% were Asian. Results: As predicted, higher
   levels of both positive and negative affect during the day were
   associated with higher rates of consumption that night. In contrast,
   negative, but not positive, affect was associated with alcohol-related
   problems after controlling for alcohol consumption. Impulsivity was
   associated with higher consumption and problems and moderated the
   relationships between negative affect and problems and also between
   alcohol consumption and problems. Low distress tolerance was associated
   with a decreased association between positive affectivity and alcohol
   consumption. Conclusions: This study replicated and extended previous
   research on affective models of alcohol use and problems through the use
   of experience sampling methodology. The results demonstrated
   associations between affective variables and alcohol consumption and
   problems measured through near real-time assessment. The results suggest
   a functional association between alcohol consumption and problems and
   both within-person changes in affect and between-person differences in
   impulsivity and distress tolerance.

   and student alcohol misuse
SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 66
IS 4
BP 470
EP 478
PD JUL 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: This study examined (1) the prevalence of misperceptions of
   college student drinking norms across campuses nationwide, (2) the
   importance of perceived norms in predicting high-risk drinking, (3) the
   association of exposure to alcohol education information with students'
   perceptions of campus drinking norms and (4) the differences in
   high-risk drinking rates between schools where exposure to alcohol
   information is associated with more accurately perceived norms and
   schools where exposure to information is unrelated to perceptions or is
   associated with greater misperceptions. Method: Multivariate analyses
   were used to analyze an aggregate database of the National College
   Health Assessment survey administered to 76,145 students from 130
   colleges and universities nationwide from spring 2000 through spring
   2003. Results: Regardless of the actual campus drinking norm, a
   consistently large percentage of students nationwide overestimated the
   quantity of alcohol consumed by their peers. Students' perception of
   their campus drinking norm was the strongest predictor of the amount of
   alcohol personally consumed in comparison with the influence of all
   demographic variables. Perception of the norm was also a much stronger
   predictor when compared with the actual campus norm. Reduced levels of
   high-risk drinking and negative consequences were found among students
   attending the relatively few schools where exposure to prevention
   information was associated with less exaggerated perceptions of the
   drinking norm compared with students attending other schools.
   Conclusions: Misperceived drinking norms are a pervasive problem.
   Schools that do not seek to reduce these misperceptions with their
   prevention information are neglecting a potentially powerful component
   of prevention.

TI The utility of collateral informant assessment in college alcohol

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 66
IS 4
BP 479
EP 487
PD JUL 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: Collateral informants have been used to assess independently
   the validity of college student self-report data. However, it is unclear
   under what conditions collateral reports might be valid and useful in
   college research. We present two studies that examine aspects of these
   issues using data from 1,264 college student participants in a brief
   intervention prevention trial conducted at a public university. Method:
   The first study describes the characteristics and predictors of
   agreement on reports of alcohol use and problems from 219
   student-collateral informant pairs. The second study investigates
   potential "pipeline effects"; that is, whether collateral verification
   resulted in changes in student self-reports on two subsequent survey
   assessments over I year using longitudinal data from 1,264 students.
   Results: Little support was found for the assumption that nondependent
   college drinkers underreport drinking behaviors and consequences.
   Collaterals who reported more occasions of drinking together, higher
   confidence in the report and a close relationship with the participant
   provided reports that were more consistent with participant drinking
   reports. No evidence was found that pipeline effects of collateral
   verification improve the accuracy of college student self-reports at
   future assessments. Conclusions: The results from this study are
   consistent with much of the published literature showing that using
   collateral reports to verify the self-reports of college students (and
   adults) may result in increased, not decreased, misclassification error.
   These findings suggest that the time and expense required to collect
   collateral data in the college setting has limited utility and may be
   better spent on establishing the proper assessment conditions that will
   foster accurate and honest self-reporting.

PY 2005
AB Objective: This study tested the predictability of error in
   retrospective self-reports of alcohol consumption on September 11, 2001,
   among 80 Vermont light, medium and heavy drinkers. Method: Subjects were
   52 men and 28 women participating in daily self-reports of alcohol
   consumption for a total of 2 years, collected via interactive voice
   response technology (IVR). In addition, retrospective self-reports of
   alcohol consumption on September 11, 2001, were collected by telephone
   interview 4-5 days following the terrorist attacks. Retrospective error
   was calculated as the difference between the IVR self-report of drinking
   behavior on September I I and the retrospective self-report collected by
   telephone interview. Retrospective error was analyzed as a function of
   gender and baseline drinking behavior during the 365 days preceding
   September 11, 2001 (termed "the baseline"). Results: The intraclass
   correlation (ICC) between daily IVR and retrospective self-reports of
   alcohol consumption on September 11 was .80. Women provided, on average,
   more accurate self-reports (ICC =.96) than men (ICC =.72) but displayed
   more underreporting bias in retrospective responses. Amount and
   individual variability of alcohol consumption during the 1-year baseline
   explained, on average, 11% of the variance in overreporting (T =.33), 9%
   of the variance in underreporting (T =.30) and 25% of the variance in
   the overall magnitude of error (T =.50), with correlations up to .62
   (r(2) =.38). Conclusions: The size and direction of error were clearly
   predictable from the amount and variation in drinking behavior during
   the 1-year baseline period. The results demonstrate the utility and
   detail of information that can be derived from daily IVR self-reports in
   the analysis of retrospective error.

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 66
IS 4
BP 545
EP 554
PD JUL 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: Prenatal exposure to alcohol is associated with cognitive,
   behavioral and social deficits, including delinquency. Although
   delinquent populations and those with intellectual and behavioral
   deficits exhibit impaired moral judgment and reasoning, this area
   remains unexplored in alcohol-exposed individuals. Method: Moral
   maturity and delinquency were evaluated in 27 participants with prenatal
   alcohol exposure (ALC group) and 29 nonexposed controls (CON group)
   matched on age (range: 10-18), gender, handedness, socioeconomic status
   and ethnicity. Moral maturity was evaluated using the Sociomoral
   Reflection Measure-Short Form, and delinquency was evaluated with the
   Conduct Disorder (CD) Questionnaire. Additional measures included social
   desirability and inhibition. Results: The ALC group performed at a lower
   level of moral maturity than the CON group. Whereas Verbal IQ primarily
   predicted this difference, a deficit on the moral value judgment having
   to do with relationships with others was specific to prenatal alcohol
   exposure. Furthermore, delinquency was higher in the ALC group, and
   specific sociomoral values were predictive of delinquent behavior.
   Finally, half of the children and adolescents with a history of prenatal
   alcohol exposure but without fetal alcohol syndrome had probable CD.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that interventions aimed
   at reducing delinquency in those with prenatal alcohol exposure are
   necessary, and targeting moral judgment for this purpose may be
   beneficial.

BP 567
EP 570
PD JUL 2005
PY 2005
AB Objective: Drinking and driving has been found to be a highly persistent
   behavior, even after experiencing negative consequences, such as arrest.
   This study tested the association between consequences of drinking and
   driving and cognitions related to drinking and driving (e.g., attitudes,
   normative beliefs). We tested whether exposure to negative consequences
   was associated with perceptions of risk associated with drinking and
   driving. Method: Participants were 938 college students. The sample was
   57% female and primarily white (86%). Questionnaire measures were used
   to assess alcohol use, drinking and driving behaviors, drinking and
   driving cognitions, and lifetime drinking and driving consequences.
   Results: Results indicated that participants who had experienced
   consequences of drinking and driving (either as a driver or rider)
   reported more current drinking and driving and greater alcohol
   consumption. Analyses indicated that most cognition measures
   differentiated those reporting lifetime consequences from the rest of
   the sample, with the consequence groups reporting more risky cognitions.
   However, experiencing a personal consequence of drinking and driving was
   associated with perceiving negative consequences of drinking and driving
   to be more likely. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that most
   cognitive risk factors for drinking and driving remain high even after
   experiencing a negative consequence. This may contribute to the
   persistence of drinking and driving in prior offenders. The finding that
   the perception of negative consequences may be influenced by
   experiencing consequences may have implications for intervention and
   treatment efforts.

AB Positive, abstinence-oriented, social support is associated with good

   help patients improve their social supports. This article reports on a
   behavioral intervention designed to encourage opioid-dependent patients
   receiving methadone to include drug-free family members or friends in
   treatment and to use these individuals to facilitate development of a
   supportive, non-drug-using social network. This report uses data from a
   quality assurance program review of the treatment response of 59
   opioid-dependent outpatients who identified a drug-free significant
   other to participate in their treatment. Fifty-five (93.2%) brought a
   significant other (most often the patient's mother, 29%) to both the
   initial evaluation session and at least one joint session. Social
   support activities were family-(33%), church-(28%), and self-help
   group-related (30%). Approximately 78% of patients who participated in
   the social support intervention achieved at least four consecutive weeks
   of abstinence. Women responded better than men. We conclude that
   methadone-maintained patients can and will include non-drug-using family
   members and friends in treatment, and these individuals can be mobilized
   to help patients improve their recovery. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Purpose: Research on the initial stage of acculturation of new
   immigrants is crucial for identifying AIDS prevention policies and
   priorities for this vulnerable population.
   Methods: This study employed an exploratory approach and qualitative
   data collection methods to identify and describe social and behavioral
   factors influencing risk for HIV infection among recent Hispanic
   immigrants (< 3 years in the United States). Immigrants from Guatemala,
   El Salvador, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Mexico were
   interviewed in urban, suburban and semirural settings in the New York
   Metropolitan Area. Data were collected through ethnographic fieldwork,
   in-depth interviews (N=51), focus groups (N= 11; total number of
   participants=86) and individual interviews with health and social
   service providers (N=26).
   Results: Initial stages of acculturation for immigrants reflect both
   retention and change in attitudes and behaviors involving their mental
   health, gender role norms, social and sexual behavior, and alcohol and
   other drug use. Current living environments may introduce conditions
   affecting HIV risk and prevention, while sustained connections to
   countries of origin may support retention of attitudes and behaviors
   with positive and negative risk implications.
   Conclusions: Specific epidemiological, environmental, economic, social
   and psychosocial factors are identified that provide the context for
   risk and prevention. The challenges and opportunities faced by these new
   communities must be distinguished from those of more acculturated
   immigrant populations if culturally appropriate interventions are to be
   developed.

   Methods: We conducted a telephone survey of 277 African-American and 101

   to questions regarding mistrust of medical care, including a series of
   questions regarding the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the

   Results: Findings show no differences by race in knowledge of or about

   in medical care mistrust.
   Conclusions: Our results cost doubt on the proposition that the widely

AB It is possible that communication from mass media, public health or

   stereotypes of racialized social groups, perhaps cueing or exacerbating
   discriminatory and racist attitudes. This research used a multifaceted
   approach to assess lay perceptions of genetic discrimination and
   genetically based racism (N=644). Two tools for use in strategic
   planning efforts associated with communicating about human genetics and
   health, the genetic discrimination instrument (GDI) and the genetically
   based racism instrument (GBRI), were derived. The GDI emerged as having
   five dimensions associated with lay perceptions of genetic
   discrimination. The GBRI was found to be unidimensional. Scale
   validation activities supported the tools' concurrent and discriminant
   validity characteristics. Significant differences between blacks and
   whites on the criminal control rights, social reproductive rights and
   employer rights factors as well as the GBRI were found. We recommend
   application of these screening tools prior to national dissemination of
   messages associated with genes and disease susceptibility, including

AB Objective. We examined the association between a belief in one's future
   mortality and various risk- taking behaviors among urban black
   adolescents. In particular, we investigated whether adolescents with
   higher levels of participation in various risk behaviors were more
   likely to believe in their future death as compared with adolescents
   with lesser levels of risk- taking behavior.
   Methods. Data obtained from April 1994 to March 1997 were analyzed for a
   total of 2694 adolescents, aged 12 to 21 years. The odds of believing
   that one would die within the next 2 years were calculated for various
   levels of participation in risk behaviors involving alcohol, drugs, and
   criminal or violent acts.
   Results. A total of 160 adolescents ( 7.1% of all boys and 5.4% of all
   girls) reported that they believed that they would die within the next 2
   years. The adjusted odds of future death belief among adolescents who
   both actively engaged in and knew others who participated in all of the
   various risk behaviors, relative to adolescents who neither personally
   engaged in nor knew others who participated in any of the risk
   behaviors, was 3.22 ( 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.01 - 5.17) vs 1.14
   (95% CI: 0.67 - 1.95) for drug use and drug selling, 2.01 ( 95% CI: 1.38
   - 2.92) vs 0.8 ( 95% CI: 0.39 - 1.62) for combined alcohol and drug use,
   and 5.60 ( 95% CI: 2.03 - 15.47) vs 1.61 ( 95% CI: 1.08 - 2.42) for
   violent physical behavior. In addition, residence in a foster home was
   significantly associated with death belief after adjustment for all
   other variables.
   Conclusions. There is a significant relationship between certain risk
   behaviors and belief in near-future death. Moreover, higher levels of
   involvement in risk behaviors were associated with a stronger likelihood
   of belief in near-future mortality. Identification of adolescents who
   engage in certain risky behaviors, combined with a recognition of the
   degree to which the adolescent participates in the particular
   behavior(s), may be used to facilitate more rapid intervention among
   youths who either believe in their imminent demise or engage in
   behaviors that increase the likelihood of their untimely death.

   challenge task in 150 young adults from families characterized by
   parental loss, divorce, or intact marriages. Results: Overall,
   higher-quality family relationships were associated with stronger
   recovery of SBP. For DBP and HR, interactions were found in which
   higher-quality family relationships were associated with stronger
   recovery in the loss group relative to the divorce and intact groups.
   Good support was found for a mediational model outlining self-regulatory
   abilities as a pathway linking family relationships to SBP reactivity
   and recovery. Conclusions: Findings provide further evidence that
   family-of-origin relationship experiences can affect cardiovascular

AB Vocational/employment and independent living for individuals with

   individuals continue to be poor and problematic. The present study
   investigated a group of adults with either specific learning
   disabilities or mild mental retardation who had graduated or exited an
   inclusionary high school which emphasized vocational technology training
   and independent living skills. The results indicated higher than the
   national average for employment and rate of pay as well as stronger than
   expected indicators of independent living in terms of mobility. The
   largest group of individuals, however, were still residing with their
   parents. Respondents with learning disabilities were doing better than
   their mentally retarded counterparts in terms of many of the indicators
   but individuals with mental retardation were still doing strongly when
   compared against figures reported in other studies. Results are
   discussed in terms of recommendations for generalization as well as the

AB Background: Between 1999 and 2002, San Francisco experienced a sharp
   increase in early syphilis among gay and bisexual men. In response, the
   San Francisco Department of Public Health launched a social marketing
   campaign to increase testing for syphilis, and awareness and knowledge
   about syphilis among gay and bisexual men.
   Methods: A convenience sample of 244 gay and bisexual men (18-60 years
   of age) were surveyed to evaluate the effectiveness of the campaign.
   Respondents were interviewed to elicit unaided and aided awareness about
   the campaign, knowledge about syphilis, recent sexual behaviors, and
   syphilis testing behavior.
   Results: After controlling for other potential confounders, unaided
   campaign awareness was a significant correlate of having a syphilis test
   in the last 6 months (odds ratio, 3.21; 95% confidence interval,
   1.30-7.97) compared with no awareness of the campaign. A comparison of
   respondents aware of the campaign with those not aware also revealed
   significant increases in awareness and knowledge about syphilis.
   Conclusions: The Healthy Penis 2002 campaign achieved its primary
   objective of increasing syphilis testing, and awareness and knowledge
   about syphilis among gay and bisexual men in San Francisco.

AB While the scholarship of teaching has risen in prominence in the past
   few decades, little is presently known about the structure of knowledge
   creation and dissemination in that area of scholarship. Such basic facts
   as the characteristics of programs that perform and publish the research
   (e.g., B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.), or the identities of specific schools that
   are leaders in teaching scholarship remain undocumented. This article
   explores the topic through counts of articles and notes published in a
   major outlet in the scholarship of teaching, Teaching Sociology, during
   the decade of the 1990s. We address the following: (1) Does publication
   of teaching scholarship vary by the type of degree program (e.g., B.A.,
   M.A., and Ph.D.) or by other characteristics? (2) Are some institutions
   centers of teaching scholarship? (3) How wide is the scope of teaching
   scholarship across the nation's departments? Overall, we find that a
   variety of sociology departments have established records of teaching
   publishing. Yet, some departments are leaders and appear to create a
   climate favorable to teaching scholarship.

AB I use a quasi-experiment and follow-up questionnaire to ascertain the
   effects of PowerPoint multimedia presentations and a Blackboard course
   website on the course grades and perceptions of teaching effectiveness
   of introductory sociology students. Results of t-tests showed no
   statistically significant difference in course grades between
   experimental and control groups. However, students' responses to
   standardized teaching evaluations were considerably more favorable in
   the experimental group; all measured dimensions of perceived teaching
   effectiveness yielded statistically significant increases, with
   substantial increases in perceptions of instructor rapport and grading.
   I use the ideas of George Herbert Mead to interpret the results and
   increase sociological understanding of the relationship between the
   introduction of instructional technology and student perceptions of
   teaching effectiveness. In Mead's terms, the introduction of technology
   is not merely a self-involved act performed by the instructor that
   changes the modality of course presentation but a social process
   involving both instructor and students. Within this process the
   introduction of technology is both a nonsignificant gesture, which
   elicits from students an unconscious or "instinctively" favorable
   impression of the course, and a significant symbol, which calls forth
   behavioral responses from students, conscious actions that substantially
   alter their perceptions of the course. Students not only reacted
   positively to the instructor's use of technology but through their own
   use of the technology increased their involvement in the course and came
   to perceive its teaching more favorably.

AB BACKGROUND. Low socioeconomic status (SES) is a reported risk factor for
   cervical carcinoma, but few studies have taken into account adequately
   the possibly confounding effects of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV)
   infection as well as access to screening and subsequent
   treatment.METHODS. Women (n = 5060 women) with a mean age of 27.5 years
   and with equivocal or mild cytologic cervical abnormalities were
   enrolled in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined
   Significance/Low- Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (ASCUS-LSIL)
   Triage Study (ALTS), a clinical trial that evaluated management
   strategies. The women were seen every 6 months for 2 years. The
   enrollment questionnaire assessed three indicators of SES:
   race/ethnicity, education, and source of payment for medical care.
   Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify predictors
   of oncogenic HPV DNA positivity at enrollment and to assess associations
   between the SES indicators and risk of cervical intraepithelial
   neoplasia grade 3 (precancer) and carcinoma (>= CIN3) identified
   throughout the study (n = 506 women) among oncogenic HPV-positive women
   (n = 3133 women).RESULTS. SES indicators were not associated
   significantly with oncogenic HPV infection after adjustment for age at
   enrollment, recent and lifetime number of sexual partners, study center,
   and smoking history. Among women with oncogenic HPV, the risk of >= CIN3
   increased with decreasing education (less than high school education:
   odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 1.5-3.7 vs.
   completed college). Black women (OR, 0.5; 95%CI, 0.4-0.7) and
   white/Hispanic women (OR, 0.4; 95%CI, 0.2-0.8) were at decreased risk
   for >= CIN3 compared with white/non-Hispanic women. The source of
   payment for medical care was not associated with risk.CONCLUSIONS.
   Factors associated with lower SES, such as low education, may serve as a
   surrogate for unknown factors that influence progression to ! CIN3 among
   women with oncogenic HPV infection. In this controlled setting with
   equalized follow-up and treatment, the decreased risk of CIN3 associated
   with black and white/Hispanic race/ethnicity could be further examined.
   Ongoing efforts should emphasize methods for equalizing screening and
   follow-up among women of varying SES, regardless of race or ethnicity.

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between social isolation and
   stroke outcomes in a multiethnic cohort. Methods: As part of the
   Northern Manhattan Stroke Study, the authors prospectively followed a
   cohort of patients with stroke for 5 years. Baseline data including
   social isolation were collected. At follow-up, the authors documented
   outcome events as defined by the first occurrence of myocardial
   infarction ( MI), stroke recurrence, or death. Cox hazard models were
   used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR, 95 % CI) for prestroke
   predictors of post stroke outcomes. Results: The authors followed 655
   ischemic stroke cases for a mean of 5 years. The cohort was 55 % women;
   17 % white, 27 % African American, 54 % Hispanic; mean age 69 +/- 12
   years. There were 265 first outcome events. In univariate analysis,
   coronary artery disease (OR 1.3, 1.0 to 1.7), age > 70 years (OR 1.9,
   1.5 to 2.5), atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR 1.8, 1.3 to 2.5), race-
   ethnicity (white vs Hispanic) ( OR 1.7, 1.1 to 2.9), physical inactivity
   (OR 1.3, 1.1 to 2.6), help at home ( OR 1.8, 1.4 to 2.4), and social
   isolation (OR 1.4, 1.2 to 1.6) were associated with increased risk of an
   outcome event. No association was seen for hypertension, diabetes,
   education, sex, insurance, occupation, marital status, or primary care
   physician. In the multivariable model controlling for age, AF (OR 1.9,
   1.5 to 2.5), help at home (OR 1.5, 1.1 to 2.0), and social isolation (OR
   1.4, 1.1 to 1.8) predicted outcome events. Conclusion: Prestroke social
   isolation is a predictor of outcome events post stroke. Lack of social
   support may contribute to poorer outcomes due to poor compliance,
   depression, and stress.

AB It is widely held that named color categories in the world's languages
   are organized around universal focal colors and that these focal colors
   tend to be chosen as the best examples of color terms across languages.
   However, this notion has been supported primarily by data from languages
   of industrialized societies. In contrast, recent research on a language
   from a nonindustrialized society has called this idea into question. We
   examine color-naming data from languages of 110 nonindustrialized
   societies and show that (i) best-example choices for color terms in
   these languages cluster near the prototypes for English white, black,
   red, green, yellow, and blue, and (it) best-example choices cluster more
   tightly across languages than do the centers of category extensions,
   suggesting that universal best examples (foci) may be the source of
   universal tendencies in color naming.

AB This study examines the association between family structure and
   adolescent substance use, specifically focusing on the potential
   conditioning effects of the level of exposure to substance-using peers.
   Using data from a statewide study of Florida students, tobacco, alcohol,
   marijuana, and other illicit drug use was regressed on measures of
   family structure, exposure to deviant peers, family process variables
   (including supervision, attachment, and discipline), and an array of
   salient predictors of adolescent substance use. Logistic regression
   analyses revealed that the level of exposure to substance-using peers
   moderates the relationship between family structure and substance use
   for three of the four dependent variables. The core finding is that
   living with two natural parents serves as a protective factor against
   using tobacco, alcohol, or other illicit drugs, but only under
   conditions when exposure to deviant peers is lowest. Under conditions
   when exposure to deviant peers is highest, teens residing in a
   traditional two-parent family are most likely to report substance use.
   However, some evidence suggests that this latter finding may be due to
   differences in the duration of exposure to deviant peers. These findings
   reinforce the need to continue to explore how the quantity of parenting
   may provide additional protection against adolescent substance use
   beyond quality of parenting factors. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Background: A critical shortage of affordable housing for low-income
   families continues in the United States. Children in households that are
   food insecure are at high risk for adverse nutritional and health
   outcomes and thus may be more vulnerable to the economic pressures
   exerted by high housing costs. Only about one fourth of eligible
   families receive a federally financed housing subsidy. Few studies have
   examined the effects of such housing subsidies on the health and
   nutritional status of low-income children.
   Objective: To examine the relationship between receiving housing
   subsidies and nutritional and health status among young children in
   low-income families, especially those that are food insecure.
   Design: Cross-sectional observational study.
   Setting and Participants: From August 1998 to June 2003, the Children's
   Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program interviewed caregivers of children
   younger than 3 years in pediatric clinics and emergency departments in 6
   sites (Arkansas, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and
   Washington, DC). Inter-views included demographics, perceived child
   health, the US Household Food Security Scale, and public assistance
   program participation. Children's weight at the time of the visit was
   documented. The study sample consisted of all renter households
   identified as low income by their participation in at least 1
   means-tested program.
   Main Outcome Measures: Weight for age, self-reported child health
   status, and history of hospitalization.
   Results: Data were available for 11723 low-income renter families 27%
   were receiving a public housing subsidy, and 24% were food insecure. In
   multivariable analyses, stratified by household food security status and
   adjusted for potential confounding variables, children of food-insecure
   families not receiving housing subsidies had lower weight for age
   (adjusted mean z score, -0.025 vs 0.205; P <.001) compared with children
   of food-insecure families receiving housing subsidies. Compared with
   children in food-insecure, subsidized families, the adjusted odds ratio
   (95% confidence interval) for weight-for-age z score more than 2 SDs
   below the mean was 2.11. (1.34-3.32) for children in food-insecure,
   nonsubsidized families.
   Conclusions: In a large convenience sentinel sample, the children of
   low-income renter families who receive public housing subsidies are less
   likely to have anthropometric indications of undernutrition than those
   of comparable families not receiving housing subsidies, especially if
   the family is not only tow income but also food insecure.

   with potential for alleviating the diminished independence and social
   isolation common in this population. The authors hypothesized that (1)
   higher rates of computer use would be reported by younger, more highly
   educated individuals with ACI, those with less severe injuries and those
   with previous computer experience; (2) A low percentage of survey
   respondents would own their own computers; and (3) People with ACI would
   experience social isolation and report low frequency of connecting with
   important people who live far away. A total of 133 individuals with ACI,
   professionals and care providers completed the survey. To gain more
   specific information, seven focus groups were conducted with 66
   individuals with ACI and 20 care providers. Finally, 10 current email
   users participated in structured conversations, detailing their
   strategies for using email. The survey revealed that 80% of subjects
   with ACI reported owning a computer. Age and education were not
   predictors of computer use, but individuals whose ACI was the result of
   more severe injuries were less likely to use computers. As expected,
   respondents reported that maintaining contact with distant loved ones is
   problematic. The focus groups and conversations provided more detail
   about the communication needs of the population and the relative
   advantages and disadvantages of email compared with telephone and mail.
   Participants also identified barriers to email use they had encountered
   or feared they would encounter when using email. A number of
   accommodations to overcome these barriers were suggested. The results of
   the survey, focus groups and conversations confirmed the utility of
   email and other technologies for people with ACI and the need to make
   these technologies more accessible. The results and suggestions provided
   by the focus groups and interviews are being used in the design of Think
   and Link, an email interface for use by individuals with ACI.

AB Ongoing alliances between. indigenous peoples and conservation
   organizations in the Brazilian Amazon have helped achieve the official
   recognition of similar to 1 million km(2) of indigenous lands. The
   future of Amazonian indigenous reserves is of strategic importance for
   the fate Of biodiversity in the region. We examined the legislation
   governing resource use on indigenous lands and summarize the history of
   the Kayapo people's consolidation of their > 100,000 km(2) territory.
   Like many Amazonian indigenous peoples, the Kayapo have halted the
   expansion of the agricultural frontier on their lands but allow
   selective logging and gold mining. Prospects for long-term conservation
   and sustainability in these lands depend on indigenous peoples'
   understandings of their resource base and on available economic
   alternatives. Although forest conservation is not guaranteed by either
   tenure security or indigenous knowledge, indigenous societies'
   relatively egalitarian common property resource management regimes-along
   with adequate incentives and long-term partnerships with conservation
   organizations-can achieve this result. Successful initiatives include
   Conservation International's long-term project with the A'ukre Kayapo
   village and incipient large-scale territorial monitoring and control in
   the Kayapo territory, and the Instituto SocioAmbiental (ISA) 15-year
   partnership with the peoples of the Xingu Indigenous Park, with projects
   centered on territorial monitoring and control, education, community
   organization, and economic alternatives. The recent agreement on
   ecological restoration of the Xingu River headwaters between ranchers
   and private companies, indigenous peoples, and environmentalists,
   brokered by ISA, marks the emergence of an indigenous and conservation
   alliance of sufficient cohesiveness and legitimacy to negotiate

   (EBF) in Accra, Ghana.
   Design, subjects, setting: Data on current and past infant feeding
   patterns, sociodemographic, biomedical and biocultural factors were
   collected using a cross-sectional design, from a sample of 376 women
   with infants 0-6 months, attending maternal and child health (MCH)
   clinics in Accra. EBF was defined in two ways: (a) based on a 24-h
   recall, and (b) based on a recall of liquids or foods given since birth.
   Results: Although 99.7% of mothers were currently breastfeeding (BF),
   only half (51.6%) of them EBF their infants. About 98% of participants
   had heard about EBF, and 85.6% of them planned to EBF on delivery. Based
   on 'since birth' EBF, planned EBF on delivery was associated with higher
   likelihood of EBF (OR=2.56; 95% Cl, 1.06-6.17) and delivery at a
   hospital/polyclinic was associated with a two times higher likelihood of
   EBF (OR=1.96; 95% Cl, 1.08-3.54). Women living in their own houses were
   more likely to EBF (OR=3.96; 95% Cl, 1.02-15.49) than those living in
   rented accommodations and family houses. Those with a more positive
   attitude towards EBF were more likely to EBF (OR=2.0; 95% Cl, 1.11-3.57)
   than their counterparts with more negative attitudes. The '24-h recall'
   EBF model yielded similar results.
   Conclusions: In this population, EBF was associated with delivery at
   hospital/polyclinic, having secondary school education, intention to EBF
   prior to delivery, owning a home and having a positive attitude to EBF.

AB Spencer's evolutionary philosophy is usually identified with right-wing
   doctrines such as individualism, laissez-faire liberalism and even
   conservatism. Since he himself defended similar positions, it is perhaps
   not surprising that the study of the political interpretations of his
   ideas has drawn relatively little attention. In this article I propose
   to examine a rather atypical reading of Spencer's organic analogy,
   though definitely not a marginal one: Enrico Ferri's Marxist doctrine of
   Scientific Socialism. Ferri is not a figure unknown to scholars
   interested in the political aspects of the evolutionary debate.
   Nonetheless, the relation between his theory and Spencer's bio-sociology
   - notably the complex dialectic of themes such as "the struggle for
   existence" versus "class struggle," or "evolution" versus "revolution" -
   has not yet received full-length analysis. In my study I investigate the
   diffusion of Spencer's ideas in Italy and their impact on the new
   "positivist" sciences of psychology and sociology inasmuch as these
   questions are essential to understanding Ferri's position. Throughout, I
   stress the importance of the intellectual and political context in the
   process of appropriation of ideas that led to this unexpected shift in
   meaning.

AB Background. Physical activity has been considered to be a socially
   desirable behavior that might be overreported because of a social
   desirability bias. This study involved an examination of the possible
   influence of social desirability on self-report measures of physical
   activity.
   Methods. Participants were male and female college students (N = 782)
   who completed the Lie scale of the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire
   (L-scale), Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (SDS), Godin
   Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire (GLTEQ), and Stanford Usual Activity
   Questionnaire.
   Results. Scores from the Lie scale were not significantly correlated
   with scores from either the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire or
   the Stanford Usual Activity Questionnaire. With the Social Desirability
   Scale, there were statistically significant, but weak correlations with
   scores from the Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire and the
   Stanford Usual Activity Questionnaire. There was no influence of the Lie
   scale and Social Desirability Scale on the magnitude of the correlations
   between scores from the two measures of physical activity.
   Conclusions. This study provides minimal evidence of an influence of
   social desirability on scores from two self-report instruments for
   measuring physical activity in young adults. &COPY; 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the HIV-related
   epidemiologic impact of establishing family-style housing in mining
   communities in South Africa.
   Methods: Modeling sex acts as independent Bernoulli trials, the
   estimated impact of converting to family housing arrangements on the
   annual risk of HIV infection is calculated and the differential effects
   on migrants and their partners is explored.
   Results: Family housing could reduce HIV transmission among migrants and
   their partners in South Africa. Given baseline estimates, the predicted
   net reduction in the annual risk of HIV infection with family housing is
   0.0254 and 0.0305 for short- and long-stay couples respectively. A
   reduction in the annual risk of HIV infection under family housing
   depends on the proportion of HIV negative concordance among couples.
   HIV-negative concordance among, couples above 22% provides reductions in
   the annual risk of HIV infection under family housing.
   Conclusions: The results indicate that family housing could decrease HIV
   transmission among HIV-negative concordant couples, indicating that this
   policy alternative should be examined closely to assess its viability
   and use as a prevention method.

AB Curanderismo, widely practiced in the southwest, is an alternative
   medical system that has been neglected by scientific research. This
   project analyzed the antibiotic properties of 23 common herbal remedies
   used in South Texas to treat wounds and infections. Ethanolic tinctures
   and aqueous extracts of each plant were prepared and applied to blank
   diffusion disks. These disks were desiccated and used in Kirby-Bauer
   disk diffusion susceptibility tests on three bacteria: Staphylococcus
   aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli. Control disks
   contained solvent only. The efficacy of the tinctures and aqueous
   extracts was compared to that of commercially prepared antibiotic
   diffusion disks. No inhibition was observed with the aqueous extracts.
   The various tincture-saturated disks produced zones of clearance ranging
   from 1 to 5 mm. Ten plants consistently inhibited bacterial growth of
   Staphylococcus aureus. None of the plants tested produced consistent
   inhibition of the two Gram-negative species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
   Escherichia coli. No zones of clearance were produced by the
   solvent-only control disks. The zones of clearance produced by
   commercial antibiotics were, on average, larger and more uniform than
   those produced by the tincture disks. Thus, it appears that some of the
   herbal remedies used in folk medicine are potentially effective
   antibacterial agents against Staphylococcus aureus. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB Background: Social support is, in general, positively associated with
   exercise behavior However, social influence may not always be helpful
   and may sometimes lead to obligation or a sense of intrusion rather than
   encouragement or assistance. Purpose: The objective was to determine
   relationships among different types of social influence (social
   encouragement and social constraint) and exercise motivation and
   exercise behavior. Method: Structural equation modeling was used to
   investigate relationships among exercise and social influence variables.
   Results: A model was found to fit the data well in which social
   encouragement had an indirect association with exercise behavior through
   motivational variables. Social constraint was associated with only one
   aspect of exercise motivation "have to," or obligatory, commitment-and
   had no direct or indirect association with exercise behavior.
   Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of social
   influences that promote desirable behaviors in contrast to those that
   pose constraints on the failure to perform desirable behaviors.

AB Although sororities are often perceived as contributing to
   eating-disordered behavior, limited research has investigated eating
   disorders in sorority members. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the utility of a highly interactive cognitive dissonance
   prevention program in reducing empirically supported risk factors in
   sorority members. Members (N = 149) were randomized to the highly
   interactive intervention, a more passive intervention, or wait-list.
   Results indicated that both interventions reduced dietary restraint,
   body dissatisfaction, and eating disorder pathology. Only the highly
   interactive group reduced thin-ideal internalization as compared to
   wait-list. Exploratory analyses also indicated that interventions were
   beneficial to both lower- and higher-risk members. Taken together,
   results suggest that sororities are a viable population to target in the
   prevention of eating disorders.

AB Responding to the growing gap between the sociological ethos and the
   world we study, the challenge of public sociology is to engage multiple
   publics in multiple ways. These public sociologies should not be left
   out in the cold, but brought into the framework of our discipline. In
   this way we make public sociology a visible and legitimate enterprise,
   and, thereby, invigorate the discipline as a whole. Accordingly, if we
   map out the division of sociological labor, we discover antagonistic
   interdependence among four types of knowledge: professional, critical,
   policy, and public. In the best of all worlds the flourishing of each
   type of sociology is a condition for the flourishing of all, but they
   can just as easily assume pathological forms or become victims of
   exclusion and subordination. This field of power beckons us to explore
   the relations among the four types of sociology as they vary
   historically and nationally, and as they provide the template for
   divergent individual careers. Finally, comparing disciplines points to
   the umbilical chord that connects sociology to the world of publics,
   underlining sociology's particular investment in the defense of civil
   society, itself beleaguered by the encroachment of markets and states.

SO CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY

PY 2005
AB Young Beti women in Cameroon regularly assert that because they are
   uncertain about what the future will bring, they cannot make any plans.
   But they do plan, strategize, and indeed act quite effectively. The
   purpose of this paper is to explain how they do so, specifically in
   reference to marriage and reproduction, and thereby to contribute to a
   general understanding of intentionality, uncertainty, and social action.
   Action has been commonly theorized as the fulfillment of a prior
   intention. But uncertainties, both the probabilistic uncertainty of
   events and the subject's experience of uncertainty, threaten to dissolve
   the link between intention and its fulfillment. This paper argues that,
   at least under the conditions of uncertainty applicable in contemporary
   Africa, effective social action is based not on the fulfillment of prior
   intentions but on a judicious opportunism: the actor seizes promising
   chances. In other words, women's negation of Weberian rational action is
   not a lack; by engaging in heterogeneous activities without a clear
   trajectory in mind, they are able to get by. The paper makes this
   argument on the basis of ethnographic and demographic data from Cameroon
   and theoretical analyses of the work of Searle, Schutz, and Hume.

AB Human rights concepts dominate discussions about social justice at the
   global level, but how much local communities have adopted this language
   and what it means to them are far less clear. As individuals and local
   social movements take on human rights ideas, they transform the shape
   and meaning of rights to accommodate local understandings. At the same
   time, they retain aspects of the global framework as signs of a global
   modernity that they wish to share. How and when individuals in various
   social locations come to see themselves in terms of human rights is a
   complicated but critically important question for anthropologists of
   globalization as well as for human rights activists. Using the female
   inheritance movement in Hong Kong in the early 1990s as a case study,
   this article argues that the localization of global human rights ideas
   depends on a complicated set of activist groups with different
   ideological orientations along with translators who bridge the gaps. As
   it explores the local appropriation of global cultural products, it
   reveals the instabilities of global and local and the importance of
   tracing the processes of translation and collaboration that make
   communication across this continuum possible.

AB In this study, we estimate a hypothesized link from early onset inhalant
   use to later use of opiates by young adulthood, with data from an
   epidemiological sample of 2311 first graders who entered an urban
   mid-Atlantic public school system in 1985 or 1986 (49.8% male; 67.1%
   ethnic minority), and who were studied longitudinally to young
   adulthood. An estimated 9% had initiated inhalant use before the age of
   14 and at follow-up in young adulthood an estimated 3% (n = 66 ) of the
   sample had tried opiates at least once. Youth who used inhalants prior
   to age 14 were twice as likely to initiate opiate use, as compared to
   those who had never tried (relative risk 2.2; 95% Cl = 1.4, 3.3).
   Statistical adjustment for other covariates attenuated but did not
   dissolve this relationship. These findings help confirm previously
   reported evidence that the use of inhalants might be an early marker of
   vulnerability for future involvement with illegal drugs such as heroin,
   but an exploratory analysis suggests that there may be no direct
   inhalants-opiate link once a general early onset susceptibility trait is
   taken into account. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

   respond to disturbances varies for different types of disturbance
   regimes. We distinguish two types of responses: one that enables the
   system to absorb disturbances from an existing disturbance regime, and
   one that enables a system to reconstruct itself after a fundamental
   change in a disturbance regime. We use immune systems as a model for how
   systems can deal with disturbances, and use this model to derive
   insights in adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems. We identify
   a tension between the two types of responses where one benefits from
   learning and memory while the other requires fast-turnover of
   experience. We discuss how this may affect building up adaptive capacity
   of social-ecological systems.

AB Objective: This study examines the multifaceted role of race/ethnicity
   in the relationship between religiosity and health.
   Methods: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and pairwise comparisons were used
   to compare the means for health, religiosity, and personal
   characteristics in Blacks, Whites, and Hispanics. A
   simultaneous-equation model with five equations modeled the relationship
   between physical health, mental health, self-rated health,
   organizational religiosity, and non-organizational religiosity.
   Qualitative data were used to help interpret quantitative results.
   Results: Health outcomes, religiosity, reasons cited for being a member
   of a religious organization, and personal factors differed by
   race/ethnicity. Overall, individuals with more social resources tend to
   have higher organizational religiosity and better health, while
   individuals with fewer social resources tend to have higher
   non-organizational religiosity and poorer health. The model indicates
   the complexity of the relationships between race/ethnicity, religiosity,
   and health. Blacks reported higher organizational and non-organizational
   religiosity than Whites, while Hispanics reported higher
   non-organizational religiosity, after controlling for sociodemographic
   and personal factors and reasons cited for belonging to a religious
   organization. Being Black was directly associated with lower mental
   health and self-rated health; however, being Black was indirectly
   positively associated with mental health through organized religiosity
   and indirectly negatively associated with physical and mental health
   through non-organizational religiosity. Being Hispanic was directly
   associated with worse self-rated health but was indirectly positively
   associated with mental health through organizational religiosity.
   Conclusion: The role of race/ethnicity in the relationship between
   religiosity and health is complex, but the findings presented in this
   paper offer insights into the nature of these associations.

AB The threat of worldwide obesity in children is a reality and has become
   pandemic. Previously a concern of only developed countries, rapid,
   escalating rates of overweight children now dominate the public health
   concerns of middle-and low-income nations as well. There are, of course,
   many influences that have literally shaped the global population, but
   there is also a recent observable pattern that is shared by those
   developing countries with increasingly obese children: a grand
   structural shift in diet and activity levels on every continent and in
   every region has occurred in the last quarter century, accompanied by
   rising rates of obesity. Two central public health concerns drive the
   need for effective interventions: the immediate health of children and
   the imminently crushing blow that is coming to health care systems and
   developing economies due to high rates of chronic disease. In developed
   nations, the role of gatekeeper has shifted to childcare providers,
   media, and schools, but in the developing world the traditional role of
   the mother as home manager has remained intact. Accepting the mother as
   the primary care provider within the child's nuclear environment places
   the mother as the guardian of the family's resources, which may be a
   viable alternative to the types of health-promotion efforts found in
   past ineffective models.
