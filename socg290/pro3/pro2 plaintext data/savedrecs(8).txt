AB Study Objectives: There are few established predictors of CPAP
   adherence; poor adherence limits its effectiveness. We investigated
   whether race, education level, and residential economic status predict
   CPAP adherence in participants enrolled in a trial with standard access
   to treatment.
   Design: A multi-center randomized trial of home vs. lab-based evaluation
   and treatment of OSA assessing adherence to CPAP at 1 and 3 months.
   Setting: Seven AASM-accredited sleep centers in 5 U. S. cities.
   Participants: Subjects with moderate to severe OSA (AHI >= 15 and
   Epworth Sleepiness Scale score > 12) who completed follow-up at 1 and/or
   3 months (n = 135).
   Measurements and Results: Subjects' demographic data were collected upon
   enrollment; CPAP use at 1 and 3 months was assessed at clinic follow-up.
   In unadjusted analyses, CPAP adherence (average minutes per night of
   CPAP use) at 3 months was lower in black subjects and in subjects from
   lower socioeconomic status ZIP codes. In adjusted analyses using
   multivariate linear regression, black race was predictive of CPAP
   adherence at one month (P = 0.03). At 3 months, black race was
   predictive in analyses only when ZIP code SES was not adjusted for.
   Conclusion: Black race and lower socioeconomic residential areas are
   associated with poorer adherence to CPAP in subjects with standardized
   access to care and treatment. Disparities remain despite provision of
   standardized care in a clinical trial setting. Future research is needed
   to identify barriers to adherence and to develop interventions tailored
   to improve CPAP adherence in at risk populations. Portable Monitoring

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate whether previously identified risk
   factors are associated with eclampsia in a contemporary, heterogeneous
   cohort of women.
   STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected from birth certificate and hospital
   discharge records and used to conduct a population-based case-control
   study among women giving birth to singletons in Washington State from
   1987 through 2007. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate
   odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Multiple imputation procedures
   were used to address missing data.
   RESULTS: Risk of eclampsia was greater in nulliparous compared to parous
   women. Being a young mother (<20 years) or an older mother (>= 35 years)
   were each associated with elevated eclampsia risk. Longer birth
   interval, low socioeconomic status, gestational diabetes, prepregnancy
   obesity, and weight gain during pregnancy above or below recommended
   guidelines were positively associated with eclampsia. Multiparity and
   smoking were inversely associated with eclampsia risk.
   CONCLUSION: Exposures identified more than a decade ago continue to be
   associated with eclampsia in contemporary birth cohorts.

AB Suites of criteria specifying ecological, biological, social, economic,

   of ecological, governance and socioeconomic criteria to comprehensively

   compensate for taxonomic and spatial gaps in available datasets; balance
   biases resulting from conventionally-employed narrow criteria suites
   focusing on rare, endemic and threatened species; plan for climate
   change effects on biodiversity; and optimize the ecological and
   administrative networking of sites. Representativeness, replication,
   ecological connectivity, size, and refugia are identified as minimum
   ecological properties of site networks. Through inclusion of a criterion
   for phylogenetic distinctiveness, criteria suites identify sites
   important for maintaining evolutionary processes. Criteria for focal
   species are needed to overcome data gaps and address limitations in
   knowledge of factors responsible for maintaining ecosystem integrity.

AB BACKGROUND: Large national registries lack information on social
   support, which is increasingly recognized as an important factor
   associated with improved outcomes after solid-organ transplantation. We
   examined our institutional database to identify social factors
   associated with improved outcomes after orthotopic heart transplantation
   (OHT).
   METHODS: Outcomes of OHT patients from 1995 to 2010 at our institution
   were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical data and social information were
   extracted from medical records. Patients were stratified by marital
   status at time of OHT listing. The examined outcome was 5-year survival,
   excluding deaths within 60 days, modeled using the Kaplan-Meier method.
   A Cox multivariable hazard regression model was constructed to assess
   the effect on 5-year survival.
   RESULTS: Of 260 OHT recipients, 176(68%) were men. Mean age was 49 +/-
   12 years and mean body mass index was 26.8 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2). At the time
   of OHT listing, 175 patients (68%) were married. Before OHT, 25% were
   supported with ventricular assist devices and 17% were in the intensive
   care unit. Conditional Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed improved 5-year
   survival for married patients (84%) compared with unmarried patients
   (69%). After risk-adjustment with Cox analysis, being married improved
   5-year survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.47; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   0.23-0.97; p = 0.042) and also improved 1-year survival (p = 0.02).
   Other social support variables (children, grandchildren, living
   arrangements, education, race, employment status) were not associated
   with mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Married patients have improved survival after OHT compared
   with unmarried patients: Being married confers a powerful 5-year
   survival advantage after OHT. This benefit appears mediated by an
   improvement in survival during the first post-transplant year. J Heart

AB Background Young women have the highest burden of chlamydia infections,
   and socioeconomic disparities exist. Individual-level measures of
   socioeconomic status (SES) may be difficult to assess for young women.
   The authors examined whether neighbourhood SES provides a useful measure
   in comparison with individual-level SES with respect to the burden of
   multiple chlamydia diagnoses.
   Methods In a study of young women with chlamydia (n=233; mean age=21
   years), multiple infections were assessed with self-report and follow-up
   testing. General estimating equations and pseudo-R(2) were used to
   assess the roles of individual-level SES (education and employment) and
   neighbourhood-level SES (percentage of people in census tract of
   residence below poverty) on multiple chlamydia diagnoses.
   Results Neither education nor employment was associated with multiple
   chlamydia diagnoses. Women living in high-poverty areas were
   significantly more likely than those living in low-poverty areas to have
   multiple chlamydia diagnoses (adjusted OR 3.46, 95% CI 1.18 to 10.15).
   This neighbourhood-level poverty measure improved model fit by 17%.
   Conclusions Neighborhood-level poverty may provide a better measure of
   SES than individual-level variables as a predictor of multiple chlamydia
   diagnoses in young women and can be useful when valid measures of
   individual-level SES are unavailable.

AB Initiatives certifying that producers of goods and services adhere to
   defined environmental and social-welfare production standards are
   increasingly popular. According to proponents, these initiatives create
   financial incentives for producers to improve their environmental,
   social, and economic performance. We reviewed the evidence on whether
   these initiatives have such benefits. We identified peer-reviewed, ex
   post, producer-level studies in economic sectors in which certification
   is particularly prevalent (bananas, coffee, fish products, forest
   products, and tourism operations), classified these studies on the basis
   of whether their design and methods likely generated credible results,
   summarized findings from the studies with credible results, and
   considered how these findings might guide future research. We found 46
   relevant studies, most of which focused on coffee and forest products
   and examined fair-trade and Forest Stewardship Council certification.
   The methods used in 11 studies likely generated credible results. Of
   these 11 studies, nine examined the economic effects and two the
   environmental effects of certification. The results of four of the 11
   studies, all of which examined economic effects, showed that
   certification has producer-level benefits. Hence, the evidence to
   support the hypothesis that certification benefits the environment or
   producers is limited. More evidence could be generated by incorporating
   rigorous, independent evaluation into the design and implementation of
   projects promoting certification.

AB Autonomic reactivity was studied in individuals with fragile X syndrome

   behavior. Relative to age-matched controls, the FXS group had faster
   baseline heart rate and lower amplitude respiratory sinus arrhythmia
   (RSA). In contrast to the typically developing controls, there was a
   decrease in RSA with age within the FXS group. Moreover, within the FXS
   group heart rate did not slow with age. The FXS group also responded
   with an atypical increase in RSA to the social challenge, while the
   control group reduced RSA. In a subset of the FXS group, the autonomic
   profile did not change following 2 months and 1 year of lithium
   treatment. The observed indices of atypical autonomic regulation,
   consistent with the Polyvagal Theory, may contribute to the deficits in
   social behavior and social communication observed in FXS. (C) 2011 Wiley

AB The promise of personalized medicine depends on the ability to integrate
   genetic sequencing information into disease risk assessment for
   individuals. As genomic sequencing technology enters the realm of
   clinical care, its scale necessitates answers to key social and
   behavioral research questions about the complexities of understanding,
   communicating, and ultimately using sequence information to improve
   health. Our study captured the motivations and expectations of research
   participants who consented to participate in a research protocol,
   ClinSeq, which offers to return a subset of the data generated through
   high-throughput sequencing. We present findings from an exploratory
   study of 322 participants, most of whom identified themselves as white,
   non-Hispanic, and coming from higher socio-economic groups. Participants
   aged 45-65 years answered open-ended questions about the reasons they
   consented to ClinSeq and about what they anticipated would come of
   genomic sequencing. Two main reasons for participating were as follows:
   a conviction to altruism in promoting research, and a desire to learn
   more about genetic factors that contribute to one's own health risk.
   Overall, participants expected genomic research to help improve
   understanding of disease causes and treatments. Our findings offer a
   first glimpse into the motivations and expectations of individuals
   seeking their own genomic information, and provide initial insights into
   the value these early adopters of technology place on information
   generated by high-throughput sequencing studies. European Journal of

   landlord-dominant tenant relationships may be a pattern and contribute
   to understanding the nuances that co-ownership potentially plays in

   We review naturalistic studies of short-term biopsychosocial processes
   as they unfold within the family.
   Day-to-day fluctuations in stressors, demands, and social and emotional
   experiences in the family are reflected in short-term changes in adult
   members' affect and in the activity of biological stress-response
   systems, particularly the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
   To learn how family environments are linked to health, researchers
   should study the interlacing of different aspects of the everyday lives

   start of treatment with low-dose or intermediate-dose interferon.
   QOL decreased significantly in the intermediate-dose group but not in
   the low-dose group (p < .01). The decline was less severe for patients
   who had high rather than low treatment optimism (p = .03). A higher
   level of social support was significantly associated with higher
   baseline QOL (p < .05) but a more rapid decline in QOL over time (p <
   .01).
   Treatment optimism was favorably associated with QOL.

AB Differences in the relative use of global and local information (seeing

   often do not benefit from corrective feedback, even though they pay
   close attention to details in social situations. In the current study,
   participants high (n=43) or low (n=47) in social anxiety symptoms gave a
   series of brief speeches, and then self-rated their speaking performance
   on items reflecting global and local performance indicators
   (self-assessment) and also received standardized performance feedback
   from an experimenter. Participants then completed a questionnaire asking
   how they thought the experimenter would rate their performance based on
   the feedback provided (experimenter assessment). Participants completed
   the self- and experimenter assessments again after 3 days, in addition
   to a measure of postevent processing (repetitive negative thinking)
   about their speech performance. Results showed that, as hypothesized,
   the High SA group rated their performance more negatively than the Low
   SA group. Moreover, the High SA group's ratings of global aspects of
   their performance became relatively more negative over time, compared to
   their ratings of local aspects and the Low SA group's ratings. As
   expected, postevent processing mediated the relationship between social
   anxiety group status and worsening global performance evaluations. These
   findings point to a pattern of progressively more negative global
   evaluations over time for persons high in social anxiety.

AB Waiting lists for methadone treatment have existed in many U.S.
   communities, but little is known nationally about what patient and
   service system factors are related to admission delays that stem from
   program capacity shortfalls. Using a combination of national data
   sources, this study examined patterns in capacity-related admission
   delays to outpatient methadone treatment in 40 U.S. metropolitan areas
   (N = 28,920). Patient characteristics associated with admission delays
   included racial/ethnic minority status, lower education, criminal
   justice referral, prior treatment experience, secondary cocaine or
   alcohol use, and co-occurring psychiatric problems. Injection drug users
   experienced fewer delays, as did self-pay patients and referrals from
   health care and addiction treatment providers. Higher community-level
   utilization of methadone treatment was associated with delay, whereas
   delays were less common in communities with higher utilization of
   alternative modalities. These findings highlight potential disparities
   in timely admission to outpatient methadone treatment. Implications for
   improving treatment access and service system monitoring are discussed.

AB PURPOSE: Little research has focused on the social patterning of
   diabetes among African Americans. We examined the relationship between
   socioeconomic status (SES) and the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and
   control of diabetes among African Americans.
   METHODS: Education, income and occupation were examined among 4,303
   participants (2,726 women and 1,577 men). Poisson regression estimated
   relative probabilities (RP) of diabetes outcomes by SES.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of diabetes was 19.6% in women and 15.9% in men.
   Diabetes awareness, treatment, and control were 90.0%, 86.8%, and 39.2%
   in women, respectively, and 88.2%, 84.4%, and 35.9% in men,
   respectively. In adjusted models, low-income men and women had greater
   probabilities of diabetes than high-income men and women (RP, 1.94; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.92; and RP, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.74,
   respectively). Lack of awareness was associated with low education and
   low occupation in women (RP, 2.28; 95%CI 1.01-5.18; and RP, 2.62; 95%
   CI, 1.08-6.33, respectively) but not in men. Lack of treatment was
   associated with low education in women. Diabetes control was not
   patterned by SES.
   CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes prevalence is patterned by SES, and awareness and
   treatment are patterned by SES in women but not men. Efforts to prevent
   diabetes in African Americans need to address the factors that place
   those of low SES at higher risk. Ann Epidemiol 2011;21:892-898. (C) 2011

AB A common assumption is that all youth with anxiety disorders (AD)
   experience impaired peer relationships relative to healthy control
   children. Social impairments have been identified among youth with
   certain AD (e.g., social anxiety disorder; SAD), but less is known about
   the peer relationships of children with generalized anxiety disorder
   (GAD). We therefore compared the interpersonal functioning of youth with
   GAD, SAD, and controls (6-13 years). Despite having relatively fewer
   friends overall, children with GAD did not differ from controls in terms
   of the likelihood of having a best friend, participation in
   groups/clubs, and parent ratings of social competence. In comparison,
   youth with SAD were less socially competent, had fewer friends and
   difficulty making new friends compared to controls. Findings suggest
   that peer difficulties are not a universal feature of all childhood AD
   and highlight a need to better understand the social experiences and
   functioning of children with GAD.

AB This paper provides a historical overview of cognitive psychology and
   computational theories in cognitive science. Critiques of the
   computational model are discussed. The perspective of the evolution of
   mind and brain provides an alternative model such as that presented by
   Merlin Donald in terms of the "Hybrid Mind." This "naturalist" model is
   also consistent with what we know of cognitive development in childhood.
   It provides a better understanding of cognition in situated context than
   the computational alternatives and is a better fit as a model of mind
   for the social sciences, including for economic decision making.

AB In this paper, we explore the differences in high school dropout rates
   among white, black and Hispanic students in 275 U.S. Metropolitan
   Statistical Areas (MSAs) in 2000. Our analysis focuses on the impact of
   community and labor market conditions, in hopes of providing insight
   into the relationship between place and educational outcomes. The
   explanatory power of our regression models is mixed across racial
   groups, performing best for whites and Hispanics. Our results also
   indicate that community factors - most importantly, same-race adult
   educational attainment in the community, teenage birth rates and
   residential stability - have a greater impact on dropout rates than
   labor market factors. Our results suggest that as education reform moves
   toward broad-based solutions to improve student outcomes including
   dropout rates, it will be increasingly important to address the
   structural origins of inequality outside of schools. (C) 2010

AB Poor social support in the aftermath of a traumatic event is a
   well-established risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   among adult trauma survivors. Yet, a great deal about the relationship
   between social support and PTSD remains poorly understood. In this
   study, we analyzed data from 102 survivors of a serious motor vehicle
   accident (MVA) at 4 weeks (Time 1) and 16 weeks (Time 2) post-MVA. We
   assessed the role of perceived dyadic social support, positive dyadic
   interaction, and negative dyadic interaction in the development and
   maintenance of PTSD. In addition, we examined how these social support
   constructs work together with negative post-trauma cognitions to affect
   the maintenance of PTSD. Neither perceived social support nor the
   quality of social interaction (i.e., positive or negative) was
   associated with PTSD symptom severity at Time 1. However, among those
   with elevated PTSD symptom severity at Time 1, greater social support
   and positive social interaction and lower negative social interaction
   were each associated with reductions in PTSD symptom severity from Time
   1 to Time 2. For social support and negative social interaction, this
   association ceased to be significant when jointly assessed with negative
   post-trauma cognitions, suggesting that perceived social support and
   negative dyadic interaction were associated with maintenance of PTSD
   symptom severity because of their association with negative post-trauma
   cognitions. These results provide support to models and treatments of
   PTSD that emphasize the role of negative post-trauma cognitions in
   maintenance of PTSD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Personality traits and socioeconomic factors such as neighborhood income
   have been identified as risk factors for future alcohol abuse, but
   findings have been inconsistent possibly due to interactions between
   risk and protective factors. The present study examined the prediction
   of drinking behavior using empirically derived multi-trait patterns and
   tested for moderation by average neighborhood income. Using latent
   profile analysis (LPA) in a sample of 863 Dutch adolescents, four
   empirical personality profiles based on 6 traits were observed:
   Extraverted, Dysregulated, Neurotic, and Regulated. Dysregulated and
   Extraverted youth drank higher quantities of alcohol more frequently in
   young adulthood relative to the Regulated group, above and beyond the
   effects of baseline adolescent drinking, age, and sex. Profile levels of
   neuroticism did not appear to affect drinking behavior. Average
   neighborhood income did not moderate adolescent personality and young
   adult drinking. These findings suggest that future alcohol research
   should consider individual trait patterns to inform prevention and
   intervention efforts, and theories implicating both positive and
   negative emotionality traits as risk factors for drinking are preferable
   to those emphasizing the importance of the latter. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB Decision-making is a social process whereby behaviors are often driven
   by social influences and social consequences. Research shows that social
   context also plays an integral role in decision-making processes. In
   particular, evidence suggests that implicit or non-conscious cognitions
   are linked to social information in memory and that implicit attitudes
   can be communicated and assimilated between people on an unconscious
   level. This study assesses social contagion of implicit cognitions
   regarding alcohol and marijuana among high school friend networks. Data
   are from an evidence-based drug education program delivered by either a
   health educator or by nominated class leaders over a 3-month period.
   Implicit attitudes were found to be susceptible to social influences,
   particularly for alcohol. Surprisingly, social contagion was stronger
   for cognitions than for behaviors. In addition, results support prior
   research that has found that implicit attitudes are not entirely stable
   and may be more susceptible to change than are behaviors. Public health
   initiatives to engender behavioral change could be facilitated by
   targeting flexible cognitive associations within existing social network
   structures. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background. Children with siblings coping with chronic illness
   experience stresses and disruptions in daily life as families work
   together to care for the affected child. Research suggests that children
   and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD) may be at risk for
   adjustment problems, impaired psychosocial functioning, and reduced
   quality of life. These potential stressors affect the child with SCD as
   well as their caregivers and other family members. This study examined
   the role of family functioning on the psychosocial functioning of
   healthy siblings of children with SCD. Procedure. Participants were 65
   healthy African-American siblings of children with SCD with a mean age
   of 11.19 years (range: 7-16) and their primary caregiver. Caregivers
   completed questionnaires assessing family functioning and child
   adjustment including demographic surveys, the Family Relations Scale
   (FRS), and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Results. Increased
   number of emergency room visits (beta = -0.28, P < 0.05) predicted poor
   psychosocial adjustment in siblings. Family functioning mediated this
   effect (beta = 0.27; P < 0.05). High levels of family expressiveness
   (total score, r = -0.34; P < 0.01), support (total score, r = -0.54; P =
   0.001), and low levels of family conflict (total score, r = 0.41; P <
   0.001) were associated with improved adjustment among healthy siblings
   of children with SCD. Conclusions. Awareness of the possible negative
   psychosocial outcomes of living with a sister or a brother with SCD is
   important for clinicians. In particular, interventions that focus on
   family expressiveness, support, and conflict are indicated for this
   population. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2011;57:1055-1061. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss,

AB Objective: To examine the association between the increase in body mass
   index (BMI) and socioeconomic factors (eg, income level, % below poverty
   line, unemployment rates and persons receiving food stamps) in
   Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee and Colorado.
   Design: Data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, United
   States Department of Agriculture and the United States Department of
   Labor/ Bureau of Labor were obtained and analyzed for the years
   1995-2008.
   Results: Results from this study showed a strong association between
   obesity and the tested variables (R(2)=.767). Factors more closely
   related with obesity were: income below poverty level; receipt of food
   stamps; unemployment; and general income level. The coefficient of
   determination for these variables were 0.438, 0.427. 0.103 and 0.018,
   respectively. The highest rate of obesity was found in Mississippi
   (26.5% +/- 4.13%) followed by Alabama (25.18% +/- 4.41%), while Colorado
   had the lowest rate of obesity (15.4% +/- 2.63%). By ethnicity, African
   Americans had the highest rate of obesity (32.64 +/- 5.99%).
   Conclusion: We found a significant effect of consumption of low-quality
   food, due to economic factors, on increased BMI. Besides physical
   activity, the quality and the quantity of food are important factors
   that contribute to obesity rates. (Ethn Dis. 2011;21:58-62)

AB Objective: Addressing recruitment challenges faced by researchers when
   the intended participants are young individuals from minority
   communities is crucial to prevent increases in study costs, prolonged
   length of the study, and loss of generalizability that may occur due to
   the resulting higher attrition rates. This article focuses on
   understanding the differences in census-tract level income, education,
   and socioeconomic status of young Latina and African American female
   participants and non-participants during the first 26 months of
   recruitment (June 2006 August 2008) in a longitudinal biobehavioral
   study.
   Design: The Transitions Study examines the psychological and
   physiological determinants influencing the decrease in physical activity
   during puberty among Latina and African American girls aged 8 to 11
   years within the greater Los Angeles area. Recruitment and retention
   through five main steps in the process were examined: telephone contact,
   telephone screening, consent, clinical screening, and baseline overnight
   visit.
   Results: As of August 2008, the recruitment Pool consisted of 110
   African Americans (17.8%) and 373 Latinas (60.4%); of these, only 40
   Latinas and 11 African American girls completed the final step into the
   study. African Americans were less willing to provide their phone
   numbers, but more likely to be reached at initial phone contact than
   Latino families.
   Conclusions: Understanding the heterogeneity within minority
   populations, population characteristics, through careful and timely
   analyses, could be used to adjust recruitment and retention strategies
   in a study involving minority youth. (Ethn Dis. 2011;21:91-98)

AB This study examines the role of urban spatial development on hydrologic
   response at both catchment (sub-grid) and river basin (between grid)
   scales in central Indiana. At the catchment scale, effective impervious
   area (EIA) was estimated using high density urban area and the patch
   size of low density urban area. The impact of urban spatial arrangement
   on floods was investigated using the estimated EIA for the entire White
   River basin, Indiana, as input to the Variable Infiltration Capacity
   (VIC) hydrology model with urban representation. A geographic
   information systems (GIS)-based routing scheme was introduced to the VIC
   model to route the total runoff. Seven theoretical scenarios were
   developed with equal urban area distributed in different isochrone
   zones. For return periods up to and including 100-year, the flood peaks
   at the basin outlet are largest if the travel time from urban cells is
   approximate to the mode of all pixels' travel time (plus the time for
   runoff rate to reach its maximum in a storm event) of the basin. Flood
   peaks tend to be smaller and arrive earlier with urbanization if
   development occurs in areas with shorter travel time, so the largest
   impacts of urbanization are not necessarily seen immediately downstream
   of the development. This research demonstrated that the spatial pattern
   of urban development can affect the hydrologic regime by influencing the
   hydrologic connectivity of urban area at a catchment scale, while at the
   river basin scale it is the travel time of urban location that controls
   flood patterns. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Human populations are both highly cooperative and highly organized.
   Human interactions are not random but rather are structured in social
   networks. Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic,
   changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This
   dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that
   has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical
   attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those
   around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present
   experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and
   dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize
   cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale
   cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial
   to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research,
   we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are
   shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also
   find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently,
   cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network
   connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome:
   Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring.
   Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links
   with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to
   substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the
   predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and
   demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in
   supporting large- scale human cooperation.

AB We attempt to elucidate whether there might be a causal connection
   between the socioeconomic status (SES) of the rearing environment and
   obesity in the offspring using data from two large-scale adoption
   studies: (1) The Copenhagen Adoption Study of Obesity (CASO), and (2)
   The Survey of Holt Adoptees and Their Families (HOLT). In CASO, the SES
   of both biological and adoptive parents was known, but all children were
   adopted. In HOLT, only the SES of the rearing parents was known, but the
   children could be either biological or adopted. After controlling for
   relevant covariates (e. g., adoptee age at measurement, adoptee age at
   transfer, adoptee sex) the raw (unstandardized) regression coefficients
   for adoptive and biological paternal SES on adoptee body mass index
   (BMI: kg/m(2)) in CASO were -.22 and -.23, respectively, both
   statistically significant (p = 0.01). Controlling for parental BMI (both
   adoptive and biological) reduced the coefficient for biological paternal
   SES by 44% (p =.034) and the coefficient for adoptive paternal SES by
   1%. For HOLT, the regression coefficients for rearing parent SES were
   -.42 and -.25 for biological and adoptive children, respectively.
   Controlling for the average BMI of the rearing father and mother (i.e.,
   mid-parental BMI) reduced the SES coefficient by 47% in their biological
   offspring (p <= .0001), and by 12% in their adoptive offspring (p =.09).
   Thus, despite the differing structures of the two adoption studies, both
   suggest that shared genetic diathesis and direct environmental
   transmission contribute about equally to the association between rearing
   SES and offspring BMI.

   objectives were to report nationally representative (U.S.) estimates of
   participation in social activities among adolescents with an ASD, to
   compare these estimates to other groups of adolescents with

   Methods and Findings: We analyzed data from wave 1 of the National
   Longitudinal Transition Study 2, a large cohort study of adolescents
   enrolled in special education. Three comparison groups included
   adolescents with learning disabilities, mental retardation, and
   speech/language impairments. Adolescents with an ASD were significantly
   more likely never to see friends out of school (43.3%), never to get
   called by friends (54.4%), and never to be invited to social activities
   (50.4%) when compared with adolescents from all the other groups.
   Correlates of limited social participation included low family income
   and having impairments in conversational ability, social communication,
   and functional cognitive skills.
   Conclusions: Compared with prior research, our study significantly
   expands inquiry in this area by broadening the range of social
   participation indicators examined, increasing the external validity of
   findings, focusing on the under-studied developmental stage of
   adolescence, and taking an ecological approach that included many
   potential correlates of social participation. There were notable
   differences in social participation by income, a dimension of social
   context seldom examined in research on ASDs.

AB Religious congregations are hypothesized to be a community organization
   affected by contextual inequalities. Survey and interview data are
   analyzed to investigate the type and prevalence of youth programming in
   a geographic area. Rather than drawing a sample of religious
   congregations in the area, the telephone survey was conducted with every
   congregation located in the three contiguous cities. Coupled with the
   high response rate (98.9%), this allows for a unique analysis of a total
   population of congregations in the specified area. In-person interviews
   were also conducted with religious youth ministers sampled from the
   broader population of congregations. U. S. Census (American Factfinder,
   2000) data on the areas in which the congregations were located was
   linked to survey and interview data. Results demonstrate contextual
   effects in religious youth programming, net of denomination,
   congregation size, and budget. The availability and type of youth
   programming in different locations relates to the inequalities embedded
   in these contexts. This study indicates that social disorganization
   theories apply to religious organizations not in inequalities of the
   number of congregations located in any particular area but in
   inequalities in the level of youth programming density available within
   those congregations.

   sociology of technological accidents. Drawing on core insights from the
   sociology of scientific knowledge, it highlights, and then challenges, a
   fundamental principle underlying our understanding of technological
   risk: a realist epistemology that tacitly assumes that technological
   knowledge is objectively knowable and that "failures" always connote
   "errors" that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a
   new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity:
   the "epistemic accident," grounded in a constructivist understanding of
   knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic
   accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their
   relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and
   reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and

AB A large literature in sociology concerns the implications of immigrants'
   participation in ethnic enclaves for their economic and social
   well-being. The "enclave thesis" speculates that immigrants benefit from
   working in ethnic enclaves. Previous research concerning the effects of
   enclave participation on immigrants' economic outcomes has come to mixed
   conclusions as to whether enclave effects are positive or negative. In
   this article, we seek to extend and improve upon past work by
   formulating testable hypotheses based on the enclave thesis and testing
   them with data from the 2003 New Immigrant Survey (NIS), employing both
   residence-based and workplace-based measures of the ethnic enclave. We
   compare the economic outcomes of immigrants working in ethnic enclaves
   with those of immigrants working in the mainstream economy. Our research
   yields minimal support for the enclave thesis. Our results further
   indicate that for some immigrant groups, ethnic enclave participation
   actually has a negative effect on economic outcomes.

AB Objective: To evaluate whether ethnicity is associated with involuntary
   childlessness and perceived reasons for difficulties in becoming
   pregnant.
   Design: Cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from a longitudinal
   cohort.
   Setting: Multiethnic, community-based observational study of US women.
   Patient(s): Women in midlife (3,149), aged 42-52 years.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Involuntary childlessness and perceived
   etiology of infertility.
   Result(s): One hundred thirty-three subjects (4.2%) were involuntarily
   childless, defined by a reported history of infertility and nulliparity.
   Ethnicity was significantly associated with self-reported involuntary
   childlessness. After controlling for economic and other risk factors,
   African American (odds ratio [OR] 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]
   0.15-0.59) and Chinese women (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.14-0.90) were less
   likely to suffer from involuntary childlessness compared with
   non-Hispanic white women. In addition, 302 subjects reported a perceived
   etiology of infertility. An unexpectedly large proportion of these women
   (24.5%, 74 of 302) reported etiologies not known to cause infertility
   (i.e., tipped uterus, ligaments for tubes were stretched), with African
   American women having been most likely to report these etiologies (OR
   2.81; 95% CI 1.26-6.28) as the reason for not becoming pregnant.
   Conclusion(s): Ethnicity is significantly associated with involuntary
   childlessness and perceived etiology of infertility. Misattribution of
   causes of infertility is common and merits further consideration with
   respect to language or cultural barriers, as well as possible physician
   misattribution. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011; 96: 1200-5. (C) 2011 by

   and measurement of social capital, drawing attention to its
   developmental roots, manifestations, and implications for health and
   well-being across the life course. Longitudinal methods are uniquely
   suited for charting pathways to and from social capital and for
   elucidating intermediate and proximal mechanisms that may explain its
   emergence and its role in healthy functioning. The four empirical
   articles in the Special Section make use of well-known longitudinal data
   sets to examine vertical and horizontal dimensions of social capital
   within and across critical developmental transitions. Collectively, the
   articles situate the construct of social capital within a behavioral
   perspective and shed new light on the nature and effectiveness of social
   relationships in the development of individual competence.

AB The predictive relations between social capital depth (high-quality
   relationships across contexts) and breadth (friendship network
   extensivity) and early-adult life adjustment outcomes were examined
   using data from a prospective longitudinal study. Interviews at age 22
   yielded (a) psychometrically sound indexes of relationship quality with
   parents, peers, and romantic partners that served as indicators of a
   latent construct of social capital depth, and (b) a measure of number of
   close friends. In follow-up interviews at age 24, participants reported
   on their behavioral adjustment, educational attainment, and arrests and
   illicit substance use. Early-adolescent assessments of behavioral
   adjustment and academic performance served as controls; data on what
   were construed as interpersonal assets (teacher-rated social skills) and
   opportunities (family income) were also collected at this time. Results
   showed that depth was associated with overall better young-adult
   adjustment, net of prior adjustment, and assets and opportunities.
   Breadth was only modestly associated with later outcomes, and when its
   overlap with depth was taken into account, breadth predicted higher
   levels of subsequent externalizing problems. These findings are
   consistent with the notion that social capital is multidimensional and
   that elements of it confer distinct benefits during an important life
   transition.

AB Social capital has traditionally been defined in terms of the amount of
   resources that one derives as a result of a diversity of interpersonal
   relationships. However, the quality of these relationships across
   development has not been examined as a contributor to social capital and
   few studies have examined the significance of various age-salient
   relationships in predicting adaptive functioning, especially testing for
   cumulative effects over time. Using data from the Minnesota Longitudinal
   Study of Risk and Adaptation, developmental models spanning from infancy
   to adulthood were tested via path modeling, linking quality of various
   age-salient relationships (e.g., infant-caregiver attachment, peer
   competence, friendship security, and effectiveness in romantic
   relationships) to global adaptive functioning at age 28. As
   hypothesized, quality of age-salient relationships during different
   developmental periods predicted the quality of subsequent relationships,
   but also showed links with adaptive functioning in early adulthood.
   Results also showed that the quality of infant attachment relationships
   not only was linked with more proximal relationships, but also had
   direct effects on global functioning, suggesting the potential
   significance of early relationship quality in adaption and well-being in
   adulthood.

AB Objective. The availability of reliable estimates of the burden of
   musculoskeletal disease is of considerable importance for policymakers.
   Methods. This study uses data from the 14,507 participants of the
   European Health Interview Survey conducted in Austria in 2006/2007 to
   calculate estimates of the prevalence of osteoarthritis, spinal
   conditions, and osteoporosis in a population representative of other
   European Union or Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
   member states. Urbanicity, socioeconomic status, and age and sex were
   included as determinants of musculoskeletal disease.
   Results. The prevalence of arthritis was 18.8% (95% confidence interval
   [95% CI] 18.2-19.4%), of spinal conditions was 38.4% (95% CI
   37.6-39.2%), and of osteoporosis was 6.6% (95% CI 6.3-7.0%). The census
   data showed strong evidence for an association between urbanicity and
   arthritis (P = 0.012) and osteoporosis (P < 0.001), but not spinal
   conditions (P = 0.721). Arthritis and spinal conditions were associated
   with socioeconomic status (P < 0.001 for all). Osteoporosis showed the
   same associations with age, income, and education. For arthritis, a
   combined model showed a substantial attenuation of the effect of
   urbanicity on arthritis prevalence after adjustment for socioeconomic
   status.
   Conclusion. These data suggest that the burden of musculoskeletal
   disease is determined by both urbanicity and socioeconomic status;
   however, the effect of urbanicity seems to be attributable to
   differences in socioeconomic status and demographics across geographic
   regions.

AB Ethno-religious conflict in multi-cultural societies has been one of the
   major causes of loss of life and property in recent history. In this
   paper, we present and analyze a multi-agent game theoretic model for
   computational study of ethno-religious conflicts in multi-cultural
   societies. Empirical fact-based research in sociology and conflict
   resolution literature have identified (a) ethno-religious identity of
   the population, (b) spatial structure (distribution) of the population,
   (c) existing history of animosity, and (d) influence of leaders as some
   of the salient factors causing ethno-religious violence. It has also
   been experimentally shown by Lumsden that multi-cultural conflict can be
   viewed as a Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) game. Using the above observations,
   we model the multi-cultural conflict problem as a variant of the
   repeated PD game in graphs. The graph consists of labeled nodes
   corresponding to the different ethno-religious types and the topology of
   the graph encodes the spatial distribution and interaction of the
   population. We assume the structure of the graph to have the statistical
   properties of a social network with the high degree nodes representing
   the leaders of the society. The agents play the game with neighbors of
   their opponent type and they update their strategies based on neighbors
   of their same type. This strategy update dynamics, where the update
   neighborhood is different from the game playing neighborhood,
   distinguishes our model from conventional models of PD games in graphs.
   We present simulation results showing the effect of various parameters
   of our model to the propensity of conflict in a population consisting of
   two ethno-religious groups. We also compare our simulation results to
   real data of occurrence of ethno-religious violence in Yugoslavia.

AB Tests of interpersonal theories of depression have established that
   elevated depression levels among peers portend increases in individuals'
   own depressive symptoms, a phenomenon known as depression socialization.
   Susceptibility to this socialization effect may be enhanced during the
   transition to adolescence as the strength of peer influence rises
   dramatically. Socialization of depressive symptoms among members of
   child and adolescent friendship groups was examined over a 1-year period
   among 648 youth in grades six through eight. Sociometric methods were
   utilized to identify friendship groups and ascertain the prospective
   effect of group-level depressive symptoms on youths' own depressive
   symptoms. Hierarchical linear modeling results revealed a significant
   socialization effect and indicated that this effect was most potent for
   (a) girls and (b) individuals on the periphery of friendship groups.
   Future studies would benefit from incorporating child and adolescent
   peer groups as a developmentally salient context for interpersonal
   models of depression.

AB Marital distress is linked to many types of mental disorders; however,
   no study to date has examined this link in the context of empirically
   based hierarchical models of psychopathology. There may be general
   associations between low levels of marital quality and broad groups of
   comorbid psychiatric disorders as well as links between marital
   adjustment and specific types of mental disorders. The authors examined
   this issue in a sample (N = 929 couples) of currently married couples
   from the Minnesota Twin Family Study who completed self-report measures
   of relationship adjustment and were also assessed for common mental
   disorders. Structural equation modeling indicated that (a) higher
   standing on latent factors of internalizing (INT) and externalizing
   (EXT) psychopathology was associated with lower standing on latent
   factors of general marital adjustment for both husbands and wives, (b)
   the magnitude of these effects was similar across husbands and wives,
   and (c) there were no residual associations between any specific mental
   disorder and overall relationship adjustment after controlling for the
   INT and EXT factors. These findings point to the utility of hierarchical
   models in understanding psychopathology and its correlates. Much of the
   link between mental disorder and marital distress operated at the level
   of broad spectrums of psychopathological variation (i.e., higher levels
   of marital distress were associated with disorder comorbidity),
   suggesting that the temperamental core of these spectrums contributes
   not only to symptoms of mental illness but to the behaviors that lead to
   impaired marital quality in adulthood.

AB Social motivation deficit theories suggest that children with autism do
   not properly anticipate and appreciate the pleasure of social stimuli.
   In this study, we investigated event-related brain potentials evoked by
   cues that triggered social versus monetary reward anticipation in
   children with autism. Children with autism showed attenuated P3 activity
   in response to cues associated with a timely reaction to obtain a
   reward, irrespective of reward type. We attribute this atypical P3
   activity in response to reward cues as reflective of diminished
   motivated attention to reward signals, a possible contributor to reduced
   social motivation in autism. Thus, our findings suggest a general reward
   processing deficit rather than a specific social reward dysfunction in
   autism.

AB Complex social systems require knowledge specialists who provide
   information that political actors rely on to solve policy challenges.
   Successful advice is unproblematic; more significant is assigning
   institutional blame in the aftermath of advice considered wrong or
   harmful, undercutting state security. How do experts, operating within
   epistemic communities, preserve their reputation in the face of charges
   of incompetence or malice? Attacks on experts and their sponsors can be
   an effective form of contentious politics, a wedge to denounce other
   institutional players. To examine the politics of expertise we analyze
   the debate in the early 1950s over "Who Lost China?," the congressional
   attempt to assign responsibility for the fall of the Nationalist regime
   to the Communists. Using a "strong case," we examine political battles
   over the motives of Professor Owen Lattimore. For epistemic authority an
   expert must be defined as qualified (having appropriate credentials),
   influential (providing consequential information), and innocent
   (demonstrating epistemic neutrality). We focus on two forms of attack:
   smears (an oppositional presentation of a set of linked claims) and
   degradation ceremonies (the institutional awarding of stigma). We
   differentiate these by the critic's links to systems of power. Smears
   appear when reputational rivals lack power to make their claims stick,
   while degradation ceremonies operate through dominance within an
   institutional setting. Policy experts are awarded provisional
   credibility, but this access to an autonomous realm of knowledge can be
   countered by opponents with alternate sources of power. Ultimately
   expertise involves not only knowledge, but also the presentation of a
   validated self.

AB Objectives. We sought to examine the association between structural,
   functional, and normative social factors and physical activity among
   urban, low-income, racially/ethnically diverse adults.
   Methods. We conducted a baseline cross-sectional survey among residents
   of 12 low-income housing communities in metropolitan Boston,
   Massachusetts. Participants were also asked to wear a pedometer for 5
   days. We analyzed complete data from 1112 residents (weighted n = 1635).
   Results. Residents with smaller social networks were significantly less
   physically active than were residents with larger social networks (b =
   -1503.7; P = .01) and residents with conflicting demands were more
   active than were residents with none (b = 601.6; P = .01), when we
   controlled for employment status, gender, poverty level, current health
   status, age, and perceived safety. Social networks were most strongly
   associated with physical activity among Hispanics and younger residents
   (aged 18-35 years).
   Conclusions. These findings indicate that social factors, including
   social networks and role-related conflicting demands, may be important
   drivers of physical activity among low-income populations. Researchers
   and practitioners should consider social factors in developing
   multilevel physical activity interventions for this population. (Am J

AB Models of social phobia highlight the importance of anticipatory anxiety
   in the experience of fear during a social situation. Anticipatory
   anxiety has been shown to be highly correlated with performance anxiety
   for a variety of social situations. A few studies show that average
   ratings of anxiety during the anticipation and performance phases of a
   social situation decline following treatment. Evidence also suggests
   that the point of confrontation with the feared stimulus is the peak
   level of fear. No study to date has evaluated the pattern of anxious
   responding across the anticipation, confrontation, and performance
   phases before and after treatment, which is the focus of the current
   study. Socially phobic individuals (N = 51) completed a behavioral
   avoidance task before and after two types of manualized cognitive
   behavioral therapy, and gave ratings of fear during the anticipation and
   performance phases.
   Results from latent growth curve analysis were the same for the two
   treatments and suggested that before treatment, anxiety sharply
   increased during the anticipation phase, was highly elevated at the
   confrontation, and gradually increased during the performance phase.
   After treatment, anxiety increased during the anticipation phase,
   although at a much slower rate than at pretreatment, peaked at
   confrontation, and declined during the performance phase. The findings
   suggest that anticipatory experiences are critical to the experience of
   fear for public speaking and should be incorporated into exposures. (C)

AB Background: Despite a considerable number of studies describing the
   relationship between area-level socioeconomic conditions and mammography
   screening, definitive conclusions have yet to be drawn. The aim of this
   study was to examine the relationship between area-level socioeconomic
   position (SEP) and repeat mammography screening, using nationwide U. S.
   census SEP data linked to a nationally representative sample of women
   who participated in the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
   Methods: An area-level SEP index using 2000 U. S. census tract data was
   constructed and categorized into quartiles, including information on
   unemployment, poverty, housing values, annual family income, education,
   and occupation. Repeat mammography utilization (dichotomous variable)
   was defined as having three mammograms over the course of 6 years
   (24-month interval), which must have included a recent mammogram (in
   past 2 years). Results were obtained by ordinary multivariable logistic
   regression for survey data. Women ages 46 to 79 years (n = 7,352) were
   included in the analysis.
   Results: In a model adjusted for sociodemographics, health care factors,
   and known correlates of mammography screening, women living in more
   disadvantaged areas had lower odds of engaging in repeat mammography
   than women living in the most advantaged areas [OR comparing quartile 4
   (most disadvantaged) to quartile 1 (most advantaged) = 0.63; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.50-0.80].
   Conclusion: The results of this nationwide study support the hypothesis
   that area-level SEP is independently associated with mammography
   utilization.
   Impact: These findings underscore the importance of addressing
   area-level social inequalities, if uptake of mammography screening
   guidelines is to be realized across all social strata. Cancer Epidemiol

AB Objective: Behavioral health problems are reported to affect as many as
   24% of children younger than 4 years. Screening within primary care
   settings remains low. Brief, inexpensive methods to identify children
   are needed. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to
   which parent worry about their children's behavior and development is
   associated with social-emotional problems. Methods: In this
   cross-sectional study, 378 Spanish and English speaking mothers of 12-
   to 48-month-old, underserved children were surveyed before a well-child
   visit with the Brief Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment. This is
   a parent-report measure that was scored to identify clinically
   significant (CS) social-emotional problems (>= 85th percentile) and
   at-risk (AR) problems (75th-84th percentile). Parents rated their worry
   about their children's behavior and social-emotional development on 3
   questions. Results: A total of 42.1% of children had AR or CS problems
   or low social competence, with 19.8% of these children having CS
   problems. Overall, 30.4% of parents expressed worry about
   social-emotional/behavioral issues. A total of 19.9% of parents
   expressed worry despite having rated their child's behavior in the
   normal range on the Brief Infant-Toddler Social-Emotional Assessment.
   Worry was significantly associated with having either AR or CS problems.
   However, worry significantly distinguished the CS group, but not the AR
   group, from the normal group. Parent worry regarding behavior and
   social-emotional development approached adequate sensitivity (66.7%) to
   identify children CS problems with specificity being 78.6%. Parent
   worry, however, was not adequately sensitive in detecting AR problems.
   Ethnic differences indicated that the sensitivity and specificity of
   worry to detect CS behavior and social-emotional problems were excellent
   in Hispanic families, but sensitivity was poor in African-American ones.
   Among parents with low educational attainment, sensitivity to detect CS
   behavior and social-emotional problems was excellent. Conclusions:
   Parent worry regarding social-emotional/behavioral issues may be a
   useful adjunct to developmental surveillance, as it identifies children
   with the most significant behavioral and social-emotional problems.
   However, as a screening method to identify all young children with
   social-emotional problems, parent worry does not currently achieve
   acceptable classification. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 32:660-667, 2011)

AB Background: Homeless men may be at particular risk for the negative
   health effects of substance use. This cross-sectional study investigates
   the individual and personal network risk factors associated with
   substance use in this vulnerable population.
   Methods: Participants were a representative probability sample of 305
   heterosexually active homeless men interviewed from meal programs in the
   Skid Row region of Los Angeles, CA. Interviews assessed individual,
   personal network, and substance use characteristics. Logistic regression
   examined individual and personal network predictors of the three most
   prevalent substances.
   Results: In the past 6 months, the three most prevalent substances were
   marijuana (56%), crack (40%), and alcohol to intoxication (38%). The
   mental health status of homeless men was associated with substance use,
   with PTSD more common among those who used crack. Riskier networks
   (comprised of a larger proportion of drug users) were associated with
   marijuana use, and normative social ties (family, employed and
   school/work contacts) were associated with a decreased likelihood of
   crack use.
   Conclusions: Mental health problems and riskier personal networks are
   associated with homeless men's substance use. These findings underscore
   the importance of interventions that focus on improving mental health,
   mitigating the drug-using norms of personal networks, and helping men to
   maintain contact with normative, low-risk alters. Mental health care and
   peer-based, network interventions to reduce substance use should be a
   priority for heterosexually active homeless men. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB Background: Although past research has found impulsivity to be a
   significant predictor of mortality, no studies have tested this
   association in samples of individuals with alcohol-related problems or
   examined moderation of this effect via socio-contextual processes. The
   current study addressed these issues in a mixed-gender sample of
   individuals seeking help for alcohol-related problems.
   Methods: Using Cox proportional hazard models, variables measured at
   baseline and Year 1 of a 16-year prospective study were used to predict
   the probability of death from Years 1 to 16 (i.e., 15-year mortality
   risk). There were 628 participants at baseline (47.1% women); 515 and
   405 participated in the follow-up assessments at Years 1 and 16,
   respectively. Among Year 1 participants, 93 individuals were known to
   have died between Years 1 and 16.
   Results: After controlling for age, gender, and marital status, higher
   impulsivity at baseline was associated with an increased risk of
   mortality from Years 1 to 16; however, this association was accounted
   for by the severity of alcohol use at baseline. In contrast, higher
   impulsivity at Year 1 was associated with an increased risk of mortality
   from Years 1 to 16, and remained significant when accounting for the
   severity of alcohol use, as well as physical health problems, emotional
   discharge coping, and interpersonal stress and support at Year 1. In
   addition, the association between Year 1 impulsivity and 15-year
   mortality risk was moderated by interpersonal support at Year 1, such
   that individuals high on impulsivity had a lower mortality risk when
   peer/friend support was high than when it was low.
   Conclusions: The findings highlight impulsivity as a robust and
   independent predictor of mortality and suggest the need to consider
   interactions between personality traits and socio-contextual processes
   in the prediction of health-related outcomes for individuals with
   alcohol use disorders.

AB Complex and dynamic societal factors continue to challenge the capacity
   of the social and behavioral sciences in preventive medicine and public
   health to overcome the most seemingly intractable health problems. This
   paper proposes a fundamental shift from a research approach that
   presumes to identify (from highly controlled trials) universally
   applicable interventions expected to be implemented "with fidelity" by
   practitioners, to an applied social and behavioral science approach
   similar to that of engineering. Such a shift would build on and
   complement the recent recommendations of the NIH Office of Behavioral
   and Social Science Research and require reformulation of the
   research-practice dichotomy. It would also require disciplines now
   engaged in preventive medicine and public health practice to develop a
   better understanding of systems thinking and the science of application
   that is sensitive to the complexity, interactivity, and unique elements
   of community and practice settings. Also needed is a modification of
   health-related education to ensure that those entering the disciplines
   develop instincts and capacities as applied scientists. (Am J Prev Med

AB Background: Previous studies have found that age at menarche is
   associated with stature, primarily via leg length. However, the effects
   appear to vary by population and/or time period. Improving socioeconomic
   conditions might amplify the association.
   Aim: To test whether the association between early menarche and reduced
   stature in industrialized countries is mediated by leg length. To
   further test whether these effects are modified by years of education,
   as a proxy for socioeconomic conditions.
   Subjects and methods: The study used data on from 3174 21-40 year-old
   women who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Survey
   of the US (NHANES III). The anthropometric measurements employed were
   stature, sitting height and upper leg length. Leg length, lower leg
   length and ratio of sitting height to leg length were calculated.
   Results: Earlier menarche was associated with shorter stature, by
   similar to 3.9mm per year of advancement, all of which was attributable
   to shorter leg length. Almost two-thirds of the effect was in the lower
   (distal) leg. Years of education did not significantly modify effects of
   pubertal timing on stature or body proportions.
   Conclusion: Socioeconomic conditions might not explain variable
   associations between linear body proportions and pubertal timing.

AB Drawing upon information about the Down syndrome behavioral phenotype
   and empirically based intervention strategies, we examined intervention
   addressing early communication impairments in young children with Down
   syndrome. Intervention involved multiple opportunities, shaping,
   prompting, and reinforcement to address both verbal imitation and
   requesting. Intervention also incorporated the relative strengths in
   social development characteristic of the Down syndrome behavioral
   phenotype by focusing on a more social request prior to addressing the
   more impaired instrumental request, as well as incorporating social
   consequences. Three of the four toddlers with Down syndrome were taught
   verbal imitation skills, two of whom generalized to novel sounds. All
   four toddlers with Down syndrome acquired requesting skills in the form
   of gaze shifting and vocalizing; three were also taught verbal
   approximations of requesting words (e.g., "mm" for "more") using
   imitative prompts. These results contribute to the small, but growing,
   literature demonstrating behavior analytic interventions informed by an
   understanding of the Down syndrome behavioral phenotype. (C) 2011

   Individual quadratic growth models were used for repeated measures of

   as well as among those who were diagnosed with myocardial infarction
   (MI; n = 1,071), stroke (n = 809), heart failure (HF; n = 1,592) or lung
   cancer (n = 433) and those who underwent a cardiac revascularisation
   procedure (n = 1,340) during follow-up.
   Results: among disease-free participants and across time, there was a
   trend for lowest mean SRH among persons living in low socioeconomic
   areas and highest mean SRH among persons living in high socioeconomic
   areas. Factors contributing to the decline in SRH over time included
   advanced age, lower educational attainment, smoking and obesity.
   Conclusion: addressing factors related to poor SRH trajectories among
   patients pre- and post-incident disease may favourably affect health
   outcomes among patients regardless of type of disease.

AB This study tested the I(3) model [Finkel, 2007; 2008] of intimate

   assess the relation among self-regulation, rejection, rejection
   sensitivity (RS), and stalking-related aggression. In Study 1,
   participants (N = 221) read one of three vignettes: no relationship
   termination, an "internal" rejection (involves an internal attribution
   to the rejected as cause of relationship ending), or an "external"
   rejection (external attributions for relationship demise). Next,
   participants experienced one of two conditions manipulating
   self-regulation (no depletion vs. depletion). Finally, participants
   rated their likelihood of engaging in ORI (e.g. unwanted pursuit and/or
   aggression). Consistent with predictions, participants receiving an
   internal rejection reported higher aggression than participants
   experiencing an external rejection, especially when depleted of
   self-regulation. Study 2 extended the design of Study 1 by adding in a
   screening survey of RS. Internal rejections still yielded more
   aggression than other conditions, but this was especially so when
   rejection-sensitive persons were depleted of self-regulation. In
   addition to providing support for the I(3) model of aggression, this
   research shows that not all types of rejection are created equal. Aggr.

AB To assess social and clinical influences of prostate cancer treatment
   decisions among white and black men in the Midlands of South Carolina.
   We linked data collected on treatment decision making in men diagnosed
   with prostate cancer from 1996 through 2002 with clinical and
   sociodemographic factors collected routinely by the South Carolina
   Central Cancer Registry (SCCCR). Unconditional logistic regression was
   used to assess social and clinical influences on treatment decision.
   A total of 435 men were evaluated. Men of both races who chose surgery
   (versus radiation) were more likely to be influenced by their physician
   and by family/friends. Black men who chose surgery also were similar to
   5 times more likely to make independent decisions (i.e., rather than be
   influenced by their doctor). White men who chose surgery were twice as
   likely to be influenced by the desire for cure and less likely to
   consider the side effects of impotence (odds ratio (OR) = 0.40; 95%
   confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.88) and incontinence (OR = 0.27; 95%
   CI: 0.12, 0.63); by contrast, there was a suggestion of an opposite
   effect in black men, whose decision regarding surgery tended to be more
   strongly influenced by these side effects.
   Results suggest that both clinical and social predictors play an
   important role for men in choosing a prostate cancer treatment, but
   these influences may differ by race.

AB By the turn of the 21st century the concept of globalization had earned
   its place in the social sciences and debate turned more squarely to the
   theoretical significance of globalization. Yet not all scholars were
   happy with the notion of globalization. Some claim that is merely a new
   name for earlier theories and concepts. Among those who reject new
   paradigmatic thinking on the current age is Immanuel Wallerstein, the
   world-renowned sociologist and 'father' of the world-system paradigm.
   This article is intended as an appraisal of Wallerstein's aeuvre in the
   context of the debate on global transformations in the late 20th and
   early 21st centuries and from the vantage point of the present author's
   own critical globalization perspective. The first three parts summarize
   and assess Wallerstein's theoretical system and his many contributions
   to macro, historical and comparative sociology, to development studies
   and international political economy. The fourth discusses Wallerstein's
   assessment of the evolution of the world capitalist system in recent
   decades, including his views on the concept of globalization, and the
   fifth focuses on earlier and more recent critical appraisals of his
   work, including the present author's own, in light of the recent
   transformations in world capitalism identified with globalization.

AB The goal of this article is to highlight the major trends in the
   establishment of public libraries in developing countries under
   conditions of globalization. Based on a review of research from library
   history and the sociology of culture, the author develops hypotheses
   about the conditions under which public libraries are likely to be
   established in relatively large numbers in developing countries.
   Analysis of historical trends in library establishments and crisp-set
   qualitative comparative analysis of UNESCO data on public libraries in
   six developing nations reveal that globalization is associated with
   decreasing or flat numbers of public libraries on a per capita basis.
   The only observed exceptions are Malaysia and Chile, where public
   libraries have been established in large numbers partly for purposes of
   national integration as a counter to sectarian and ethnic heterogeneity.
   Implications of these findings for research in the information society
   paradigm, and for development theory, are discussed.

AB Little is known about how often patients desire and experience
   discussions with hospital personnel regarding R/S (religion and
   spirituality) or what effects such discussions have on patient
   satisfaction.
   We examined data from the University of Chicago Hospitalist Study, which
   gathers sociodemographic and clinical information from all consenting
   general internal medicine patients at the University of Chicago Medical
   Center.
   Primary outcomes were whether or not patients desired to have their
   religious or spiritual concerns addressed while hospitalized, whether or
   not anyone talked to them about religious and spiritual issues, and
   which member of the health care team spoke with them about these issues.
   Primary predictors were patients' ratings of their religious attendance,
   their efforts to carry their religious beliefs over into other dealings
   in life, and their spirituality.
   Forty-one percent of inpatients desired a discussion of R/S concerns
   while hospitalized, but only half of those reported having such a
   discussion. Overall, 32% of inpatients reported having a discussion of
   their R/S concerns. Religious patients and those experiencing more
   severe pain were more likely both to desire and to have discussions of
   spiritual concerns. Patients who had discussions of R/S concerns were
   more likely to rate their care at the highest level on four different
   measures of patient satisfaction, regardless of whether or not they said
   they had desired such a discussion (odds ratios 1.4-2.2, 95% confidence
   intervals 1.1-3.0).
   These data suggest that many more inpatients desire conversations about
   R/S than have them. Health care professionals might improve patients'
   overall experience with being hospitalized and patient satisfaction by
   addressing this unmet patient need.

AB A higher prevalence of moderate or severe lower urinary tract symptoms
   (LUTS) has been reported among African Americans, but the separate
   effects of race and socioeconomic status (SES) on LUTS severity are
   unclear.
   We investigated the roles of education, income, marital status, and
   source of health insurance on LUTS reporting among black and white U.S.
   men.
   A prospective cohort within the Southern Community Cohort Study
   The International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) was completed during
   follow-up by 2488 white men and 4188 black men. Multivariable linear and
   logistic regression methods were used to compare IPSS scores and LUTS
   severity by race and SES after adjusting for age, duration of follow-up,
   benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) treatment, source of recruitment,
   smoking status, BMI, mode of follow-up ascertainment, and prior
   diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia.
   Overall IPSS scores and the prevalence of moderate/severe LUTS were not
   significantly associated with race. Instead, higher IPSS scores were
   significantly associated (p < 0.05) with a lower income, marital status,
   and source of insurance. Education was also marginally associated with
   IPSS scores (p = 0.06) among black men. Furthermore, moderate/severe
   LUTS onset was significantly associated with a household income less
   than $15,000/year (OR = 1.56 (1.23, 1.96)) and having private health
   insurance (OR = 0.79 (0.67, 0.93)).
   Social or behavioral factors related to SES affect LUTS reporting, and
   suggests a potential affect on BPH diagnosis.

AB Although colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer
   death among adults in the US and colonoscopy is efficacious in reducing
   morbidity and mortality from CRC, screening rates are sub-optimal.
   Understanding the socioeconomic, cultural, and health care context
   within which decisions about colonoscopy are made allows physicians to
   address patients' most salient beliefs and values and other constraints
   when making screening recommendations.
   To evaluate the direct and interactive effects of socioeconomics, health
   care variables, psychological characteristics, and cultural values on
   colonoscopy use.
   National survey completed between January-August 2009 in a random sample
   of African American, white, and Hispanic adults ages 50-75 without
   cancer (n = 582).
   Self-reported colonoscopy use.
   Only 59% of respondents reported having a colonoscopy. The likelihood of
   colonoscopy increased with having health insurance (OR = 2.82, 95% CI =
   1.24, 6.43, p = 0.004), and increasing age (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.11,
   1.77, p = 0.001). In addition, respondents with greater self-efficacy
   were more likely to have a colonoscopy (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.35, 4.29,
   p = 0.003).
   Programs that help patients to overcome access and psychological

   distinct contributions: first in terms of considering children's health
   disparities as an area of concern within sociology, and second by
   considering children's health as a factor that shapes other areas of
   children's well-being. In addition, these papers offer novel empirical
   research on children's health and varied methodological and theoretical
   orientations. Each paper also makes contributions to social policy,
   first in the area of infant health affecting later educational outcomes,
   second in the area of family structure and children's health, and
   additionally in understanding type 2 diabetes for children at the
   individual and structural levels. Finally, these studies highlight the

AB Tracking the volume of keywords in Internet searches, message boards, or
   Tweets has provided an alternative for following or predicting
   associations between popular interest or disease incidences. Here, we
   extend that research by examining the role of e-communications among day
   traders and their collective understanding of the market. Our study
   introduces a general method that focuses on bundles of words that behave
   differently from daily communication routines, and uses original data
   covering the content of instant messages among all day traders at a
   trading firm over a 40-month period. Analyses show that two word bundles
   convey traders' understanding of same day market events and potential
   next day market events. We find that when market volatility is high,
   traders' communications are dominated by same day events, and when
   volatility is low, communications are dominated by next day events. We
   show that the stronger the traders' attention to either same day or next
   day events, the higher their collective trading performance. We conclude
   that e-communication among traders is a product of mass collaboration
   over diverse viewpoints that embodies unique information about their
   weak or strong understanding of the market.

AB BACKGROUND The question of whether neighborhood environment contributes
   directly to the development of obesity and diabetes remains unresolved.
   The study reported on here uses data from a social experiment to assess
   the association of randomly assigned variation in neighborhood
   conditions with obesity and diabetes.
   METHODS From 1994 through 1998, the Department of Housing and Urban
   Development (HUD) randomly assigned 4498 women with children living in
   public housing in high-poverty urban census tracts (in which = 40% of
   residents had incomes below the federal poverty threshold) to one of
   three groups: 1788 were assigned to receive housing vouchers, which were
   redeemable only if they moved to a low-poverty census tract (where <10%
   of residents were poor), and counseling on moving; 1312 were assigned to
   receive unrestricted, traditional vouchers, with no special counseling
   on moving; and 1398 were assigned to a control group that was offered
   neither of these opportunities. From 2008 through 2010, as part of a
   long-term follow-up survey, we measured data indicating health outcomes,
   including height, weight, and level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA(1C)).
   RESULTS As part of our long-term survey, we obtained data on body-mass
   index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height
   in meters) for 84.2% of participants and data on glycated hemoglobin
   level for 71.3% of participants. Response rates were similar across
   randomized groups. The prevalences of a BMI of 35 or more, a BMI of 40
   or more, and a glycated hemoglobin level of 6.5% or more were lower in
   the group receiving the low-poverty vouchers than in the control group,
   with an absolute difference of 4.61 percentage points (95% confidence
   interval [CI], -8.54 to -0.69), 3.38 percentage points (95% CI, -6.39 to
   -0.36), and 4.31 percentage points (95% CI, -7.82 to -0.80),
   respectively. The differences between the group receiving traditional
   vouchers and the control group were not significant.
   CONCLUSIONS The opportunity to move from a neighborhood with a high
   level of poverty to one with a lower level of poverty was associated
   with modest but potentially important reductions in the prevalence of
   extreme obesity and diabetes. The mechanisms underlying these
   associations remain unclear but warrant further investigation, given
   their potential to guide the design of community-level interventions
   intended to improve health. (Funded by HUD and others.)

AB People act more prosocially when they know they are watched by others,
   an everyday observation borne out by studies from behavioral economics,
   social psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. This effect is thought to
   be mediated by the incentive to improve one's social reputation, a
   specific and possibly uniquely human motivation that depends on our
   ability to represent what other people think of us. Here we tested the
   hypothesis that social reputation effects are selectively impaired in
   autism, a developmental disorder characterized in part by impairments in
   reciprocal social interactions but whose underlying cognitive causes
   remain elusive. When asked to make real charitable donations in the
   presence or absence of an observer, matched healthy controls donated
   significantly more in the observer's presence than absence, replicating
   prior work. By contrast, people with high- functioning autism were not
   influenced by the presence of an observer at all in this task. However,
   both groups performed significantly better on a continuous performance
   task in the presence of an observer, suggesting intact general social
   facilitation in autism. The results argue that people with autism lack
   the ability to take into consideration what others think of them and
   provide further support for specialized neural systems mediating the
   effects of social reputation.

   Sagarmatha (Mount Everest) National Park and Buffer Zone. Utilizing
   mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, I selected a stratified
   random sample of 100 individuals to assess spiritual values, and species
   and landscape knowledge. The results generally showed that individuals
   who lived on the tourist route and younger generations had less
   knowledge of these domains. These findings suggest that some Sherpa
   ecological knowledge and understanding had shifted from spiritual and
   agro-pastoralist socioeconomic values to a more tourismcentered economic
   logic. Future environmental decisions may be influenced by these
   changes.

   assumed that what works in small sample, controlled settings would work
   in all community settings, substantially improving safety,
   effectiveness, and value-for-money. The evidence-based "model" programs
   mandate has imposed immutable "core components," fidelity testing, alien
   programming and program developers, loss of familiar programs, and
   resource capacity requirements upon tribes, while infringing upon their
   tribal sovereignty and consultation rights. Tribal response in one state
   (Oregon) went through three phases: shock and rejection; proposing an
   alternative approach using criteria of cultural appropriateness,
   aspiring to evaluability; and adopting logic modeling. The state heard
   and accepted the argument that the tribal way of knowing is different
   and valid. Currently, a state-authorized tribal logic model and a review
   panel process are used to approve tribal best practices for state
   funding. This constructive response to the evidence-based program
   mandate elevates tribal practices in the funding and regulatory world,
   facilitates continuing quality improvement and evaluation, while
   ensuring that practices and programs remain based on local community
   context and culture. This article provides details of a model that could

AB Contemporary tribal commitments to traditional cultural reclamation and
   revitalization find continued expression by recent generational cohorts
   of American Indians who, when it comes to matters of recovery, healing,
   and wellness in the context of substance abuse, routinely assert that
   "our culture is our treatment." And yet, empirical investigations of
   this culture-as-treatment hypothesis-namely, that a (post)colonial
   return to indigenous cultural orientations and practices is sufficient
   for effecting abstinence and recovery from substance use disorders for
   many American Indians-have yet to appear in the scientific literature.
   Preliminary activities of a research partnership dedicated to the
   empirical exploration of this hypothesis for reducing Native American
   substance use disorders are summarized. Specifically, collaboration
   between a university-based research psychologist and a reservation-based
   substance abuse treatment program staff has thus far resulted in a
   detailed blueprint for a radically alternative, culturally-grounded
   intervention developed for reservation residents. This proposed
   alternative intervention-a seasonal cultural immersion camp designed to
   approximate the day-to-day experiences of prereservation ancestors-was
   designed for eventual implementation and evaluation with adult clients
   referred for residential treatment on the Blackfeet Indian reservation.
   It is anticipated that the proposed intervention will eventually afford
   empirical evaluation of the culture-as-treatment hypothesis.

AB Best practices for Native Americans are rooted in culture. However,
   reclaiming best practices is a challenge given the genocidal policies
   that outlawed Native culture. Despite this challenge Native people have
   proven resilient in restoring culture. The Native American Health Center
   in Oakland, California, has made cultural interventions an option for an
   urban, intertribal and sometimes multiracial Native American population
   to create and maintain their health on a spiritual, emotional, mental
   and physical level. Nevertheless, sustaining these cultural options to
   maintain health continues to be a challenge. While the passage of the
   Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) in 2004 in California to transform
   treatment of mental and behavioral health "as we know it" would seem to
   create a gateway for cultural options, mainstream mental health has a
   hard time perceiving cultural interventions as a viable means to treat
   mental illness and maintain wellness. Frequently, the author has
   attended meetings of decisionmaking bodies that oversee how MHSA money
   is spent and someone will blurt out after someone has described an
   innovative cultural intervention "What does that have to do with mental
   illness?" The following article discusses how the clash of the two
   cultures, Native and mainstream, continues to be a challenge for
   sustained funding to implement culturally competent programs.

AB The Holistic System of Care for Native Americans in an Urban Environment
   is a community-focused intervention that provides behavioral health
   care, promotes health, and prevents disease. This approach is based on a
   community strategic,planning process that honored Native American
   culture and relationships. Substance abuse, mental illness,
   homelessness, poverty, crime, physical illness, and violence are
   symptoms of historical trauma, family dysfunction, and spiritual
   imbalance. The holistic model links treatment, prevention, and recovery.
   The link between prevention and treatment is early intervention. Peer
   support is the link between treatment and recovery. Recovering
   individuals serve as role models linking recovery to prevention. Culture
   and spirituality build a strong and resilient foundation for recovery.
   This article documents the effectiveness of the holistic model over a
   ten-year period that it has been implemented at the Family & Child
   Guidance Clinic of the Native American Health Center in the San
   Francisco Bay Area. The holistic model has produced statistically
   significant reductions in substance abuse among adult Native American
   women, men, reentry, and homeless populations; reductions in substance
   abuse among Native American adolescents; reductions in HIV/AIDS
   high-risk behavior among Native American men, women, and adolescents;
   and decreases in acting out behavior among Native American severely
   emotionally disturbed children.

AB Culture counts in the prevention and treatment of behavioral ailments.
   The Native American Health Center (NAHC) has successfully developed a
   model that incorporates cultural adaptations into EBPs, yet also
   believes community-defined and practice-based evidence are relevant in
   the validation of traditional practices. American Indian/Alaska Native
   (AI/AN) traditional practices are more than complementary forms of
   healing. They are stand-alone methods, developed and used by tribal
   people long before the concept of EBPs existed. There is a need for
   funders to respect these practices as autonomous mental health
   strategies. The reasons for promoting change are explained through an
   understanding of key dimensions of AI/AN behavioral health issues. These
   key dimensions were identified in the 2001 Surgeon General's Report and
   an extensive literature review of Indigenous research methodologies.
   Recommendations are made based upon their ability to promote AI/AN
   empowerment, to support movement toward self-determination using the
   Indigenous Research Agenda model. This model honors fluid movement of
   Indigenous people through states of survival, recovery, development and
   self-determination through four categories for action: decolonization,
   mobilization, transformation, and healing. The end results are options
   for holistic approaches to influence policy changes in the EBP system.

AB In 2007 the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Office for
   Minority Health, collaborating with other federal agencies, sponsored
   the Indian Country Methamphetamine Initiative (ICMI). ICMI was
   undertaken to create community-driven, culture-based best practices in
   methamphetamine prevention and treatment which could then be
   disseminated throughout Indian Country. The ICMI ultimately involved ten
   tribes and five national organizations. Each tribe established a
   coalition of community government, nongovernment agencies, and elements
   of civic society to develop a comprehensive assessment, plan, and then
   to implement the plan. Each tribal coalition planned a complex array of
   activities including treatment programs, public education and
   mobilization, law enforcement strategies, and other intervention
   strategies, each intervention described within a logic model. These
   interventions focused on logic modeling; coalitions; capacity
   development and service system optimization; law enforcement and
   justice; individual and family treatment; public information, awareness,
   and education; community mobilization; and a very popular ICMI strategy,
   cultural renaissance. It was concluded that worthwhile activities were
   conducted under ICMI sponsorship, but that the specific aim of
   demonstrating community-driven, culture-based innovations in a manner
   suitable for dissemination was achieved only to a limited extent. Based
   on this outcome together with similar experiences, recommendations for
   future initiatives are suggested.

   culturally relevant treatment approaches that incorporate community
   perspectives within the urban setting are limited. This study analyzes
   community perspectives from AI/AN parents, AI/AN youths, and services
   providers within Los Angeles County. Information gathered was utilized
   to develop a needs assessment for AI/AN youths with mental health and
   substance use problems and to design a community-informed treatment
   approach. Nine focus groups and key informant interviews were conducted.
   The Los Angeles County community strongly expressed the need for
   providing urban AI/AN youths with traditional healing services and
   cultural activities within their treatment program. However, various
   barriers to accessing mental health and substance abuse treatment
   services were identified. An integrated treatment approach was
   subsequently designed as a result of input derived from community
   perspectives. The community believed that providing urban AI/AN youths
   with an integrated treatment approach has the potential to decrease the
   risk of mental health and substance abuse problems in addition to
   enhancing their cultural identity and self esteem.

   participation in cultural practices was associated with stronger ethnic
   identity. The Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM) scale was used
   to measure the ethnic identity of 945 Native American adolescents (416
   male, 529 female) aged 13 19 across California. Respondents who
   participated in cultural activities including pow-wows, sweat lodge,
   drum group and roundhouse dance reported significantly higher Native
   American ethnic identity than their counterparts who did not take part
   in cultural activities. The association between cultural activities and
   ethnic identity was only significant among urban youth and not among
   reservation youth. Higher grades in school were associated with ethnic
   identity among females but not among males. Findings from this study
   show a strong association between cultural activities and traditional

   (AI/AN) communities in the United States. For the increasing numbers of
   AI/AN individuals who enter and receive treatment for their alcohol or
   other drug problem it is imperative that the service they receive be
   effective. This study used qualitative methodology to examine attitudes
   toward evidence-based practices, also known as evidence-based treatments
   (EBTs) in minority-serving substance abuse treatment programs in the San
   Francisco Bay area. Twenty-two interviews were conducted in the study,
   of which seven were with program directors and substance abuse
   counselors at two urban AI/AN focused sites. These clinics were more
   likely than other minority-focused programs to have experience with
   research and knowledge about adapting EBTs. Only in the AI/AN specific
   sites did an issue arise concerning visibility, that is, undercounting
   AI/AN people in national and state databases. Similar to other
   minority-focused programs, these clinics described mistrust, fear of
   exploitation from the research community, and negative attitudes towards
   EBTs. The underutilization of EBTs in substance abuse programs is
   prevalent and detrimental to the health of patients who would benefit
   from their use. Future research should explore how to use this research
   involvement and experience with adaptation to increase the adoption of
   EBTs in AI/AN serving clinics.

   psychosocial needs satisfaction (autonomy, competence, and relatedness).
   Methods Adults from four cities enrolling in a weight loss program
   (N=477; 72.1% White, BMI=32.21 +/- 7.67) completed questionnaires on
   current exercise levels, perceptions of the environment for exercise,

   Results There were significant interaction effects for neighborhood
   characteristics with all three psychological needs satisfaction, and for
   convenience with competence and relatedness, such that the relationship
   between psychosocial needs satisfaction and exercise is stronger for
   participants with better perceptions of convenience and neighborhood
   characteristics.

   Purpose This study aims to investigate mothers' intentions to vaccinate

   loss) across three cultural groups: Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, and
   non-Hispanic African-American.
   Methods One hundred fifty mothers were recruited from city department of
   health clinics and asked to respond to information about the HPV vaccine
   for their daughters. In a repeated-measures experiment, two different
   frames (gain and loss) were used to present the information.
   Results The results indicated that both frames are equally effective in
   promoting vaccination intentions in non-Hispanic white mothers.
   Conversely, a loss frame message was more effective in non-Hispanic
   African-American and Hispanic mothers.
   Conclusions Information sharing campaigns, aimed at promoting the HPV
   vaccine among ethnic minority groups should be modified to not focus
   exclusively on the benefits of vaccination.

   increased risk for abuse, smoking, and chronic physical health problems
   compared with heterosexual women. In the general population, abuse and
   smoking are associated with physical health problems. However, there has
   been little research on their associations among SMW.
   Purpose The current study examined a mediational model of abuse,
   smoking, and self-reported physical health conditions in a national
   sample of SMW.
   Methods Participants (N=1,224) were recruited via the Internet and
   completed measures of childhood trauma, adult sexual assault, smoking,
   body mass index, and chronic medical conditions.
   Results Structural equation modeling demonstrated that childhood abuse
   was associated with adult sexual assault, smoking, and physical health
   problems, but smoking was not a significant mediator.
   Conclusions The results highlight the impact of childhood abuse on
   physical health problems among SMW and the need to examine other health
   behaviors that may mediate this relation.

AB Objectives. We investigated the frequency of alcohol ads at all 113
   subway and streetcar stations in Boston and the patterns of community
   exposure stratified by race, socioeconomic status, and age.
   Methods. We assessed the extent of alcohol advertising at each station
   in May 2009. We measured gross impressions and gross rating points
   (GRPs) for the entire Greater Boston population and for Boston public
   school student commuters. We compared the frequency of alcohol
   advertising between neighborhoods with differing demographics.
   Results. For the Greater Boston population, alcohol advertising at
   subway stations generated 109 GRPs on a typical day. For Boston public
   school students in grades 5 to 12, alcohol advertising at stations
   generated 134 GRPs. Advertising at stations in low-poverty neighborhoods
   generated 14.1 GRPs and at stations in high-poverty areas, 63.6 GRPs.
   Conclusions. Alcohol ads reach the equivalent of every adult in the
   Greater Boston region and the equivalent of every 5th- to 12th-grade
   public school student each day. More alcohol ads were displayed in
   stations in neighborhoods with high poverty rates than in stations in
   neighborhoods with low poverty rates. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We determined racial/ethnic differences in social support
   and exposure to violence and transphobia, and explored correlates of
   depression among male-to-female transgender women with a history of sex
   work (THSW).
   Methods. A total of 573 THSW who worked or resided in San Francisco or
   Oakland, California, were recruited through street outreach and
   referrals and completed individual interviews using a structured
   questionnaire.
   Results. More than half of Latina and White participants were depressed
   on the basis of Center For Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
   scores. About three quarters of White participants reported ever having
   suicidal ideation, of whom 64% reported suicide attempts. Half of the
   participants reported being physically assaulted, and 38% reported being
   raped or sexually assaulted before age 18 years. White and African
   American participants reported transphobia experiences more frequently
   than did others. Social support, transphobia, suicidal ideation, and
   levels of income and education were significantly and independently
   correlated with depression.
   Conclusions. For THSW, psychological vulnerability must be addressed in
   counseling, support groups, and health promotion programs specifically
   tailored to race/ethnicity. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:1980-1988.

   antiretroviral treatment (ART) to determine the impact of
   neuropsychiatric symptoms and socioeconomic status on adherence and
   mortality. Almost 60% had good adherence based upon pharmacy records.
   Poor adherence was associated with being divorced, poorer, food
   insecure, and less educated. Longer travel time to clinic, concealing
   one's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and experiencing side
   effects predicted poor adherence. Over a third of the patients had
   cognitive impairment and poorer cognitive function was also associated
   with poor adherence. During follow-up (mean 275 days), 20% died-usually
   within 90 days of starting ART. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, advanced HIV,
   peripheral neuropathy symptoms, food insecurity, and poverty were
   associated with death. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, advanced HIV, and
   poverty remained significant independent predictors of death in a
   multivariate model adjusting for other significant factors. Social,
   economic, cognitive, and psychiatric problems impact adherence and
   survival for people receiving ART in rural Zambia.

AB Threatening things are often perceptually exaggerated, such that they
   appear higher, closer, of greater duration, or more intense than they
   actually are. According to the Resources and Perception Model (RPM)
   psychosocial resources can prevent this exaggeration, leading to more
   accurate perception. Two studies tested RPM. Study 1 showed that the
   perceived closeness of a threatening object (a live tarantula) but not
   an innocuous object (a cat toy) was moderated by induced self-worth.
   Further, the more self-worth that participants experienced, the less
   close the tarantula appeared to them. Study 2 showed that greater levels
   of self-esteem reduced perceived height, but only among participants
   prevented from holding a protective handrail while looking down.
   Together, these studies confirm that resources moderate the physical
   perception of both distance and height, that resources moderate
   perception of threats but not nonthreats, that different resources have
   similar moderating effects, and that psychosocial resources can supplant
   physical resources.

AB Objective: To quantify empirically the role of peer social networks in
   contraceptive behavior among adolescents. Method: Using longitudinal
   data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents, the authors
   use a multivariate structural model with school-level fixed effects to
   account for the problems of contextual effects, correlated effects, and
   peer selection to reduce the potential impact of biases from the
   estimates of peer influence. The peer group measures are drawn not only
   from the nominations of close friends but also from classmates.
   Contraception use among the peer groups was constructed using the peers'
   own reports of their contraceptive behavior. Results: Controlling for
   parental characteristics and other demographic variables, the authors
   find that a 10% increase in the proportion of classmates who use
   contraception increases the likelihood of individual contraception use
   by approximately 5%. They also find evidence that the influence of close
   friends diminishes after accounting for unobserved environmental
   confounders. Conclusion: The findings of this study support the findings
   in the literature that peer effects are important determinants of
   contraception use even after controlling for potential biases in the
   data. Effective policy aimed at increasing contraception use among
   adolescents should consider these peer effects.

AB Major depressive disorder (MDD) profoundly affects social functioning,
   including the ability to enjoy social activities with peers, friends,
   and family members. We sought to compare changes in social functioning
   and depressive symptoms in the first level of the Sequenced Treatment
   Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. Adult outpatients (N
   = 2876) with diagnoses of MDD were treated using flexible doses of
   citalopram for up to 14 weeks. We compared the change over the course of
   treatment in the social activities item of the Work and Social
   Adjustment Scale to the change in individual items of the Quick
   Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self-Rated (QIDS-SR). Improvement in
   social functioning was modestly positively correlated with improvement
   in sad mood, concentration/decision making, involvement, and
   energy/fatigability. Only 16% to 22% of the variance in the change in
   social functioning was accounted for by these symptoms, and only 32% was
   accounted for by the total QIDS-SR score. In this large real-world
   sample of outpatients treated using citalopram, changes in depressive
   symptoms do not entirely explain improvements in social functioning.

AB Several philosophers of science have argued that epistemically rational

   conversely, rational groups might be composed of irrational individuals.
   We call the conjunction of these two claims the Independence Thesis, as
   they entail that methodological prescriptions for scientific communities
   and those for individual scientists are logically independent. We defend
   the inconsistency thesis by characterizing four criteria for epistemic
   rationality and then proving that, under said criteria, individuals will
   be judged rational when groups are not and vice versa. We then explain
   the implications of our results for descriptive history of science and

AB A host of interventions are now known to be helpful to alleviate
   subjective distress and improve well-being in dementia caregivers.
   However, few intervention studies have focused on measures of physical
   health, and none have examined cortisol as an outcome-despite the fact
   that cortisol is regarded as a crucial biological intermediary by which
   chronic stress leads to disease. In this study, we examined demographic
   and psychosocial factors as predictors of salivary cortisol at a
   baseline assessment, among a sample of 175 Latino/Hispanic and Caucasian
   women caring for a family member with dementia. We also examined the
   influence of a cognitive-behaviour-based psychoeducational intervention
   (Coping with Caregiving) on cortisol at a post-treatment assessment,
   compared with a minimal support condition. Results revealed that
   caregivers with high intensity caregiving situations, characterized by
   long hours of care and co-residence with the care recipient, tended to
   have less adaptive cortisol patterns. However, these 'at-risk'
   caregivers benefited most from the Coping with Caregiving intervention
   and had more normal cortisol patterns at post-treatment, compared with
   caregivers in the control condition. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley &

AB Inspired by inquiry-guided learning and critical self-reflection as

   develop critical thinking skills through inquiry and reflective writing.
   Students compile questions and reflections throughout the course and, at
   the end of the term, use their writings for a comprehensive analytic
   self-reflection that examines their intellectual and sociological
   growth. Following Schwalbe's (2008) urging to emphasize sociological
   thinking over disciplinary nuances in introductory courses, we describe
   several complementary methods for teaching students how to think like
   sociologists. We detail five inquiry exercises and three reflection
   exercises that build up to the final analytic reflection essay. The
   unique value of these exercises is that students not only engage the
   course material throughout the course but also learn to examine their
   own writing as data. In doing so, students learn to value the process of
   learning, inquiry, and critical self-reflection while acquiring and
   constructing self-knowledge.

AB Context: Research examining the association between environmental
   attributes and physical activity among youth is growing. An updated
   review of literature is needed to summarize the current evidence base,
   and to inform policies and environmental interventions to promote active
   lifestyles among young people.
   Evidence acquisition: A literature search was conducted using the Active
   Living Research (ALR) literature database, an online database that codes
   study characteristics and results of published papers on built/social
   environment and physical activity/obesity/sedentary behavior. Papers in
   the ALR database were identified through PubMed, Web of Science, and
   SPORT Discus using systematically developed and expert-validated search
   protocols. For the current review, additional inclusion criteria were
   used to select observational, quantitative studies among youth aged 3-18
   years.
   Evidence synthesis: Papers were categorized by design features, sample
   characteristics, and measurement mode. Relevant results were summarized,
   stratified by age (children or adolescents) and mode of measurement
   (objective or perceived) for environmental attributes and physical
   activity. Percentage of significant results was calculated.
   Conclusions: Mode of measurement greatly influenced the consistency of
   associations between environmental attributes and youth physical
   activity. For both children and adolescents, the most consistent
   associations involved objectively measured environmental attributes and
   reported physical activity. The most supported correlates for children
   were walkability, traffic speed/volume, access/proximity to recreation
   facilities, land-use mix, and residential density. The most supported
   correlates for adolescents were land-use mix and residential density.
   These findings support several recommendations for policy and
   environmental change from such groups as the IOM and National Physical
   Activity Plan. (Am J Prev Med 2011;41(4):442-455) (C) 2011 American

AB Objective: To assess the relationship between bullying peers as a child
   and adult intimate partner violence perpetration in a clinic-based
   sample of adult men. School bullying perpetration and intimate partner
   violence perpetration are both thought to stem from desire for power and
   control over others.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between January 2005 and
   December 2006.
   Setting: Three urban community health centers in Boston, Massachusetts.
   Participants: Men aged 18 to 35 years (n = 1491) seeking services at
   participating community health centers.
   Main Exposure: School bullying perpetration.
   Outcome Measure: Past-year physical or sexual violence perpetration
   against a female partner (intimatepartner violence [IPV]).
   Results: Two-fifths of men reported perpetrating school bullying as a
   child (n = 610; 40.9%). Men who rarely bullied in school were 1.53 times
   more likely to perpetrate past-year IPV than men who did not bully (95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.29); this risk was elevated to 3.82
   times more likely to perpetrate any past-year IPV for those men who
   bullied peers frequently (95% CI, 2.55-5.73).
   Conclusions: The present study indicates that bullying peers in school
   as a child, especially frequent bullying perpetration, is associated
   with increased risk for men's perpetration of IPV as an adult. The
   effect remains strong after controlling for common prior risk factors
   for both bullying and IPV perpetration. Future research is needed to
   discern the mechanisms and underlying root causes of abusive behavior,
   such as power and control, as a means to prevent violence perpetration
   across settings and life stages.

AB It is proposed that socioeconomic conditions in early childhood effect
   immune programming, with poorer conditions resulting in adult phenotypes
   that are prone to inflammation. Recent evidence supports this
   possibility, showing an inverse association of childhood SES with adult
   markers of systemic inflammation. In this study, we further investigate
   this association, extending prior studies to include an examination of
   multiple indices of SES across distinct periods of childhood. Subjects
   were 112 men and women, 40-60 years of age (88.6% Caucasian). Childhood
   SES was indexed by a composite of three indicators of parental wealth
   (parental home and vehicle ownership, and number of bedrooms per child
   in the family home) averaged across 2 year periods of childhood between
   1 and 18 years old. Higher adult serum concentrations of interleukin
   (1L)-6 were associated with lower SES in early childhood (years 1-2)
   (beta = -.05, p <.05), associations that were independent of adult age,
   personal income, educational attainment, gender, race, body mass index,
   and physical activity. These associations support recent suggestions
   that the early environment may program immune phenotypes that contribute
   to disease risk. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Methodological differences among studies of vasomotor symptoms limit
   rigorous comparison or systematic review. Vasomotor symptoms generally
   include hot flushes and night sweats although other associated symptoms
   exist. Prevalence rates vary between and within populations, but
   different studies collect data on frequency, bothersomeness, and/or
   severity using different outcome measures and scales. making comparisons
   difficult.
   We reviewed only cross-cultural studies of menopausal symptoms that
   explicitly examined symptoms in general populations of women in
   different countries or different ethnic groups in the same country. This
   resulted in the inclusion of nine studies: Australian/Japanese Midlife
   Women's Health Study (AJMWHS), Decisions At Menopause Study (DAMeS),
   Four Major Ethnic Groups (FMEG), Hilo Women's Health Survey (HWHS),
   Mid-Aged Health in Women from the Indian Subcontinent (MAHWIS), Penn
   Ovarian Aging Study (POAS), Study of Women's Health Across the Nation
   (SWAN), Women's Health in Midlife National Study (WHiMNS), and Women's
   International Study of Health and Sexuality (WISHeS). These studies
   highlight the methodological challenges involved in conducting
   multi-population studies, particularly when languages differ, but also
   highlight the importance of performing multivariate and factor analyses.
   Significant cultural differences in one or more vasomotor symptoms were
   observed in 8 of 9 studies, and symptoms were influenced by the
   following determinants: menopausal status, hormones (and variance), age
   (or actually, the square of age, age(2)). BMI, depression, anxiety, poor
   physical health, perceived stress, lifestyle factors (hormone therapy
   use, smoking and exposure to passive smoke), and acculturation (in
   immigrant populations). Recommendations are made to improve
   methodological rigor and facilitate comparisons in future cross-cultural
   menopause studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is the third in a series of reviews of cross-cultural studies

   used previously in cross-cultural studies of menopause and women's

   somatic symptoms across cultures and (2) recommend questions and tools
   that can be used in future research. This review also aims to examine
   the determinants of somatic symptoms.
   The review concludes that methods used for assessing somatic symptoms
   differ across studies. Somatic symptoms, particularly, aches, pain, and
   fatigue have a high prevalence. Statistically significant differences
   were seen in the prevalence of somatic symptoms across cultures. Based
   on the number of studies that demonstrated cross-cultural differences in
   symptom prevalence, we recommend that the following symptoms be included
   in future studies of symptoms at midlife: headaches, aches/pain,
   palpitations. dizziness, fatigue, breathing difficulties, numbness or
   tingling, and gastrointestinal difficulties. We also recommend that
   objective measures of physical function be administered when possible to
   supplement subjective self-evaluation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   impact of malnutrition, social disadvantages, and poverty on the lives
   of children. An integrated response to these difficulties associated in
   the lives of children, families and the communities in which they live -
   the "Medical Home" - is suggested as a means to promote health for all
   ages. The four types of malnutrition delineated by the World Health
   Organization are discussed, as are differences between "socioeconomic
   status" and "social gradient." The latter construct is more meaningful
   from a health care standpoint as differences within each of the
   socioeconomic groupings are greater than differences between them.
   Poverty affects food choices with a profound impact on nutritional
   status. This review suggests how providing a "Medical Home" can improve
   dietary habits, improve overall nutrition and prevent disease. (C) 2011

AB This study explores how firms shape labor markets and career paths using
   employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked
   non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical
   professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment
   contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets,
   firms use non-competes to "strike back" against technical professionals'
   increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets.
   In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single
   industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of
   industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more
   likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their
   technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms
   strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such
   contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These
   findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in
   the knowledge economy.

AB Background: Hungary will continue to experience a high burden of disease
   and death from lung cancer and other tobacco-induced disease unless
   there is a significant reduction in youth smoking. Social factors have
   been found to be among the most important determinants of adolescent
   smoking, yet few studies have investigated social normative beliefs in
   Hungarian youth. The purpose of the current study was to investigate
   three measures of smoking normative beliefs thought to influence
   adolescent smoking: perceived prevalence of smoking; perceived
   popularity of smoking among successful/elite elements of society; and
   perceived disapproval by friends and family.
   Methods: A cross-sectional school-based survey of eighth grade (n = 258)
   and 12th grade (n = 288) students in Mako, Hungary was conducted to
   assess social normative beliefs about smoking, current smoking, ever
   smoking, and susceptibility to smoking. The association of the normative
   beliefs with the smoking behavior variables was examined through
   logistic regression analysis, and the underlying factor structure of the
   normative belief items in the current sample was determined through
   factor analysis.
   Results: The percent of boys reporting current smoking was 40.5% in 12th
   grade and 27.0% in eighth grade. Among girls, the percent was 44.0% of
   12th graders and 29.1% of eighth graders. Parent/peer disapproval was
   the most consistently associated normative belief with smoking behavior
   and susceptibility to smoking across both samples.
   Conclusions: Youth smoking prevention programs should consider assessing
   and taking into account normative beliefs and develop strategies that
   provide accurate information about the actual prevalence of smoking, the
   types of individuals who smoke, and approval/disapproval of smoking by
   parents and peers.

AB A growing number of studies have examined the prevalence and correlates
   of psychopathology in Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi
   Freedom (OEF-OIF), but few have examined determinants of resilience in
   this population. This study employed a novel approach to classify
   psychological resilience in a cross-sectional sample of OEF-OIF
   Veterans. A total of 272 predominantly older reserve/National Guard
   OEF/OIF Veterans completed a mail survey that assessed combat exposure,
   psychopathology, psychosocial functioning, and aspects of social
   support. Cluster analysis of scores on measures of combat exposure and
   PTSD symptoms revealed that a three-group solution best fit the data:
   Controls (low combat exposure, low PTSD symptoms); PTSD (high combat
   exposure, high PTSD symptoms); and Resilient (high combat exposure, low
   PTSD symptoms). Compared to the PTSD group, the Resilient group was more
   likely to be in a relationship and active duty; they also scored lower
   on a measure of psychosocial dysfunction, and higher on measures of
   psychological resilience and postdeployment social support. Logistic
   regression analysis revealed that being in a relationship, having fewer
   psychosocial difficulties, and reporting greater perceptions of
   purpose/control and family support and understanding were significantly
   associated with resilient group membership. Results of this study
   demonstrate a novel approach to classifying psychological resilience and
   suggest that interventions to mitigate psychosocial difficulties,
   enhance perceptions of purpose and control, and bolster family support
   and understanding may help promote resilience to combat-related PTSD in
   OEF-OIF Veterans. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Worship attendance has been associated with longer survival in
   prospective cohort studies. A possible explanation is that religious
   involvement may promote healthier lifestyle choices. Therefore, we
   examined whether attendance is associated with healthy behaviors, i.e.
   use of preventive medicine services, non-smoking, moderate drinking,
   exercising regularly, and with healthy dietary habits. The population
   included 71,689 post-menopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health
   Initiative observational study free of chronic diseases at baseline.
   Attendance and lifestyle behaviors information was collected at baseline
   using self-administered questionnaires. Healthy behaviors were modeled
   as a function of attendance using logistic regression. After adjustment
   for confounders, worship attendance (less than weekly, weekly, and more
   than weekly vs. never) was positively associated with use of preventive
   services [OR for mammograms: 1.34 (1.19, 1.51), 1.41 (1.26, 1.57), 1.33
   (1.17, 1.52); breast self exams: 1.14 (1.02, 1.27), 1.33 (1.21, 1.48),
   1.25 (1.1, 1.43); PAP smears: 1.22 (1.01, 1.47-weekly vs. none)];
   non-smoking: [1.41 (1.35, 1.48), 1.76 (1.69, 1.84), 2.27 (2.15, 2.39)];
   moderate drinking [1.35 (1.27, 1.45), 1.60 (1.52, 1.7), 2.19 (2.0,

   (1.23, 1.39), respectively], but not with regular exercise or with lower
   saturated fat and caloric intake. These findings suggest that worship
   attendance is associated with certain, but not all, healthy behaviors.
   Further research is needed to get a deeper understanding of the
   relationship between religious involvement and healthy lifestyle
   behaviors and of the inconsistent patterns in this association.

AB Patients make medical decisions in consultation with their partner,
   family, and friends. However, little is known about the ways in which
   these close others influence their decisions, particularly with respect
   to discrete decisions such as those related to medical treatments. This
   cross-sectional study investigated their influence on the surgical
   decisions of inflammatory bowel disease patients referred for surgery to
   remove their colon (N = 91). Guided by research on social control and
   classic research on power and influence in close relationships, we
   identified four types of close other decision influence: persuasion,
   assistance with understanding, indirect influence, and negative
   influence. Linear logistic and regression analyses showed that patients
   were more likely to have surgery when their close other used persuasion,
   and they reported lower decisional conflict when their close other
   helped them understand the decision. Patients were less likely to have
   surgery and reported greater decisional conflict when their close other
   used negative influence tactics. Findings demonstrate the importance of
   considering social context when investigating patient decision making.

AB BACKGROUND: Electronic patient portals give patients access to
   information from their electronic health record and the ability to
   message their providers. These tools are becoming more widely used and
   are expected to promote patient engagement with health care.
   OBJECTIVE: To quantify portal usage and explore potential differences in
   adoption and use according to patients' socioeconomic and clinical
   characteristics in a network of federally qualified health centers
   serving New York City and neighboring counties.
   DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data from portal and electronic health
   records.
   PARTICIPANTS: 74,368 adult patients seen between April 2008 and April
   2010.
   MAIN MEASURES: Odds of receiving an access code to the portal,
   activating the account, and using the portal more than once
   KEY RESULTS: Over the 2 years of the study, 16% of patients (n = 11,903)
   received an access code. Of these, 60% (n = 7138) activated the account,
   and 49% (n = 5791) used the account two or more times. Patients with
   chronic conditions were more likely to receive an access code and to
   become repeat users. In addition, the odds of receiving an access code
   were significantly higher for whites, women, younger patients, English
   speakers, and the insured. The odds of repeat portal use, among those
   with activated accounts, increased with white race, English language,
   and private insurance or Medicaid compared to no insurance. Racial
   disparities were small but persisted in models that controlled for
   language, insurance, and health status.
   CONCLUSIONS: We found good early rates of adoption and use of an
   electronic patient portal during the first 2 years of its deployment
   among a predominantly low-income population, especially among patients
   with chronic diseases. Disparities in access to and usage of the portal
   were evident but were smaller than those reported recently in other
   populations. Continued efforts will be needed to ensure that portals are
   usable for and used by disadvantaged groups so that all patients benefit
   equally from these technologies.

AB BACKGROUND: Despite high rates of post-deployment psychosocial problems
   in Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, mental health and social services are
   under-utilized.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)
   integrated care (IC) clinic (established in April 2007), offering an
   initial three-part primary care, mental health and social services
   visit, improved psychosocial services utilization in Iraq and
   Afghanistan veterans compared to usual care (UC), a standard primary
   care visit with referral for psychosocial services as needed.
   DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using VA administrative data.
   POPULATION: Five hundred and twenty-six Iraq and Afghanistan veterans
   initiating primary care at a VA medical center between April 1, 2005 and
   April 31, 2009.
   MAIN MEASURES: Multivariable models compared the independent effects of
   primary care clinic type (IC versus UC) on mental health and social
   services utilization outcomes.
   KEY RESULTS: After 2007, compared to UC, veterans presenting to the IC
   primary care clinic were significantly more likely to have had a
   within-30-day mental health evaluation (92% versus 59%, p < 0.001) and
   social services evaluation [77% (IC) versus 56% (UC), p < 0.001]. This
   exceeded background system-wide increases in mental health services
   utilization that occurred in the UC Clinic after 2007 compared to before
   2007. In particular, female veterans, younger veterans, and those with
   positive mental health screens were independently more likely to have
   had mental health and social service evaluations if seen in the IC
   versus UC clinic. Among veterans who screened positive for a parts per
   thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 1 mental health disorder(s), there
   was a median of 1 follow-up specialty mental health visit within the
   first year in both clinics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans new to primary care, an
   integrated primary care visit further improved the likelihood of an
   initial mental health and social services evaluation over background
   increases, but did not improve retention in specialty mental health
   services.

AB Sociologists have used the concept of embeddedness to examine the
   relationships between social networks, social capital, cultural and
   cognitive elements and the construction of markets. Yet important
   questions remain regarding how local and extra-local actors actively
   construct embedded markets and how networks exhibit both embedding and
   disembedding tendencies. I use qualitative data on a case study of Comte
   cheese, an origin-labelled cheese produced in eastern France, to develop
   a more critical and precise analysis of what embeddedness means in the
   context of (localised) food systems. I demonstrate the importance of
   horizontal and vertical forms of embeddedness. The expansion of the
   market and the entry of extra-local actors into the chain put a strain
   on the proximity and close ties that have historically constituted the
   basis of the social embeddedness of the Comte supply chain. The
   institutions that the Inter-professional Committee for Gruyere from
   Comte has developed, the support offered by the French state and the
   actors' shared belief in terroir are forms of vertical embeddedness that
   all act to re-embed the Comte supply chain in its particular territory,
   even in the context of these destabilising forces.

AB Purpose: Cryptorchidism is a common finding in infants and young boys.
   Early repair lessens the extent of testicular injury. We hypothesized
   that anatomical and socioeconomic factors affect the timing of
   consultation and treatment for boys with cryptorchidism.
   Materials and Methods: Under an institutional review board approved
   protocol we reviewed the records at a single institution of children who
   underwent exploration for unilateral or bilateral cryptorchidism.
   Demographic and anatomical factors were recorded.
   Results: The median age of 677 boys at consultation and surgery was 20.3
   and 28.9 months, respectively. Median age at consultation for boys with
   nonpalpable and palpable testicles was 12.3 and 20.9 months,
   respectively (p = 0.03). Boys with a concomitant penile anomaly had a
   younger median age at consultation than boys without a penile anomaly
   (8.5 vs 20.3 months, p < 0.01). Demographic factors did not vary with
   respect to time to consultation and surgery (p > 0.05). Multivariate
   analysis showed that abdominal site and concomitant penile anomaly were
   associated with earlier time to consultation (p = 0.02 and < 0.01,
   respectively).
   Conclusions: The timing of consultation for boys with undescended
   testicles does not vary in regard to race, language or insurance type at
   this tertiary care institution. Instead, anatomical factors influenced
   age at consultation for boys with cryptorchidism. This suggests that in
   some geographic regions access to care is not restricted for minorities
   or noncommercially insured children.

AB Objective Perchloroethylene (PCE) is a known animal carcinogen and
   probable human carcinogen. Dry cleaning exposures, particularly PCE, are
   also associated with renal toxicity. The objective was to follow-up a
   cohort of dry cleaners to evaluate mortality and assess end-stage renal
   disease (ESRD) morbidity.
   Methods This study adds 8 years of mortality follow-up for 1704 dry
   cleaning workers in four cities. Employees eligible for inclusion worked
   for >= 1 year before 1960 in a shop using PCE as the primary solvent.
   Life table analyses for mortality and ESRD morbidity were conducted.
   Only employees alive on 1 January 1977 were included in ESRD analyses.
   Results Overall cancer deaths were in significant excess in this cohort
   (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 1.22, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.36).
   Oesophageal, lung and tongue cancers had significant excesses of deaths.
   Oesophageal cancer risk was highest among those employed in a PCE-using
   shop for >= 5 years with >= 20 years' latency since first such
   employment. Deaths from non-malignant underlying diseases of the stomach
   and duodenum were in significant excess. Hypertensive ESRD morbidity was
   significantly elevated in the entire cohort (standardised incidence
   ratio (SIR) 1.98, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.27), and among workers employed only
   in PCE-using dry cleaning shops for >= 5 years.
   Conclusion Employment in the dry cleaning industry and occupational
   exposure to PCE are associated with an increased risk for ESRD and for
   cancer at several sites. The employment duration findings for
   oesophageal cancer and hypertensive ESRD further support an association
   with PCE exposure instead of lifestyle or socioeconomic factors.

   of HIV-infected individuals by age in South Carolina (SC).
   Methods: Logistic regression was used to compare the characteristics of
   individuals' >= 50 years old to individuals 20-49 years old at HIV
   diagnosis who were reported to SC enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System
   (eHARS) from January 1998 to December 2009. Cox proportional hazards
   analysis was used to examine the time to death after HIV diagnosis over
   the study period.
   Results: Of the 7531 participants, 1204 (16%) were >= 50 years old.
   Multivariable analyses suggested that individuals >= 50 years old were
   more likely to have simultaneous AIDS (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.54-2.10). For
   individuals >= 50 years old, the risk of death was more than three times
   when compared to the younger age group (HR: 3.46, 95% CI 2.27, 5.30).
   Conclusion: Routine HIV screening may decrease late-stage diagnosis and
   improved linkage to care may decrease mortality in older adults.

AB Aims Studies of the relationship between social norms and marijuana use
   have generally focused on individual attitudes, leaving the influence of
   larger societal-level attitudes unknown. The present study investigated
   societal-level disapproval of marijuana use defined by birth cohort or
   by time-period. Design Combined analysis of nationally representative
   annual surveys of secondary school students in the United States
   conducted from 1976 to 2007 as part of the Monitoring the Future study.
   Setting In-school surveys completed by adolescents in the United States.
   Participants A total of 986 003 adolescents in grades 8, 10 and 12.
   Measurements Main predictors included the percentage of students who
   disapproved of marijuana in each birth cohort and time-period.
   Multi-level models with individuals clustered in time-periods of
   observation and birth cohorts were modeled, with past-year marijuana use
   as the outcome. Findings Results indicated a significant and strong
   effect of birth cohort disapproval of marijuana use in predicting
   individual risk of marijuana use, after controlling for individual-level
   disapproval, perceived norms towards marijuana and other
   characteristics. Compared to birth cohorts in which most (87-90.9%)
   adolescents disapproved of marijuana use, odds of marijuana use were
   3.53 times higher in cohorts where fewer than half (42-46.9%)
   disapproved (99% confidence interval: 2.75, 4.53). Conclusions
   Individuals in birth cohorts that are more disapproving of marijuana use
   are less likely to use, independent of their personal attitudes towards
   marijuana use. Social norms and attitudes regarding marijuana use
   cluster in birth cohorts, and this clustering has a direct effect on
   marijuana use even after controlling for individual attitudes and
   perceptions of norms.

AB Background In the largely cross-sectional literature, built environment
   characteristics such as walkability and recreation centres are variably
   related to physical activity. Subgroup-specific effects could help
   explain inconsistent findings, yet few studies have compared built
   environment associations by key characteristics such as sex or life
   stage.
   Methods Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health (wave I 1994-5, wave III 2001-2; n=12 701) and a linked
   geographic information system, cross-sectional relationships between
   moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) bouts and built and
   socioeconomic environment measures were estimated. Negative binomial
   generalised estimating equation regression modelled MVPA as a function
   of log-transformed environment measures, controlling for individual
   sociodemographics and testing for interactions with sex and life stage
   (waves I and III, when respondents were adolescents and young adults,
   respectively).
   Results Higher landscape diversity (coefficient 0.040; 95% CI 0.019 to
   0.062) and lower crime (coefficient -0.047; 95% CI -0.071 to -0.022)
   were related to greater weekly MVPA regardless of sex or life stage.
   Higher street connectivity was marginally related to lower MVPA
   (coefficient -0.176; 95% CI -0.357 to 0.005) in females but not males.
   Pay facilities and public facilities per 10 000 population and median
   household income were unrelated to MVPA.
   Conclusions Similar relationships between higher MVPA and higher
   landscape diversity and lower crime rate across sex and life stage
   suggest that application of these environment features may benefit broad
   populations. Sex-specific associations for street connectivity may
   partly account for the variation in findings across studies and have
   implications for targeting physical activity promotion strategies.

AB Background The relationship between asthma and socio-economic status
   remains unclear. The authors investigated how neighbourhood, school and
   community social environments were associated with incident asthma in
   Southern California schoolchildren.
   Methods New-onset asthma was measured over 3 years of follow-up in the
   Children's Health Study cohort. Multilevel random-effects models
   assessed associations between social environments and asthma, adjusted
   for individual risk factors. At baseline, subjects resided in 274 census
   tracts (ie, neighbourhoods) and attended kindergarten or first grade in
   one of 45 schools distributed in 13 communities throughout Southern
   California. Neighbourhoods and communities were characterised by
   measures of deprivation, income inequality and racial segregation.
   Communities were further described by crime rates. Information on
   schools included whether a school received funding related to the Title
   1 No Child Left Behind programme, which aims to reduce academic
   underachievement in disadvantaged populations.
   Results Increased risk for asthma was observed in subjects attending
   schools receiving Title I funds compared with those from schools without
   funding (adjusted HR 1.71, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.58), and residing in
   communities with higher rates of larceny crime (adjusted HR 2.02, 95% CI
   1.08 to 3.02 across the range of 1827 incidents per 100 000 population).
   Conclusions Risk for asthma was higher in areas of low socio-economic
   status, possibly due to unmeasured risk factors or chronic stress.

AB It is commonly believed that race is perceived through another's facial
   features, such as skin color. In the present research, we demonstrate
   that cues to social status that often surround a face systematically
   change the perception of its race. Participants categorized the race of
   faces that varied along White-Black morph continua and that were
   presented with high-status or low-status attire. Low-status attire
   increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status
   attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this
   influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1).
   When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces
   with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants' hand
   movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the
   other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue)
   before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction
   effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational
   simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by
   a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual
   cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception.
   Together, the findings show how stereotypes interact with physical cues
   to shape person categorization, and suggest that social and contextual
   factors guide the perception of race.

AB The causes of socioeconomic inequality have been debated since the time
   of Plato. Many reasons for the development of stratification have been
   proposed, from the need for hierarchical control over large-scale
   irrigation systems to the accumulation of small differences in wealth
   over time via inheritance processes. However, none of these explains how
   unequal societies came to completely displace egalitarian cultural norms
   over time. Our study models demographic consequences associated with the
   unequal distribution of resources in stratified societies. Agent-based
   simulation results show that in constant environments, unequal access to
   resources can be demographically destabilizing, resulting in the outward
   migration and spread of such societies even when population size is
   relatively small. In variable environments, stratified societies spread
   more and are also better able to survive resource shortages by
   sequestering mortality in the lower classes. The predictions of our
   simulation are provided modest support by a range of existing empirical
   studies. In short, the fact that stratified societies today vastly
   outnumber egalitarian societies may not be due to the transformation of
   egalitarian norms and structures, but may instead reflect the more rapid
   migration of stratified societies and consequent conquest or
   displacement of egalitarian societies over time.

AB Background: Reducing harm associated with selling and purchasing sex is
   an important public health priority in China, yet there are few examples
   of sustainable, successful programs to promote sexual health among
   female sex workers. The limited civil society and scope of
   nongovernmental organizations circumscribe the local capacity of female
   sex workers to collectively organize, advocate for their rights, and
   implement STI/HIV prevention programs. The purpose of this study was to
   examine social networks among low-income female sex workers in South
   China to determine their potential for sexual health promotion.
   Methods/Principal Findings: Semi-structured interviews with 34
   low-income female sex workers and 28 health outreach members were used
   to examine how social relationships affected condom use and negotiation,
   STI/HIV testing and health-seeking behaviors, and dealing with violent
   clients. These data suggested that sex worker's laoxiang (hometown
   social connections) were more powerful than relationships between women
   selling sex at the same venue in establishing the terms and risk of
   commercial sex. Female sex workers from the same hometown often migrated
   to the city with their laoxiang and these social connections fulfilled
   many of the functions of nongovernmental organizations, including
   collective mobilization, condom promotion, violence mitigation, and
   promotion of health-seeking behaviors. Outreach members observed that
   sex workers accompanied by their laoxiang were often more willing to
   accept STI/HIV testing and trust local sexual health services.
   Conclusions/Significance: Organizing STI/HIV prevention services around
   an explicitly defined laoxiang social network may provide a strong
   foundation for sex worker health programs. Further research on dyadic
   interpersonal relationships between female sex workers, group dynamics
   and norm establishment, and the social network characteristics are
   needed.

AB Context Studies involving physicians suggest that unconscious bias may
   be related to clinical decision making and may predict poor
   patient-physician interaction. The presence of unconscious race and
   social class bias and its association with clinical assessments or
   decision making among medical students is unknown.
   Objective To estimate unconscious race and social class bias among
   first-year medical students and investigate its relationship with
   assessments made during clinical vignettes.
   Design, Setting, and Participants A secure Web-based survey was
   administered to 211 medical students entering classes at Johns Hopkins
   School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, in August 2009 and August 2010.
   The survey included the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to assess
   unconscious preferences, direct questions regarding students' explicit
   race and social class preferences, and 8 clinical assessment vignettes
   focused on pain assessment, informed consent, patient reliability, and
   patient trust. Adjusting for student demographics, multiple logistic
   regression was used to determine whether responses to the vignettes were
   associated with unconscious race or social class preferences.
   Main Outcome Measures Association of scores on an established IAT for
   race and a novel IAT for social class with vignette responses.
   Results Among the 202 students who completed the survey, IAT responses
   were consistent with an implicit preference toward white persons among
   140 students (69%, 95% CI, 61%-75%). Responses were consistent with a
   preference toward those in the upper class among 174 students (86%, 95%
   CI, 80%-90%). Assessments generally did not vary by patient race or
   occupation, and multivariable analyses for all vignettes found no
   significant relationship between implicit biases and clinical
   assessments. Regression coefficient for the association between pain
   assessment and race IAT scores was -0.49 (95% CI, -1.00 to 0.03) and for
   social class, the coefficient was -0.04 (95% CI, -0.50 to 0.41).
   Adjusted odds ratios for other vignettes ranged from 0.69 to 3.03 per
   unit change in IAT score, but none were statistically significant.
   Analysis stratified by vignette patient race or class status yielded
   similarly negative results. Tests for interactions between patient race
   or class status and student IAT D scores in predicting clinical
   assessments were not statistically significant.
   Conclusions The majority of first-year medical students at a single
   school had IAT scores consistent with implicit preference for white
   persons and possibly for those in the upper class. However, overall
   vignette-based clinical assessments were not associated with patient
   race or occupation, and no association existed between implicit
   preferences and the assessments. JAMA. 2011;306(9):942-951

AB Emerging findings imply that distinct neurobehavioral systems process
   gains and losses. This study investigated whether individual differences
   in gain learning and loss learning might contribute to different life
   financial outcomes (i.e., assets versus debt). In a community sample of
   healthy adults (n = 75), rapid learners had smaller debt-to-asset ratios
   overall. More specific analyses, however, revealed that those who
   learned rapidly about gains had more assets, while those who learned
   rapidly about losses had less debt. These distinct associations remained
   strong even after controlling for potential cognitive (e. g.,
   intelligence, memory, and risk preferences) and socioeconomic (e. g.,
   age, sex, ethnicity, income, education) confounds. Self-reported
   measures of assets and debt were additionally validated with credit
   report data in a subset of subjects. These findings support the notion
   that different gain and loss learning systems may exert a cumulative
   influence on distinct life financial outcomes.

   a logistic model predicting the effects of having a blog on winning a
   Parliamentary seat. The results show that opposition candidates benefit
   significantly more from having a blog than do non-opposition candidates,
   as blogging provides opportunities denied to them by Malaysia's

   there is much less convergence between these perspectives on the

   this impasse by creating a hegemony index to assess the power structure
   of the capitalist world-system. Though results support the world-economy
   view of three hegemons since the 16th century, findings also contradict
   this perspective and show that England is the most powerful nation

AB Since the mid-nineteenth century, the American Medical Association's

   However managerialism has threatened the likelihood of physicians'
   providing charity care. Specifically, physicians who recently became
   employees, or whose revenue became predominantly pre-paid, also became
   less likely to provide free care. Moreover, physicians with an increased
   proportion of revenue from Medicaid, or in counties with high Medicaid
   managed care penetration, were less likely to provide charity, perhaps
   due in part to a reduced ability to cost-shift. Despite upcoming health
   reform, managerial strategies that employ or pre-pay physicians are
   likely to leave many millions of uninsured without access to charity
   care from physicians.

AB Significant transformations of the health care services sector over the
   past three decades have seen. an increasing reliance on the private
   provision of health care services mediated through private health
   insurance. In countries such as Australia and the UK, private health
   insurance is promoted as providing a greater choice for individuals and
   easing the burden on the public system. While these claims, the policy
   contexts and the decision-making processes of individual consumers have
   attracted some sociological attention, little has been said about the
   role of private insurers. In this article we present a comparative
   analysis of the websites of private health insurers in Australia and the
   UK. Our analysis highlights adoption by private health insurers of
   neoliberal discourses of choice and individual responsibility,
   partnership and healthy lifestyles. In these respects, similarities
   between the discourses over-ride national differences which might
   otherwise be expected given their contrasting health care traditions and
   contexts.

AB Introduction: Limited qualitative research has explored opinions of
   kidney disease health care providers regarding racial and ethnic
   disparities in access to and receipt of kidney transplantation.
   Methods: Key informant interviews were conducted among transplant
   nephrologists, nephrologists, transplant social workers, and transplant
   coordinators to determine barriers to transplantation among African
   Americans compared to whites with end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
   Analysis: Thirty-eight interviews were audio recorded and transcribed to
   hardcopy for content analysis. Grounded theory was used to determine
   dominant themes within the interviews. Reliability and validity were
   ensured by several coinvestigators independently sorting verbatim
   responses used for generating themes and subsequent explanations.
   Results: Several major categories arose from analysis of the
   transcripts. Under the category of personal and social responsibility
   for kidney transplantation, interviews revealed 4 major themes: negative
   personal behaviors, acquisition of and lack of self-treatment of
   comorbid conditions, lack of individual responsibility, and the need for
   more social responsibility. Many providers perceived patients as being
   largely responsible for the development of ESRD, while some providers
   expressed the idea that more social responsibility was needed to improve
   poor health status and disparities in kidney transplantation rates.
   Conclusion: Kidney disease health providers seemed torn between notions
   of patients' accountability and social responsibility for racial
   disparities in chronic kidney disease and ESRD. Further research is
   needed to clarify which aspects contribute most to disparities in access
   to transplantation.

AB Background: Minorities are more prevalent than the general population in
   the child protection system; however, racial/ethnic disparities in
   physical abuse and child protective services interventions are not
   understood.
   Methods: Bivariate and multivariate analyses evaluated racial/ethnic
   differences in reported and substantiated physical abuse, physical abuse
   deaths, and interventions provided in all reported maltreatment from the
   2006 National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System.
   Results: In bivariate analyses, African American (25%), Asian/Pacific
   Islander (21%), and multiracial children (21%) have a higher prevalence
   of substantiated physical abuse than whites (20%). Native Americans
   (0.21%), African Americans (0.15%), Asians/Pacific Islanders (0.12%),
   and Latinos (0.11%) are more likely to die from physical abuse than
   whites (0.09%). African Americans have higher odds than whites of
   reported (odds ratio [04 1.13; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.11-1.14)
   and substantiated (OR, 1.27; 95% Cl, 1.23-1.31) physical abuse. Latinos
   have higher odds of reported physical abuse (OR, 1.18; 95% Cl,
   1.16-1.20) and lower odds of substantiated physical abuse (OR, 0.93; 95%
   Cl, 0.90-0.96). Native Americans have lower odds (OR, 0.53; 95% Cl,
   0.49-0.56) and Asian/ Pacific Islanders higher odds (OR, 1.34; 95% Cl,
   1.26-1.44) of reported physical abuse vs whites. Latinos have
   significantly lower odds than whites of receiving support services.
   Conclusions: Compared with whites, African Americans are at increased
   risk. Latino, Asian/Pacific Islander, and multiracial children have
   greater odds of reports, and Native Americans have lower odds of reports
   for physical abuse. Significant disparities exist in interventions
   provided to minority families. Understanding these disparities has the
   potential to improve reporting, prevention, and interventions.

   to engage in research and assessed correlates of readiness. We also
   conducted interviews with participating pastors to explore strategies
   they had in place to support research engagement. Churches scored fairly
   high in readiness (average of 4.04 out of 5). Churches with a pastor who
   promoted the importance of good nutrition in a sermon or had a budget
   for health-related activities had significantly higher readiness scores
   than churches without such practices. Having a tool to evaluate church
   readiness to engage in research will inform targeted technical
   assistance and research projects that will strengthen church-academic
   partnerships and improve capacity to address health disparities.

AB The present study used a delay discounting framework to study decisions
   about six social policy issues and one monetary outcome. For outcomes
   that nearly all participants discounted, social policies were discounted
   significantly more than money. A similar result was observed when
   analyzing all outcomes using data only from participants who discounted
   all outcomes. Factor analyses, however, indicated that discounting of
   social policies outcomes was not independent of discounting money. When
   data from nondiscounters were included in the analyses, results
   indicated that participants placed the most value on money and the least
   value on expanding legalized abortion. Further, a factor analysis
   suggested that the issues of abortion, gay marriage, and potentially
   affirmative action were valued differently than the other outcomes. This
   separation appeared to be mediated by political party affiliation and
   church attendance. The present results highlight the potential value of
   studying how individuals discount delayed outcomes pertaining to social
   issues, but also reveal the potential complexities of doing so.

   connected measures of neighborhood quality to changes in health outcomes
   for residents, yet little work has been done to develop measures that
   capture and quantify the physical features of the neighborhood's manmade
   surroundings, also known as the built environment. This paper
   investigates the current literature detailing the relationship between
   the built environment and low birthweight and suggests potential
   interventions. Interventions developed at the county, neighborhood, and
   individual levels could aid community leaders and policy-makers in
   breaking the cycle of low birthweight.

AB Background: Studies of small for gestational age (SGA) birth and
   subsequent childhood cognitive outcomes are inconsistent. Few studies
   have assessed whether effects varied by socioeconomic status
   (SES).Objective: To assess child cognitive and behavioral outcomes
   according to SGA and severe SGA (<10th and <5th percentiles) and
   SES.Methods: We followed 474 infants initially selected for a
   case-control study assessing SGA vs. appropriate-for-gestational age
   (AGA). The infants were born at two hospitals: a public hospital serving
   a low-income, African-American population and a private hospital serving
   a predominantly white, middle-class population. At age 54 months, a
   psychologist administered the Differential Abilities Scales (DAS), and
   Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS). The mother completed the Child
   Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Associations were analyzed using multiple
   linear regression.Results: Among AGA children, the mean DAS score was >1
   standard deviation lower for children born at the public vs. the private
   hospital (75.2 vs. 95.7 among boys; 76.3 vs. 101.8 among girls). Being
   SGA had a weaker effect on DAS scores, overall. Severe SGA had a
   significant effect on DAS scores of children born at the private
   hospital (average reduction 8.0 +/- 2.5 points), but not on children
   born at the public hospital (average reduction 1.1 +/- 2.2 points). In
   the latter group, severe SGA was associated with a lower VABS score
   (average reduction 9.2 +/- 2.5 points).Conclusions: Poor fetal growth
   influences neurodevelopment, but this influence is modified by postnatal
   environment. Adverse effects associated with low SES might mask or
   attenuate associations between prenatal exposures and developmental
   outcomes in some populations.

   extraordinary flexibility and stability. Much has been written about the
   paucity of women in tenure track scientific positions and the general
   disparity between men and women in all professions. However, the status
   quo is changing as more women fill the ranks of academia and male
   professors share childcare and household duties with spouses who hold

AB Drawing on an integrated theoretical framework of symbolic interaction
   and queer theory, I analyze how forty-one mostly white middle-class gay
   men accomplish their parenting and family identities. Findings reveal
   how gay active and prospective parents are influenced by the normative
   family ideal and implicate themselves in dominant discourses about
   (hetero)sexuality, gender, family, and parenting. Data suggest that in
   order for gay men to understand themselves as parents, many identify
   with female-familial roles and frame their parenting experiences in
   maternal terms, using such terms as maternal instincts, biological
   clocks, and soccer moms. I argue that these patterns emerge because
   these men inhabit a rather liminal space that lacks any definitive
   models or guidelines. These men make sense of their liminality by
   framing their identities and experiences within established gendered and
   heterosexual parenting scripts, resulting in a narrative hybrid of
   heterosexual men's family and parenting trajectories and discourses
   about women, femininity, and mothering.

   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey research study in a
   convenience sample of 211 Chinese Americans with type 2 diabetes. We
   measured acculturation and diabetes self-management and evaluated the
   association between acculturation and self-management behaviors after
   controlling participants' characteristics using structural equation
   modeling.
   Results: The majority of the participants was born outside the U.S. and
   had a low level of acculturation. Women and older individuals were less
   acculturated, and those who had higher social economic status and lived
   in the U.S. for a longer period were more acculturated. The results of
   the structural equation modeling demonstrated that acculturation was
   significantly associated with DM self-management, and more-acculturated
   individuals were more likely to perform DM self-management than
   less-acculturated ones after controlling demographic characteristics.
   Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that Chinese Americans
   diagnosed with diabetes may benefit from acculturation to mainstream
   society probably because increased acculturation was associated with
   increased help seeking behaviors and increased use of professional
   services. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB BACKGROUND
   Blunted nocturnal blood pressure (NBP) dipping is a significant
   predictor of cardiovascular events. Lower socioeconomic position (SEP)
   may be an important predictor of NBP dipping, especially in African
   Americans (AA). However, the determinants of NBP dipping are not fully
   understood.
   METHODS
   The cross-sectional associations of individual and neighborhood SEP with
   NBP dipping, assessed by 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, were examined
   among 837 AA adults (Mean age: 59.2 +/- 10.7 years; 69.2% women), after
   adjustment for age, sex, hypertension status, body mass index (BMI),
   health behaviors, office, and 24-h systolic BP (SBP).
   RESULTS
   The mean hourly SBP was consistently lower among participants in the
   highest category of individual income compared to those in the lowest
   category, and these differences were most pronounced during sleeping
   hours. The odds of NBP dipping (defined as >10% decline in the mean
   asleep SBP compared to the mean awake SBP) increased by 31% (95%
   confidence interval: 13-53%) and 18% (95% confidence interval: 0-39%)
   for each s.d. increase in income and years of education, respectively,
   after multivariable adjustment.
   CONCLUSIONS
   NBP dipping is patterned by income and education in AA adults even after
   accounting for known risk factors. These results suggest that low SEP is
   a risk factor for insufficient NBP dipping in AA.

   were associated with lower initial BMI trajectory group membership
   (p's<.05). Greater observed BMI increase was associated with higher
   initial BMI across groups (0.6, 0.8, 1.5, 1.9, 2.7). Gender specific
   trajectory models found that male Veterans with higher education and
   white female Veterans were associated with the lowest initial BMI group
   (p's<.05).
   Conclusions. Higher post-deployment BMI was associated with greater BMI
   gain over time for both male and female veterans. Older age is
   associated with higher BMI regardless of gender. Education level and
   racial status are differentially related to BMI trajectory by gender.

AB This article develops and defends a theory of "network failure"
   analogous to more familiar theories of organizational and market failure
   already prevalent in the literature on economic governance. It theorizes
   those failures not as the simple absence of network governance, but
   rather as a situation in which transactional conditions for network
   desirability obtain but network governance is impeded either by
   ignorance or opportunism, or by a combination of the two. It depicts
   network failures as continuous rather than discrete outcomes, shows that
   they have more than one cause, and pays particular attention to two
   undertheorized-if not undiscovered-types of network failure (i.e.,
   involution and contested collaboration). It thereby contributes to the
   development of sociology's toolkit for theorizing networks that are
   "neither market nor hierarchy."

AB The great German theorist Niklas Luhmann argued long ago that meaning is
   the central construct of sociology. We agree, but our scheme of
   stochastic processes-evolved over many years as identity and
   control-argues for switchings of intercalated bits of social network and
   interpretive domain (i.e., netdom switchings) as the core of meaning
   processes. We thus challenge Luhmann's central claim that modern
   society's subsystems are based on communicative self-closure. We assert
   that there is refuting evidence from sociolinguistics, from how
   languages are put together and how languages' indexical and reflexive
   devices (e.g., metapragmatics, heteroglossia, genres) are used in social
   action. Communication is about managing indexicalities, which entail
   great ambiguity and openness as they are anchored in myriad netdom
   switchings across social times and spreads. In contrast, Luhmann's
   concept of communication revolves around binary codes governed
   recursively and algorithmically within systems in efforts to reduce
   complexity from the environment. We conclude that systems closure does
   not solve the problem of uncertainty in social life. In fact, lack of
   uncertainty is itself a problem. Order is necessary, but order at the
   edge of chaos.

AB For the many ethnic minorities in China, the country's current rapid
   development is resulting in lasting effects on both traditions and the
   local environment. This study focuses on the Naxi people of Lijiang, in
   China's Yunnan Province, with the objective of investigating the effects
   of tourism on the minority's culture and environment, most notably their
   water resources. The Naxi have a strong traditional respect for the
   environment. Prompted by cultural and religious values, the Naxi people
   established a water system that brought clean spring water to their town
   for centuries. However, because of a recent surge in domestic tourism,
   the local environment is threatened and the Naxi have lost their respect
   for nature. Unlike their elders, the younger generation no longer
   follows an 'environmental ethic,' the moral relationship of people to
   their natural surroundings. Renewing an environmental ethic among the
   younger Naxi generation would be a crucial step towards better
   environmental management in Lijiang and would help buffer the negative
   effects of rapid development. Findings from this study, synthesized from
   interviews with local residents and experts, serve as a case study to
   analyse the consequences of economic development on traditional cultures
   and their water resources. It explores how indigenous values can be used
   to support sustainable development.

AB Objective: This study examines the role of neighborhood context in the
   accumulation of biological risk factors and racial/ethnic and
   socioeconomic disparities. Methods: Data came from face-to-face
   interviews and blood sample collection on a probability sample of adults
   (n = 549) in the 2002 Chicago Community Adult Health Study. Following
   the approach of prior studies, we constructed an index of cumulative
   biological risk (CBR) by counting how many of eight biomarkers exceeded
   clinically defined criteria for "high risk": systolic and diastolic
   blood pressure, resting heart rate, hemoglobin A(1c), C-reactive
   protein, waist size, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
   Data are presented as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) based on generalized
   linear models with a Poisson link function and population-average
   estimates with robust standard errors. Results: Non-Hispanic blacks (n =
   200), Hispanics (n = 149), and people with low (n = 134) and moderate (n
   = 275) level of education had significantly higher numbers of biological
   risks than their respective reference groups (IRR = 1.48, 1.59, 1.62,
   and 1.48, respectively, with p < .01). Black-white (p < .001) and
   Hispanic-white (p < .003) disparities in CBR remained significant after
   adjusting for individual-level socioeconomic position and behavioral
   factors, whereas individual-level controls substantially diminished the
   low/high (p < .069) and moderate/high (p < .042) educational
   differences. Estimating "within-neighborhood" disparities to adjust for
   neighborhood context fully explained the black-white gap in CBR (p <
   .542) and reduced the Hispanic-white gap to borderline significance (p <
   .053). Neighborhood affluence predicted lower levels of CBR (IRR = 0.82,
   p < .027), but neighborhood disadvantage was not significantly
   associated with CBR (IRR = 1.00, p < .948). Conclusions: Neighborhood
   environments seem to play a pivotal role in the accumulation of
   biological risk and disparities therein.

AB Current and projected rates of species loss prompt us to look for
   innovative conservation efforts. One such proposal is that large areas
   of North America be re-wilded with old world species that descended from
   Pleistocene mega-fauna. We argue that this approach overlooks many
   important ecological, evolutionary, cultural, and economic issues and
   detracts from conservation efforts by adding another arbitrary
   restoration benchmark. Our objectives are to specifically address the
   shifting benchmark for ecological restoration, explore the social
   dimensions of Pleistocene re-wilding, which have been largely
   overlooked, and discuss why we think Pleistocene re-wilding is not a
   proactive approach for conservation. This is not intended as a critique
   of innovative approaches. Instead it is an argument that human and
   ecological factors need to be considered in depth before any restoration
   initiative can be practically implemented. Proactive approaches should
   consider historical conditions while managing based on the present,
   should plan for the future, and should allow adaptation to changing
   conditions. We support the strategy to restore ecological interactions
   using species that coevolved with these interactions, bearing in mind
   the complexities of the socio-ecological dimensions of any management
   action.

AB Background: The study was conducted to determine whether perceived
   racial, economic and gender discrimination has an impact on
   contraception use and choice of method.
   Methods: We analyzed the first 2,500 women aged 14-45 years enrolled in
   the Contraceptive CHOICE Project, a prospective cohort study aimed to
   reduce barriers to obtaining long-acting reversible contraception. Items
   from the "Experiences of Discrimination" (EOD) scale measured
   experienced race-, gender- and economic-based discrimination.
   Results: Overall, 57% of women reported a history of discrimination.
   Thirty-three percent reported gender- or race-based discrimination, and
   24% reported discrimination attributed to socioeconomic status (SES).
   Prior to study enrollment, women reporting discrimination were more
   likely to report any contraception use (61% vs. 52%, p <.001) but were
   more likely to use less effective methods (e.g., barrier methods,
   natural family planning or withdrawal; 41% vs. 32%, p <.001). In
   adjusted analyses, gender-, race- or SES-based discrimination were
   associated with increased current use of less effective methods
   [adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-1.41;
   aRR 1.25, CI 1.08-1.45; aRR 1.23, CI 1.06-1.43, respectively]. After
   enrollment, 66% of women with a history of experience of discrimination
   chose a long-acting reversible contraceptive method (intrauterine device
   or implantable) and 35% chose a depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate or
   contraceptive pill, patch or ring.
   Conclusions: Discrimination negatively impacts a woman's use of
   contraception. However, after financial and structural barriers to
   contraceptive use were eliminated, women with EOD overwhelmingly
   selected effective methods of contraception. Future interventions to
   improve access and utilization of contraception should focus on
   eliminating barriers and targeting interventions that encompass race-,
   gender- and economic-based discrimination. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Research shows that community socioeconomic status (SES) predicts, based
   on food service types available, whether a population has access to
   healthy food. It is not known, however, if a relationship exists between
   SES and risk for foodborne illness (FBI) at the community level.
   Geographic information systems (GIS) give researchers the ability to
   pinpoint health indicators to specific geographic locations and detect
   resulting environmental gradients. It has been used extensively to
   characterize the food environment, with respect to access to healthy
   foods. This research investigated the utility of GIS in determining
   whether community SES and/or demographics relate to access to safe food,
   as measured by food service critical health code violations (CHV) as a
   proxy for risk for FBI. Health inspection records documenting CHV for
   10,859 food service facilities collected between 2005 and 2008 in
   Philadelphia, PA, were accessed. Using an overlay analysis through GIS,
   CHV were plotted over census tracts of the corresponding area. Census
   tracts (n = 368) were categorized into quintiles, based on poverty
   level. Overall, food service facilities in higher poverty areas had a
   greater number of facilities (with at least one CHV) and had more
   frequent inspections than facilities in lower poverty areas. The
   facilities in lower poverty areas, however, had a higher average number
   of CHV per inspection. Analysis of CHV rates in census tracts with high
   concentrations of minority populations found Hispanic facilities had
   more CHV than other demographics, and Hispanic and African American
   facilities had fewer days between inspections. This research
   demonstrates the potential for utilization of GIS mapping for tracking
   risks for FBI. Conversely, it sheds light on the subjective nature of
   health inspections, and indicates that underlying factors might be
   affecting inspection frequency and identification of CHV, such that CHV
   might not be a true proxy for risk for FBI.

AB Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a complication of visceral
   leishmaniasis. Bangladesh national treatment guidelines during the study
   period called for 120 intramuscular injections of sodium antimony
   gluconate (SAG). We assessed care-seeking behavior, diagnosis and
   treatment costs, and coping strategies among 134 PKDL patients; 56 (42%)
   patients had been treated with SAG, and 78 (58%) remained untreated. The
   median direct cost per patient treated was US$367 (interquartile range
   [IQR] = 90-284), more than two times the estimated per capita annual
   income for the study population. The most common coping strategy was to
   take a loan; the median amount borrowed was US$98 (IQR = 71-150), with a
   median interest of US$32 (IQR = 16-95). Households lost a median of 123
   work-days per patient treated. The current regimen for PKDL imposes a
   significant financial burden, reinforcing the link between poverty and
   visceral leishmaniasis. More practical shorter-course regimens for PKDL
   are urgently needed to achieve national and regional visceral
   leishmaniasis elimination goals.

AB Background/Objectives: Socioeconomic disparities in diet quality are
   well established. This study tested the hypothesis that such disparities
   are mediated, in part, by diet cost.
   Subjects/Methods: The Seattle Obesity Study (S.O.S) was a
   cross-sectional study based on a representative sample of 1266 adults of
   King County, WA, conducted in 2008-09. Demographic and socioeconomic
   variables were obtained through telephone survey. Income and education
   were used as indicators of socioeconomic position. Dietary intake data
   were obtained using a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Diet cost was
   calculated based on retail prices for FFQ component foods. Energy
   density (KJ/g) and mean adequacy ratio (MAR) were used as two indices of
   overall diet quality.
   Results: Higher income and education were each associated with lower
   energy density and higher MAR scores, adjusting for covariates. Higher
   income and education were also associated with higher energy adjusted
   diet cost. Higher quality diets were in turn associated with higher diet
   costs. All these associations were significant (P<0.0001). In formal
   mediation analyses, diet cost significantly mediated the pathway between
   income and diet quality measures, adjusting for covariates (P<0.05
   each). Further, income-diet cost-diet quality pathway was found to be
   moderated by education level.
   Conclusions: The social gradient in diet quality may be explained by
   diet cost. Strategies to improve diet quality among lower socioeconomic
   strata may need to take food prices and diet cost along with nutrition
   education into account. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011)

   mothers judged parental authority as less legitimate for personal than
   for conventional or prudential issues. Poorer, less educated mothers
   were more authoritarian in their parenting, and more authoritarian and
   less authoritative parenting and poorer maternal mental health were
   uniquely associated with more frequent and more intense conflicts.
   Conflicts were more frequent among mothers who evaluated parental
   authority as less legitimate for prudential issues and more legitimate
   for personal issues, particularly among mothers of boys. Despite broad
   variation in mothers' education and social class, conflicts reflected
   concerns about drawing boundaries between mothers' legitimate authority
   and adolescents' personal jurisdiction.

AB This study examined Black-White differences in growth of depressive

   subjects (n = 956) that spanned from adolescence to early adulthood.
   Specifically, this study examined whether Black-White differences in
   growth of depressive affect shift over time, and the extent to which
   that shift, if any, was associated with racial differences in the rate
   and ental health consequences of early adult social roles (e.g., living
   arrangements, work/college status, and single parenthood) and
   socio-economic status (SES). As expected, growth in depressive affect
   pivoted around the onset of early adulthood, with the trajectory
   pivoting upward for Black Americans and downward for White Americans.
   Due to deficits in SES, the relation between challenging early adult
   social roles-under/unemployment in particular-and growth in depressive
   affect was more positive for Black Americans. This differential
   "vulnerability'' appears to underlie racial differences in early adult
   growth (and by connection contribute to racial differences in growth
   pivot). The extent to which Black Americans were at a greater risk
   (relative to White Americans) for an upward pivot increased as the
   number of challenging roles increased. Black Americans facing only
   optimal early adult social roles were not at a greater risk, while those
   facing only challenging social roles were at the greatest risk.

AB This study uses the third National Family Health Survey (2005-06) in

   individual and community levels, can explain the persistent gender
   differential in nutritional allocation among children. The results show
   that girls are less likely than boys to receive supplemental food and
   more likely to be malnourished. In general it appears that higher
   women's status within a community, as well as higher maternal status,
   have beneficial effects on a daughter's nutritional status. Further, the
   moderating effects of community appear to be more consistent and
   stronger than the individual-level characteristics. A positive
   relationship between the percentage of literate women in a community and
   the gender differential in malnutrition appears to be an exception to
   the general findings regarding the beneficial nature of women's status
   on a daughter's well-being, showing the need for more than just basic
   adult literacy drives in communities to overcome the problem of daughter
   neglect.

AB Global shifts toward an increasingly Western diet and rises in
   nutrition-related noncommunicable diseases necessitate systematic
   examination of dietary change in adults and children. This study
   longitudinally examined mother and child dietary intakes and their
   relationship with socioeconomic factors across 4 mutually exclusive
   cohorts followed over 6- to 7-y time periods (cohort A: 1991-1997,
   cohort B: 1993-2000, cohort C: 1997-2004, cohort D: 2000-2006). The
   cohorts included 966 mother-child pairs (children 3-5 y at baseline)
   from the China Health and Nutrition Survey. Dietary intake was assessed
   using 24-h recall and household food consumption data; dietary variables
   were the percentage of total energy from animal-source foods (ASF),
   fats/oils, and grains. Mother-child comparison of dietary variables used
   average annual change measures, Spearman partial correlations, random
   effects models, and seemingly unrelated regression models and
   estimation. Whereas children were earlier adopters and maintainers of a
   less traditional Chinese diet, mothers experienced greater shifts away
   from the traditional Chinese diet with increasing child age.
   Mother-child correlations for the dietary variables ranged from 0.46 to
   0.89 (P < 0.001). Similar increased intake of ASF and decreased intake
   of grains were reported for mothers and children of urban (vs. rural)
   residence and with higher levels of maternal education IP < 0.001). A
   comparable cohort effect was shown, with mothers and children consuming
   a less traditional Chinese diet in the later (C and D) compared to

AB Food insecurity is associated with decreased nutrient intake and poor
   health and possibly low bone mass in children. The purpose of this study
   was to formally investigate the relationship of diet, bone mass, and
   food insecurity among children aged 8-19 y (n = 5270). The data used in
   this cross-sectional study were drawn from children participating in the
   NHANES 2001-2004. Data were collected from homes and NHANES mobile
   examination centers across the United States. Food security status was
   classified using the US Children's Food Security Scale and the US
   Household Food Security Scale. Dietary measures were quantified by 24-h
   dietary recall and bone mineral content (BMC) was determined with whole
   body DXA. Results indicated that males 8-11 y from households with food
   insecurity among children were 2.5 times [OR = 2.5 (955k CI = 1.1-5.8)]
   more likely to have fewer than the USDA Food Guide recommended servings
   of dairy foods, 2.3 times [OR = 2.3 (95% Cl = 1.3-4.0)] more likely to
   have less than the estimated average requirement for calcium intake, and
   more likely to have a significantly lower estimated total body (P =
   0.04), trunk (P = 0.05), lumbar spine (P = 0.02), pelvis (P = 0.05), and
   left arm (P = 0.05) BMC compared with males 8-11 y old from households
   with food security among children. Calcium-related dietary factors and
   BMC did not differ among females by food security status. These results
   are evidence that health disparities persist among 8- to 11-y-old,
   food-insecure boys. Successful interventions to improve diet and bone
   health and reduce food insecurity among children are a continuing need
   in the United States. J. Nutr. 141: 1738-1745,2011.

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships of
   chronic stress, social undermining, and social support with symptom
   reduction and remission in depressed patients treated with
   antidepressant medication (citalopram), and to determine whether these
   relationships were moderated by ethnicity. A sample of 301
   treatment-seeking adult patients with non-psychotic depression,
   including 169 African American and 132 Caucasian men and women, were
   enrolled in an eight week, dose-escalation clinical trial.
   Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that, consistent with expectations,
   more baseline social support was associated with greater symptom
   reduction and higher likelihood of remission, especially at higher
   levels of social undermining. Additionally, increases in social support
   from baseline to last visit were associated with more symptom reduction
   and higher likelihood of remission. However, contrary to expectations,
   higher levels of baseline social undermining were associated with more
   symptom reduction in Caucasians, but not in African Americans. Results
   supported the treatment-enhancing effect of available social support at
   the beginning of treatment and over the course of treatment. Efforts to
   enhance social support for patients on antidepressants should be
   considered as part of comprehensive treatment.

AB Background: It is well known that individuals with schizophrenia have
   impaired social cognition. The construct of social cognition involves
   several components, including perception, interpretation, and the
   ability to integrate context (Adolphs R. The neurobiology of social
   cognition. Curr Opin Neurobiol. 2001;11:231-239; Brothers L. The social
   brain: a project for integrating primate behavior and neurophysiology in
   a new domain. Concepts Neurosci. 1990;1:27-61). Importantly, a number of
   studies have suggested that deficits in context processing underlie
   cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (Penn DL, Corrigan PW, Bentall
   RP, Racenstein JM, Newman L. Social cognition in schizophrenia. Psychol
   Bull. 1997;121(1):114-132; Green MF, Nuechterlein KH. Should
   schizophrenia be treated as a neurocognitive disorder? Schizophr Bull.
   1999;25:309-319). Thus, the purpose of the current study was to
   investigate the relationship between context processing and different
   aspects of social cognition in schizophrenia. Method: Individuals with
   schizophrenia (n = 41) and the healthy controls (n = 32) participated in
   this study. The participants completed 2 sections of The Awareness of
   Social Inference Test: (1) social inference minimal (SI-M) and (2)
   social inference enriched (SI-E). They also completed face and voice
   emotion discrimination tasks. In addition, we used the AX-Continuous
   Performance Test (AX-CPT) to measure context processing and the n-back
   task to measure working memory more generally. Results: AX-CPT
   performance in schizophrenia was positively correlated with both SI-M
   and SI-E performance but not with either the face or the voice
   discrimination. Furthermore, the correlation between AX-CPT performance
   and SI-M/SI-E performance was significantly stronger in individuals with
   schizophrenia than in controls. Conclusion: These results suggest that
   impairments in context processing are related to inferential components
   of social cognition in schizophrenia but not to the ability to
   recognition facial or vocal emotion. As such, deficits in context
   processing may contribute to deficits in both "hot" and "cold" aspects
   of cognition in schizophrenia.

AB Few studies have examined geographic variation in hypertension
   disparities, but studies of other health outcomes indicate that racial
   residential segregation may help to explain these variations. The
   authors used data from 8,071 black and white participants in the
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2006) who were
   aged 25 years or older to investigate whether black-white hypertension
   disparities varied by level of metropolitan-level racial residential
   segregation and whether this was explained by race differences in
   neighborhood poverty. Racial segregation was measured by using the black
   isolation index. After adjustment for demographics and individual-level
   socioeconomic position, blacks had 2.74 times higher odds of
   hypertension than whites (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.32, 3.25).
   However, race differences were significantly smaller in low- than in
   high-segregation areas (P(interaction) = 0.006). Race differences in
   neighborhood poverty did not explain this heterogeneity, but poverty
   further modified race disparities: Race differences were largest in
   segregated, low-poverty areas (odds ratio = 4.14, 95% CI: 3.18, 5.38)
   and smallest in nonsegregated, high-poverty areas (odds ratio = 1.24,
   95% CI: 0.77, 2.01). These findings suggest that racial disparities in
   hypertension are not invariant and are modified by contextual levels of
   racial segregation and neighborhood poverty, highlighting the role of
   environmental factors in the genesis of disparities.

AB Rationale: The contribution of socioeconomic factors to racial
   differences in the distribution of lung function is not well understood.
   Objectives: We investigated the contribution of socioeconomic factors to
   racial differences in FEV(1) using statistical tools that allow for
   examination across the population distribution of FEV(1).
   Methods: We compared FEV(1) for white and African-American participants
   (aged 20-80 yr) in NHANES III with greater than or equal to two
   acceptable maneuvers to a restricted sample following the routine
   exclusion criteria used to derive population reference equations.
   Ordinary least squares and quantile regression analyses using
   spirometric, anthropometric, and socioeconomic data (high school
   completion) were performed separately by sex for both data sets.
   Measurements and Main Results: In the entire sample with acceptable
   spirometry (n = 9,658), high school completion was associated with a
   mean 69.13-ml increase in FEV(1) for males (P < 0.05) and a mean
   50.75-ml increase in FEV(1) for females (P < 0.01). In quantile
   regression analysis, we observed a significant racial difference in the
   association of high school completion with FEV(1) among both sexes that
   varied across the distribution; college completion was associated with
   an additional increase in FEV(1) for white males (70.36-250.76 ml) and
   white females (57.87-317.77 ml). Routine exclusion criteria
   differentially excluded individuals by age, race, and education. In the
   restricted sample (n = 2,638), the association with high school
   completion was not significant.
   Conclusions: High school completion is associated with racially
   patterned improvements in the FEV(1) of adults in the general
   population. The application of routine exclusion criteria leads to
   underestimates of the role of high school completion on FEV(1).

AB The Humane metropolis is a rubric to summarize and promote environmental
   and social quality in contemporary urban mosaics. Because cities,
   suburbs, and exurbs, as spatially extensive and connected
   socio-ecological systems, exhibit many negative features, the humane
   metropolis identifies a strategy to combat the ills and instill more
   positive and sustainable features and processes in urban systems.
   Because the humane metropolis as a program has arisen primarily from
   social motivations, there is the opportunity to articulate more
   explicitly the role that science can play in addressing the humane
   metropolis program and evaluating its success. A humane metropolis can
   be summarized as one that 1) protects and restores ecological services
   in cities and suburbs, 2) promotes physical and mental health and safety
   of residents, 3) enhances efficiency by conserving energy, matter,
   water, and time, 4) facilitates equity by being inclusive, as well as
   socially and environmentally just, and 5) maintains a sense of community
   and a sense of place. We clarify the nature of science as a contributor
   to the social program, pointing out the social values motivating
   science, and the role that scientific knowledge and metaphor play in
   linking science with the social program of the humane metropolis. We
   further identify roles that socio-ecological research can play in
   meeting the goals of the humane metropolis. We use examples of
   environmental history, watershed function and restoration, and
   environmental justice research and action from the Baltimore Ecosystem
   Study, Long-Term Ecological Research program. The humane metropolis as a
   social program benefits from scientific contributions that 1) expose
   hidden ecological processes in urban systems, 2) generate knowledge
   connecting people and institutions to the biophysical environment, 3)
   contribute to the civic dialog, and 4) bring scientific values to the
   prioritization and balancing of the goals of the humane metropolis.

AB Previous research on charitable giving has identified a significant
   relationship between political conservatism and greater financial giving
   to charitable causes. Yet that research has not adequately explored the
   important role of religion in that relationship, nor differences in
   financial giving targets (i.e., religious congregations,
   noncongregational religious organizations, and nonreligious
   organizations). Support for competing theories concerning political
   ideology, religious practice, and charitable financial giving is
   assessed using data from the Panel Study on American Ethnicity and
   Religion (PS-ARE). For both religious and nonreligious giving, the
   effect of political ideology is completely mediated by participation in
   religious and civic practices. These findings support recent arguments
   on "practice theory" in cultural sociology and suggest that it is less
   the effect of ideology than of active participation in religious,
   political, and community organizations that explains Americans'
   financial giving to religious and nonreligious organizations.

AB Analysis of interviews with 275 natural and social scientists at 21
   elite U. S. research universities suggests that only a minority of

   selectively employ different cultural strategies with regards to the
   religion-science relationship: redefining categories (the use of
   institutional resources from religion and from science), integration
   models (scientists strategically employ the views of major scientific
   actors to legitimate a more symbiotic relationship between science and
   religion), and intentional talk (scientists actively engage in
   discussions about the boundaries between science and religion). Such
   results challenge narrow conceptions of secularization theory and the
   sociology of science literature by describing ways science intersects
   with other knowledge categories. Most broadly the ways that institutions
   and ideologies shape one another through the agency of individual actors
   within those institutions is explored.

   determinants of health and who saw social policy as health policy were
   more likely to be older, women, non-White, and liberal, and to have less

AB Objectives. We examined relationships between neighborhood social
   disorganization and trichomoniasis among young US adults.
   Methods. We employed multilevel logistic regression modeling with
   secondary data from wave III of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health (2001-2002). The dependent variable-trichomoniasis-was
   measured via urine testing. The measures for neighborhood social
   disorganization were derived from the 2000 US Census-racial and ethnic
   composition, concentrated poverty, and residential instability. The
   sample comprised 11370 individuals across 4912 neighborhoods.
   Results. Trichomoniasis was more likely in neighborhoods with higher
   concentrations of Black residents (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.16; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.30). However, this association was
   mediated by neighborhood concentrated poverty. Furthermore, young adults
   who lived in neighborhoods with higher concentrations of poverty were
   significantly more likely to have trichomoniasis (AOR = 1.25; 95% CI =
   1.07, 1.46). Neither immigrant concentration nor residential instability
   was significantly associated with trichomoniasis.
   Conclusions. These findings strengthen the evidence that neighborhood
   structural conditions are associated with individual sexually
   transmitted infection (STI) acquisition. Research is needed to explore
   the mechanisms through which these conditions influence STI. In
   addition, STI-prevention programs that include structural interventions
   targeting neighborhood disadvantage are needed. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We investigated associations among racial discrimination,

   immigrant Black Americans.
   Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of employed
   working-class Black Americans (193 US-born, 275 foreign-born).
   Results. Both US-born and foreign-born Black participants had high
   levels of exposure to poverty (51% and 57%, respectively) and racial
   discrimination (76% and 60%) and reported high levels of severe
   psychological distress (14% and 16% had a Kessler 6 [K6] score of 13 or
   greater); 17% and 7% reported fair or poor health. After controlling for
   relevant covariates, their risk parameters for racial discrimination
   (high vs no exposure) were 4.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]=2.3, 5.6)
   and 3.3(95% CI=2.1, 4.5), respectively, for continuous K6 score;
   corresponding odds ratios for severe psychological distress were 6.9
   (95% CI=1.4, 35.7) and 6.8(95% CI=2.5, 18.3). No associations existed
   between racial discrimination and self-reported health, suggesting that
   an underlying propensity to report adversity does not account for our
   psychological distress findings.
   Conclusions. Our results attest to the salience of racial
   discrimination, nativity, and socioeconomic position in understanding
   the experiences and psychological health of Black Americans. (Am J

   Linear mixed models examined the cross-sectional association between an
   NSES index and cognitive functioning scores. A base model adjusted for
   age, race/ethnicity, education, income, marital status, and
   hysterectomy. Three groups of potential confounders were examined in
   separate models: vascular, health behavior, and psychosocial factors.
   Results. Living in a neighborhood with a 1-unit higher NSES value was
   associated with a level of cognitive functioning that was 0.022 standard
   deviations higher (P=.02). The association was attenuated but still
   marginally significant (P <.1) after adjustment for confounders and,
   according to interaction tests, stronger among younger and non-White
   women.
   Conclusions. The socioeconomic status of a woman's neighborhood may
   influence her cognitive functioning. This relationship is only partially
   explained by vascular, health behavior, or psychosocial factors. Future
   research is needed on the longitudinal relationships between NSES,
   cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. I examined state-level rates of nursing home use for the
   period from 2000 to 2007.
   Methods. I used multivariate fixed-effects models to examine
   associations between state sociodemographic, economic, supply, and
   programmatic characteristics and rates of use.
   Results. Nursing home use declined among older adults (aged >= 65 years)
   in more than two thirds of states and the District of Columbia but
   increased among older working-age adults (aged 31-64 years) in all but 2
   states. State characteristics associated with these trends differed by
   age group. Although relatively greater state investment in Medicaid
   home- and community-based services coupled with reduced nursing home
   capacity was associated with reduced rates of nursing home care for
   adults aged 65 years and older, neither characteristic was associated
   with use among older working-age adults. Their use was associated with
   state sociodemographic characteristics, as well as chronic disease
   prevalence.
   Conclusions. Policy efforts to expand home- and community-based services
   and to reduce nursing facility capacity appear warranted. To more fully
   extend the Supreme Court's Olmstead decision's promise to older
   working-age adults, additional efforts to understand factors driving
   their increasing use are required. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We examined surveillance data for disparities in pediatric
   influenza-associated hospitalizations according to neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) measures in New Haven County, Connecticut.
   Methods. We geocoded influenza-associated hospitalization case data from
   the past 7 years for children from birth to age 17 years and linked
   these to US Census 2000 tract-level SES data. Following the methods of
   Harvard's Public Health Disparities Geocoding Project, we examined
   neighborhood SES variables, including measures of poverty and crowding.
   We calculated influenza-associated hospitalization incidence by
   influenza season and individual case characteristics, stratified by SES
   measures.
   Results. Overall, the mean annual incidence of pediatric
   influenza-associated hospitalization in high-poverty and high-crowding
   census tracts was at least 3 times greater than that in low-poverty and
   low-crowding tracts. This disparity could not be fully explained by
   prevalence of underlying conditions or receipt of influenza vaccination.
   Conclusions. Linkage of geocoded surveillance data and census
   information allows for ongoing monitoring of SES correlates of health
   and may help target interventions. Our analysis indicates a correlation
   between residence in impoverished or crowded neighborhoods and incidence
   of influenza-associated hospitalization among children in Connecticut.

AB Under what cultural conditions can the relics of symbolically polluted
   time re-emerge as its purified signifiers and culturally successful
   icons within new circumstances? What does it mean when people articulate
   'nostalgic' commitments to social reality they have themselves recently
   jettisoned? Drawing on the ideas of the iconic turn and American
   cultural sociology, the article offers a new framework for understanding
   post-communist nostalgia. Specifically, it provides a comparative
   reinterpretation of the phenomenon of so-called Ostalgie as manifest in
   the streetscapes of Berlin and its counterpart in Warsaw. One of the key
   arguments holds that 'nostalgic' icons are successful because they play
   the cultural role of mnemonic bridges to rather than tokens of longing
   for the failed communist past. In this capacity they forge a communal
   sense of continuity in the liquid times of systemic transformation. As
   such, the article contributes to broader debates about meanings of
   material objects and urban space in relation to collective memory
   destabilized by liminal temporality.

AB Personal and indoor exposure to PM2.5 and polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons (PAHs) were measured in households in the Njombe district
   of Tanzania. Cooking is conducted indoors in this region due to its high
   elevation, cool climate, and heavy seasonal rainfall. Kitchens are often
   poorly ventilated, resulting in high exposures to combustion-related
   pollutants. Sampling sites were selected to represent typical cooking
   practices across regional socio-economic divisions. These include the
   use of open wood fires, charcoal, a mix of charcoal and kerosene, and
   liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking fuels. PM2.5 average personal
   exposure was 14 mu g/m(3) (+/- 3, n = 3) for LPG, 88 mu g/m(3) (+/- 42,
   n = 3) for kerosene/charcoal mix, 588 mu g/m(3) (+/- 347, n = 3) for
   charcoal alone, and 1574 mu g/m(3) (+/- 287, n = 3) for open wood fires.
   Total PAH average personal exposures were less than 1 ng/m(3) (+/- 1, n
   = 3) for LPG, 57 ng/m(3) (+/- 16, n = 3) for kerosene/charcoal mix, 334
   ng/m(3) (+/- 57, n = 3) for charcoal alone, and 5040 ng/m(3) (+/- 909, n
   = 3) for open wood fires. Benzo[a]pyrene equivalent exposures for US
   EPA's priority PAH pollutants were 0 for LPG, 8 ng/m(3) for
   kerosene/charcoal mix, 44 ng/m(3) for charcoal, and 767 ng/m(3) for open
   wood fire. Inhalable pollutants are present at unacceptably high levels,
   exceeding indoor air quality standards for all but LPG fuels. Relative
   results provide an exposure profile for rural East Africa and support
   the feasibility of conducting a larger scale smoke exposure campaign in
   the region. The use of "fuel efficient" wood stoves for the reduction of
   PM2.5 and PAH exposure was measured in a local secondary school. Proper
   use of "fuel efficient" wood stoves reduced personal and indoor exposure
   to measured pollutants by more than 90%, supporting further
   investigation into the applicability of this technology to significantly
   improve indoor air quality.

AB Racial segregation has been a persistent feature of the American social
   landscape and a longstanding contributor to racial inequality,
   particularly between Blacks and Whites. Affirmative action policies have
   been used to address the systemic discrimination and attendant
   socioeconomic consequences to which African Americans have been
   subjected. Yet affirmative action has not been widely used in all
   domains in which segregation and systemic discrimination occurred.
   Although such policies have been adopted in the domains of employment
   and postsecondary education, few federal affirmative action programs
   have been used in housing. This is surprising given high levels of
   segregation across the metropolitan United States, as well as the stated
   integrative objectives of the U.S. Congress when it passed the Fair
   Housing Act of 1968. To understand this puzzle, we use the Gautreaux
   Assisted Housing Program, a housing mobility effort of the Federal
   government and the Chicago Housing Authority that used explicit racial
   criteria, as a surrogate for affirmative action in housing more broadly.
   We conduct a comparative analysis of Gautreaux and affirmative action in
   college admissions using insights from applied political philosophy and
   sociology. By confronting Gautreaux with a more traditional affirmative
   action program, we are able to identify and compare the judicial, moral,
   and instrumental justifications for each, enabling us to draw
   conclusions about whether and how affirmative action can justifiably be
   used on a large scale to reduce neighborhood segregation, the possible
   forms it could take, and the difficulties it would face. We close with a
   discussion of the recent shift toward integration taken by the
   Department of Housing and Urban Development under the Obama
   administration, its relationship to affirmative action, and its
   implications for declines in residential segregation in the United
   States.

AB The political ideology of neoliberalism is widely recognized as having
   influenced the organization of national and global economies and public
   policies since the 1970s. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between the neoliberal variant of globalization and science. To do so,
   we develop a framework for sociology of science that emphasizes closer
   ties among political sociology, the sociology of social movements, and
   economic and organizational sociology and that draws attention to
   patterns of increasing and uneven industrial influence amid several
   countervailing processes. Specifically, we explore three fundamental
   changes since the 1970s: the advent of the knowledge economy and the
   increasing interchange between academic and industrial research and
   development signified by academic capitalism and asymmetric convergence;
   the increasing prominence of science-based regulation of technology in
   global trade liberalization, marked by the heightened role of
   international organizations and the convergence of scientism and
   neoliberalism; and the epistemic modernization of the relationship
   between scientists and publics, represented by the proliferation of new
   institutions of deliberation, participation, activism, enterprise, and
   social movement mobilization.

AB A satisfactory sociology of markets requires that both order and
   disorder in markets be addressed, yet sociologists have seemed more
   concerned with theorizing market stability and order. Change, however,
   is too fundamental a part of markets to receive so little sociological
   attention. One perspective that provides a fertile ground for moving
   ahead with developing an agenda for studying both stability and change
   in markets is American pragmatist social theory. This article therefore
   examines the influence of a pragmatist viewpoint on two broad modern
   theoretical approaches that have implications for the sociology of
   markets, one focused on stabilization processes, the other on
   institutional designs for promoting change. Most particularly, it draws
   on work carried out from a pragmatist viewpoint and illustrates a
   pragmatic approach to change in markets using the case of the EU's
   Forest, Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan and
   initiative.

AB Sociologists, philosophers, and historians of science tend to focus
   their attention on the production of knowledge. More recently, scholars
   have begun to investigate more fully the structures and processes that
   impede the production of knowledge. This article draws on interviews
   conducted with 41 academic researchers to present a phenomenological
   examination of "forbidden knowledge''-a phrase that refers to knowledge
   considered too sensitive, dangerous, or taboo to produce. Forbidden
   knowledge has traditionally been understood as a set of formal controls
   on what ought not be known. We argue that the social processes that
   create forbidden knowledge are embedded in the everyday practices of
   working scientists. The narrative legacies of past controversies in
   science are of particular importance, as they serve as a tool that
   working scientists use to justify, construct, and hide their acceptance
   of forbidden knowledge. As a result, the precise contents of forbidden
   knowledge are fluid, fuzzy, essentially contested, specialty specific,
   locally created, and enforced.

   moderated by both popularity and physiological reactivity to social
   exclusion (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia reactivity [RSAR] and
   heart rate reactivity [HRR]). Popular girls with a reputation for
   valuing popularity were at greater risk for engaging in relational
   aggression when they also exhibited blunted reactivity to social
   exclusion. Conversely, girls who had a reputation for valuing popularity
   but were not popular (i.e., the "wannabes") were at risk for engaging in
   relational aggression when they exhibited heightened reactivity to
   exclusion. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Excavations at the site of Taraco in the northern Titicaca Basin of
   southern Peru indicate a 2,600-y sequence of human occupation beginning
   ca. 1100 B. C. E. Previous research has identified several political
   centers in the region in the latter part of the first millennium B. C.
   E. The two largest centers were Taraco, located near the northern lake
   edge, and Pukara, located 50 km to the northwest in the grassland
   pampas. Our data reveal that a high-status residential section of Taraco
   was burned in the first century A. D., after which economic activity in
   the area dramatically declined. Coincident with this massive fire at
   Taraco, Pukara adopted many of the characteristics of state societies
   and emerged as an expanding regional polity. We conclude that organized
   conflict, beginning approximately 500 B. C. E., is a significant factor
   in the evolution of the archaic state in the northern Titicaca Basin.

   trials.
   Background HF trials have demonstrated differences in outcomes by
   geographic region.
   Methods Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that
   evaluated beta-blockers in HF patients, had a primary endpoint of
   mortality, and enrolled U. S. patients were included. Relative risk (RR)
   was calculated for patients enrolled in the United States and ROW.
   Meta-analysis of the combined mortality rates was performed using the
   Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic, stratified by study.
   Results A total of 8,988 patients were enrolled in the MERIT-HF
   (Metoprolol Controlled-Release Randomized Intervention Trial in Heart
   Failure), COPERNICUS (Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative
   Survival trial), and BEST (beta-Blocker Evaluation of Survival Trial)
   combined; 4,198 (46.7%) were from the United States. In the U. S.
   cohort, the RR reduction for each beta-blocker was of smaller magnitude
   than in the overall cohort and no longer significant, whereas in the ROW
   subgroup, the mortality benefit for beta-blockade persisted. In the
   pooled analysis (n = 11,635), the RR of death was reduced by 23% (p <
   0.001) with beta-blockade compared with placebo. In contrast, the
   mortality reduction associated with beta-blockade in the U. S. cohort
   was small and not statistically significant (RR: 0.92, 95% confidence
   interval [CI]: 0.82 to 1.02, p = 0.11). The survival benefit persisted
   in the ROW cohort (RR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.72, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions Among patients enrolled in the United States, beta-blockade
   was associated with a lower magnitude of survival benefit, whereas the
   ROW response was similar to the total study population. This geographic
   difference in treatment response may be a reflection of population
   differences, genetics, cultural or social differences in disease
   management, or low power and statistical chance. (J Am Coll Cardiol

AB The conversion of Earth's land surface to urban uses is one of the most
   irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere. It drives the loss
   of farmland, affects local climate, fragments habitats, and threatens
   biodiversity. Here we present a meta-analysis of 326 studies that have
   used remotely sensed images to map urban land conversion. We report a
   worldwide observed increase in urban land area of 58,000 km(2) from 1970
   to 2000. India, China, and Africa have experienced the highest rates of
   urban land expansion, and the largest change in total urban extent has
   occurred in North America. Across all regions and for all three decades,
   urban land expansion rates are higher than or equal to urban population
   growth rates, suggesting that urban growth is becoming more expansive
   than compact. Annual growth in GDP per capita drives approximately half
   of the observed urban land expansion in China but only moderately
   affects urban expansion in India and Africa, where urban land expansion
   is driven more by urban population growth. In high income countries,
   rates of urban land expansion are slower and increasingly related to GDP
   growth. However, in North America, population growth contributes more to
   urban expansion than it does in Europe. Much of the observed variation
   in urban expansion was not captured by either population, GDP, or other
   variables in the model. This suggests that contemporary urban expansion
   is related to a variety of factors difficult to observe comprehensively
   at the global level, including international capital flows, the informal
   economy, land use policy, and generalized transport costs. Using the
   results from the global model, we develop forecasts for new urban land
   cover using SRES Scenarios. Our results show that by 2030, global urban
   land cover will increase between 430,000 km(2) and 12,568,000 km(2),
   with an estimate of 1,527,000 km(2) more likely.

AB In 1 previous study, it was shown that neighborhood socioeconomic
   disadvantage is associated with cognitive decline among Latinos. No
   studies have explored whether and to what extent individual-level
   socioeconomic factors account for the relation between neighborhood
   disadvantage and cognitive decline. The purpose of the present study was
   to assess the influence of neighborhood socioeconomic position (SEP) on
   cognitive decline and examine how individual-level SEP factors
   (educational level, annual income, and occupation) influenced
   neighborhood associations over the course of 10 years. Participants (n =
   1,789) were community-dwelling older Mexican Americans from the
   Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging. Neighborhood SEP was derived by
   linking the participant's individual data to the 2000 decennial census.
   The authors assessed cognitive function with the Modified Mini-Mental
   State Examination. Analyses used 3-level hierarchical linear mixed
   models of time within individuals within neighborhoods. After adjustment
   for individual-level sociodemographic characteristics, higher
   neighborhood SEP was significantly associated with cognitive function
   (beta = -0.033; P < 0.05) and rates of decline (beta = -0.0009; P <
   0.10). After adjustment for individual educational level, neighborhood
   SEP remained associated with baseline cognition but not with rates of
   decline. Differences in individual educational levels explained most of
   the intra- and interneighborhood variance. These results suggest that

AB "Development" has become both a watchword and a fascination in sporting
   circles worldwide. Yet sport officials, policy makers, and advocates
   often have relatively unsophisticated understandings of development and
   the role of sport therein. This can result in programs and initiatives
   that are unfocused, ineffective, or even counterproductive. Drawing on
   critical theory and informed by our own research on sport-based social
   programs, the authors attempt to impart clarity by distinguishing two
   different approaches to sport and development: a dominant vision, in
   which sport essentially reproduces established social relations, and an
   interventionist approach, in which sport is intended to contribute to
   more fundamental change and transformation. The authors develop a
   critique of the former and elaborate on the latter, focusing on
   normative visions of the social status quo and the role of sport as an
   educational tool for otherwise disempowered, marginalized young people.
   The overarching objective is to show that practitioners interested in
   using sport for development however defined must recognize these
   theoretical issues and create appropriate programming if their intended
   outcomes are to be achieved.

AB Americans and Chinese tend to behave differently in response to success
   and failure: Americans tend to persist on a task after success, whereas
   Chinese tend to persist after failure. This study examined whether
   cultural differences in emotional reactions to success and failure
   account for these differences. American and Chinese students recalled
   personal success and failure events, evaluated the primary emotion
   evoked by the event, and responded to measures of concerns, appraisals,
   and willingness to try the same task again. Americans were more likely
   than Chinese to report that their success enhanced their self-esteem.
   Chinese were more likely than Americans to estimate that their success
   would make others jealous and enhance others' respect for their family.
   Chinese, compared to Americans, viewed failures as more tolerable, as
   less problematic for their goals, and as less damaging to their
   self-esteem. Culture moderated the relations between these components of
   emotion and willingness to try the task again. In short, culturally
   framed emotional reactions to success and failure result in different
   patterns of anticipated self-regulation.

AB Whereas positive emotions and feeling unequivocally good may be at the
   heart of well-being among Westerners, positive emotions often carry
   negative associations within many Asian cultures. Based on a review of
   East-West cultural differences in dialectical emotions, or co-occurring
   positive and negative feelings, we predicted culture to influence the
   association between positive emotions and depression, but not the
   association between negative emotions and depression. As predicted, in a
   survey of over 600 European-, immigrant Asian-. and Asian American
   college students, positive emotions were associated with depression
   symptoms among European Americans and Asian Americans, but not immigrant
   Asians. Negative emotions were associated with depression symptoms among
   all three groups. We also found initial evidence that acculturation
   (i.e., nativity) may influence the role of positive emotions in
   depression: Asian Americans fell "in between" the two other groups.
   These findings suggest the importance of studying the role of culture in
   positive emotions and in positive psychology. The use of interventions
   based on promoting positive emotions in clinical psychology among Asian
   clients is briefly discussed.

AB Bangladesh has experienced a rapid decline in fertility in the past
   several decades, facilitated by proactive population policies, provision
   of contraceptives, and broader societal shifts, encouraging smaller
   families and use of contraceptive to achieve revised childbearing norms.
   This paper presents 18 years of data from the Sample Registration
   System, a demographic surveillance system operated by the Maternal and
   Child Health-Family Planning Extension Project in six study areas in
   Bangladesh. Prospective measurements of women's fertility preferences
   were used for classifying nearly 25,000 birth outcomes from 1983 to 2000
   as intended, unintended, or 'up to God/Allah'. Over the 18-year period,
   the level of unintended births varied from 22% to 38%, with the lowest
   levels in the mid-1990s. Fatalistic responses declined significantly
   from 25% in the mid-1980s to 1% by the late 1990s. Results of the
   comparison of two geographic areas of Bangladesh indicate differential
   declines in the levels of unintended pregnancies over the study period.
   Prospective measurements of unintended pregnancies were 2-3 times the
   magnitude indicated by retrospective estimates of unwanted births from
   the demographic and health surveys conducted during the study period.
   This unique dataset provides a rare opportunity to visualize the vast
   changes in fertility preferences and unintended births in Bangladesh
   from 1983 to 2000. Significant declines in fatalistic responses reflect
   broader social changes that occurred in Bangladesh to facilitate the
   fertility decline and contraceptive uptake. The drastic differences
   between prospective and retrospective measurements of fertility
   preferences highlight the importance of considering the strengths and
   limitations of each method when attempting to estimate the true level of
   unintended pregnancies and births in a population.

AB There is still much that we do not know about the effects of
   international migration on mental health, but we know even less about
   the mental health consequences of rural-to-urban migration. This may be
   particularly important in developing countries where the health of
   internal migrating populations may affect economic development. We use a
   large representative sample of adults residing in Kathmandu, Nepal to
   investigate the utility of a stress process model for understanding the
   mental health effects of rural-to-urban migration. Because our sample
   contains both migrants and non-migrants, we are able to compare the
   importance of stressors common to all urban dwellers and those specific
   to migrants (i.e. acculturation stressors) as they affect the well-being
   of urban residents. Results show that acculturation-related stressors
   and social support problems are less salient for explaining distress and
   mental health symptoms than common stressors and social support
   problems. Migrants do face more chronic stressors, have more social
   support problems and report higher levels of distress and symptoms. We
   speculate that this has more to do with the social inequality that
   results from migration than with specific migration-related stressors or
   loss of social resources. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB In the Western Polynesian society of Samoa, cultural learning and the
   acquisition of competency in many domains is substantially influenced by
   the hierarchical structure of social relations and interactions. From a
   population-level perspective, this pattern of intergenerational
   transmission of culture can generate differential distributions of
   competencies in many domains of cultural knowledge on the basis of
   children's relative household rank. However, because the local primary
   school provides children with opportunities to learn without regard to
   their household rank, the possibility exists that it may act as a
   countervailing force in the distribution of cultural competency. This
   report examines this possibility through an analysis of children
   developing competency with the Samoan honorific lexicon, a basic yet
   important element of the larger category of respectful behavior that all
   adults in this culture are expected to acquire. A multiple-choice test
   of the Samoan honorific lexicon was administered to a sample of early
   adolescent schoolchildren aged 10-14 years (n = 64) at a single rural
   primary school. Analysis of this data set supports the interpretation
   that the primary school functions to reduce the levels of variation in
   competencies across the population of children and thus operates as a
   leveling mechanism in this domain of cultural knowledge.

AB Children's gardens have recently been shown to increase life skills. The
   purpose of this study was to assess the effects that gardening/plant
   activities from the Junior Master Gardener curriculum, Literature in the
   Garden, have on children's life skills. The life skills examined were
   leadership, teamwork, self-understanding, decision-making skills, and
   communication skills. About 130 third-grade students from a Lee County,
   AL, school participated in the study. Students were equally divided into
   control and experimental groups, and each student was given the youth
   life skills inventory (YLSI) as a pre- and posttest. The experimental
   group participated in eight gardening/ plant activities after the
   pretest, whereas the control group did not complete the activities. No
   significant differences were found between pretests and posttests for
   teamwork, self-understanding, decision making, communication, and
   overall life skills. Significant decreases from pretest to posttest were
   found on leadership skills for the experimental group. Several trends
   were observed with students who read more for fun, read more each week,
   and read more garden books generally increasing in life skills.

AB Methods Data are drawn from Wave 2 of the National Epidemiologic Survey
   on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 34 653), a nationally
   representative study of non-institutionalized US adults. Risk variables
   included social isolation and economic adversity. High state-level
   concentration of same-sex couples, obtained from the US Census, was
   examined as a protective factor.
   Results The past-year prevalence of major depression and generalized
   anxiety disorder was lower among LGB respondents living in states with
   higher concentrations of same-sex couples, compared with LGB respondents
   in states with lower concentrations. Additionally, the increased risk
   for mood and anxiety disorders among LGB individuals exposed to economic
   adversity and social isolation was evident only in states with low
   concentrations of same-sex couples. These interactions between the risk
   and protective factors were not found among heterosexuals, suggesting
   specificity of the effects to LGB individuals. Results were not
   attenuated after controlling for socio-demographic factors, state-level
   income inequality, state-level policies targeting LGBs and state-level
   attitudes towards LGB-relevant issues.
   Conclusions These results provide evidence for the protective effect of
   social/contextual influences on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders
   in LGB individuals. Measures of the social environment should be
   incorporated into future research on the mental health of LGB

AB We evaluated the biological and socio-economic effects of statewide
   limitation of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) hunting licenses, which
   began in Colorado in 1999. We implemented a before-after-control-impact
   (BACI) analysis of annual helicopter sex and age class surveys,
   collected as part of the Colorado Division of Wildlife's routine
   monitoring, to assess changes in adult male/adult female ratios and
   fawn/adult female ratios in response to this change in harvest
   management. Following statewide limitation and reduction of license
   sales (1999-2006), we observed increases in adult male/adult female
   ratios of 7.39 (SE = 2.36) to 15.23 (SE = 1.22) adult males per 100
   adult females in moderately limited areas and of 17.55 (SE = 3.27) to
   21.86 (SE = 2.31) adult males per 100 adult females in highly limited
   areas. We simultaneously observed reductions in fawn/adult female ratios
   in newly limited areas by as much as 6.96 (SE - 2.19) fawns per 100
   females, whereas in areas that had previously been limited we observed
   stabilization of fawn/adult female ratios at levels lower than levels
   observed under the unlimited harvest management structure. An immediate
   decline of $7.86 million in annual revenue stemmed from the change in
   harvest management, but revenue subsequently rebounded. This study
   provides preliminary evidence of potential effects that other state and
   provincial wildlife management agencies may face as they consider
   shifting mule deer harvest management towards limited license scenarios.

AB Objective. To examine disparities in delivery of care and survival
   according to racial classification among White and African-American
   women with Stage IIIC epithelial ovarian cancer undergoing initial
   treatment in a tertiary referral center setting.
   Methods. All consecutive patients diagnosed with Stage IIIC epithelial
   ovarian cancer between 1/1/95 and 12/31/08 were identified and
   clinic-pathologic variables retrospectively collected. Differences in
   initial treatment paradigm, surgical and adjuvant therapy, and overall
   survival according to racial classification were assessed by univariate
   and multivariate analyses.
   Results. A total of 405 patients (White, n = 366; African-American, n =
   39) were identified. There were no significant differences according to
   racial classification in age, CA125, ASA class, histology, tumor grade,
   the frequency of initial surgery (90.4% vs 82.1%, p = 0.06), optimal
   residual disease (73.0% vs 69.2%, p = 0.28), no gross residual disease
   (51.4% vs 53.8%, p = 0.49), and platinum-taxane chemotherapy (88.3% vs
   87.2%, p = 0.55). The median overall survival for White patients was
   50.5 months (95%Cl = 43.2-57.9 months), compared to 47.0 (95%Cl =
   36.2-57.8) months for African-Americans (p= 0.57). On multivariate
   analysis, age, tumor grade 3, serum albumin <3.0 g/dl, platinum-based
   chemotherapy, and no gross residual disease were independently
   associated with overall survival, while African-American race was not
   (HR = 1.06, 95% Cl = 0.61-1.79).
   Conclusions. Among women undergoing initial treatment for ovarian cancer
   at a tertiary referral center, African-American patients were as likely
   as White patients to undergo cytoreductive surgery, be left with minimal
   post-surgical residual disease, and receive appropriate chemotherapy.
   With equal access to gynecologic oncology care and multidisciplinary
   cancer resources, the survival disparities according to race observed in
   population-based studies are largely mitigated. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB The period immediately preceding the onset of overt psychosis is
   characterized by a range of symptoms and behaviors including emerging
   attenuated psychosis, spontaneous movement abnormalities, and a broad
   decline in role and social functioning. Recent evidence suggests that
   basal ganglia dysfunction, which is implicated in the development of
   psychotic symptomatology, may manifest in the form of both movement
   abnormalities and deficits in processes integral to psychosocial
   functioning. However, little is known about the relationship between
   abnormal movement function and the observed psychosocial deficits. In
   the present study, 40 clinical high-risk participants meeting criteria
   for a prodromal syndrome were assessed for movement abnormalities and
   global role and social functioning at baseline. Role and social
   functioning were then followed up after a one-year period. At baseline,
   the severity of spontaneous movement abnormalities was associated with
   poor role functioning. Further, when controlling for baseline
   functioning, movement abnormalities predicted changes in social
   functioning one-year later, with a trend in the same direction for role
   functioning. Exploratory analyses also indicated that elevated baseline
   movement abnormalities distinguished those at-risk participants who
   eventually converted to psychosis and that this was also the case for
   poorer baseline global role functioning (at the trend level). Taken
   together, the results suggest that movement abnormalities are closely
   associated with deficits in psychosocial functioning. Elucidating the
   link between these phenomena may serve to refine etiological models of
   frontal-subcortical circuit dysfunction and inform understanding of
   functioning and outcome of these affected youth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB Background: Event related desynchronization (ERD) of mu waves, or mu
   suppression, over sensorimotor cortex has been observed in response to
   self-generated movement, viewing movement, or imaging movement. Mu
   suppression is especially pronounced when the movement has social
   relevance and is being generated by a biological entity indicating
   successful social adaptation. And since social adaptation problems are
   common in schizophrenia, the authors designed a study to test mu wave
   suppression in a first episode of psychosis population.
   Methods: A total of 32 subjects (first episode of psychosis patients N =
   20; healthy comparison subjects N = 12) aged 13-34 watched movement
   videos with and without socially relevant cues, executed by biological
   or nonbiological agents. Scalp electrode EEG recordings of mu rhythm
   (8-13 Hz) over sensorimotor cortex during the session were used to
   calculate mu wave suppression. Average mu suppression was compared
   within and between groups, as well as correlations between mu
   suppression and clinical measures.
   Results: First episode patients showed significantly reduced mu wave
   suppression over sensorimotor cortex when viewing biological motion,
   compared to healthy subjects. In addition, negative symptom burden and
   poor social adjustment correlated with impaired mu wave suppression.
   Conclusions: Our finding provides the first description of impaired
   event related desynchronization of mu waves in response to biological
   motion and its correlation with negative symptoms and social adjustment
   in the first episode of psychosis. Future studies can be conducted to
   determine if mu wave suppression represents an endophenotype with
   potential applications in biological treatments of negative symptoms and
   social functioning deficits in schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

AB This research extends our understanding of the relationship of social
   contact theory to stigma in a sample of mainly African American college
   students. In Phase 1, 75 participants with high levels of contact
   reported significantly lower negative affect and less social distance
   toward the mentally ill as compared to 89 participants with low contact.
   Despite this, the high contact group attributed significantly higher
   levels of dangerousness to the mentally ill. Thus while social contact
   was associated with reductions in some dimensions of stigma, it was
   associated with higher levels of self-reported perceived dangerousness.
   These results were obtained while controlling for social desirability
   bias in the self-report measures of stigma. The results from Phase I of
   this study may indicate fundamental differences between incidental
   social contact and that which occurs in an assistive context. In Phase
   2, a subset of convenience from the high contact group (n = 27) and the
   low contact group (n =38) were compared on cardiovascular reactivity
   measures while imagining social interactions with people labeled with
   schizophrenia. Post hoc testing revealed that when participants from the
   high contact group imagined interacting with people labeled as
   schizophrenic they exhibited significant decreases in total peripheral
   resistance (TPR), the challenge pattern, compared to their reactions
   when they imagined interacting with unstigmatized people. This finding
   suggests the higher dangerousness ratings of the mentally ill sometimes
   found in African American samples may be related to factors other than
   direct threat. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Large-scale sell-offs of industrial timberlands in the United States
   have prompted public and private investments in a new class of "working
   forest" land deals, notable for their large size and complex divisions
   of property rights. These transactions have been pitched as
   "win-win-win" deals that provide social, economic, and ecological
   benefits. Despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in these
   transactions, we found a paucity of evidence that their supposed
   benefits are being realized. Monitoring programs necessary to gather
   such evidence tend to be underfunded, short term, and focused on a
   limited set of indicators. The few projects with more comprehensive
   monitoring programs had long-term funding sources, formal mechanisms for
   incorporating data into subsequent management decisions, and combined
   multidisciplinary monitoring techniques. We propose that a relatively
   modest allocation of funds to monitoring could help assess-and hopefully
   improve-the effectiveness of current and future transactions, to see if
   the promise of "win-win-win" is actually delivered.

AB Social support from marriage has been linked with better health
   outcomes. Persons with epilepsy (PWE) are significantly less likely to
   be married than persons without epilepsy. No previous studies have
   examined the impact of marriage on epilepsy-related health concerns.
   Outpatient PWE (n=267) were asked to identify their top five concerns on
   the Epilepsy Foundation Concerns Index. After controlling for clinical
   factors (seizure frequency, age of epilepsy diagnosis and disability
   status) PWE who were married were significantly less likely to report
   "Fear of being injured during a seizure" Odds Ratio (OR) 0.33, "Holding
   down a job" OR 0.29, "Getting the work or education you want" OR 0.29,
   "Medical costs of your epilepsy" OR 0.21 and "Lack of people's
   understanding of epilepsy" OR 0.27. Once we controlled for both clinical
   factors and demographic factors only one concern "Medical costs of your
   epilepsy" OR 0.24 remained significant. Our findings support several
   theories examining the health benefits of marriage related to selection,
   protection and economic resources. PWE are particularly prone to
   economic disparities due to lower educational attainment and
   unemployment. Earlier intervention especially for those with childhood
   onset epilepsy may help mitigate these disparities and their impact on
   social relationships and marriage. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB OBJECTIVES: To cross-sectionally quantify the contribution of proxy
   measures of cognitive reserve reflective of the lifespan, such as
   education, socioeconomic status (SES), reading ability, and cognitive
   activities, in explaining late-life cognition.
   DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study of aging.
   SETTING: Retirement communities across the Chicago metropolitan area.
   PARTICIPANTS: Nine hundred fifty-one older adults free of clinical
   dementia in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (aged 79 +/- 8, 74%
   female).
   MEASUREMENTS: Baseline data on multiple life course factors included
   early-, mid-, and late-life participation in cognitive activities;
   early-life and adult SES; education; and reading ability (National Adult
   Reading Test; NART). Path analysis quantified direct and indirect
   standardized effects of life course factors on global cognition and five
   cognitive domains (episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory,
   visuospatial ability, perceptual speed).
   RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, and race, education had the strongest
   association with global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, and
   visuospatial ability, whereas NART (followed by education) had the
   strongest association with working memory. Late-life cognitive
   activities had the strongest association with perceptual speed, followed
   by education.
   CONCLUSIONS: These cross-sectional findings suggest that education and
   reading ability are the most-robust proxy measures of cognitive reserve
   in relation to late-life cognition. Additional research leveraging path
   analysis is warranted to better understand how these life course
   factors, reflecting the latent construct of cognitive reserve, affect
   abnormal cognitive aging. J AmGeriatr Soc 59: 1403-1411, 2011.

AB Testosterone concentrations fluctuate rapidly in response to competitive
   and aggressive interactions, suggesting that changes in testosterone
   rather than baseline differences shape ongoing and/or future competitive
   and aggressive behaviors. Although recent experiments in animal models
   provide compelling empirical support for this idea, studies in humans
   have focused largely on how competitive interactions drive changes in
   testosterone concentrations and not how these changes influence
   subsequent behavior. In this paper, we provide a review of the
   literature on testosterone and human aggression with a main focus on the
   role of testosterone dynamics in modulating reactive aggression. We also
   speculate on one putative neural mechanism through which testosterone
   may bias human aggressive behavior. Finally, we conclude by highlighting
   important questions that should be addressed in future research. (C)

AB Coauthorship links actors at the micro-level of scientists. Through
   electronic databases we now have enough information to compare entire
   research disciplines over time. We compare the complete longitudinal
   coauthorship networks for four research disciplines (biotechnology,
   mathematics, physics and sociology) for 1986-2005. We examined complete
   bibliographies of all researchers registered at the national Slovene
   Research Agency. Known hypotheses were confirmed as were three new
   hypotheses. There were different coauthoring cultures. However, these
   cultures changed over time in Slovenia. The number of coauthored
   publications grew much faster than solo authored productions, especially
   after independence in 1991 and the integration of Slovenian science into
   broader EU systems. Trajectories of types of coauthorship differed
   across the disciplines. Using blockmodeling, we show how coauthorship
   structures change in all disciplines. The most frequent form was a
   core-periphery structure with multiple simple cores, a periphery and a
   semi-periphery. The next most frequent form had this structure but with
   bridging cores. Bridging cores consolidate the center of a discipline by
   giving it greater coherence. These consolidated structures appeared at
   different times in different disciplines, appearing earliest in physics
   and latest in biotechnology. In 2005, biotechnology had the most
   consolidated center followed by physics and sociology. All coauthorship
   networks expanded over time. By far, new recruits went into either the
   semi-periphery or the periphery in all fields. Two 'lab' fields,
   biotechnology and physics, have larger semi-peripheries than
   peripheries. The reverse holds for mathematics and sociology, two
   'office' disciplines. Institutional affiliations and shared interests
   all impact the structure of collaboration in subtle ways.

   science, and Kronegger, Ferligoj and Doreian's paper exemplify both
   (henceforth K, F, D). First, we rarely have such rich and detailed data
   in most other areas of social life. Because science is a written social
   sphere where credit and authorship matter greatly, we have rich data on
   scientific careers that allows us to develop new research methodologies.
   Second, with a nod to the sociology of science, the ever-increasing
   importance of scientific discovery to national economies, the extension
   of science through metaphor (or evidence) to other types of
   organizations with emphasis on the development of new ideas, career
   trajectories and so forth, underscore the substantive importance of
   studying science.

AB Objective: To examine socioeconomic disparities in prostate cancer
   mortality and to assess the scale effect on the results of the disparity
   analysis.
   Methods: Using prostate cancer mortality data (N = 14,036) of Texas from
   1996 to 2004, this study examines the variations of socioeconomic
   disparities in prostate cancer mortality across different geographic
   scales. Age-adjusted odds ratios are employed to reveal the disparities
   by single and composite socioeconomic indicators at county, census
   tract, and block group levels.
   Results: The analysis shows that (1) disparities in prostate cancer
   mortality are significant for most socioeconomic indicators, (2)
   area-level socioeconomic indicators tend to reveal a less extent of
   disparity than individual-level indicators do, and (3) socioeconomic
   disparities in prostate cancer mortality at the census tract and block
   group levels are similar to each other but are completely different from
   those at the county level.
   Conclusion: The selection of geographic scale and socioeconomic
   indicators affects the results of socioeconomic disparity analysis in
   prostate cancer mortality. Most census tract and block group level
   socioeconomic indicators are appropriate for analyzing disparities in
   prostate cancer mortality. County level socioeconomic indicators should
   be avoided if possible.

   studies of masculinities involving men who participated in
   semi-structured individual interviews while enrolled at a private
   research university. Using West and Zimmerman's theory of gender
   performance, the authors argue that participants expressed themselves as
   men and offered responses to interview questions in ways that were
   aligned with traditional assumptions about gender roles and
   expectations. Data from the two studies are juxtaposed to illuminate the
   influence researchers' gender may have had on data collection and

   other kinds of cultural modeling. Using a comparison of two cases of
   food protest in the United Stales the health food movement of William
   Sylvester Graham (1830s) and the early organic movement (1960s-1970s)-I
   emphasize similarities in underlying grievances and in the general
   advocacy of natural food alternatives. The two movements differed
   dramatically, however, in framing and tactics. I focus on contrasts in
   the religious significance they assigned to diet, in their democratic
   commitments, in the relationship they constructed between personal
   transformation and social change, and in their use of state-centered
   strategies. These frames and tactics transposed to food reform more
   general scripts associated with cultural institutions and movements of
   the time, particularly evangelical churches and temperance (Grahamites),
   and environmentalism, the New Left, and the wider counterculture
   (organic advocates).

AB Objectives. We considered the relationship between an urban adult
   population's fruit and vegetable consumption and several selected social
   and psychological processes, beneficial aesthetic experiences, and
   garden participation.
   Methods. We conducted a population-based survey representing 436
   residents across 58 block groups in Denver, Colorado, from 2006 to 2007.
   We used multilevel statistical models to evaluate the survey data.
   Results. Neighborhood aesthetics, social involvement, and community
   garden participation were significantly associated with fruit and
   vegetable intake. Community gardeners consumed fruits and vegetables 5.7
   times per day, compared with home gardeners (4.6 times per day) and
   nongardeners (3.9 times per day). Moreover, 56% of community gardeners
   met national recommendations to consume fruits and vegetables at least 5
   times per day, compared with 37% of home gardeners and 25% of
   nongardeners.
   Conclusions. Our study results shed light on neighborhood processes that
   affect food-related behaviors and provides insights about the potential
   of community gardens to affect these behaviors. The qualities intrinsic
   to community gardens make them a unique intervention that can narrow the
   divide between people and the places where food is grown and increase
   local opportunities to eat better. (Am J Public Health.

AB Single individuals typically have higher testosterone compared to those
   who are partnered, suggesting that individual differences in
   testosterone are associated with mating effort, or people's motivation
   to find a sexual partner. However, there is less consistent evidence for
   links between testosterone and sociosexuality, or people's orientation
   toward uncommitted sexual activity. Based on Penke and Asendorpfs (2008)
   conceptualization, we propose that a more nuanced measure of
   sociosexuality may reveal more robust associations with testosterone. In
   the current study, we assessed relations between three components of
   sociosexuality-desire, behavior, and attitudes-and endogenous
   testosterone levels in men and women. We found that partnered status was
   indeed associated with lower testosterone in both men and women, but
   only among those who reported more restricted sociosexuality. Partnered
   men who reported greater desire for uncommitted sexual activity had
   testosterone levels that were comparable to those of single men;
   partnered women who reported more frequent uncommitted sexual behavior
   had testosterone levels that were comparable to those of single women.
   These findings provide new evidence that people's orientations toward
   sexual relationships, in combination with their relationship status, are
   associated with individual differences in testosterone. The current
   results are also among the first to demonstrate
   sociosexuality-testosterone associations in both men and women, and they
   reveal that the nature of these associations varies by gender. Together,
   these findings highlight the utility of a multifaceted conceptualization
   of sociosexuality and the implications of this conceptualization for
   neuroendocrine processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Independent of current socioeconomic status (SES), past
   maternal SES might influence asthma outcomes in children.
   Objective: We examined associations among the mother's SES in the first
   10 years of her life (maternal childhood SES), increased cord blood IgE
   levels (upper 20% [1.37 IU/mL]), and repeated wheeze (>= 2 episodes by
   age 2 years) in an urban pregnancy cohort (n = 510).
   Methods: Data on sociodemographics, discrimination, financial strain,
   community violence, interpersonal trauma, and other negative events were
   obtained prenatally. Prenatal household dust was assayed for cockroach
   and murine allergens, and traffic-related air pollution was estimated by
   using spatiotemporal land-use regression. Maternal childhood SES was
   defined by parental home ownership (birth to 10 years). Maternally
   reported child wheeze was ascertained at 3-month intervals from birth.
   Using structural equation models, we examined whether outcomes were
   dependent on maternal childhood SES directly versus indirect
   relationships operating through (1) cumulative SES-related adversities,
   (2) the mother's socioeconomic trajectory (adult SES), and (3) current
   prenatal environmental exposures.
   Results: Mothers were largely Hispanic (60%) or black (28%), 37% had not
   completed high school, and 56% reported parental home ownership. When
   associations between low maternal childhood SES and repeated wheeze were
   examined, there were significant indirect effects operating through
   adult SES and prenatal cumulative stress (beta = 0.28, P = .003) and
   pollution (beta = 0.24, P = .004; P value for total indirect effects <=
   .04 for both pathways). Low maternal childhood SES was directly related
   to increased cord blood IgE levels (beta = 0.21, P = .003). Maternal
   cumulative adversity (interpersonal trauma) was also associated with
   increased cord blood IgE levels (beta = 0.19, P = .01), although this
   did not explain maternal childhood SES effects.
   Conclusion: Lower maternal childhood SES was associated with increased
   cord blood IgE levels and repeated wheeze through both direct and
   indirect effects, providing new insights into the role of social
   inequalities as determinants of childhood respiratory risk. (J Allergy

   high-risk African-American premature infant-mother dyads participated.
   Psychosocial (maternal depression, stress and self-efficacy) and
   sociodemographic risk (poverty, maternal education, marital status) were
   maternal self-report (0-4 months). Infant health risk was obtained from
   hospital charts. Infant-mother attachment (12 months) and maternal
   sensitivity (4 months) were assessed with Q-sort measures. Findings:
   Psychosocial and sociodemographic risk, but not infant health risk,
   negatively related to attachment. Both were mediated by maternal
   sensitivity. Conclusions: The impact of risk domains on attachment
   security was mediated by maternal sensitivity. Results emphasize the
   need for early intervention programs targeting premature infants to
   identify and address environmental and personal factors that place

AB BACKGROUND: Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse), the Asian tiger
   mosquito, is an introduced invasive species in the United States that is
   responsible for a significant proportion of service requests to local
   mosquito control programs. This container utilizing mosquito is
   refractory to standard mosquito abatement measures in the United States.
   This study is part of a USDA-ARS project to develop an area-wide
   management strategy for Ae. albopictus. The goal was to identify three
   study sites, similar in socioeconomic parameters, geography and Ae.
   albopictus abundance, in urban and suburban areas in Mercer and Monmouth
   counties in New Jersey. Prior service requests and light trap counts and
   also detailed county maps were used to chose nine preliminary sites
   (four in Mercer and five in Monmouth) where weekly surveillance for Ae.
   albopictus was performed throughout the 2008 active season.
   RESULTS: Although outliers were detected, socioeconomic variables in the
   study sites within each county were fairly consistent. Ae. albopictus
   abundance was associated with poverty levels and had the highest maxima
   in Mercer, although average mosquito abundance was similar in urban
   Mercer and suburban Monmouth.
   CONCLUSION: Three study sites in each county were identified for future
   studies. The summer-long surveillance also revealed socioeconomic
   variables critical for the development of integrated mosquito
   management. (C) 2011 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Both professional work and the sociological study of professional work
   experienced a "golden age" in the mid-20th century. When dramatic
   changes began to shake the professions in the 1970s and 1980s, however,
   old approaches no longer fit, and the research area became quiescent.
   Yet interest in professional work simply "went underground," surfacing
   under other names in a variety of sociological and interdisciplinary
   fields. In the process, researchers' focus expanded to include a broader
   range of "expert" or "knowledge-based" occupations as well as
   traditional professions. This essay brings these disparate research
   streams together and shows that they cohere around four central themes:
   expert knowledge, autonomy, a normative orientation grounded in
   community, and high status, income, and other rewards.

AB Background: Smoking in movies is prevalent. However, use of content
   analysis to describe trends in smoking in movies has provided mixed
   results and has not tapped what adolescents actually perceive.
   Purpose: To assess the prospective trends in the prevalence of smoking
   in movies as perceived by teenagers and identify predictors associated
   with these trends.
   Methods: Using data from the Minnesota Adolescent Community Cohort Study
   collected during 2000-2006 when participants were aged between 12 and 18
   years (N=4735), latent variable growth models were employed to describe
   the longitudinal trends in the perceived prevalence of smoking in movies
   using a four-level scale (never to most of the time) measured every 6
   months, and examined associations between these trends and demographic,
   smoking-related attitudinal and socio-environmental predictors. Analysis
   was conducted in 2009.
   Results: At baseline, about 50% of participants reported seeing smoking
   in movies some of the time, and another 36% reported most of the time.
   The prevalence of smoking in movies as perceived by teenagers declined
   over time, and the decline was steeper in those who were aged 14-16
   years than those who were younger at baseline (p <= 0.05). Despite the
   decline, teenagers still reported seeing smoking in movies some of the
   time. Teenagers who reported more close friends who smoked also reported
   a higher prevalence of smoking in movies at baseline (regression
   coefficients=0.04-0.18, p<0.01).
   Conclusions: Teenagers' perception of the prevalence of smoking in
   movies declined over time, which may be attributable to changes made by
   the movie industry. Despite the decline, teenagers were still exposed to
   a moderate amount of smoking imagery. Interventions that further reduce
   teenage exposure to smoking in movies may be needed to have an effect on
   adolescent smoking. (Am J Prev Med 2011;41(2):167-173) (C) 2011 American

AB Background Although health disparity research has investigated social
   structural, cultural, or psychological factors, the interrelations among
   these factors deserve greater attention.
   Purpose This study aims to examine cancer screening emotions and their
   relations to screening fatalism as determinants of breast cancer
   screening among women from diverse socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds.
   Methods An integrative conceptual framework was used to test the
   multivariate relations among socioeconomic status, age, screening
   fatalism, screening emotions, and clinical breast exam compliance among
   281 Latino and Anglo women, using multi-group structural equation causal
   modeling.
   Results Screening emotions and screening fatalism had a negative, direct
   influence on clinical breast exam compliance for both ethnic groups.
   Still, ethnicity moderated the indirect effect of screening fatalism on
   clinical breast exam compliance through screening emotions.
   Conclusions Integrative conceptual frameworks and multivariate methods
   may shed light on the complex relations among factors influencing health
   behaviors relevant to disparities. Future research and intervention must
   recognize this complexity when working with diverse populations.

AB In the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a US
   longitudinal study of >15 000 young adults, we examined the extent to
   which socioeconomic status is linked to systolic blood pressure (SBP)
   and whether biobehavioral risk factors mediate the association. More
   than 62% of the participants had SBP >120 mm Hg and 12% had SBP >140 mm
   Hg. More than 66% were classified as at least overweight (body mass
   index >25 kg/m(2)), with >36% meeting criteria for at least class I
   obesity (body mass index >30 kg/m(2)). Multivariate models showed that
   higher household income and being married were independently associated
   with lower SBP. Higher body mass index, greater waist circumference,
   smoking, and higher alcohol intake were each independently associated
   with higher SBP. Meditational analyses suggested that higher education
   level was associated with lower SBP by way of lower body mass, smaller
   waist circumference, and lower resting heart rate. When these indirect
   effects were accounted for, education was not significantly associated
   with SBP. In contrast, household income remained associated with SBP
   even with control for all of the covariates. Results reinforce current
   public health concerns about rates of obesity and high blood pressure
   among young adults and suggest that disparities in education level and
   household income may play an important role in the observed decrements
   in health. Identifying modifiable mechanisms that link socioeconomic
   status to SBP using data from a large representative sample may improve
   risk stratification and guide the development of effective
   interventions. (Hypertension. 2011;58:161-166.). Online Data Supplement

AB PURPOSE: Racial and gender disparities in out-of-hospital deaths from
   coronary heart disease (CHD) have been well-documented, yet disparities
   by neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES) have been less
   systematically studied in US population-based surveillance efforts.
   METHODS: We examined the association of nSES, classified into tertiles,
   with 3,743 out-of-hospital fatal CHD events, and a subset of 2,191
   events classified as sudden, among persons aged 35 to 74 years in four
   US communities under surveillance by the Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities (ARIC). Poisson generalized linear mixed models generated
   age-, race- (white, black) and gender-specific standardized mortality
   rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (RR, 95% CI).
   RESULTS: Regardless of nSES measure used, inverse associations of nSES
   with all out-of-hospital fatal CHD and sudden fatal CHD were seen in all
   race-gender groups. The magnitude of these associations was larger among
   women than men. Further, among blacks, associations of low nSES (vs.
   high nSES) were stronger for sudden cardiac deaths (SCD) than for all
   out-of-hospital fatal CHD.
   CONCLUSIONS: Low nSES was associated with an increased risk of
   out-of-hospital CHD death and SCD. Measures of the neighborhood context
   are useful tools in population-based surveillance efforts for
   documenting and monitoring socioeconomic disparities in mortality over
   time. Ann Epidemiol 2011;21:580-588. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB To explore the psycho-social impact of vesico-vaginal fistula (VVF) on
   women in Niger.
   We conducted a qualitative study on 21 women in convalescence at the
   DIMOL Reproductive Health Center in Niamey, Niger, in 2008 and 2009. The
   women had undergone 1-3 fistula repair operations and all had stillborn
   infants.
   Women reported many psychological consequences of VVF including
   depression, feelings of shame, and loneliness. Others reported feeling
   devalued as a woman and wanting to end their lives. Social consequences
   of fistula reported by these women included rejection from society,
   isolation, rejection from husband and/or divorce. Almost half of the
   women reported of having lost their social network and support as a
   result of the fistula. Women with VVF were deemed unworthy, and their
   illness was often attributed to some fault of their own.
   Our findings support the notion that socio-economic factors, though they
   certainly contribute to obstetric fistula, are not the primary reason
   for fistula, particularly in Niger. Fistula is a direct result of lack
   of access to skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care.

AB Drawing on an analysis by Pritchett et al of the "techniques of
   persistent implementation failure'' common across many development
   sectors, this commentary suggests that health systems attempting to
   integrate maternal health and HIV services may need to contend with a
   profound clash of organizational cultures. For decades, countries have
   been pressed to implement global "best practices'' in maternal health
   without attention to the systemic capacity building needed to support
   complex interventions. The result is often form without function, a kind
   of "isomorphic mimicry'' in which policy documents and program plans
   that meet global standards ultimately camouflage deep dysfunction in the
   actual delivery of lifesaving services. As a result, the organizational
   culture that surrounds maternal health services often stands in stark
   contrast to the can-do style that has characterized the rapid,
   well-resourced deployment of HIV services over the last few years. As
   integration proceeds, the resolution of this clash may hold the seeds of
   a much-needed transformation of implementation support practices in both
   fields.

AB Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with higher levels of
   allostatic load (AL). Posited mechanisms for this association include
   stress, personality, psychosocial variables, coping, social networks,
   and health behaviors. This study examines whether these variables
   explain the SES-AL relationship in a population-based sample of 208 51-
   to 69-year-old White, Black, and Hispanic adults in the Chicago Health,
   Aging, and Social Relations Study. AL was based on nine markers of
   physiological dysregulation. SES was inversely associated with a
   composite measure of AL; hostility and poor sleep quality helped to
   explain the association between AL and SES. Factor analyses revealed
   four AL components corresponding to the bodily systems of interest. SES
   was significantly associated with two AL components, suggesting that the
   effects of SES on physiological dysregulation are specific to certain
   systems in a middle to early old-age population.

AB PURPOSE: We wished to determine whether a gradient of association of low
   socioeconomic status with incidence of coronary heart disease was
   present in two population-based cohorts, one from United States and the
   other from Finland.
   METHODS: Using data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
   cohort and the Finnish FINRISK cohort, we estimated, with Cox
   proportional hazard regression models, incidence of sudden cardiac death
   (SCD), non-sudden cardiac death (NSCD), and non-fatal myocardial
   infarction (NEMO for strata of income and education (follow-up:
   1987-2001). In both cohorts, incidence rates of the three outcomes
   increased across all socioeconomic status exposure categories.
   RESULTS: Low education was associated with increased hazard of NFMI in
   both cohorts and with increased risk of SCD among ARIC women. Low income
   was significantly associated with increased hazard of all three outcomes
   among ARIC women and with increased hazard of cardiac death among ARIC
   men. In FINRISK, low income was significantly associated with increased
   risk of SCD only. Risk of SCD in the low income categories was similar
   for both cohorts. Smoking, alcohol consumption, and race (ARIC only) did
   not appreciably alter effect estimates in either cohort.
   CONCLUSIONS: Indices of low SES show similar associations with increased
   risk of cardiac events in Finland and in United States. Ann Epidemiol

AB State-led agrarian reform (SLAR) settlements established in the Amazon
   in the 1970s led to environmental degradation and mixed socioeconomic
   outcomes. More recently, direct-action land reform (DALR) settlements
   have proliferated, which are leading to new forest clearing in the name
   of agrarian reform. The emergence of DALR begs questions about social
   and environmental outcomes in recent Amazon settlements. This paper
   compares DALR settlements in two different regions of the eastern
   Amazon: the South of Para and the Transamazon. Analysis of household
   survey data shows that DALR settlements in the two study areas differ
   substantially in terms of their histories of formation and regional
   contexts. However, social and environmental outcomes do not always
   differ among the two study areas, which in turn resemble older SLAR
   settlements.

AB Environmental equity has been identified as a challenge and goal of
   national to global air quality management. Here, relationships between
   traffic-related air pollution measures and the social demographics of
   elementary schools are investigated. Ogawa passive samplers were used to
   measure ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels near 75 randomly selected
   elementary schools in the county containing Tampa, FL over one week in
   March 2008. Concentrations were determined using colorimetric reaction
   using Hach nitrite reagent and photometric detection at 545 nm. NO2
   levels, two metrics of traffic (highest annual average daily traffic
   count within 500 m and 1000 m), and school enrollment data by
   demographic subgroup (racial/ethnic and socioeconomic) were then
   compared. Data were analyzed for distribution statistics, linear
   correlations, and differences in subgroup category means. Weighted
   average values of NO2 and traffic count were also calculated for each
   subgroup. All measured NO2 levels were low, with a mean of 2.7 ppbv and
   range from 0.8 to 4.7 ppbv. Values were largest at sites near downtown.
   Results from all analyses show comparatively higher potential exposures
   to measured NO2 and traffic count for black school children, and lower
   values for white and Asian or Pacific Islander school children. The
   economically disadvantaged and Hispanic subgroups were also associated
   with higher levels of NO2 and traffic counts, but the relationship was
   not as strong or robust. Although measured NO2 levels were low and the
   differences between groups are small, results suggest disparities by
   racial/ethnic and economic status in children's exposures to air
   pollution for the Tampa area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   perceptions of the community experience following participation. Data
   collection tools included an open-ended questionnaire and focus group
   interviews. Comparisons were made across data for participants who
   engaged in the activity one time versus multiple times. Data analysis
   revealed participation in the community engagement experience had a
   positive impact on most participants. One time only participants
   demonstrated increased self-awareness, contemplating change, and
   capacity to serve while more than one time participants described a
   deeper understanding of community, impact on others, and professional
   transformation. Student involvement in community engagement activities
   combined with structured reflection provided meaningful insight into
   participants' personal beliefs. The results suggest incorporation of
   community-based learning experiences into academic curriculum may be
   beneficial in the students' preliminary understanding of social
   responsibility.</.

AB Injection drug users (IDUs) are at risk for HIV and other bloodborne
   pathogens through receptive syringe sharing (RSS) and receptive
   paraphernalia sharing (RPS). Research into the influence of the
   perceived risk of HIV infection on injection risk behavior has yielded
   mixed findings. One explanation may be that consequences other than HIV
   infection are considered when IDUs are faced with decisions about
   whether or not to share equipment. We investigated the perceived
   consequences of refusing to share injection equipment among 187 IDUs
   recruited from a large syringe exchange program in Los Angeles,
   California, assessed their influence on RSS and RPS, and evaluated
   gender differences. Two sub-scales of perceived consequences were
   identified: structural/external consequences and social/internal
   consequences. In multiple linear regression, the perceived
   social/internal consequences of refusing to share were associated with
   both RSS and RPS, after controlling for other psychosocial constructs
   and demographic variables. Few statistically significant gender
   differences emerged. Assessing the consequences of refusing to share
   injection equipment may help explain persistent injection risk behavior,
   and may provide promising targets for comprehensive intervention efforts
   designed to address both individual and structural risk factors. (C)

   expectancies among college students (N=225). Participants were
   approached during popular drinking nights as they exited events at which
   alcohol was consumed or in front of their residence as they returned
   home. Participants completed a brief questionnaire that included art
   assessment of demographics, breath alcohol concentration (BrAC), and
   positive expectancies. Within 48 h of baseline assessment, participants
   received via email a follow-up survey that re-assessed positive
   expectancies while sober. Positive sexual expectancies were more
   strongly endorsed while drinking in the college social environment for
   both males and females, while males also reported heightened liquid
   courage expectancies. In addition, positive expectancies were more
   strongly endorsed at higher doses of alcohol for males but not females.
   These findings suggest that interventions which seek to prevent alcohol
   abuse by targeting alcohol expectancies may wish to challenge positive
   expectancies in naturalistic college social settings. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB Background: Socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic factors are known
   determinants of stroke and myocardial infarction (MI) risk. Clustering
   of these factors in neighborhoods needs to be taken into consideration
   during planning, prioritization and implementation of health programs
   intended to reduce disparities. Given the complex and multidimensional
   nature of these factors, multivariate methods are needed to identify
   neighborhood clusters of these determinants so as to better understand
   the unique neighborhood profiles. This information is critical for
   evidence-based health planning and service provision. Therefore, this
   study used a robust multivariate approach to classify neighborhoods and
   identify their socio-demographic characteristics so as to provide
   information for evidence-based neighborhood health planning for stroke
   and MI.
   Methods and Findings: The study was performed in East Tennessee
   Appalachia, an area with one of the highest stroke and MI risks in USA.
   Robust principal component analysis was performed on neighborhood
   (census tract) socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, obtained
   from the US Census, to reduce the dimensionality and influence of
   outliers in the data. Fuzzy cluster analysis was used to classify
   neighborhoods into Peer Neighborhoods (PNs) based on their socioeconomic
   and demographic characteristics. Nearest neighbor discriminant analysis
   and decision trees were used to validate PNs and determine the
   characteristics important for discrimination. Stroke and MI mortality
   risks were compared across PNs. Four distinct PNs were identified and
   their unique characteristics and potential health needs described. The
   highest risk of stroke and MI mortality tended to occur in less affluent
   PNs located in urban areas, while the suburban most affluent PNs had the
   lowest risk.
   Conclusions: Implementation of this multivariate strategy provides
   health planners useful information to better understand and effectively
   plan for the unique neighborhood health needs and is important in
   guiding resource allocation, service provision, and policy decisions to
   address neighborhood health disparities and improve population health.

AB In many human societies, high male social status associates with higher
   fertility, but the means by which status increases lifetime fitness have
   not been systematically investigated. We analyse the pathways by which
   male status begets reproductive success in a small-scale, Amerindian
   society. Men who are more likely to win a dyadic physical confrontation,
   i.e. dominant men, have higher intra-marital fertility for their age,
   and men with more community-wide influence, i.e. prestigious men,
   exhibit both higher intra-marital fertility and lower offspring
   mortality. Both forms of status elicit support from allies and deference
   from competitors, but high status men are not provisioned more than
   their peers. Prestigious but not dominant men marry wives who first give
   birth at earlier ages, which multivariate analysis suggests is the
   strongest pathway between status and fitness in this population.
   Furthermore, men are motivated to pursue status because of fitness gains
   both within and outside of marital unions: dominant and prestigious men
   have more in-pair surviving offspring as well as more extra-marital
   affairs.

AB Mathematical models are useful tools for understanding and predicting
   epidemics. A recent innovative modeling study by Stehle and colleagues
   addressed the issue of how complex models need to be to ensure accuracy.
   The authors collected data on face-to-face contacts during a two-day
   conference. They then constructed a series of dynamic social contact
   networks, each of which was used to model an epidemic generated by a
   fast-spreading airborne pathogen. Intriguingly, Stehle and colleagues
   found that increasing model complexity did not always increase accuracy.
   Specifically, the most detailed contact network and a simplified version
   of this network generated very similar results. These results are
   extremely interesting and require further exploration to determine their
   generalizability. Please see related article BMC Medicine, 2011, 9:87

AB Early vaccination against influenza viruses is a cost-effective solution
   to prevent contagion and reduce influenza-related morbidity and
   mortality. In the face of pandemic viruses, such as the A(H1N1),
   adequate rates of vaccine uptake play a critical role in containing the
   spread and effects of the disease. In order to understand the reasons
   underlying the relatively low 2009-2010 A(H1N1) vaccination rates, we
   conducted an online survey of 1569 respondents drawn from a nationally
   representative sample of United States (U.S.) adults age 18, and older.
   Because prior research suggests that vaccination rates are especially
   low among some U.S. population subgroups, we oversampled participants
   from minority ethnic/racial groups and those living under the Federal
   Poverty Level. Our results show that A(H1N1) vaccine uptake is
   associated with sociodemographic factors, A(H1N1)-related beliefs and
   seasonal vaccination. That is, A(H1N1) vaccination is strongly
   associated with age, urbanicity, perceiving the A(H1N1) vaccine as safe
   and seasonal flu vaccine uptake. Perceptions of safety and season flu
   vaccination show the strongest associations with A(H1N1) uptake. The
   reasons people gave to decline vaccination varied by respondents'
   sociodemographic group. For example, Black participants were the most
   likely ethnic/racial group to reported having tried to get the vaccine
   but found it unavailable. Together, these findings suggest some clear
   pointers towards strategic public health communication efforts calling
   for communication campaigns towards audiences segmented by social class,
   race/ethnicity and beliefs, often what advertisers call
   "psychodemographics". (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Sex differences in cardiovascular disease mortality are more pronounced
   among non-Hispanic whites than other racial/ethnic groups, but it is
   unknown whether this variation is present in the earlier subclinical
   stages of disease. The authors examined racial/ethnic variation in sex
   differences in coronary artery calcification (CAC) and carotid intimal
   media thickness at baseline in 2000-2002 among participants (n = 6,726)
   in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis using binomial and linear
   regression. Models adjusted for risk factors in several stages: age,
   traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, behavioral risk
   factors, psychosocial factors, and adult socioeconomic position. Women
   had a lower prevalence of any CAC and smaller amounts of CAC when
   present than men in all racial/ethnic groups. Sex differences in the
   prevalence of CAC were more pronounced in non-Hispanic whites than in
   African Americans and Chinese Americans after adjustment for traditional
   cardiovascular disease risk factors, and further adjustment for
   behavioral factors, psychosocial factors, and socioeconomic position did
   not modify these results (for race/sex, P(interaction) = 0.047). Similar
   patterns were observed for amount of CAC among adults with CAC.
   Racial/ethnic variation in sex differences for carotid intimal media
   thickness was less pronounced. In conclusion, coronary artery
   calcification is differentially patterned by sex across racial/ethnic
   groups.

AB BACKGROUND: This is the first study to use the linked National
   Longitudinal Mortality Study and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) data to determine the effects of individual-level
   socioeconomic factors (health insurance, education, income, and poverty
   status) on racial disparities in receiving treatment and in survival.
   METHODS: This study included 13,234 cases diagnosed with the 8 most
   common types of cancer (female breast, colorectal, prostate, lung and
   bronchus, uterine cervix, ovarian, melanoma, and urinary bladder) at age
   >= 25 years, identified from the National Longitudinal Mortality
   Study-SEER data during 1973 to 2003. Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox
   regression models were used for survival analysis. RESULTS: Three-year
   all-cause observed survival for cases diagnosed with local-stage cancers
   of the >= 8 leading tumors combined was >82% regardless of
   race/ethnicity. More favorable survival was associated with higher
   socioeconomic status. Compared with whites, blacks were less likely to
   receive first-course cancer-directed surgery, perhaps reflecting a less
   favorable stage distribution at diagnosis. Hazard ratio (HR) for
   cancer-specific mortality was significantly higher among blacks compared
   with whites (HR, 1.2; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.143) after
   adjusting for age, sex, and tumor stage, but not after further
   controlling for socioeconomic factors and treatment (HR, 1.0; 95% Cl,
   0.9-1.1). HRs for all-cause mortality among patients with breast cancer
   and for cancer-specific mortality in patients with prostate cancer were
   significantly higher for blacks compared with whites after adjusting for
   socioeconomic factors, treatment, and patient and tumor characteristics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Favorable survival was associated with higher socioeconomic
   status. Racial disparities in survival persisted after adjusting for
   individual-level socioeconomic factors and treatment for patients with
   breast and prostate cancer. Cancer 2011;117:3242-51.0 (C) 2011 American

AB BACKGROUND: Interactions with comorbidity burden and comorbidity-related
   care have not been examined as potential explanations for racial/ethnic
   disparities in advanced-stage breast cancer at diagnosis. METHODS: The
   authors used linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare
   data to determine whether comorbidity burden and comorbidity-related
   care are associated with stage at diagnosis, whether these associations
   are mediated by mammography use, and whether they explain racial/ethnic
   disparities. Stage at diagnosis and mammography use were analyzed in
   multivariate regression models, adjusting for comorbidity burden and
   comorbidity-race interactions among 118,742 women diagnosed with breast
   cancer during 1993 to 2005. RESULTS: Mammography utilization was higher
   among women with >= 3 stable comorbidities than among those without
   comorbidities. Advanced stage at diagnosis was associated with black
   race (odds ratio [OR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.6-1.8),
   Hispanic ethnicity (OR, 1.3; 95% Cl, 1.2-1.5), unstable comorbidity, and
   age >= 80 years. Mammography was protective in all racial/ethnic groups,
   but neither mammography use (OR, 0.3; 95% Cl, 0.3-0.3 and OR, 0.2; 95%
   Cl, 0.2-0.2 for women with 1 and >= 2 prior mammograms, respectively)
   nor overall physician service use (OR, 0.7; 95% Cl, 0.7-0.8 for women
   with >= 16 visits) explained the association between race/ethnicity and
   stage at diagnosis. The black/white OR fell to 1.2 (95% Cl, 0.9-1.5)
   among women with multiple stable comorbidities who received >= 2
   screening mammograms, and 1.0 (95% Cl, 0.8-1.3) among mammography users
   with unstable comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity burden was
   associated with regular mammography and earlier stage at diagnosis.
   Racial/ethnic disparities in late stage disease were reduced among women
   who received both regular mammograms and comorbidity-related care.

AB Cultures vary in the extent to which people prefer social hierarchical
   or egalitarian relations between individuals and groups. Here we
   examined the effect of cultural variation in preference for social
   hierarchy on the neural basis of intergroup empathy. Using
   cross-cultural neuroimaging, we measured neural responses while Korean
   and American participants observed scenes of racial ingroup and outgroup
   members in emotional pain. Compared to Caucasian-American participants,
   Korean participants reported experiencing greater empathy and elicited
   stronger activity in the left temporo-parietal junction (L-TPJ), a
   region previously associated with mental state inference, for ingroup
   compared to outgroup members. Furthermore, preferential reactivity
   within this region to the pain of ingroup relative to outgroup members
   was associated with greater preference for social hierarchy and ingroup
   biases in empathy. Together, these results suggest that cultural
   variation in preference for social hierarchy leads to cultural variation
   in ingroup-preferences in empathy, due to increased engagement of brain
   regions associated with representing and inferring the mental states of

AB Social sanctioning is widely considered a successful strategy to promote
   cooperation among humans. In situations in which individual and
   collective interests are at odds, incentives to free-ride induce
   individuals to refrain from contributing to public goods provision.
   Experimental evidence from public goods games shows that when endowed
   with sanctioning powers, conditional cooperators can discipline
   defectors, thus leading to greater levels of cooperation. However,
   extant evidence is based on peer punishment institutions, whereas in
   complex societies, systems of control are often centralized: for
   instance, we do not sanction our neighbors for driving too fast, the
   police do. Here we show the effect of centralized sanctioning and
   legitimate authority on cooperation. We designed an adaptation of the
   public goods game in which sanctioning power is given to a single
   monitor, and we experimentally manipulated the process by which the
   monitor is chosen. To increase the external validity of the study, we
   conducted lab-in-the-field experiments involving 1,543 Ugandan farmers
   from 50 producer cooperatives. This research provides evidence of the
   effectiveness of centralized sanctioning and demonstrates the causal
   effect of legitimacy on cooperation: participants are more responsive to
   the authority of an elected monitor than a randomly chosen monitor. Our
   essay contributes to the literature on the evolution of cooperation by
   introducing the idea of role differentiation. In complex societies,
   cooperative behavior is not only sustained by mechanisms of selection
   and reciprocity among peers, but also by the legitimacy that certain
   actors derive from their position in the social hierarchy.

AB Indigenous communities around the world face pressures from ecotourism
   practices and conservation. Otavalo, Ecuador, is an example of how local
   spiritual values can add to the conservation efforts of ecotourism. The
   Imbakucha watershed includes mountain landscapes with natural and
   cultural values of numerous indigenous communities where most residents
   associate their livelihood with iconic, sacred, natural features.
   Because this region has been conserved with a vibrant artisan economy,
   it is a well-known cultural landscape in Latin America, and therefore,
   the increased pressure of globalization affects its preservation as it
   undergoes a shift from traditional towards contemporary ecotourism
   practices. We investigate the relationship between the indigenous people
   and their intangible spiritual environment by local understanding of
   identity and cultural values, using ethnographic and qualitative
   research to analyze the influence of spirituality on environmental
   actions and intersections that reify the native sacred translated into
   Christianity, to define synchronisms of modernity and the ancestral
   influence on the Andean culture in the Kichwa Otavalo living in the
   valley. This study concludes that there is an outlook among indigenous
   leaders, politicians, researchers, and scholars that a stronger
   influence of environmental ideals and ecofriendly lifestyles should and
   can be instilled into the livelihood that exists in indigenous
   communities to favor sacred sites conservation with development. We
   recommend the implementation of a sacred site conservation category for
   the Imbakucha watershed to help with the conservation efforts of local
   indigenous ecotourism practices.

   programs increasingly target worksites. The aim was to evaluate the
   relationship between worksite social support and dietary behaviors,
   physical activity, and body mass index (BMI).
   Method: Baseline data were obtained on 2878 employees from 2005 to 2007
   from 34 worksites through Promoting Activity and Changes in Eating, a
   group-randomized weight reduction intervention in Greater Seattle.
   Worksite social support, diet, physical activity. and BMI were assessed
   via self-reported questionnaire. Principal component analysis was
   applied to workgroup questions. To adjust for design effects, random
   effects models were employed.
   Results: No associations were found with worksite social support and
   BMI, or with many obesogenic behaviors. However, individuals with higher
   worksite social support had 14.3% higher (95% Cl: 5.6%-23.7%) mean
   physical activity score and 4% higher (95% Cl: 1%-7%) mean fruit and
   vegetable intake compared to individuals with one-unit lower support.
   Conclusion: Our findings do not support a conclusive relationship
   between higher worksite social support and obesogenic behaviors, with
   the exception of physical activity and fruit and vegetable intake.
   Future studies are needed to confirm these relationships and evaluate
   how worksite social support impacts trial outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB A substantial number of studies have extended the work on universal
   properties in physical systems to complex networks in social,
   biological, and technological systems. In this paper, we present a
   complex networks perspective on interfirm organizational networks by
   mapping, analyzing and modeling the spatial structure of a large
   interfirm competition network across a variety of sectors and industries
   within the United States. We propose two micro-dynamic models that are
   able to reproduce empirically observed characteristics of competition
   networks as a natural outcome of a minimal set of general mechanisms
   governing the formation of competition networks. Both models, which
   utilize different approaches yet apply common principles to network
   formation give comparable results. There is an asymmetry between
   companies that are considered competitors, and companies that consider
   others as their competitors. All companies only consider a small number
   of other companies as competitors; however, there are a few companies
   that are considered as competitors by many others. Geographically, the
   density of corporate headquarters strongly correlates with local
   population density, and the probability two firms are competitors
   declines with geographic distance. We construct these properties by
   growing a corporate network with competitive links using random
   incorporations modulated by population density and geographic distance.
   Our new analysis, methodology and empirical results are relevant to
   various phenomena of social and market behavior, and have implications
   to research fields such as economic geography, economic sociology, and
   regional economic development. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB What are the underpinnings of workplace transformation in the developing

   Republic (DR) in the turbulent 1990s. I find that public officials
   responded to a series of external shocks by facilitating the transfer of
   modular methods to domestically owned factories in particular and
   conclude that organizational innovations are more likely to be
   co-produced by developing country firms and their governments in

AB Markets are mechanisms of social exchange, intended to facilitate
   trading. However, the question remains as to whether markets would help
   or hurt individuals with decision-makings deficits, as is frequently
   encountered in the case of cognitive aging. Essential for predicting
   future gains and losses in monetary and social domains, the striatal
   nuclei in the brain undergo structural, neurochemical, and functional
   decline with age. We correlated the efficacy of market mechanisms with
   dorsal striatal decline in an aging population, by using market based
   trading in the context of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Elections (primary
   cycle). Impaired decision-makers displayed higher prediction error
   (difference between their prediction and actual outcome). Lower in vivo
   caudate volume was also associated with higher prediction error.
   Importantly, market-based trading protected older adults with lower
   caudate volume to a greater extent from their own poorly calibrated
   predictions. Counterintuitive to the traditional public perception of
   the market as a fickle, risky proposition where vulnerable traders are
   most surely to be burned, we suggest that market-based mechanisms
   protect individuals with brain-based decision-making vulnerabilities.

AB Objectives: To build upon prior research on stress-related breathing
   pattern changes in asthma. Previous research has considered a limited
   set of respiratory parameters and has remained equivocal. Emotions and
   stress are known to change the respiratory pattern. In asthma, certain
   breathing patterns have adverse effects on the airways and lead to
   symptom exacerbation. Methods: We studied respiration during resting
   conditions and an acute psychosocial stressor (a free speech and mental
   arithmetic task) in participants with asthma (n = 20) and healthy
   controls (n = 19). The respiratory pattern was recorded with respiratory
   inductance plethysmography. Partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide
   (PCO(2)) was measured with capnometry before and after stress. Results:
   The overall minute ventilation was higher in asthma (mean [standard
   deviation] = 9.0 [4.0] L versus 6.8 [4.1] L, p < .05), but levels of the
   PCO(2) were comparable (34.6 [3.5] mm Hg versus 35.0 [3.7] mm Hg, p =
   .667) to healthy controls during prestress and poststress phases.
   Participants with asthma also showed a significant lengthening of
   inspiration, expiration, and the total respiratory cycle during stress
   compared with healthy controls (p < .05). During stress tasks, all
   participants showed marked increases in tidal volume, inspiratory flow,
   minute ventilation, tidal volume instability, ribcage contribution to
   tidal volume, and ribcage-abdominal asynchrony. A significant increase
   in tidal volume instability and a tendency toward lengthening of
   expiration and the total respiratory cycle were observed in
   quiet-sitting periods at prestress to poststress in asthma. Conclusions:
   Expiratory lengthening and variable tidal volumes are characteristic for
   individuals with asthma during psychosocial stress. The function and
   possible association of these changes with symptom exacerbations require
   further study.

AB By analysing rumour content as covered by major Chinese newspapers, this
   article explores the multiple dimensions of SARS-related rumouring
   throughout China during the 2003 epidemic. Findings indicate a strong
   correlation between the scale of SARS infections and level of rumour
   activities across regions. As for channels of dissemination, the rumour
   process still found a natural habitat in word of mouth, while
   internet-based platforms and cell phone text messaging emerged as viable
   grapevines. Our particular typology of SARS-incurred rumours leads us to
   identify four distinct types of rumours: legendary rumours; aetiological
   narratives; proto-memorates; and bogies. The four types of rumours are
   discussed against the background of superstitious beliefs, folklore
   practices, popular mentalities, and China's particular socio-political
   information environment.

AB Conflict minerals is a term applied to ores mined in conditions of armed
   conflict and human rights abuse. Niobium and tantalum are two rare
   metals whose primary natural occurrence is in the complex oxide minerals
   columbite and tantalite, the ore of which is commonly referred to as
   coltan. The illicit export of coltan ore from the Democratic Republic of
   the Congo is thought to be responsible for financing the ongoing civil
   conflicts in this region. Determining the chemical composition of an ore
   is one of the means of ascertaining its provenance. Laser-induced
   breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) offers a means of rapidly distinguishing
   different geographic sources for a mineral because the LIBS plasma
   emission spectrum provides the complete chemical composition (i.e.,
   "chemical fingerprint") of any material in real time. To test this idea
   for columbite-tantalite, three sample sets were analyzed. Partial least
   squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) allows correct sample-level
   geographic discrimination at a success rate exceeding 90%.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to identify participant characteristics
   associated with volunteering among older adults.
   Methods: Based on data from the 2008 Aging Texas Well (ATW) Indicators
   Survey, we examined the degree to which demographic factors, health
   status, spiritual participation, and community involvement are
   associated with volunteering among adults aged 60 years or older (n =
   525).
   Results: Rates of volunteering varied by race/ethnicity: non-Hispanic
   Whites (56.4%), African Americans (51.1%), and Hispanics (43.2%).
   Bivariate analyses showed that non-Hispanic White older adults were more
   likely to participate in formal volunteering activities, while their
   African American and Hispanic counterparts tended to participate in
   informal volunteering activities. Logistic regression analyses revealed
   that volunteering was less observed among Hispanics (OR=0.48, 95% CI
   0.29-0.78). Volunteering was more observed among those who reported
   providing informal care (OR = 1.93,95% CI 1.14-3.28), having very good
   or excellent mental health (OR=1.90 and 2.07, 95% CI 1.09-3.32 and
   1.20-3.55, respectively), having weekly or daily spiritual participation
   (OR=2.15 and 2.35, 95% CI 1.28-3.63 and 1.29-4.28, respectively),
   perceiving community involvement very important (OR=2.37, 95% CI
   1.55-3.62), and being very satisfied with the community interaction (OR
   = 1.81, 95% CI 1.15-2.85).
   Conclusions: Given the positive associations of mental health,
   spirituality, and social engagement with volunteering among older
   adults, system-level efforts to increase the sense of community among
   older adults and recognize their roles as volunteers will be helpful in
   recruiting and retaining older volunteers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland

AB High performance work organizations (HPWOs) and their consequences in
   the workplace have gained a notable status in sociology and psychology
   of the workplace during the last three decades in the US and in the
   other industrialized nations. One area in which the ongoing debates and
   evidence are inconclusive is the job rewards associated with HPWOs in
   the manufacturing and service economies. Analysing functional and
   numerical flexibilities (the 'internalization' and 'externalization'
   strategies) adopted in the manufacturing and service sectors, this study
   intends to extend our understanding of associations between workplace
   restructuring (HPWOs) and job rewards. The findings reveal that
   'internalized' or standard employees have gained from internalization
   strategy with no significant differences between the two economic
   sectors. However, significant differences are disclosed when the
   consequences of externalization are contrasted between the sectors. The
   externalization strategy has significantly undermined job rewards for
   non-standard workers, except for independent contractors, especially in
   the manufacturing sector. The article ends with a short discussion on
   the theoretical significance of the findings and their policy
   implications in human sources management.

   deficit in autism focusing on new approaches to characterizing social
   information processing problems, potential brain mechanisms, and
   theoretical models of the disorder. It will touch on aspects of specific
   social processes that appear to develop in unusual ways in autism
   including facial perception, joint attention, and social information
   processing. The importance of adopting more ecologically valid methods
   and for integrating the various approaches in deriving new models for
   social deficits in autism will be highlighted. Future research should

   were examined using 12-month longitudinal data among 143 participants
   with severe mental illness (SMI) in an inpatient psychiatric

AB Objective: Risk factors for adolescent alcohol use are typically
   conceptualized as individual and interpersonal level factors; however,
   these factors do not fully explain adolescent drinking behavior. We used
   a socioecological model to examine the contribution of neighborhood
   factors in a risk and promotive model of adolescent alcohol use among
   urban high school youth (N = 711; 52% female; 82% African American; M =
   18 years old). Method: Using a multilevel model, we considered the role
   of neighborhood disadvantage on youth alcohol use, after accounting for
   risk (e.g., peer and parental substance use) and promotive factors
   (e.g., social support and participation in prosocial activities).
   Results: Peer alcohol use and peer support were associated with more
   alcohol use, and maternal support was negatively associated with alcohol
   use. Despite significant variation at the neighborhood level,
   neighborhood disadvantage was not directly associated with adolescent
   drinking. Conclusions: Our study contributes to a mixed body of
   literature on social context and adolescent health. Although our
   research highlights the importance of interpersonal relationships, we
   found no support for neighborhood influences. We conclude with future
   directions for research examining the link between adolescent drinking
   and neighborhood contexts. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 651-659, 2011)

AB OBJECTIVE: To evaluate trends in adherence to American Academy of
   Pediatrics recommendations for early discharge of late-preterm newborns
   and to test the association between hospital characteristics and early
   discharge.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was a population-based cohort study
   using statewide birth-certificate and hospital-discharge data for
   newborns in California, Missouri, and Pennsylvania from 1993 to 2005. A
   total of 282 601 late-preterm newborns at 611 hospitals were included.
   Using logistic regression, we studied the association of early discharge
   with regional and hospital factors, including teaching affiliation,
   volume, and urban versus rural location, adjusting for patient factors.
   RESULTS: From 1995 to 2000, early discharge decreased from 71% of the
   sample to 40%. However, by 2005, 39% were still discharged early.
   Compared with Pennsylvania, California (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 5.95
   [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.03-7.04]), and Missouri (aOR: 1.56 [95%
   CI: 1.26-1.93]) were associated with increased early discharge.
   Nonteaching hospitals were more likely than teaching hospitals to
   discharge patients early if they were uninsured (aOR: 1.91 [95% CI:
   1.35-2.69]) or in a health maintenance organization plan (aOR: 1.40 [95%
   CI: 1.06-1.84]) but not patients with fee-for-service insurance (aOR:
   1.04 [95% CI: 0.80-1.34]). A similar trend for newborns on Medicaid was
   not statistically significant (aOR: 1.77 [95% CI: 0.95-3.30]).
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite a decline in the late 1990s, early discharge of
   late-preterm newborns remains common. We observe differences according
   to state, hospital teaching affiliation, and patient insurance.
   Additional research on the safety and appropriateness of early discharge
   for this population is necessary. Pediatrics 2011; 128: 62-71

AB OBJECTIVE: Early weight change is associated with overall weight loss
   treatment response in adults but has been relatively unexplored in
   youth. We investigated the importance of early weight change in a
   pediatric weight control trial.
   METHODS: Overweight children aged 7 to 12 years (n = 204) participated
   in a randomized controlled trial of 2 weight maintenance treatments
   (MTs) after a 20-week family-based behavioral weight loss treatment
   (FBT). Hierarchical regression was used to investigate the relation
   between children's percentage weight change at sessions 4, 6, and 8 of
   FBT and BMI z-score reductions after FBT and at the 2-year follow-up.
   Correlations and hierarchical regression were used to identify child and
   parent factors associated with children's early weight change.
   RESULTS: Children's percentage weight change by FBT session 8 was the
   best predictor of BMI z-score reductions after FBT and at 2-year
   follow-up. Percentage weight change in children at the session 8 was
   associated with better FBT attendance and with greater percentage weight
   change in parents at FBT session 8.
   CONCLUSIONS: Early weight change seems to be related to treatment
   response through the end of treatment and 2-year follow-up. Future
   research should include investigation of strategies to promote early
   weight change in children and parents and identification of mechanisms
   through which early weight change is related to overall treatment
   response. Pediatrics 2011;128:e33-e39

   in the family was studied at ages 10-12, 16, 19 and 22 years.
   Measurements The transmissible liability index (TLI), along with
   measures of quality of the parent-child relationship, cooperative
   behavior at home, social attitudes and peer milieu were administered to
   model the developmental pathway to cannabis use disorder. Findings
   Affiliation with socially deviant peers and harboring non-normative
   attitudes (age 16) mediate the association between transmissible risk
   for substance use disorder (SUD) (age 10-12) and use of illegal drugs
   (age 19), leading to cannabis use disorder (age 22). Conclusions Deviant
   socialization resulting from transmissible risk and poor parent-child
   relationship is integral to development of cannabis use disorder in
   young adulthood.

AB Background: Quitlines and other evidence-based cessation treatments are
   greatly underutilized by smokers, limiting their public health impact.
   Social support is correlated with successful cessation. Thus, efforts
   targeting the social network of smokers could be a potential avenue to
   promote quitline utilization.
   Purpose: This study examined the efficacy of an intervention for
   nonsmokers interested in helping a smoker (i.e., support people) to
   promote smoker utilization of the Minnesota QUITPLAN (R) Helpline. Data
   were collected from 2007 to 2010, and analyses were conducted from 2010
   to 2011.
   Design: Two-group randomized design evaluating the support-person
   intervention (n=267) compared with a control condition (written
   materials, n=267).
   Setting/participants: Enrolled were 534 support people (91% female, 93%
   Caucasian) residing in Minnesota.
   Intervention: Written materials plus three weekly telephone sessions
   lasting 10-30 minutes each. Based on Cohen's theory of social support,
   the intervention provided participants with information and skills
   needed to encourage their smoker to call the QUITPLAN Helpline.
   Main outcome measures: Participants completed the Support Provided
   Measure (SPM) by mail at baseline and Week 4 (end-of-treatment).
   Helpline intake staff documented smoker calls to the Helpline through 6
   months of follow-up.
   Results: The proportion of calls to the Helpline was significantly
   (p=0.012) greater for smokers linked to support people in the
   intervention group (16.1%, 43/267) than in the control group (8.6%,
   23/267). The treatment effect remained significant after adjusting for
   support person residing with the smoker (OR=2.04, 95% CI=1.19, 3.49,
   p=0.010). Among support people randomly assigned to the intervention
   group, greater number of sessions completed was associated with
   increased smokers' calls to the Helpline (p=0.004). After adjusting for
   the baseline score, the M +/- SD SPM score at Week 4 was significantly
   higher for support people in the intervention group (16.4 +/- 3.3) than
   for those in the control group (15.3 +/- 3.6), p=0.002.
   Conclusions: A support-person intervention is effective in increasing
   smoker utilization of the QUITPLAN Helpline. There is potential for
   increasing the reach of quitlines by targeting the social network of
   smokers.

AB Background: Measures of neighborhood deprivation used in health research
   are typically based on conventional area-based SES.
   Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine new data and measures of
   SES for use in health research. Specifically, assessed property values
   are introduced as a new individual-level metric of wealth and tested for
   their ability to substitute for conventional area-based SES as measures
   of neighborhood deprivation.
   Methods: The analysis was conducted in 2010 using data from 1922
   participants in the 2008-2009 survey of the Seattle Obesity Study (SOS).
   It compared the relative strength of the association between the
   individual-level neighborhood wealth metric (assessed property values)
   and area-level SES measures (including education, income, and percentage
   above poverty as single variables, and as the composite Singh index) on
   the binary outcome fair/poor general health status. Analyses were
   adjusted for gender, categoric age, race, employment status, home
   ownership, and household income.
   Results: The neighborhood wealth measure was more predictive of
   fair/poor health status than area-level SES measures, calculated either
   as single variables or as indices (lower DIC measures for all models).
   The odds of having a fair/poor health status decreased by 0.85 (95%
   CI=0.77, 0.93) per $50,000 increase in neighborhood property values
   after adjusting for individual-level SES measures.
   Conclusions: The proposed individual-level metric of neighborhood
   wealth, if replicated in other areas, could replace area-based SES
   measures, thus simplifying analyses of contextual effects on health. (Am

AB Based on anecdotal and qualitative reports, a general assumption is that
   caregiving negatively impacts grandparents in Africa.
   Objectives: The purpose of this article is to determine how caregiving
   and gender impact nutritional status over four waves of data from Luo
   elders.
   Methods: Luo elders, aged 60 and over (age 73.6 +/- 7.9) were sampled.
   Participant recruitment was rolling and included 287 Luo grandparents in
   2005, 396 in 2006, 389 in 2007, and 390 in 2009. A total of 689 elders
   participated in at least 1 year. Standard anthropometric measures were
   used to determine nutritional status. Impact of caregiving was examined
   using structural equation models.
   Results: Caregiving positively associated with nutritional status among
   women. This main effect was mediated by caregiving intensity, which also
   positively associated with nutritional status. Among men, caregiving
   negatively associated with nutritional status, although caregiving
   intensity did not significantly associate with most anthropometric
   measures. Socioeconomic status (SES) positively associated with five of
   nine anthropometric measures in women and all measures in men. Several
   measures indicated that both men and women became larger over time but
   few of the variables tested predicted growth.
   Conclusions: The beneficial impact on grandmothers might indicate a
   coping strategy. These results indicated that researchers should shift
   away from comparing caregivers to noncaregivers and instead look at the
   multiple factors which may make some families resilient and others at
   risk. Human biologists can contribute to this literature by examining
   the ecological and cultural contexts under which caregiving represents a
   burden with physiological repercussions. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 23:498-508,

AB Background Several studies have documented poor housing conditions for
   farmworkers but none has focused on migrant farmworker housing, which is
   often provided as a condition of employment. Farmworker housing quality
   is regulated, but little documentation exists of compliance with
   regulations.
   Methods A 2007 survey of 43 randomly selected farmworker camps and a
   2008 survey of 27 camps randomly selected from the 2007 sample
   documented housing conditions via interviewer administered questionnaire
   and housing checklist.
   Results Substandard conditions are common in migrant housing. All camps
   had at least one exterior housing problem; 93% had at least one interior
   problem. Housing conditions worsen across the agricultural season.
   Characteristics including no residents with H2A visa and 11 or more
   residents are associated with poorer conditions.
   Conclusions Housing standards are not adequately enforced. An increase
   in post-occupancy inspections and targeting camps with characteristics
   that place them at increased risk for substandard conditions are
   recommended. Am. J. Ind. Med. 54:533-544, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss,

AB Background: Native Hawaiians have high rates of obesity and
   obesity-related diseases compared with non-Hawaiians in Hawaii, and the
   relation between this ethnic disparity in adiposity and socioeconomic
   status (SES) in children is unclear.
   Aim: The present study compared measures of adiposity in two cohorts of
   school children residing in the Hilo area of Hawaii and related these
   measures to parental reports of ethnicity, household income and parent
   educational attainment.
   Subjects and methods: All children in either Kindergarten (mean age 5.6
   years) or third grade (mean age 8.7 years) in eight elementary schools
   in the Hilo area were invited to participate. A total of 125 children
   had anthropometric, bioelectric impedance and air displacement
   plethysmography measurements taken and their parents answered questions
   about household income, parental educational attainment and genealogical
   background that included ethnicity of ancestors.
   Results: Boys and girls in both cohorts had stature approximately at the
   50(th) percentile (Z-score = 0) of national samples (CDC data). Z-scores
   of BMI were elevated compared to the CDC reference curves, but were
   significantly higher in male Native Hawaiian children in the older
   cohort among whom nearly 50% had a BMI above the 95(th) percentile for
   age. In the younger cohort, there was no significant ethnic difference
   in adiposity measures. In the older cohort, Native Hawaiian boys had
   significantly higher adiposity measures than their classmates. Adiposity
   in third grade girls was significantly and inversely related to their
   father's educational attainment. Percentage of Hawaiian ancestry was not
   significantly related to adiposity measures.
   Conclusions: Ethnic disparity in adiposity among Native Hawaiians
   compared with non-Hawaiian age mates occurs after the age of 6 years,
   and is confined to males in this sample. For older girls, father's, but
   not mother's, educational attainment was inversely related to adiposity.

AB Background: This study investigates evidence of the nutrition transition
   among women in Miskito communities on the northeastern coast of
   Honduras.
   Aim: The hypothesis that socioeconomic status (SES) is positively
   associated with body size and fatness is tested; and dietary and
   physical activity patterns are examined among SES groups.
   Subjects and methods: An anthropometric survey was conducted with 200
   non-pregnant women following standard procedures. Dietary intake and
   physical activity data were collected using 24-hour recall methods.
   Women were categorized into three SES groups (high, medium and low)
   based on economic and social attributes. Differences in anthropometric
   measures, diet and physical activity among SES groups were analysed.
   Results: More than 70% (n = 142) of women in the sample were overweight
   or obese. Mean height, weight, skin-fold thicknesses, arm and calf
   circumferences, percentage body fat and upper-arm fat area were
   significantly greater among high SES women than low SES women. Women
   with high SES had lower rates of physical activity and higher rates of
   obesity, perceived food sufficiency, meat consumption, milk/dairy intake
   and general dietary diversity.
   Conclusion: High SES women were significantly fatter than low SES women;
   and variation observed among groups is likely related to different
   patterns of dietary intake and physical activity.

AB Ethnic and racial minority women within the U.S. are less likely to use
   breast cancer screening (BCS) procedures than non-Latina White women,
   and are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer at later stages of
   disease. Previous studies examining Latina rates of screening and
   disease have used aggregated populations for comparison, possibly
   attenuating important ethnic healthcare disparities and yielding
   misleading findings. The purpose of this study was to examine if
   ethnicity matters in understanding current estimates of BCS patterns
   among U.S. women; to test if healthcare disparities in BCS are present,
   and if any ethnic/racial groups are primarily affected. The authors used
   multivariate multinomial regression to examine self-reported mammogram
   and clinical breast exam in the 2007 full-year U.S. Medical Expenditure
   Panel Survey. Mexican origin women reported the lowest rates of
   past-year mammograms and clinical breast examination. Factors enabling
   healthcare moderated the group's lower likelihood of mammograms and
   clinical breast examination. Some breast cancer screening parity appears
   to have been achieved in 2007 for Black and some Latina groups; however,
   those rates lag behind for the largest Latino ethnic group, Mexican.
   Factors enabling healthcare access, such as education, income and
   insurance, attenuated the BCS inequalities found for Mexican origin
   women. Findings suggest that successful efforts to reduce BCS
   disparities be strategically redirected to include women of Mexican
   origin in addition to other underserved populations.

AB BACKGROUND: Social networks may influence screening behaviors. We
   assessed whether screening for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer is
   influenced by the actual screening behaviors of siblings, friends,
   spouses, and coworkers. METHODS: We conducted an observational study
   using Framingham Heart Study data to assess screening for eligible
   individuals during the late 1990s. We used logistic regression to
   determine whether the probability of screening for breast, prostate, or
   colorectal cancer was influenced by the proportion of siblings, friends,
   and coworkers who had the same screening, as well as spouse's screening
   for colorectal cancer, adjusting for other factors that might influence
   screening rates. RESULTS: Among 1660 women aged 41-70 years, 71.7%
   reported mammography in the previous year; among 1217 men aged 51-70
   years, 43.3% reported prostate-specific antigen testing in the previous
   year; and among 1426 men and women aged 51-80 years, 46.9% reported
   stool blood testing and/or sigmoidoscopy in the previous year. An
   increasing proportion of sisters who had mammography in the previous
   year was associated with mammography screening in the ego (odds ratio
   [OR], 1.034; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.000-1.065 for each 10%
   increase). A spouse with recent screening was associated with more
   colorectal cancer screening (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.39-1.98 vs unmarried).
   Otherwise, screening behaviors of siblings, friends, and coworkers were
   not associated with screening in the ego. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from a
   slight increase in breast cancer screening among women whose sisters
   were screened and colorectal cancer screening if spouses were screened,
   the screening behavior of siblings, friends, or coworkers did not
   influence cancer screening behaviors. Cancer 2011;117:3045-52. (c) 2011

AB Despite significant social difficulties, children with autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD) are vulnerable to the effects of social exclusion. We
   recorded EEG while children with ASD and typical peers played a
   computerized game involving peer rejection. Children with ASD reported
   ostracism-related distress comparable to typically developing children.
   Event-related potentials (ERPs) indicated a distinct pattern of temporal
   processing of rejection events in children with ASD. While typically
   developing children showed enhanced response to rejection at a late slow
   wave indexing emotional arousal and regulation, those with autism showed
   attenuation at an early component, suggesting reduced engagement of
   attentional resources in the aversive social context. Results emphasize
   the importance of studying the time course of social information
   processing in ASD; they suggest distinct mechanisms subserving similar
   overt behavior and yield insights relevant to development and
   implementation of targeted treatment approaches and objective measures
   of response to treatment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study aimed to explore the neural correlates of two
   characteristic deficits in Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs): social
   impairment and restricted, repetitive behavior patterns. To this end, we
   used comparable experiences of social exclusion and rule violation to
   probe potentially atypical neural networks in ASD. In children and
   adolescents with and without ASD, we used the interactive ball-toss game
   (Cyberball) to elicit social exclusion and a comparable game
   (Cybershape) to elicit a non-exclusive rule violation. Using functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified group differences in
   brain responses to social exclusion and rule violation. Though both
   groups reported equal distress following exclusion, the right insula and
   ventral anterior cingulate cortex were hypoactive during exclusion in
   children with ASD. In rule violation, right insula and dorsal prefrontal
   cortex were hyperactive in ASD. Right insula showed a dissociation in
   activation; it was hypoactive to social exclusion and hyperactive to
   rule violation in the ASD group. Further probed, different regions of
   right insula were modulated in each game, highlighting differences in
   regional specificity for which subsequent analyses revealed differences
   in patterns of functional connectivity. These results demonstrate
   neurobiological differences in processing social exclusion and rule
   violation in children with ASD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Children's respiratory health has been linked to many
   factors, including air pollution. The impacts of urban land-use on
   health are not fully understood, although these relationships are of key
   importance given the growing populations living in urban environments.
   Objectives: We investigated whether the degree of urban land-use near a
   family's residence is associated with severity of respiratory symptoms
   like wheeze among infants.
   Methods: Wheeze occurrence was recorded for the first year of life for
   680 infants in Connecticut for 1996-1998 from a cohort at risk for
   asthma development. Land-use categories were obtained from the National
   Land Cover Database. The fraction of urban land-use near each subject's
   home was related to severity of wheeze symptoms using ordered logistic
   regression, adjusting for individual-level data including smoking in the
   household, race, gender, and socio-economic status. Nitrogen dioxide
   (NO(2)) exposure was estimated using integrated traffic exposure
   modeling. Different levels of urban land-use intensity were included in
   separate models to explore intensity-response relationships. A buffer
   distance was selected based on the log-likelihood value of models with
   buffers of 100-2000 m by 10 m increments.
   Results: A 10% increase in urban land-use within the selected 1540 m
   buffer of each infant's residence was associated with 1.09-fold
   increased risk of wheeze severity (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.16).
   Results were robust to alternate buffer sizes. When NO(2), representing
   traffic pollution, was added to the model, results for urban land-use
   were no longer statistically significant, but had similar central
   estimates. Higher urban intensity showed higher risk of prevalence and
   severity of wheeze symptoms.
   Conclusions: Urban land-use was associated with severity of wheeze
   symptoms in infants. Findings indicate that health effect estimates for
   urbanicity incorporate some effects of traffic-related emissions, but
   also involve other factors. These may include differences in housing
   characteristics or baseline healthcare status. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This paper investigates the role of specialized production strategies in
   the development of socioeconomic inequalities in Bronze Age
   south-eastern (SE) Arabia, and particularly, the ways in which a
   localized, internal exchange economy may have produced stress and
   instability in the SE Arabian socio-economic system. While
   archaeological research has established that the communities of SE
   Arabia participated in a widespread Bronze Age exchange system that
   included areas of the ancient Near East, South Asia, and Central Asia,
   it is unclear to what degree this interaction fostered the broad-scale
   socioeconomic changes seen in the Early Bronze Age of SE Arabia. Here we
   present the results of an agent-based model that suggest the nature of
   the internal exchange economy in SE Arabia itself may have precipitated
   the social conditions necessary for change by allowing individuals to
   profit disproportionately. We thus emphasize the importance of local
   production strategies in generating socioeconomic change, in addition to
   the well-established economic and cultural contacts with the wider
   Bronze Age world. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This study investigates how various social, demographic and economic
   factors affect spousal agreement on preferred waiting time to next
   birth. Data for matched cohabiting couples from ten Demographic and
   Health Surveys in sub-Saharan Africa (Benin, Burkina Faso, Ghana,
   Guinea, Mali, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe),
   conducted between 2003 and 2006, were analysed to compare reported
   waiting time to next birth by the husband and the wife. Couples where
   the reported waiting time to next birth was the same for both partners
   (difference is 0 months) were defined as having agreement on waiting
   time to next birth. In sub-Saharan Africa, spousal agreement on waiting
   time to next birth was found to be associated with wanting the next
   child sooner. When the spouses disagree on waiting time to next birth,
   the wives want to wait longer than their husbands in most cases.
   Additionally, the study found that demographic factors are the primary
   determinants of spousal agreement on waiting time to next birth, not
   socioeconomic factors. The strongest predictors of spousal agreement on
   waiting time to next birth were number of living children, difference
   between the number of ideal and living children and wife's age. Couples
   with fewer children, a younger wife and those with a difference of five
   or more children between ideal and living number of children were more
   likely to agree on waiting time to next birth. Effects of socioeconomic
   factors, such as education and wealth status, on spousal agreement on
   waiting time to next birth were generally weak and inconsistent. The
   findings highlight some of the challenges in developing programmes to
   promote spousal communication and birth spacing and underscore the need
   for programmes to be gender-sensitive.

   determine association of factors related to hepatitis B virus (HBV)
   screening among Asian Americans.
   Methods: A cross-sectional design of 1312 Asian men and women 18 years
   and older. The frequency distribution analysis and chi square analysis
   were used for the initial screening of the following variables:
   access/satisfaction with health care, enabling, predisposing, cultural,
   and health belief factors. Univariate and multivariate analyses were
   conducted on factors for HBV screening using logistic regression
   analysis.
   Results: Correlates to HBV screening included demographics, cultural
   factors, enabling factors, and family/social support factors. Enabling
   factors were more likely to be associated with HBV screening.
   Conclusion: The model highlights the role sociocultural factors play in
   HBV screening. Findings reinforce the need for HBV screening programs
   and indicate programs could be more effective if they included these
   components and were sensitive to ethnic and cultural factors.

AB Budget exercises are frequently used in introductory and social problems
   courses to facilitate student understanding of income inequality. But do
   these exercises actually lead to greater sociological understanding? To
   explore this issue, the authors studied undergraduate students enrolled
   in introductory sociology courses during the 2008-2009 academic year.
   Using a unique pretest-pretest-posttest design, the authors captured
   student perceptions of issues of socioeconomic inequality at the
   beginning of the course, after completion of a traditional unit on
   stratification, and after participation in a budget exercise. The unique
   study design allows the authors to examine if and how students make
   gains in understanding inequality sociologically. They also consider
   other learning objectives, including fostering an appreciation of
   obstacles to social mobility and increasing general knowledge about
   inequality. The results suggest that both budget exercises and a
   traditional pedagogical unit of lecture, reading, and discussion play
   limited roles in fostering at least short-term sociological
   understanding as related to these goals.

   Missouri Community Action Poverty Simulation (CAPS) program. CAPS is
   designed to simulate common, everyday experiences among people living in
   poverty as participants take on the roles of family members working to
   make ends meet. The creators of CAPS emphasize that "CAPS is not a game"
   but "a unique tool that community action agencies are able to use to
   educate everyone, from policy makers to community leaders, about the day
   to day realities of life with a shortage of money and an abundance of
   stress." The authors facilitated the CAPS program with two large groups
   of undergraduate students enrolled in sociology, gerontology, and
   psychology courses at a medium-sized private college in south-central
   Pennsylvania. The analysis examines the experiential learning outcomes
   of the students as they reflect on their participation in the
   simulation. Following participation in CAPS, the students demonstrated
   an increased awareness of the material conditions of everyday life among
   families living in poverty.

AB When students enter college classrooms for the first time they
   inevitably have preconceived images of professors. According to research
   on student evaluations of teaching, these preconceptions have important
   implications in college classrooms. This study explores one avenue
   through which these preconceptions are perpetuated-popular film. Using
   content analysis, the authors examine popular films released between
   1985 and 2005 that contain professors in either primary or secondary
   roles. The findings show stereotypical depictions beyond glasses, bow
   ties, and tweed jackets. Specifically, the authors find stereotypical
   images of race and gender as well as an emphasis on the importance of
   research, sometimes at the expense of teaching or ethical behavior. This
   research provides instructors with knowledge of the stereotypes that
   students may have upon entering the college classroom, which may impact
   classroom interactions, and provides insight into how race and gender
   affect student evaluations of professors.

AB Rightwing theorists argue that we owe the current financial crisis to
   the democratization of credit, or financial inclusion: politics
   interfered with the market to benefit marginalized actors, only to cause
   instability and risk. Leftwing theorists focus instead on
   financialization: namely, the shift of profit-making activities from
   industry to finance. These views implicitly draw on Schumpeter and Marx.
   Much like their intellectual progenitors, they emphasize exogenous
   processes to explain financial change. Here I claim that the connection
   between financial innovation and financial inclusion is endogenous. I
   suggest two main typologies of financial innovators: Market Utopians
   (MUs) and Populist Innovators (PIs). Financial inclusion, I submit, is
   the byproduct of the quest for power of the latter.

AB Many theories of social construction make some reference to sight, yet
   few offer sustained examinations of perception. In light of this, I
   highlight the visual dimension of the social construction of reality by
   analyzing visual perception as a process of 'socio-mental filtration'.
   Building on theories of social construction - most notably those using
   the concepts 'frame', 'paradigm' and 'schema' in which expectations are
   the organizing force of experience, I focus on how social construction
   happens. One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention,
   which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on
   the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to
   identify the specific dynamics of 'socio-optical construction' - adding
   a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social
   construction - may help scholars to more effectively account for some of
   the 'hard problems' of constructionist theory, such as the body.

AB A growing body of evidence shows that humans are remarkably altruistic
   primates. Food sharing and division of labor play an important role in
   all human societies, and cooperation extends beyond the bounds of close
   kinship and networks of reciprocating partners. In humans, altruism is
   motivated at least in part by empathy and concern for the welfare of
   others. Although altruistic behavior is well-documented in other
   primates, the range of altruistic behaviors in other primate species,
   including the great apes, is much more limited than it is in humans.
   Moreover, when altruism does occur among other primates, it is typically
   limited to familiar group members-close kin, mates, and reciprocating
   partners. This suggests that there may be fundamental differences in the
   social preferences that motivate altruism across the primate order, and
   there is currently considerable interest in how we came to be such
   unusual apes. A body of experimental studies designed to examine the
   phylogenetic range of prosocial sentiments and behavior is beginning to
   shed some light on this issue. In experimental settings, chimpanzees and
   tamarins do not consistently take advantage of opportunities to deliver
   food rewards to others, although capuchins and marmosets do deliver food
   rewards to others in similar kinds of tasks. Although chimpanzees do not
   satisfy experimental criteria for prosociality in food delivery tasks,
   they help others complete tasks to obtain a goal. Differences in
   performance across species and differences in performance across tasks
   are not yet fully understood and raise new questions for further study.

AB In the last 60,000 y humans have expanded across the globe and now
   occupy a wider range than any other terrestrial species. Our ability to
   successfully adapt to such a diverse range of habitats is often
   explained in terms of our cognitive ability. Humans have relatively
   bigger brains and more computing power than other animals, and this
   allows us to figure out how to live in a wide range of environments.
   Here we argue that humans may be smarter than other creatures, but none
   of us is nearly smart enough to acquire all of the information necessary
   to survive in any single habitat. In even the simplest foraging
   societies, people depend on a vast array of tools, detailed bodies of
   local knowledge, and complex social arrangements and often do not
   understand why these tools, beliefs, and behaviors are adaptive. We owe
   our success to our uniquely developed ability to learn from others. This
   capacity enables humans to gradually accumulate information across
   generations and develop well-adapted tools, beliefs, and practices that
   are too complex for any single individual to invent during their
   lifetime.

AB Stress in the social environment can affect individual health. Election
   of the first Black President of the United States provides an
   opportunity to assess how a positive change in the macro-political
   climate impacts the health of Americans. Past research suggests that
   race-related political events influence the health of non-dominant
   racial groups. Yet many questions remain, including the types of events
   that affect health, the timing and durability of health effects, and
   whether effects are similar for Blacks and Hispanics in the United
   States. The present study uses data from the Ohio Family Health Survey,
   which was in the field from August 6, 2008 until January 24, 2009, to
   assess whether immediate changes in average self-rated health occurred
   after key events in the election of President Barack Obama. We find
   better average health ratings among Blacks and Hispanics immediately
   following Obama's nomination by the Democratic Party. Similar effects
   did not occur after the election or inauguration, and Whites showed no
   effect of any of the events. We discuss the implications of these
   findings in terms of the theoretical links between macro-level social
   conditions, race/ethnicity, and health. (Ethn Dis. 2011; 21 (3):349-355)

   Design: A case-control study was performed among African American women
   delivering infants at two tertiary care hospitals in Chicago, IL between
   July 2001-June 2005. A structured questionnaire was administered to
   measure maternal perceived exposure to interpersonal racial
   discrimination in public settings and coping behaviors.
   Results: A greater percentage of African American mothers of preterm
   infants had high lifetime and past year exposure to racism in public
   settings than their peers who deliver term infants; odds ratios (OR) and
   95% confidence intervals (95% CI) equaled 1.5 (0.9-2.8) for lifetime and
   2.5 (1.2-5.2) for past year exposure. Active coping, especially "working
   harder to prove them wrong" led to attenuated ORs (interaction P
   value<.05 for lifetime and <.10 for past year.
   Conclusions: African American women's exposure to racism in public
   settings is a risk factor for preterm birth; active coping behaviors
   weaken this relationship. Ethn Dis. 2011; 21(3): 370-376.

PD SUM 2011
PY 2011
AB Within environmental sociology there exists a debate between competing
   theories of societal development and its accompanying ecological
   repercussions and possible solutions. Environmental reform (ecological
   modernization) and unsustainable economic system (treadmill of
   production, ecological unequal exchange, and structural human ecology)
   theories propose two very different paths for the direction of society
   in addressing the multiple ecological crises of the 21(st) century. Both
   approaches provide theoretical and practical strides in addressing these
   questions within environmental sociology; however, both also fail to
   address important foci for the future. For us to continue to thrive as a
   species we must reconsider our relationship with nature and abandon our
   anthropocentric views of nature by taking a position that recognizes our
   role in a complex system. Ultimately, mechanisms for building resilience
   and adaptation and reducing vulnerability rely upon a paradigm shift, an
   understanding of "true" and "false" sustainability, and adaptation and
   resilience strategies that afford us an opportunity to recast
   social-ecological relationships towards "true" sustainability.

PY 2011
AB If it can be argued that no single attribute or condition (leprosy
   included) is inherently or universally considered to be 'deeply
   discrediting,' to quote Goffman, then we must consider how external
   factors shape stigma associated with that condition in different
   cultural and socioeconomic contexts. Often, an analysis of what is
   perceived to be stigma towards people affected by leprosy uncovers other
   prejudices or stigmatising attitudes associated with class, gender,
   and/or ethnic inequalities in that society. The movement of people
   across international borders adds new dimensions to the experience of
   leprosy, as affected individuals confront different sets of
   understandings of the disease among healthcare professionals, friends,
   family, and employers in host and sending countries. Preconceptions of
   the immigrant 'other' in host countries may be bound up with notions of
   disease and danger, further complicating the experience of leprosy
   treatment for immigrants. Drawing on the work of others and on early
   stage qualitative research on leprosy among Brazilian immigrants to the
   United States, this paper will consider the ways in which immigration
   and transnational processes could affect the experience of stigma among
   immigrants affected by leprosy.

AB C. P. Snow's famous Two Cultures essay has become a foil for decades of
   discussions over the relation between science and the humanities. The
   problem of the "two cultures" is often framed in terms of how the
   particular epistemological claims or general intellectual orientations
   of particular individuals on either side of this purported divide
   obstruct interdisciplinary dialogue or cooperation. This formulation,
   however, fails to consider the institutional frameworks within which
   such debates occur. This article examines the broader structural
   constraints that provide incentives, erect barriers, or otherwise shape
   the potential for interdisciplinary research and practice, with
   particular attention to work involving the life sciences. It argues that
   in order to understand the nature and scope of the problems facing
   interdisciplinary work, we must focus on the institutional constraints
   that shape how individuals frame questions, pursue investigations,
   develop careers, and collaborate.

AB Socioeconomic position (SEP) across life is found to be related to adult
   physical performance, but the underlying pathways are not well

   of SEP from childhood into midlife with objective physical performance
   measures in midlife were examined, adjusting for possible confounders or
   mediators, including indicators of muscle development and central
   nervous system function. Childhood and adulthood SEP were positively
   related to standing balance and chair rise performance, but not to grip
   strength after basic adjustments. When both father's occupation and
   mother's education were included in the same model, having a mother with
   low education was associated with 0.6 standard deviations (SD) (95%
   confidence interval (CI: 0.3, 0.8)) poorer standing balance time
   compared with having a mother with the highest educational level, and
   having a father in the lowest occupational group was associated with a
   0.3 SD (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) lower chair rise score compared with having a
   father in the highest occupational group. These associations were
   maintained, albeit attenuated, after adjustment. In contrast, the
   associations of own education and adult occupation with physical
   performance were generally not maintained after adjustment. SEP across
   life impacts on midlife physical performance, and thereby the ageing
   process.

   anxiety-provoking situations was developed from a review of existing
   measures of social anxiety. In addition to items derived from existing
   measures, the investigators generated items thought to be particularly
   relevant for older adults. One hundred and four older adults were asked,
   "Please check all situations where you might feel uncomfortable,
   nervous, scared, worried, embarrassed, or anxious." Participants were
   also prompted to record any additional situations in which they
   experienced anxiety. Older adults endorsed items not included on typical
   measures of social anxiety at high rates. Exploratory analyses of the
   effects of gender on item endorsement were examined and significant
   differences were found for several items. The authors discuss these
   findings and their implications for the assessment of late-life social

AB I begin with the premise that there is an American Islam being created-a
   version of the faith that aligns with the contemporary United States
   both organizationally and culturally. This faith formation is connected
   to the immigration of Muslims to the United States since the 1965
   changes in immigration laws, even though Muslims have been in the United
   States, especially among African Americans, much longer than that. Two
   sets of social forces are creating this American Islam: the lived
   religious practices of the second and third generations of these
   post-1965 families; and the imposed images of Islam and institutional
   constraints of civil society coming from major social institutions and
   native-born Americans. The interaction of these "bottom up" and "top
   down" dynamics can be illuminated by an understanding of "place" in both
   social and geographical terms.

AB This study explores the identity formation process of self-avowed
   atheists in the context of American culture. Drawing on data collected
   from participant observation and 40 individual in-depth interviews with
   atheists in Colorado, four stages of atheist identity development are
   presented: the starting point/the ubiquity of theism, questioning
   theism, rejecting theism, and "coming out" atheist. I argue that an
   atheist identity is an achieved identity, and one that is constructed in
   social interaction. Focusing on the interactional processes and
   narrative accounts of participants, I discuss the process of rejecting
   the culturally normative belief in God, and the adoption instead, of an
   identity for which the "theist culture" at large offers no validation.
   This research illustrates how identification with atheism in America
   becomes an important aspect of self for those who adopt this label.
   Further, it makes a qualitative contribution to our incipient
   understanding of the subjective experience and identities of actual
   atheists, as well as the dynamics of irreligion and unbelief in
   America-an area of inquiry within the sociology of religion that is in
   need of further development.

AB This paper links the work of Sebastiao Salgado, recipient of the 2010
   American Sociological Association (ASA) Award for Excellence in the
   Reporting of Social Issues, with the discipline of sociology. I reflect
   on Salgado's biography, method, and concerns in order to demonstrate how
   his work contributes to the awareness and understanding of social
   issues. Toward this end, I summarize sociology's record of involvement
   with visual documentation. Prior to 1915, the American Journal of
   Sociology regularly included photographs that provided visual
   documentation of environments under study. However, as sociology moved
   away from social reform activities and toward scientific investigation,
   the regular publication of photographs ceased. During the 1930s and
   1940s, photographic projects in disciplines and social movements beyond
   sociology developed a variety of methods that would prove useful to
   sociology. During the 1970s, sociologists once again began to use visual
   methods in their teaching, research, and publication, putting sociology
   in the position to both contribute to and benefit from insights and
   social commitments that have distinguished Sebastiao Salgado as a
   globally significant photographer and social activist during the late
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

AB Objective: To determine whether characteristics of the social
   environment surrounding lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth
   contribute to their rates of tobacco use after controlling for
   established community-level risk factors.
   Design: Cross-sectional.
   Setting: Population-based study of youth.
   Participants: A total of 31 852 eleventh-grade students (1413 LGB
   individuals [4.44%]) in Oregon completed the Oregon Healthy Teens survey
   in 2006-2008.
   Main Exposures: We created a composite index of the social environment
   in 34 Oregon counties. This measure included the proportion of same-sex
   couples, the presence of gay-straight alliances in schools, and school
   policies (nondiscrimination and antibullying) that specifically
   protected LGB students.
   Main Outcome Measures: Any tobacco use in the past 30 days.
   Results: A more supportive social environment for LGB youth was
   significantly associated with reduced tobacco use (odds ratio, 0.92; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.90-0.94). This effect remained robust after
   controlling for sociodemographic variables and multiple community-level
   risk factors for tobacco use, including median county-level income,
   exposure to cigarette advertisements, exposure to teacher and peer
   smoking in schools, and school smoking rules.
   Conclusion: This study documents an association between an objective
   measure of the social environment and sexual orientation-related
   disparities in tobacco use. These results highlight the need for
   structural-level interventions that reduce smoking behaviors in LGB
   youth.

AB Urban air pollution is among the top 15 causes of death and disease
   worldwide, and a problem of growing importance with a majority of the
   global population living in cities. A important question for sustainable
   development is to what extent urban design can improve or degrade the
   environment and public health. We investigate relationships between
   satellite-derived estimates of nitrogen dioxide concentration (NO2, a
   key component of urban air pollution) and urban form for 83 cities
   globally. We find a parsimonious yet powerful relationship (model R-2 =
   0.63), using as predictors population, income, urban contiguity, and
   meteorology. Cities with highly contiguous built-up areas have, on
   average, lower urban NO2 concentrations (a one standard deviation
   increase in contiguity is associated with a 24% decrease in average NO2
   concentration). More-populous cities tend to have worse air quality, but
   the increase in NO2 associated with a population increase of 10% may be
   offset by a moderate increase (4%) in urban contiguity. Urban
   circularity ("compactness") is not a statistically significant predictor
   of NO2 concentration. Although many factors contribute to urban air
   pollution, our findings suggest that antileapfrogging policies may
   improve air quality. We find that urban NO2 levels vary nonlinearly with
   income (Gross Domestic Product), following an "environmental Kuznets
   curve"; we estimate that if high-income countries followed urban
   pollution-per-income trends observed for low-income countries, NO2
   concentrations in high-income cities would be similar to 10 x larger
   than observed levels.

   current study used the experience-sampling methodology to examine
   associations between depressive symptoms, social contact, and daily life
   impairment in 197 young adults. Depressive symptoms were associated with
   increased isolation, negative affect, anhedonia, and physical symptoms,
   decreased positive affect, and social and cognitive impairment in daily
   life. For people with more depressive symptoms, being with social
   partners who were perceived as close was associated with greater
   decreases in negative affect, as well as increases in positive affect.
   Ironically, participants with depressive symptoms reported spending less
   time with people whom they perceived as close, minimizing the protective
   effects of socializing. These results suggest that people experiencing
   depressive symptoms may be especially sensitive to the nature of social
   interactions.

AB The phenotypic expression of adult body size and shape results from
   synergistic interactions between hereditary factors and environmental
   conditions experienced during growth. Variation in body size and shape
   occurs even in genetically relatively homogeneous groups, due to
   different occurrence, duration, and timing of growth insults.
   Understanding the causes and patterns of intrapopulation variation can
   foster meaningful information on early life conditions in living and
   past populations. This study assesses the pattern of biological
   variation in body size and shape attributable to sex and social status
   in a medieval Italian population. The sample includes 52 (20 female, 32
   male) adult individuals from the medieval population of Trino
   Vercellese, Italy. Differences in element size and overall body size
   (skeletal height and body mass) were assessed through Monte Carlo
   methods, while univariate non-parametric tests and Principal Component
   Analysis (PCA) were employed to examine segmental and overall body
   proportions. Discriminant Analysis was employed to determine the
   predictive value of individual skeletal elements for social status in
   the population. Our results highlight a distinct pattern in body size
   and shape variation in relation to status and sex. Male subsamples
   exhibit significant postcranial variation in body size, while female
   subsamples express smaller, nonsignificant differences. The analysis of
   segmental proportions highlighted differences in trunk/lower limb
   proportions between different status samples, and PCA indicated that in
   terms of purely morphological variation high status males were distinct
   from all other groups. The pattern observed likely resulted from a
   combination of biological factors and cultural practices. Am J Phys

AB Empires have transformed political, social, and environmental landscapes
   in the past and present. Although much research on archaeological
   empires focuses on large-scale imperial processes, we use
   biogeochemistry and bioarchaeology to investigate how imperialism may
   have reshaped regional political organization and regional migration
   patterns in the Wari Empire of the Andean Middle Horizon (ca. AD
   600-1000). Radiogenic strontium isotope analysis of human remains from
   the site of Beringa in the Majes Valley of southern Peru identified the
   geographic origins of individuals impacted by the Wari Empire. At
   Beringa, the combined archaeological human enamel and bone values range
   from (87)Sr/(86)Sr = 0.70802 - 0.70960, with a mean (87)Sr/(86)Sr =
   0.70842 +/- 0.00027 (1 sigma, n = 52). These data are consistent with
   radiogenic strontium isotope data from the local fauna in the Majes
   Valley and imply that most individuals were local inhabitants, rather
   than migrants from the Wari heartland or some other locale. There were
   two outliers at Beringa, and these "nonlocal'' individuals may have
   derived from other parts of the South Central Andes. This is consistent
   with our understanding of expansive trade networks and population
   movement in the Andean Middle Horizon, likely influenced by the policies
   of the Wari Empire. Although not a Wari colony, the incorporation of
   small sites like Beringa into the vast social and political networks of
   the Middle Horizon resulted in small numbers of migrants at Beringa. Am

AB Existing research about the role of the habitus in social change
   emphasizes inertia. Individuals in new contexts are understood to face
   disadvantage, making disruption of a hierarchical status quo difficult.
   Recent theory regarding our ability to strategically change and use our
   bodily habits, however, suggests that the habitus may not be condemned
   to a purely conservative role. Here I examine a community of lindy
   hoppers who are re-shaping the collective body towards feminist ends.
   Control over bodies is essential to partner dance. However, these
   dancers revision the lead/follow dynamic. Instead of an active/passive
   binary, partners happily negotiate power. This negotiation is decidedly
   corporeal and cooperative and occurs spontaneously and constantly. My
   findings add empirical weight to theory regarding the role of the
   habitus in widespread social change, suggest that the habitus has
   emancipatory potential, and offer a template for how the habitus could
   be used by social movement actors.

AB Parent engagement in anti-smoking parenting practices was examined as a
   predictor of children's recalled exposure to these practices, the
   presence of pro-smoking risk factors in children's social environments,
   and children's odds of initiating smoking.
   1,032 parents reported level of engagement in a program that promoted
   anti-smoking parenting practices for 8-year-old children. 1,032 children
   were surveyed 6 months and 3 years post-intervention; they reported on
   exposure to anti-smoking parenting practices, pro-smoking risk factors,
   and initiation of smoking.
   If parents reported high engagement in anti-smoking socialization,
   children had significantly greater recall of anti-smoking parenting
   practices and significantly fewer pro-smoking risk factors up to 3 years
   post-intervention. If engagement was moderate or low, children had
   progressively lower odds of recalling anti-smoking parenting practices
   relative to controls and they were progressively less likely to differ
   from controls in exposure to pro-smoking risk factors at follow-up.
   Achieving full program implementation remains a significant challenge to
   home-based, parent-led approaches to smoking prevention. However, if
   parents fully engage in anti-smoking parenting practices, children
   demonstrate protective effects up to 3 years later.

   analysis of rural community and change: the community
   stability/instability studies. One of their less recognized features is
   that their analyses included women. This article revisits these six
   studies, but from a different vantage point. As a socially constructed
   enterprise, the community studies can be seen as a product of human
   agency. Examining how these researchers saw and included women, this
   analysis examines the historically embedded mediating impact of the
   research producers' positionality on the knowledge they produced. In
   particular, this analysis examines how women came to be included in the
   studies, how these researchers interpreted women's roles, and how
   gendered assumptions affected the conclusions they reached regarding the

AB P>The welfare of farm animals has become a continuing source of
   controversy as states seek greater regulation over the livestock
   industry. However, empirical studies addressing the determinants of
   public concern for farm-animal welfare are limited. Religion and
   politics, two institutional bases of attitudes, are rarely explored. Nor
   have sociologists responded systematically to the popular charge that
   people concerned with animal welfare care less about human well-being.
   This study builds from sociology's stratification literature to address
   new questions about farm-animal welfare. Using a range of animal-welfare
   attitudes and samples drawn from a statewide and a national population
   in 2007, we find support for the religious and political bases of
   farm-animal-welfare attitudes. Frequent church attendance is related to
   less concern with animal welfare. However, we also find that religious
   beliefs can be a source of support for animal welfare. Political
   orientation as reflected by desire for more economic equality and
   greater tolerance of outgroups is also related to concern for
   farm-animal welfare. Formal political partisanship and denomination have
   weaker effects. Concern with farm-animal welfare is consistently related
   to greater concern with human welfare in the food sector.

AB Sociology has long shied away from the problem of populism. This may be
   due to suspicion about the concept or uncertainty about how to fit
   populist cases into broader comparative matrices. Such caution is
   warranted: the existing interdisciplinary literature has been plagued by
   conceptual confusion and disagreement. But given the recent resurgence
   of populist politics in Latin America and elsewhere, sociology can no
   longer afford to sidestep such analytical challenges. This article moves
   toward a political sociology of populism by identifying past theoretical
   deficiencies and proposing a new, practice-based approach that is not
   beholden to pejorative common sense understandings. This approach
   conceptualizes populism as a mode of political practice-as populist
   mobilization. Its utility is demonstrated through an application to
   mid-twentieth-century Latin American politics. The article concludes by
   sketching an agenda for future research on populist mobilization in
   Latin America and beyond.

AB A major problem with the emerging sociological literature on
   cosmopolitanism is that it has not adequately theorized mechanisms that
   mediate the presumed causal relationship between globalization and the
   development of cosmopolitan orientations. To solve this problem, I draw
   on Bruno Latour's actor-network theory (ANT) to theorize the development
   of three key elements of cosmopolitanism: cultural omnivorousness,
   ethnic tolerance, and cosmopolitics. ANT illuminates how humans and
   nonhumans of multiple nationalities develop attachments with one another
   to create network structures that sustain cosmopolitanism. ANT also
   helps the sociology of cosmopolitanism become more reflexive and
   critical of its implicit normative claims.

AB Background: Low-income, urban African-American youth are at higher risk
   for obesity and less likely to meet dietary recommendations than white,
   higher-income youth. Patterns of food purchasing among youth likely
   contribute to these disparities, but little published information is
   available.
   Purpose: To investigate food purchasing behaviors of low-income, urban
   African-American youth.
   Methods: A total of 242 African-American youth, aged 10-14 years, were
   recruited from 14 recreation centers in low-income, predominantly
   African-American neighborhoods in Baltimore MD. Youth reported the
   amount of money typically spent on food, the source of this money, the
   place of purchase, and frequency of purchase for 29 foods and beverages.
   Data were collected in 2008-2009 and analyzed in 2009-2010.
   Results: Youth reported spending an average of $3.96 on foods and
   beverages in a typical day. Corner stores were the most frequently
   visited food source (youth made purchases at these stores an average of
   2.0 times per week). Chips, candy, and soda were the most commonly
   purchased items, with youth purchasing these an average of 2.5, 1.8, and
   1.4 times per week, respectively. Older age was associated with more
   money spent on food in a typical day (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: Food purchasing among low-income, urban African-American
   youth is frequent and substantial. Interventions aimed at preventing and
   treating obesity in this population should focus on increasing access to
   healthy foods in their neighborhoods, especially in corner stores. (Am J

AB Past research recognizes that firms exploit regulatory variations to
   their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic
   process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by
   including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view
   regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity
   structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their
   rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws
   that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22
   U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze
   how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and
   exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and
   non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new
   stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the
   borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW
   states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of
   regulation, social movements, and organizations.

   Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is
   contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of
   creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I
   illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum
   United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed
   to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a
   process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I
   conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral
   authority, which have made the local level a springboard for
   destabilizing financial innovations.

AB Background The incidence of autism rose dramatically between 1992 and
   2001, while the age at which children were first diagnosed declined.
   During this period the size and composition of the autism caseload has
   changed, but little is known about whether the factors associated with
   the timing of diagnosis may also have shifted. Using a multilevel
   analysis strategy, the individual and community-level factors associated
   with age of diagnosis were modelled across 10 birth cohorts of
   California children.
   Methods Linked birth and administrative records on 17 185 children with
   diagnoses of autistic disorder born in California between 1992 and 2001
   and enrolled with the California Department of Developmental Services
   (DDS) were analysed. Information on cases, their parents and their
   residential location were extracted from birth and DDS records. Zip
   codes of residence were matched to census data to create community-level
   measures. Multilevel linear models were estimated for each birth cohort,
   with individual-level effects for sex, race, parental characteristics,
   poverty status, birth order and symptom expression. At the community
   level measures of educational and economic composition, local autism
   prevalence and the presence of a child psychiatrist were included.
   Results Children with highly educated parents are diagnosed earlier, and
   this effect has strengthened over time. There is a persistent gap in the
   age of diagnosis between high and low socioeconomic status (SES)
   children that has shrunk but not disappeared over time.
   Conclusion Routine screening for autism in early childhood for all
   children, particularly those of low SES, is necessary to eliminate
   disparities in early intervention.

AB BACKGROUND: Homeless people have high rates of hospitalization and
   emergency department (ED) use. Obtaining adequate food is a common
   concern among homeless people and may influence health care utilization.
   OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that food insufficiency is related
   to higher rates of hospitalization and ED use in a national sample of
   homeless adults.
   DESIGN: We analyzed data from the 2003 Health Care for the Homeless
   (HCH) User Survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 966 adults surveyed at 79 HCH clinic
   sites throughout the US. The study sample was representative of over
   436,000 HCH clinic users nationally.
   MEASURES: We determined the prevalence and characteristics of food
   insufficiency among respondents. Using multivariable logistic
   regression, we examined the association between food insufficiency and
   four past-year acute health services utilization outcomes: (1)
   hospitalization for any reason, (2) psychiatric hospitalization, (3) any
   ED use, and (4) high ED use (>= 4 visits).
   RESULTS: Overall, 25% of respondents reported food insufficiency. Among
   them, 68% went a whole day without eating in the past month. Chronically
   homeless (p = 0.01) and traumatically victimized (p = 0.001) respondents
   were more likely to be food insufficient. In multivariable analyses,
   food insufficiency was associated with significantly greater odds of
   hospitalization for any reason (AOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.07, 2.36),
   psychiatric hospitalization (AOR 3.12, 95% CI 1.73, 5.62), and high ED
   utilization (AOR 2.83, 95% CI 1.32, 6.08).
   CONCLUSIONS: One-fourth of homeless adults in this national survey were
   food insufficient, and this was associated with increased odds of acute
   health services utilization. Addressing the adverse health services
   utilization patterns of homeless adults will require attention to the
   social circumstances that may contribute to this issue.

   effects, however, varies by race/ethnicity. We also show that black and

AB The sociology of aging draws on a broad array of theoretical

   own. We build on past work to advance and empirically test a model of
   mental health framed in terms of structural theorizing and situated
   within the life course perspective. Whereas most prior research has been
   based on cross-sectional data, we utilize four waves of data from a
   nationally representative sample of American adults (Americans' Changing
   Lives Study) collected prospectively over a 15-year period and find that
   education, employment and marital status, as well as their consequences
   for income and health, effectively explain the increase in depressive
   symptoms after age 65. We also found significant cohort differences in
   age trajectories of mental health that were partly explained by
   historical increases in education. We demonstrate that a purely
   structural theory can take us far in explaining later life mental
   health.

AB Religious leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa do not just deal with the
   spiritual needs of members but are also heavily engaged in dealing with
   social problems and material needs. Although true elsewhere, the
   realities of limited state infrastructure and an increasingly diverse
   religious landscape make it crucial for religious entrepreneurs to deal
   with material problems if they hope to gain adherents. This article
   applies the concepts of problem solving and brokerage (Burt, 2005;
   Knoke, 1990) to a case study of religious leaders in Balaka, a small
   town of rural Malawi. I argue that religious leaders solve problems in
   three major areas-material infrastructure, activities and organization,
   and healthcare-and that they are able to do so at least partly because
   of their connections to various overlapping secular and religious
   networks. I focus both on the provision of material resources and the
   facilitation of effervescent experiences in order to advance a fuller
   understanding of the experience of poverty and the ways leaders in poor
   communities work to solve problems.

   about health by their medical training and membership in a particular

   itself influenced by both a common body of accepted formal knowledge and

   education. In this study, we compared physicians from different

   regard to beliefs and attitudes about the relation between diet and
   health and other health-related issues. Telephone interviews about diet
   and health conducted with randomly sampled physicians and laypersons in
   France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the USA revealed
   substantial cultural/national differences and few differences between
   physicians and laypersons of the same country. Three different measures
   of similarity converged in supporting the claim that in the areas of

   resemble physicians from other Western countries. The degree to which
   differences in culture- and nation-mediated medical education influence
   these results is to be determined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Recent findings indicate that household food insecurity affects
   children's social skill development in the early years of elementary
   school. It is important to assess the persistency of developmental
   consequences and investigate whether all categories of social skills are
   equally affected by food insecurity experiences. The present paper
   estimates population-averaged and subject-specific models for children's
   social skill scores reported by school teachers using longitudinal data
   on 2310 boys and 2400 girls in the USA enrolled in the 1st (aged 6-9
   years), 3rd (aged 8-11 years) and 5th (aged 10-13 years) grades
   (1999-2003) from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten.
   The main findings are, first, significantly (P<0.05) negative,
   contemporaneous and transitional relationships between food insecurity
   experiences and children's social skill scores are evident. Estimates
   based on sex-stratified samples indicate that the contemporaneous
   association is strongest among girls, while the association of an early
   transition from food insecurity in the 1st grade to food security in the
   3rd grade is strongest among boys. Second, food insecurity experiences
   predict children's social skill scores emphasising self-control,
   attentiveness and task persistence, rather than interpersonal
   relationships or externalising behaviour. Overall, the findings
   underscore the multifaceted effect that household food insecurity has on
   children's social skills and provide the strongest empirical evidence to
   date that the experiences are linked with non-nutritional developmental
   consequences for children over a time horizon spanning several years.

AB Introduction: Breast cancer in women has historically been seen as a
   "cancer of affluence" and there is a well-documented higher incidence
   among women of higher social class, as well as in societies with higher
   resources. However, the relationship between social class and breast
   cancer disease characteristics, especially those associated with poorer
   prognosis, is less well documented, and the overall relationship between
   breast cancer mortality and social class has been shown to vary.
   Furthermore, rapid changes in women's health and health-related
   behaviors in societies around the world may have an impact on both
   incidence and mortality patterns for breast cancer in the future.
   Methods: A PUBMED search on breast cancer and social class
   (incorporating the MeSH-nested concept of SES) yielded 403 possible
   studies published between 1978 and 2009, of which 90 met criteria for
   review. Our review discusses conceptualization and measurement of
   women's social class in each study, as well as findings related to
   breast cancer incidence, tumor biology or mortality, associated with
   social class. Findings: We found mostly consistent evidence that breast
   cancer incidence continues to be higher in higher social class groups,
   with some modification of risk with adjustment for known risk factors,
   including physical activity and reproductive history. However, biologic
   characteristics associated with poorer prognosis were negatively
   associated with social class (i.e., greater occurrence among
   disadvantaged women), and mortality from breast cancer showed
   inconsistent relationship to social class. Conclusions: We discuss these
   studies in relation to the growing burden of breast cancer among low
   resource groups and countries, and the need for cancer control
   strategies reflecting the emerging demographics of breast cancer risk.

AB Urbanization is recognized as one of the greatest threats to
   biodiversity throughout the world. However, the vegetation within an
   urbanized landscape is diverse and includes a variety of native and
   exotic plant species. This variation allows for testing whether certain
   landscape designs outperform others in the support of native
   biodiversity. Residential yards represent a large component of an urban
   landscape and, if managed collectively for birds and other wildlife,
   could offset some of the negative effects of urbanization. In addition,
   many urbanites have their primary interaction with the natural world in
   their front and back yards. Therefore, ensuring positive wildlife
   experiences for them is essential in promoting urban biodiversity. At
   the Central Arizona-Phoenix Long-Term Ecological Research site we tested
   the efficacy of native landscaping in residential yards in attracting
   native birds. We also explored the links between socioeconomic factors,
   landscape designs, and urban gradient measurements with the urban bird
   communities. A redundancy analysis suggested that native desert bird
   species increased in abundance in neighborhoods with desert landscaping
   designs, neighborhoods closer to large desert tracts, and higher-income
   neighborhoods. Variance partitioning showed that collectively these
   three sets of environmental variables explained almost 50% of the
   variation in the urban bird community. Results suggested racial and
   economic inequities in access to biodiversity, whereby predominantly
   Hispanic and lower-income neighborhoods had fewer native birds. We also
   found that residents' satisfaction with bird diversity was positively
   correlated with actual bird diversity. Our study provides new insights
   into the relative importance of socioeconomic variables and common urban
   ecological measurements in explaining urban bird communities. Urban
   planners can use this information to develop residential landscapes that
   support the well-being of both birds and people.

AB Nine experiments tested competing hypotheses regarding nonconscious
   affective responses to acute social exclusion and how such responses may
   relate to positive mental health. The results strongly and consistently
   indicated that acute social exclusion increased nonconscious positive
   affect. Compared to nonexcluded participants, excluded participants
   recalled more positive memories from childhood than did accepted
   participants (Experiment 1), gave greater weight to positive emotion in
   their judgments of word similarity (Experiments 2 and 3), and completed
   more ambiguous word stems with happy words (Experiments 4a and 4b). This
   process was apparently automatic, as participants asked to imagine
   exclusion overestimated explicit distress and underestimated implicit
   positivity (Experiment 3). Four final experiments showed that this
   automatic emotion regulation process was found among participants low
   (but not high) in depressive symptoms (Experiments 5 and 6) and among
   participants high (but not low) in self-esteem (Experiments 7 and 8).
   These findings suggest that acute exclusion sets in motion an automatic
   emotion regulation process in which positive emotions become highly
   accessible, which relates to positive mental health.

   characterizes state and corporate violence. This logic of capital can be
   explicated in contrast to a relational account of community that can
   ground alternative logics of care. Nigeria's oil policy led to drilling
   impacts including pollution, social costs, and corruption. The failure
   of organized resistance to these developments produced widespread
   disillusionment in the 1990s, to which male youth responded with
   militancy and profiteering. In contrast,women's organized resistance

AB Petroleum extraction in the Amazon rain forest has left grave human
   rights violations in its wake, creating myriad ethics and sustainability
   challenges. Framing sustainability ethics in terms of collective
   responsibility, there are four conceptions of responsibility: aggregated
   complicit individual responsibility, the responsibility of a unitary
   corporate person, a social connection model of shared responsibility,
   and universal social responsibility. Each conception of collective
   responsibility expands the scope of responsible actors, from selective
   stakeholders, to institutions, to systems, and finally to all parties.
   Only universal social responsibility is sufficiently comprehensive to
   encompass all actors responsible for environmental problems such as the
   Amazon crisis. Moreover, its proponents take a spiritual turn that
   emphasizes compassion with and a sense of solidarity requisite for
   motivating activism. Universal social responsibility has the greatest
   potential to stimulate a paradigm shift that could lead to improved
   solutions to sustainability challenges. Ultimately, environmental
   activism needs to be rooted in love.

AB Risk is a reality that has to be managed by households in rural
   Afghanistan. Some communities are more likely than others to experience
   risks and at the same time are the least likely to adapt and recover
   from the adverse outcomes when they arise. In rural Nangarhar many of
   the communities most likely to experience natural risks, as well as
   risks resulting from human activity, are also those who have been the
   most reliant on opium production. The impact of a comprehensive opium
   ban across the province for the third consecutive year has hit those
   communities who are most vulnerable to repeated and concurrent risks the
   hardest. Where these risks are compounded by the economic costs of
   illness, injury or death, or other life events such as marriage,
   households are left increasingly destitute, creating the conditions that
   foster further economic and political instability.

AB OBJECTIVES: Assess the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD) symptomatology and its association with health characteristics in
   a geriatric primary care population.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional screening assessments during a multisite trial
   for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and at-risk drinking.
   SETTING: Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-based primary care clinics
   across the United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: Seventeen thousand two hundred five veterans aged 65 and
   older.
   MEASUREMENTS: Sociodemographic information, the General Health
   Questionnaire (GHQ-12), questions about death wishes and suicidal
   ideation, quantity and frequency of alcohol use, smoking, exposure to
   traumatic events, and PTSD symptom clusters.
   RESULTS: Twelve percent (2,041/17,205) of participants screened endorsed
   PTSD symptoms. Veterans with PTSD symptoms from some (partial PTSD) or
   each (PTSD all clusters) of the symptom clusters were significantly more
   likely to report poor general health, currently smoke, be divorced,
   report little or no social support, and have a higher prevalence of
   mental distress, death wishes, and suicidal ideation than those with no
   trauma history or those with trauma but no symptoms. Group differences
   were most pronounced for mental distress and least for at-risk drinking.
   Presence of PTSD all clusters was associated with poorer outcomes on all
   of the above-mentioned health characteristics than partial PTSD.
   CONCLUSION: PTSD symptoms are common in a substantial minority of older
   veterans in primary care, and careful inquiry about these symptoms is
   important for comprehensive assessment in geriatric populations. J Am

AB Dramatic shocks to social systems can disrupt normal social processes
   such as life course sequences and socioeconomic attainment. Such shocks
   provide a rare opportunity for contrasting normal and extraordinary
   social processes and thus revealing social structures and processes that
   may otherwise be invisible. The current article focuses on the
   'sent-down' generation in China of the 1960s and 1970s, many of whom
   were forcibly relocated to the countryside following middle or high
   school graduation to "learn from the peasants." Although most of these
   young people eventually returned to urban areas, the experience was
   traumatic for at least some and disrupted normal life course
   developments and process of socioeconomic attainment for many. This is
   especially the case for those who stayed in the countryside for an
   extended period of time. Data from the Chinese General Social Survey
   indicate that both the formal and informal power of parents was unable
   to protect children from being sent down. Nevertheless, as the process
   matured, stratification forces reemerged in the ability of politically
   well-placed parents to facilitate the early return of their children.
   Despite some success in attaining college education and Communist Party
   membership for the sent-down generation, sent-down men report more
   unhappiness with life than their non-sent-down counterparts and
   sent-down men and women report much earlier retirement and withdrawal
   from the labor force than non-sent-down women. These findings
   collaborate and extend prior research on the sent-down generation and
   illustrate the lasting effects of both inequality and of attempts to
   change inequality. (C) 2010 International Sociological Association

AB An historical review of authorship definitions and publication practices
   that are embedded in directions to authors and in the codes of ethics in
   the fields of psychology, sociology, and education illuminates
   reasonable agreement and consistency across the fields with regard to
   (a) originality of the work submitted, (b) data sharing, (c) human
   participants' protection, and (d) conflict of interest disclosure.
   However, the role of the professional association in addressing
   violations of research or publication practices varies among these
   fields. Psychology and sociology provide active oversight with sanction
   authority. In education, the association assumes a more limited role: to
   develop and communicate standards to evoke voluntary compliance. With
   respect to authorship credit, each association's standards focus on
   criteria for inclusion as an author, other than on the author's ability
   to defend and willingness to take responsibility for the entire work.
   Discussions across a broad range of research disciplines beyond the
   social sciences would likely be beneficial. Whether improved standards
   will reduce either misattribution or perceptions of inappropriate
   attribution of credit within social science disciplines will likely
   depend on how well authorship issues are addressed in responsible
   conduct of research education (RCR), in research practice, and in each
   association's ongoing efforts to influence normative practice by
   specifying and clarifying best practices.

AB Experience with nature contributes to human wellbeing and environmental
   stewardship. Both may be affected when people experience local
   environmental disturbances. I test the hypothesis that relatively
   gradual ecological disturbance in urban areas increases awareness and
   appreciation of urban nature and environmental stewardship. In recent
   years the Emerald Ash Borer killed 10,000 street trees in Ann Arbor,
   Michigan. Information on residents attitudes and behavior regarding
   urban nature and street trees was collected from a mailed survey
   returned by 594 homeowners. Residential properties in the sample were
   distributed across the city as 24 pairs of nearest neighbor streets,
   including a "treatment street" (>70% street trees lost) and a "control
   street" (<30% street trees lost).
   Findings indicate that those experiencing tree loss were significantly
   more engaged with nature and more willing to participate in stewardship.
   The degree of increased engagement was directly related to the
   individual's proximity to the disturbance. Proximity to the loss was
   also a significant contributor to respondents' appreciation of urban
   nature and the feeling that street trees enhance sense of wellbeing.
   However, regardless of proximity to tree loss, responses to items
   concerning appreciation of urban nature and the feeling that street
   trees enhance sense of wellbeing were extremely high. The results of
   this study suggest that recovery from ecological disturbance may be best
   supported by stewardship activities that engage citizens in what the
   care about, in ways that foster wellbeing of both the self and the urban
   ecosystem. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB How do people interpret the meaning of a smile? Previous studies with
   Westerners have found that both the eyes and the mouth are crucial in
   identifying and interpreting smiles, yet less is known about Easterners.
   Here we reported that when asking the Chinese to judge the Duchenne and
   non-Duchenne smiles as either real or fake, their accuracy and
   sensitivity were negatively correlated with their individualism scores
   but positively correlated with their collectivism scores. However, such
   correlations were found only for participants who stated the eyes to be
   the most useful references, but not for those who favored the mouth.
   Moreover, participants who favored the eyes were more accurate and
   sensitive than those who favored the mouth. Our results thus indicate
   that Chinese who follow the typical Eastern decoding process of using
   the eyes as diagnostic cues to identify and interpret others' facial
   expressions and social intentions, are particularly accurate and
   sensitive, the more they self-report greater collectivistic and lower
   individualistic values.

AB In many social networks, there is a high correlation between the
   similarity of actors and the existence of relationships between them.
   This paper introduces a model of network evolution where actors are
   assumed to have a small aversion from being connected to others who are
   dissimilar to themselves, and yet no actor strictly prefers a segregated
   network. This model is motivated by Schelling's [Schelling TC (1969)
   Models of segregation. Am Econ Rev 59: 488-493] classic model of
   residential segregation, and we show that Schelling's results also apply
   to the structure of networks; namely, segregated networks always emerge
   regardless of the level of aversion. In addition, we prove analytically
   that attribute similarity among connected network actors always reaches
   a stationary distribution, and this distribution is independent of
   network topology and the level of aversion bias. This research provides
   a basis for more complex models of social interaction that are driven in
   part by the underlying attributes of network actors and helps advance
   our understanding of why dysfunctional social network structures may
   emerge.

AB Indirect reciprocity models are meant to correspond to simple moral
   systems, in which individuals assess the interactions of third parties
   in order to condition their cooperative behavior. Despite the staggering
   number of possible assessment rules in even the simplest of these
   models, previous research suggests that only a handful are
   evolutionarily stable against invasion by free riders. These successful
   assessment rules fall into two categories, one which positively judges
   miscreants when they refuse to help other miscreants, the other which
   does not. Previous research has not, however, demonstrated that all of
   these rules can invade an asocial population-a requirement for a
   complete theory of social evolution. Here, I present a general
   analytical model of indirect reciprocity and show that the class of
   assessment rules which positively judges a refusal to help scofflaws
   cannot invade a population of defectors, whereas the other class can.
   When rare, assessment rules which positively judge a refusal to help bad
   people produce a poor correlation between reputation and behavior. It is
   this correlation that generates the assortment crucial in sustaining
   cooperation through indirect reciprocity. Only assessment rules that
   require good deeds to achieve a good reputation guarantee a strong
   correlation between behavior and reputation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Most studies of human molecular genetics and social environment
   interactions on health have relied heavily on the classic
   diathesisstress model that treats genetic variations and environments as
   being either "risky" or "protective." The biological susceptibility
   model posits that some individuals have greater genetic reactivity to
   stress, leading to worse outcomes in poor environments, but better
   outcomes in rich environments. Using a nontruncated measure of a chronic
   environmental stressor-socioeconomic status-measured by education, and
   two polymorphisms (5-HTTLPR and STin2 VNTR) of the serotonin transporter
   gene (5-HTT), we find strong evidence that some women are genetically
   more reactive to the environment, resulting in a crossover of risks of
   postpartum depression for the most reactive groups. We discuss how our
   approach and findings provide a framework for understanding some of the
   confusion in the gene-environment interaction literature on stress,
   5-HTT, and depression.

AB Reconstructing the rise and fall of social complexity in human societies
   through time is fundamental for understanding some of the most important
   transformations in human history. Phylogenetic methods based on language
   diversity provide a means to reconstruct pre-historic events and model
   the transition rates of cultural change through time. We model and
   compare the evolution of social complexity in Austronesian (n = 88) and
   Bantu (n = 89) societies, two of the world's largest language families
   with societies representing a wide spectrum of social complexity. Our
   results show that in both language families, social complexity tends to
   build and decline in an incremental fashion, while the Austronesian
   phylogeny provides evidence for additional severe demographic
   bottlenecks. We suggest that the greater linguistic diversity of the
   Austronesian language family than Bantu likely follows the different
   biogeographic structure of the two regions. Cultural evolution in both
   the Bantu and Austronesian cases was not a simple linear process, but
   more of a wave-like process closely tied to the demography of expanding
   populations and the spatial structure of the colonized regions.

AB Analysis of networks and in particular discovering communities within
   networks has been a focus of recent work in several fields and has
   diverse applications. Most community detection methods focus on
   partitioning the entire network into communities, with the expectation
   of many ties within communities and few ties between. However, many
   networks contain nodes that do not fit in with any of the communities,
   and forcing every node into a community can distort results. Here we
   propose a new framework that extracts one community at a time, allowing
   for arbitrary structure in the remainder of the network, which can
   include weakly connected nodes. The main idea is that the strength of a
   community should depend on ties between its members and ties to the
   outside world, but not on ties between nonmembers. The proposed
   extraction criterion has a natural probabilistic interpretation in a
   wide class of models and performs well on simulated and real networks.
   For the case of the block model, we establish asymptotic consistency of
   estimated node labels and propose a hypothesis test for determining the
   number of communities.

AB The Leeward Kohala Field System (LKFS) covering similar to 60 km(2) on
   Hawai'i Island is one of the world's best-studied archaeological
   examples of preindustrial agricultural intensification. Archaeological
   correlates for households over a 400-y period of intensification of the
   LKFS (A.D. 1400-1800) indicate that household age, number, and
   distribution closely match the expansion of agricultural features at
   both macro-and microscales. We excavated and dated residential complexes
   within portions of five traditional Hawaiian land units (ahupua'a), two
   in the central core of the field system and three in the southern
   margins. Forty-eight radiocarbon dates from 43 residential features
   indicate an overall pattern of exponential increase in the numbers of
   households over time. Spatial distribution of these dates suggests that
   the core of the LKFS may have reached a population saturation point
   earlier than in the southern margins. Bayesian statistical analysis of
   radiocarbon dates from residential features in the core region, combined
   with spatial analysis of agricultural and residential construction
   sequences, demonstrates that the progressive subdivision of territories
   into smaller socioeconomic units was matched by addition of new
   residences, probably through a process of household fissioning. These
   results provide insights into the economic processes underlying the
   sociopolitical transformation from chiefdom to archaic state in
   precontact Hawai'i.

AB Wild and Scenic Rivers provide a host of psychological, social,
   ecological, and economic benefits to local communities. In this study,
   we use data collected from recreational users of two Wild and Scenic
   Rivers to examine perceptions of the benefits provided by the rivers to
   local communities. Our purposes are (1) to determine if similar
   perceptions of community benefits exist across the two rivers, (2) to
   determine if individuals' proximity to the rivers are related to the
   benefits they perceive, (3) to determine if individuals' prior
   recreation experience on the river is related to variations in perceived
   benefits, (4) to determine if users' sociodemographic characteristics
   are related to perceived community benefits, and (5) to determine if the
   influence of these characteristics on perceived community benefits is
   similar across the two resource areas. Perceived benefits were found to
   be analogous across both rivers as individuals consistently ranked
   ecological/affective benefits as well as tangible benefits similarly.
   Recreationists living further from the river ranked ecological and
   affective benefits as significantly less important than those
   individuals living closer to the river. Women perceived the community
   benefits produced by the resource areas to be significantly more
   important when compared to men. Significant relationships were also
   found between perceived benefits and recreationists' previous use of the
   river, their age, and their level of education. With the exception of
   resource proximity and prior use history, the effects of user
   characteristics on perceived community benefits were not statistically
   different across the two rivers. These findings imply similar patterns
   of perceived community benefits exist across distinct resource areas and
   that the relationships between user characteristics and perceived
   benefits are also similar across the study rivers.

AB Objective: Although racial and ethnic minorities are often disadvantaged
   in multiple ways, little research has examined the interactive effects
   of multiple forms of disadvantage in these populations. The current
   study describes the independent and interactive effects of perceived
   prejudice, perceived unfair treatment, poverty, and foreign nativity on
   problem drinking outcomes among Black and Latino adults. Method: The
   data source was Black (n = 504) and Latino (n = 766) drinkers from the
   nationally representative, weighted 2005 National Alcohol Survey.
   Perceived prejudice was assessed using a composite measure of racial
   stigma consciousness; perceived unfair treatment was assessed using a
   single item. Respondents whose per capita household income was below the
   2004 poverty guidelines were coded as "poor"; nativity status was
   assessed among Latinos. Outcomes included past-year drinking to
   drunkenness, any drinking-related consequences, and two or more
   dependence symptoms. Results: In bivariate tests, higher levels of
   unfair treatment were significantly associated with all three outcomes
   among Blacks (marginally so for drunkenness) and dependence symptoms
   among Latinos. Further, higher racial stigma was significantly
   associated with higher rates of any drinking consequences among Latinos.
   In multivariate logistic regressions, six significant or marginally
   significant interactions emerged. For each, the pattern of results
   suggested stronger associations between perceived prejudice/unfair
   treatment and problem drinking given either poverty or foreign nativity.
   Conclusions: Although findings were somewhat mixed, the pattern of
   results tentatively supports the hypothesis that associations between
   problem drinking and both prejudice and unfair treatment can be
   exacerbated given the presence of other stressors, particularly among
   Latinos. Results extend the literature on the health consequences of
   prejudice and discrimination, highlighting important effects of
   cumulative adversity and suggesting a need to focus particularly on
   drinkers exposed to the combined effects of multiple stressors in
   prevention and treatment efforts. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 361-370,

AB OBJECTIVES: To describe the independent contributions of selected
   medical conditions to the disparity between black and white people in
   disability rates, controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a community-based cohort.
   SETTING: Urban and rural counties of central North Carolina.
   PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand nine hundred sixty-six adults aged 68 and
   older participating in the Duke Established Populations for
   Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE).
   MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported data on sociodemographic characteristics and
   medical conditions, Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire,
   activities of daily living (ADLs).
   RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of the cohort was black. Blacks were more
   likely than whites to report disability (odds ratio - 1.39, 95%
   confidence interval - 1.15-1.68). Controlling for age, sex, marital
   status, and socioeconomic status, blacks were more likely to be obese
   and have diabetes mellitus, and less likely to report vision problems,
   fractures, and heart attacks. The higher prevalence of obesity and
   diabetes mellitus in blacks, after adjustment for sociodemographic
   factors, accounted for more than 30% of the black-white difference in
   disability. Conversely, the black-white disability gap would be
   approximately 45% wider if whites had a lower prevalence of fractures
   and vision impairment, similar to their black peers.
   CONCLUSION: Higher rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus in older black
   Americans account for a large amount of the racial disparity in
   disability, even after controlling for socioeconomic differences.
   Culturally appropriate interventions that lower the prevalence or the
   functional consequences of obesity and diabetes mellitus in blacks could
   substantially decrease this racial health disparity. J Am Geriatr Soc

AB Objective: To examine behavioral observations of affiliation (ie, warmth
   versus hostility) and control (ie, dominance versus submissiveness) and
   prior divorce as predictors of coronary artery calcification (CAC) in
   older couples. In some but not all studies, marital disruption and low
   marital quality have been shown to confer risk of coronary artery
   disease (CAD). Inconsistencies might reflect limitations of self-reports
   of marital quality compared with behavioral observations. Also, aspects
   of marital quality related to CAD might differ for men and women.
   Methods: Couples underwent computed tomography scans for CAC and marital
   assessments, including observations of laboratory-based disagreement.
   Participants were 154 couples (mean age, 63.5 years; mean length of
   marriage, 36.4 years) free of prior diagnosis of CAD. Results:
   Controlling traditional risk factors, we found behavioral measures of
   affiliation (low warmth) accounted for 6.2% of variance in CAC for
   women, p < .01, but not for men. Controlling behavior (dominance)
   accounted for 6.0% of variance in CAC for men, p < .02, but not for
   women. Behavioral measures were related to self-reports of marital
   quality, but the latter were unrelated to CAC. History of divorce
   predicted CAC for men and women. Conclusions: History of divorce and
   behavioral-but not self-report-measures of marital quality were related
   to CAD, such that low warmth and high dominance conferred risk for women
   and men, respectively. Prior research might underestimate the role of
   marital quality in CAD by relying on global self-reports of this risk
   factor.

AB Theorists posit that certain behaviors exhibited by depressed
   individuals (e.g., negative self-statements, dependency, reassurance
   seeking, inappropriate or premature disclosures, passivity, social
   withdrawal) reduce social support, yet there have been few experimental
   tests of this hypothesis. Using data from a randomized depression
   prevention trial (N = 253) involving adolescents (M age = 15.5, SD =
   1.2), we tested whether a cognitive behavioral group intervention that
   significantly reduced depressive symptoms relative to bibliotherapy and
   educational brochure control conditions through 2-year follow-up
   produced improvements in perceived parental and friend social support
   and whether change in depressive symptoms mediated the effect on change
   in social support. Cognitive behavioral group participants showed
   significantly greater increases in perceived friend social support
   through 1-year follow-up relative to bibliotherapy and brochure
   controls, but there were no significant effects for perceived parental
   support. Further, change in depressive symptoms appeared to mediate the
   effects of the intervention on change in perceived friend support.
   Results provide experimental support for the theory that depressive
   symptoms are inversely related to perceived social support, but imply
   that this effect may be specific to friend vs. parental support for
   adolescents. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Fatal overdoses involving prescription opioids have
   increased significantly in recent years in the United States -
   especially in rural areas. However, there are scant data about non-fatal
   overdose among rural drug users. The purpose of this study is to examine
   the prevalence and correlates of non-fatal overdose and witnessed
   overdose among rural Appalachian drug users.
   Methods: Rural drug users were participants in a longitudinal study of
   social networks and HIV transmission. An interviewer-administered
   questionnaire elicited information in the following domains:
   sociodemographic characteristics, drug use (including lifetime overdose
   and witnessed overdose), psychiatric disorders, HIV risk behaviors and
   social networks (support, drug and sex networks). Negative binomial
   regression was used to model the number of lifetime overdoses and
   witnessed overdoses.
   Results: Of the 400 participants, 28% had ever experienced a non-fatal
   overdose, while 58.2% had ever witnessed an overdose (fatal or
   non-fatal). Factors independently associated with a greater number of
   overdoses included having ever been in drug treatment, past 30-day
   injection of prescription opioids, meeting the criteria for
   post-traumatic stress disorder and/or antisocial personality disorder
   and having more members in one's support network.
   Conclusions: Rural drug users with history of overdose were more likely
   to have injected with prescription opioids - which is different from
   urban heroin users. However, the remaining correlates of non-fatal
   overdose among this cohort of rural drug users were similar to those of
   urban heroin users, which suggests current overdose prevention
   strategies employed in urban settings may be effective in preventing
   fatal overdose in this population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

AB Altruistic acts have been defined, in economic terms, as "...costly acts
   that confer economic benefits on other individuals" (Fehr and
   Fischbacher, 2003). In multi-player, one-shot prisoner's dilemma games,
   a significant number of players behave altruistically: their behavior
   benefits each of the other players but is costly to them. We consider
   three potential explanations for such altruism. The first explanation,
   following a suggestion by the philosopher Derek Parfit, assumes that
   players devise a strategy to avoid being free-loaders-and that in the
   present case this strategy dictates cooperation. The second explanation
   says that cooperators reject the one-shot aspect of the game and behave
   so as to maximize reward over a series of choices extending beyond the
   present situation (even though reward is not maximized in the present
   case). This explanation assumes that people may learn to extend the
   boundaries of their selves socially (beyond their own skin) as well as
   temporally (beyond the present moment). We propose a learning mechanism
   for such behavior analogous to the biological, evolutionary mechanism of
   group selection. The third explanation assumes that people's altruism is
   based on a straightforward balancing of undiscounted costs to themselves
   against discounted benefits to others (social discounting). The three
   proposed explanations of altruism complement each other. (C) 2010

AB This paper offers a first step in a theory of religious hypocrisy.
   Religious hypocrisy is shown to be a rational strategy at the individual
   level through which the individual maximizes his/her religious gain by
   accessing religious rewards and minimizing the costs through selective
   non-compliance to the religion's objective commitments. The
   pervasiveness of religious hypocrisy is argued to be a result of group
   level characteristics, namely the extensiveness of the religious group's
   objective commitments. The level of objective hypocrisy can be moderated
   through variation in the members' dependence on the group and the
   group's capacity to control its members. Religious hypocrisy is a
   maximizing behavior; however, it is not costless and it can lead to the
   experience of moral dissonance. This dissonance can have group level
   outcomes including decline due to exit and secularization.

AB Background: There is conflicting evidence about the influence of
   race/ethnicity on the use of intensive care at the end of life, and
   little is known about the influence of socioeconomic status.
   Methods: We examined patients who died in the ICU in 15 hospitals.
   Race/ethnicity was assessed as white and nonwhite. Socioeconomic status
   included patient education, health insurance, and income by zip code. To
   explore differences in end-of-life care, we examined the use of (1)
   advance directives, (2) life-sustaining therapies, (3) symptom
   management, (4) communication, and (5) support services.
   Results: Medical charts were abstracted for 3,138/3,400 patients of whom
   2,479 (79%) were white and 659 (21%) were nonwhite (or Hispanic). In
   logistic regressions adjusted for patient demographics, socioeconomic
   factors, and site, nonwhite patients were less likely to have living
   wills (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32-0.54) and more likely to die with full
   support (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.30-1.94). In documentation of family
   conferences, nonwhite patients were more likely to have documentation
   that prognosis was discussed (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.21-1.77) and that
   physicians recommended withdrawal of life support (OR, 1.57; 95% CI,
   1.11-2.21). Nonwhite patients also we:re more likely to have discord
   documented among family members or with clinicians (OR, 1.49; 95% CI,
   1.04-2.15). Socioeconomic status did not modify these associations and
   was not a consistent predictor of end-of-life care.
   Conclusions: We found numerous racial/ethnic differences in end-of-life
   care in the ICU that were not influenced by socioeconomic status. These
   differences could be due to treatment preferences, disparities, or both.
   Improving ICU end-of-life care for all patients and families will
   require a better understanding of these issues.

AB Objective: This analysis assessed whether stimulant adherence was
   associated with improvement in academic grade point average (GPA) among
   children diagnosed with and treated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD). Method: Medicaid claims were merged with academic
   records from Philadelphia public schools of Medicaid-eligible children
   in first through eighth grades who were diagnosed with ADHD and who had
   filled one or more stimulant prescription. Students diagnosed with
   mental retardation, autism, or speech, hearing, visual, or language
   impairments were excluded. Marking periods were scored for GPA (range:
   0-4.0) based on English, mathematics, social studies, and science grades
   and for stimulant adherence (medication possession ratio >= 0.70).
   Random and fixed-effects models estimated the effects of stimulant
   adherence on GPA, between all adherent and nonadherent marking periods
   in aggregate and within individual student's marking periods,
   respectively. Results: A total of 3,543 students contributed 29,992
   marking periods, of which 18.6% were adherent. Mean GPA was
   significantly higher during stimulant-adherent (2.18) than
   stimulant-nonadherent (1.99) marking periods in aggregate (p < .0001).
   The regression coefficient representing within-student association
   between stimulant adherence and GPA over time was 0.108 (p < .0001),
   indicating that adherence was associated with a 0.108 increase in GPA.
   In stratified analyses, analogous coefficients were 0.106 for boys,
   0.111 for girls, 0.078 for elementary students, and 0.118 for middle
   school students (all p < .0001). The association was stronger among
   students with (0.139) than without (0.088) comorbid disruptive behavior
   disorders (both p < .0001). Conclusions: Stimulant adherence, although
   found to be low among urban elementary and middle school students
   diagnosed with ADHD, was associated with a marginal improvement in GPA.

AB The social capital literature has focused on the functional and
   structural properties of social relations, partially neglecting the way
   in which they are experienced by individuals. Drawing on anthropological
   and social theory, this article distinguishes two ideal-typical forms of
   social capital - reciprocity and trust - based on the meaning of the
   social relations that embed them. Reciprocity is the type of social
   capital embedded within personal relations, triply defined in the
   factual, social and temporal dimensions by co-presence, reciprocity and
   memory, respectively. Trust is the type of social capital embedded
   within relations with strangers, defined by the condition of
   impersonality or anonymity. These two types of social capital cannot be
   reduced to extremes in a continuum, nor are they fungible, and while
   reciprocity is by definition particularistic ( this is the source of its
   strength as a linking mechanism), trust has a universalistic potential.
   Analytical and empirical implications of this distinction are outlined.

AB OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine associations between
   chronic preconception psychosocial and socioeconomic stress with
   bacterial vaginosis (BV) during pregnancy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression,
   childhood abuse and neglect, chronic discrimination, childhood
   socioeconomic status, potential confounders, and BV were assessed at
   14-16 and 19-22 weeks' gestation in a cohort of 312 pregnant women.
   RESULTS: Persistent BV (BV positive at both time points vs no BV at
   either time point) was associated with childhood sexual abuse (CSA),
   chronic discrimination, and lack of parental home ownership. These
   associations were still present after covarying for current perceived
   stress, socioeconomic status, and other potential confounders.
   CONCLUSION: There is evidence that BV during pregnancy is independently
   linked with early life psychosocial adversity, suggesting that a
   life-course perspective may be important in elucidating determinants of
   perinatal outcomes.

AB Background: Weight gain in young women suggests that childbearing may be
   an important contributor to the development of obesity in women.
   Depressive symptoms can interfere with resumption of normal activity
   levels following childbirth or with the initiation of or adherence to
   physical activity programs essential for losing pregnancy weight.
   Depression symptoms may function directly to promote weight gain through
   a physiologic mechanism. Obesity and its related insulin resistance may
   contribute to depressed mood physiologically. Although physical activity
   has well-established beneficial effects on weight management and
   depression, women tend to under participate in physical activity during
   childbearing years. Further, the mechanisms underpinning the interplay
   of overweight, obesity, physical activity, depression, and inflammatory
   processes are not clearly explained.
   Objectives: This report describes the theoretical rationale, design
   considerations, and cultural relevance for "Madres para la Salud"
   [Mothers for Health].
   Design and methods: Madres para la Salud is a 12 month prospective,
   randomized controlled trial exploring the effectiveness of a culturally
   specific intervention using "bouts" of physical activity to effect
   changes in body fat, systemic and fat tissue inflammation, and
   postpartum depression symptoms in sedentary postpartum Latinas.
   Summary: The significance and innovation of Madres para la Salud
   includes use of a theory-driven approach to intervention, specification
   and cultural relevance of a social support intervention, use of a
   Promotora model to incorporate cultural approaches, use of objective
   measures of physical activity in post partum Latinas women, and the
   examination of biomarkers indicative of cardiovascular risk related to
   physical activity behaviors in postpartum Latinas. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the social environment surrounding
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth may contribute to their higher rates of
   suicide attempts, controlling for individual-level risk factors.
   METHODS: A total of 31 852 11th grade students (1413 [4.4%] lesbian,
   gay, and bisexual individuals) in Oregon completed the Oregon Healthy
   Teens survey in 2006-2008. We created a composite index of the social
   environment in 34 counties, including (1) the proportion of same-sex
   couples, (2) the proportion of registered Democrats, (3) the presence of
   gay-straight alliances in schools, and (4) school policies
   (nondiscrimination and antibullying) that specifically protected
   lesbian, gay, and bisexual students.
   RESULTS: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth were significantly more likely
   to attempt suicide in the previous 12 months, compared with
   heterosexuals (21.5% vs 4.2%). Among lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth,
   the risk of attempting suicide was 20% greater in unsupportive
   environments compared to supportive environments. A more supportive
   social environment was significantly associated with fewer suicide
   attempts, controlling for sociodemographic variables and multiple risk
   factors for suicide attempts, including depressive symptoms, binge
   drinking, peer victimization, and physical abuse by an adult (odds
   ratio: 0.97 [95% confidence interval: 0.96-0.99]).
   CONCLUSIONS: This study documents an association between an objective
   measure of the social environment and suicide attempts among lesbian,
   gay, and bisexual youth. The social environment appears to confer risk
   for suicide attempts over and above individual-level risk factors. These
   results have important implications for the development of policies and
   interventions to reduce sexual orientation-related disparities in
   suicide attempts. Pediatrics 2011;127:896-903

AB The rhetorical techniques by which governments deny, justify, and
   qualify alleged instances of torture have been well documented.
   Sociologists, however, have neglected the social contexts in which
   officials confront allegations of torture, as well as officials' use of
   evidence to strengthen their own or weaken competing claims about
   torture. Relying on findings from a qualitative content analysis of
   seven Senate Armed Services Committee hearings held in 2004 on "detainee
   abuse" at Abu Ghraib prison, this article examines the processes by
   which hearing participants portrayed the violence there as an isolated
   incident. Building on James A. Holstein and Jaber F. Gubrium's (2003)
   "constructionist analytics," I examine the textual mediation of
   claims-making in the hearings, focusing on the interplay between textual
   realities of detainee abuse and the interpretive uses to which hearing
   participants put these realities. I show that developments in the
   textual environment of the hearings, particularly the development of a
   textually mediated vantage on events that "really occurred" throughout
   Afghanistan and Iraq, provided hearing participants with rich
   interpretive materials to downplay and rationalize instances of abuse
   that occurred in places other than Abu Ghraib prison. These findings
   suggest that official denial is sustained by diverse claims-making
   activities, including the production of a textual reality of human
   rights violations. The findings also extend the purview of social
   problems theory to account for the role of texts in the construction of
   social problems.

AB Objectives. We evaluated psychosocial, built-environmental, and
   policy-related correlates of adolescents' indoor tanning use.
   Methods. We developed 5 discrete data sets in the 100 most populous US
   cities, based on interviews of 6125 adolescents (aged 14-17 years) and
   their parents, analysis of state indoor tanning laws, interviews with
   enforcement experts, computed density of tanning facilities, and
   evaluations of these 3399 facilities' practices regarding access by
   youths. After univariate analyses, we constructed multilevel models with
   generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs).
   Results. In the past year, 17.1% of girls and 3.2% of boys had used
   indoor tanning. The GLMMs indicated that several psychosocial or
   demographic variables significantly predicted use, including being
   female, older, and White; having a larger allowance and a parent who
   used indoor tanning and allowed their adolescent to use it; and holding
   certain beliefs about indoor tanning's consequences. Living within 2
   miles of a tanning facility also was a significant predictor. Residing
   in a state with youth-access legislation was not significantly
   associated with use.
   Conclusions. Current laws appear ineffective in reducing indoor tanning;
   bans likely are needed. Parents have an important role in prevention
   efforts. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:930-938.

AB The industrialization of developing countries has fundamentally
   transformed work, employment, and labor for millions. Despite the
   industrialization of most of the developing world, we present evidence
   that Latin America has experienced stagnating industrial employment in
   the past few decades. Benefiting from recently available data on
   industrial employment as a percentage of total employment from 1980
   through 2006, we analyze fixed-effects models for 20 Latin American
   countries. Specifically, we examine three theoretical explanations:
   productivity/comparative advantage, institutionalism, and
   dependency/world-systems. Our analyses demonstrate that the prevailing
   productivity/comparative advantage explanation has limited value. By
   contrast, we find supportive evidence for a combination of institutional
   and dependency/world-systems variables. In particular, the stagnating
   industrial employment share in Latin American countries has been driven
   by the negative effects of (in order of magnitude) the Mercosur trade
   agreement, mineral and ore exports (as a percentage of total exports),
   the duration of the current political regime, military spending (as a
   percentage of GDP), and inward foreign direct investment flows (as a

   APIs with HNC using population-based data. METHODS: A total of 53,544
   HNC patients (4,711 = APIs) were identified from the California Cancer
   Registry from 1988 to 2007. Neighborhood (block-group-level) SES, based
   on composite Census 1990 and 2000 data, was calculated for each patient
   based on address at diagnosis, categorized into statewide quintiles, and
   collapsed into 2 groups for comparison (low SES = quintiles 1-3; high
   SES quintiles 4-5). DSS and OS were computed by the Kaplan-Meier method.
   Adjusted hazards ratios (HR) were estimated using Cox proportional
   hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among APIs, lower neighborhood SES
   was significantly associated with poorer DSS (HR range for oral cavity,
   oropharynx, or larynx/hypopharynx cancer, 1.07-1.34) and OS (HR,
   1.13-1.37) after adjusting for patient and tumor characteristics. Lower
   SES was significantly associated with poorer survival in API with all
   HNC sites combined: DSS HR: 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.08-1.48) and OS HR, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.16-1.45). CONCLUSIONS:
   Neighborhood SES was associated with longer DSS and OS in API with HNC.
   The effect of SES on HNC survival should be considered in future
   studies, and particular attention should be paid to clinical care of
   lower-SES HNC patients. Cancer 2011;117:1935-45. (C) 2010 American

AB BACKGROUND: Lack of health insurance is a key barrier to accessing care
   for chronic conditions and cancer screening. The influence of insurance
   type (private, public, none) on survivor-focused and general preventive
   health care in adult survivors of childhood cancer was examined.
   METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study is a retrospective cohort
   study of childhood cancer survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1986.
   Among 8425 adult survivors, the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence
   interval (CI) of receiving survivor-focused and general preventive
   health care were estimated for uninsured (n = 1390) and publicly insured
   (n = 640), compared with for the privately insured (n = 6395) RESULTS:
   Uninsured survivors were less likely than those privately insured to
   report a cancer-related visit (adjusted RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.75-0.91) or
   a cancer center visit (adjusted RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98). Uninsured
   survivors had lower levels of utilization in all measures of care in
   comparison with privately insured. In contrast, publicly insured
   survivors were more likely to report a cancer-related visit (adjusted
   RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.35) or a cancer center visit (adjusted RR,
   1.41; 95% CI, 1.18-1.70) than were privately insured survivors. Although
   publicly insured survivors had similar utilization of general health
   examinations, they were less likely to report a Papanicolaou test or a
   dental examinations CONCLUSIONS: Among this large, socioeconomically
   diverse cohort, publicly insured survivors utilize survivor-focused
   health care at rates at least as high as survivors with private
   insurance. Uninsured survivors have lower utilization of both
   survivor-focused and general preventive health care. Cancer

AB BACKGROUND: We evaluated the effect of marital status on risk of
   late-stage cutaneous melanoma diagnosis. METHODS: Information about
   melanoma patients was obtained from Surveillance Epidemiology and End
   Results (SEER), 1973-2006. A multivariable logistic regression model was
   used to estimate relative risks of late-stage disease at diagnosis.
   RESULTS: After exclusion criteria, 192,014 adult melanoma patients
   remained for analyses. After adjustment for age, race, year of
   diagnosis, tumor histology, anatomic site, socioeconomic status, and
   SEER site, the relationship between estimated risk of late-stage
   melanoma diagnosis and marital status was dependent on sex (P < .0001
   for interaction). Although unmarried patients had a higher risk of being
   diagnosed at a late stage among men and women, the magnitude of the
   effect varied by sex. Moreover, among married, single, and divorced or
   separated patients, men had more than a 50% increase in risk of
   late-stage diagnosis when compared with women. Widowed men and widowed
   women, however, were not statistically different in their stage at
   diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study are important and may be
   used by clinicians and public health practitioners interested in
   increasing the proportion of melanoma patients diagnosed at an early
   stage through screening, perhaps by specifically targeting unmarried
   individuals in addition to having broad-based skin cancer prevention
   programs. Cancer 2011;117:1984-93. (C) 2010 American Cancer Society.

AB Objective: To identify cultural differences in access to infertility
   care.
   Design: Cross-sectional, self-administered survey.
   Setting: University hospital-based fertility center.
   Patient(s): Thirteen hundred fifty consecutive women who were seen for
   infertility care.
   Intervention(s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Details about demographic characteristics,
   health care access, and treatment opinions based on patient race or
   ethnicity.
   Result(s): The median age of participants was 35 years; 41% were white,
   28% African American, 18% Hispanic, and 7% Asian. Compared with white
   women, African American and Hispanic women had been attempting to
   conceive for 1.5 years longer. They also found it more difficult to get
   an appointment, to take time off from work, and to pay for treatment.
   Forty-nine percent of respondents were concerned about the stigma of
   infertility, 46% about conceiving multiples, and 40% about financial
   costs. Disappointing one's spouse was of greater concern to
   African-American women, whereas avoiding the stigmatization of
   infertility was of greatest concern to Asian-American women.
   Conclusion(s): While the demand for infertility treatment increases in
   the United States, attention to cultural barriers to care and cultural
   meanings attributed to infertility should be addressed. Enhanced
   cultural competencies of the health care system need to be employed if
   equal access is to be realized as equal utilization for women of color
   seeking infertility care. (Fertil Steril (R) 2011; 95: 1943-9. (C)2011

   prior to the shooting, was examined along with two-month post-shooting
   data in a sample of 298 female students enrolled at the university at
   the time of the shootings. Linear regression analyses revealed
   consistent predictive roles for world assumptions pertaining to control
   and self-worth as well as family support. In addition, for those more
   severely exposed to the shooting, greater belief in a lack of control
   over outcomes appeared to increase vulnerability for post-trauma

AB Self, peer and teacher reports of social relationships were examined for
   60 high-functioning children with ASD. Compared to a matched sample of
   typical children in the same classroom, children with ASD were more
   often on the periphery of their social networks, reported poorer quality
   friendships and had fewer reciprocal friendships. On the playground,
   children with ASD were mostly unengaged but playground engagement was
   not associated with peer, self, or teacher reports of social behavior.
   Twenty percent of children with ASD had a reciprocated friendship and
   also high social network status. Thus, while the majority of high
   functioning children with ASD struggle with peer relationships in
   general education classrooms, a small percentage of them appear to have

AB This study revisits and extends a classic question in sociology and
   tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational
   social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at
   midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of
   intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during
   adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress
   and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological
   problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of
   prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This
   study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that
   breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and
   intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current
   class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological
   distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to
   resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the
   outcomes of study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has conceptualized sustainability as the environmental
   efficiency of wellbeing (EWEB). This concept takes into account the
   benefits societies are able to produce from their demands on the
   environment. Research along these lines indicates that countries vary
   widely in the efficiency with which they transform the Earth's resources
   into well-being. Here, we take up this finding as a puzzle to be
   explained. We construct a new measure of EWEB using the ecological
   footprint per capita (a measure of environmental consumption) and
   average life satisfaction (a measure of subjective well-being). We draw
   hypotheses from political economy, modernization, and sustainable
   consumption theories in the environmental social sciences. Using full
   information maximum likelihood estimation, we test the effects of
   climate, political, economic, and social factors on EWEB with a sample
   of 105 countries. Key findings include a negative quadratic effect of
   economic development on EWEB, a negative effect of income inequality,
   and a positive effect of social capital. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Background: Parks have been proposed as a feature of the built
   environment that may promote increased physical activity. Little, if
   any, research has investigated the role of the park social environment
   in promoting physical activity within parks, however.
   Purpose: To examine whether social capital is a collective feature of
   the park environment and whether it is associated with park use and
   park-based physical activity.
   Methods: Adult park users (n = 222) were surveyed in 27 neighborhood
   parks in New Orleans LA in July-August 2008. Direct observation methods
   were used to count the numbers and activity levels of all park users in
   these parks on weekdays during the hours of 4:00-7:00PM. Multilevel
   linear regression models were used to calculate the intraclass
   correlation (ICC), which measures the variation in perceived social
   capital attributable to differences among parks and to test whether park
   use and physical activity outcomes differed between parks with high
   versus low levels of social capital. Analyses were conducted in
   2009-2010.
   Results: In study parks, 27% of perceived social capital was
   attributable to differences among parks (ICC = 0.27). Parks with higher
   levels of social capital had higher daily numbers of observed park users
   (42.5 vs 12.1, p = 0.0044) and had more energy expended within the park
   (3200.3 vs 721.2 MET-minutes across all park users, p = 0.0087).
   Conclusions: Interventions to improve park social environments should be
   conducted to determine if they promote increased physical activity among
   park users. (Am J Prev Med 2011; 40(5): 522-529) (C) 2011 American

AB PURPOSE: Socioeconomic status (SES) as a risk factor for mortality in
   type 1 diabetes (T1D) has not been adequately studied prospectively.
   METHODS: Complete clinical and SES (income, education, occupation) data
   were available for 317 T1D participants in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology
   of Diabetes Complications Study within 4 years of age 28 (chosen to
   maximize income, education, and occupational potential, and to minimize
   the SES effect of advanced diabetes complications). Vital status was
   determined as of 1/1/2008.
   RESULTS: Over a median 16 years of follow-up, 34 (10.7%) deaths occurred
   (standardized mortality ratios [SMRs] = 4.1, 95% confidence interval
   [CI]: 2.7-5.5). SMRs did not differ from the general population for
   those in the highest education and income groups, whereas in those with
   low SES, SMRs were increased. Mortality rates were three times lower for
   individuals with a college degree versus without a college degree (p =
   0.004) and nearly four times lower for the highest income versus lower
   income groups (p = 0.04). In Cox models adjusting for diabetes duration
   and sex, education was the only SES measure predictive of mortality
   (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.0, 95% CI: 1.2-7.8), but lost significance after
   adjusting for HbA(1c), non-HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and
   microalbuminuria (HR = 2.1, 95% CI: 0.8-5.6).
   CONCLUSIONS: The strong association of education with mortality in T1D
   is partially mediated by better glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure
   control. Ann Epidemiol 2011;21:367-373. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

AB PURPOSE: To understand the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on the
   risk of complications in type 1 diabetes (T1D), we explored the
   relationship between SES and major diabetes complications in a
   prospective, observational T1D cohort study.
   METHODS: Complete data were available for 317 T1D persons within 4 years
   of age 28 (ages 24-32) in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes
   Complications Study. Age 28 was selected to maximize income, education,
   and occupation potential and to minimize the effect of advanced diabetes
   complications on SES.
   RESULTS: The incidences over 1 to 20 years' follow-up of end-stage renal
   disease and coronary artery disease were two to three times greater for
   T1D individuals without, compared with those with a college degree (p <
   .05 for both), whereas the incidence of autonomic neuropathy was
   significantly greater for low-income and/or nonprofessional participants
   (p < .05 for both). HbA(1c) was inversely associated only with income
   level. In sex- and diabetes duration-adjusted Cox models, lower
   education predicted end-stage renal disease (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; 95%
   confidence interval [95% CI], 1.1-7.7) and coronary artery disease (HR,
   2.5,95% CI, 1.3-4.9), whereas lower income predicted autonomic
   neuropathy (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9) and lower-extremity arterial
   disease (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-11.9).
   CONCLUSIONS: These associations, partially mediated by clinical risk
   factors, suggest that lower SES T1D individuals may have poorer
   self-management and, thus, greater complications from diabetes. Ann

AB Variation in the mu-opioid receptor gene has been associated with early
   social behavior in mice and rhesus macaques. The current study tested
   whether the functional OPRM1 A118G predicted various indices of social
   relations in children. The sample included 226 subjects of self-reported
   European ancestry (44% female; mean age 13.6, SD = 2.2) who were part of
   a larger representative study of children aged 9-17 years in rural North
   Carolina. Multiple aspects of recent (past 3 months) parent-child
   relationship were assessed using the Child and Adolescent Psychiatric
   Assessment. Parent problems were coded based upon a lifetime history of
   mental health problems, substance abuse, or criminality. Child genotype
   interacted with parent behavior such that there were no genotype
   differences for those with low levels of parent problems; however, when
   a history of parent problems was reported, the G allele carriers had
   more enjoyment of parent-child interactions (mean ratio (MR) = 3.5, 95%
   CI = 1.6, 8.0) and fewer arguments (MR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.1, 8.9). These
   findings suggest a role for the OPRM1 gene in the genetic architecture
   of social relations in humans. In summary, a variant in the mu-opioid
   receptor gene (118G) was associated with improved parent-child
   relations, but only in the context of a significant disruption in
   parental functioning. Neuropsychopharmacology (2011) 36, 1165-1170; doi:

AB It is proposed that citation contexts, the text surrounding references
   in scientific papers, be analyzed in terms of an expanded notion of
   sentiment, defined to include attitudes and dispositions toward the
   cited work. Maps of science at both the specialty and global levels are
   used as the basis of this analysis. Citation context samples are taken
   at these levels and contrasted for the appearance of cue word sets,
   analyzed with the aid of methods from corpus linguistics. Sentiments are
   shown to vary within a specialty and can be understood in terms of
   cognitive and social factors. Within-specialty and between-specialty
   co-citations are contrasted and in some cases suggest a correlation of
   sentiment with structural location. For example, the sentiment of
   "uncertainty" is important in interdisciplinary co-citation links, while
   "utility" is more prevalent within the specialty. Suggestions are made
   for linking sentiments to technical terms, and for developing sentiment
   "baselines" for all of science.

AB When something serves a function, it is easy to overlook its origins.
   The tendency is to proceed directly to function and retroactively
   construct a story about origin based on the function it fills. In this
   article, I address this problem of origins as it appears in the
   sociology of knowledge, using a case study of the publication of the 3rd
   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-III) in 1980. The manual revolutionized American psychiatry and the
   treatment of mental illness, because it served the function of
   classification that had become critical to the field of mental health by
   this time. But this function must be bracketed in order to reveal the
   "extra-functional" origins of the DSM-III. Using field theory, I argue
   that the manual was necessary for reasons other than the function it
   filled as a classification. Specifically, its origin lies in a series of
   conflicts among psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and clinical
   psychologists within the field of mental health, which followed in the
   wake of the collapse of psychoanalysis as the dominant treatment type
   for mental illness. I reveal the generative formula behind the
   production of the DSM-III, capturing a variety of social processes that
   influenced the format of the manual and made it a useful classification,
   but which are not reducible to function. In this way, I reproduce its
   raison d'etre in a manner similar to how the DSM-III appeared for the
   people who produced it. This focus on generative formulas offers the
   sociology of knowledge a way to capture the epistemic importance of a
   range of different social processes. Most importantly, it avoids the
   functional fallacy of reducing origin to function, and ignoring the idea
   that innovations might appear necessary even without clear recognition
   of their functional consequences.

AB Objective. To examine the independent and combined influence of
   individual-and community-level socioeconomic status (SES) measures on
   physical health status outcomes in people with self-reported arthritis.
   Methods. From 2004-2005, 968 participants completed a telephone survey
   assessing health status, chronic conditions, community characteristics,
   and sociodemographic variables. Individual-level SES measures used
   included homeownership, occupation (professional or not), educational
   attainment (less than high school, high school degree, and more than
   high school), and income (<$15,000, $15,000-$45,000, and >$45,000).
   Community poverty (2000 US Census block group percentage of individuals
   living below the poverty line [low, medium, and high]) was used as a
   community-level SES measure. Outcomes were physical functioning (Medical
   Outcomes Study Short Form 12 version 2 physical component summary
   [PCS]), functional disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]),
   and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Health-Related
   Quality of Life (HRQOL) Healthy Days physical and limited activity days,
   and were analyzed via multivariable regressions.
   Results. When entered separately, all individual-level SES variables
   were significantly (P < 0.01) associated with poorer PCS, HAQ, and CDC
   HRQOL scores. A higher magnitude of effect was seen for household
   income, specifically <$15,000 per year in final models with all 4
   individual SES measures and community poverty. The magnitude of effect
   for education is reduced and marginally significant for the PCS and
   number of physically unhealthy days. No effects were seen for
   occupation, homeownership, and community poverty.
   Conclusion. Findings confirm that after adjusting for important
   covariates, lower individual-and community-level SES measures are
   associated with poorer physical health outcomes, while household income
   is the strongest predictor (as measured by both significance and effect)
   of poorer health status in final models. Studies not having
   participant-reported income available should make use of other SES
   measures, as they do independently predict physical health.

AB Landscape offers a complex way of seeing, understanding, and shaping
   environments. In its Dutch origin, landschap meant to adapt cultural and
   natural processes to create new territory. As the word moved into
   English and other languages, it took on visual meaning as well. In
   several ways, landscape ecology helped return the word to its root
   meaning. Developments in urban ecology and landscape urbanism open new
   possibilities to restructure ecosystem understanding and city design.
   This essay will explore the concepts and evolution of landscape urbanism
   and urban ecology, as well as a possible synthesis-landscape ecological
   urbanism. Such a synthesis is important, given global trends in
   urbanization, population growth, climate change, energy use, and water

AB The extent to which the 21st century world will be "sustainable" depends
   in large part on the sustainability of cities. Early ideas on
   implementing sustainability focused on concepts of achieving stability,
   practicing effective management and the control of change and growth - a
   "fail-safe" mentality. More recent thinking about change, disturbance,
   uncertainty, and adaptability is fundamental to the emerging science of
   resilience, the capacity of systems to reorganize and recover from
   change and disturbance without changing to other states - in other
   words, systems that are "safe to fail." While the concept of resilience
   is intellectually intriguing, it remains largely unpracticed in
   contemporary urban planning and design. This essay discusses the theory
   of resilience as it applies to urban conditions, and offers a suite of
   strategies intended to build urban resilience capacity:
   multifunctionality, redundancy and modularization, (bio and social)
   diversity, multi-scale networks and connectivity, and adaptive planning
   and design. The strategies are discussed in the context of resilience
   theory and sustainability science, and are illustrated with innovative
   policies, projects, and programs selected from international examples.

AB During the past decades, there have been tremendous strides in the
   sophistication and power of analyzing, displaying, and interpreting
   spatial information, particularly Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
   The vast majority of this work has focused on the physical landscape
   where increasingly complex models are able to predict, describe, and
   assess the implications of future planning issues related to watersheds,
   urban growth, and other planning issues. However, this increasing
   sophistication in the power of landscape modeling remains disconnected
   from the sociopolitical realities of the communities and regions which
   are the subject of these studies. There is a research need to integrate
   public perceptions and attitudes with the type of information typically
   found in a landscape assessment. This essay reviews the different types
   of social and perceptual research that landscape planners have conducted
   and concludes with recommendations for research avenues that are
   necessary to describe the social landscape in spatial terms. Landscape
   planners in the future will need to know as much about the social
   landscape as they do the physical landscape before embarking on planning
   actions. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.

AB Archaeologists and anthropologists have long recognized that different
   cultural complexes may have distinct descent histories, but they have
   lacked analytical techniques capable of easily identifying such
   incongruence. Here, we show how Bayesian phylogenetic analysis can be
   used to identify incongruent cultural histories. We employ the approach
   to investigate Iranian tribal textile traditions.
   Methods: We used Bayes factor comparisons in a phylogenetic framework to
   test two models of cultural evolution: the hierarchically integrated
   system hypothesis and the multiple coherent units hypothesis. In the
   hierarchically integrated system hypothesis, a core tradition of
   characters evolves through descent with modification and characters
   peripheral to the core are exchanged among contemporaneous populations.
   In the multiple coherent units hypothesis, a core tradition does not
   exist. Rather, there are several cultural units consisting of sets of
   characters that have different histories of descent.
   Results: For the Iranian textiles, the Bayesian phylogenetic analyses
   supported the multiple coherent units hypothesis over the hierarchically
   integrated system hypothesis. Our analyses suggest that pile-weave
   designs represent a distinct cultural unit that has a different
   phylogenetic history compared to other textile characters.
   Conclusions: The results from the Iranian textiles are consistent with
   the available ethnographic evidence, which suggests that the commercial
   rug market has influenced pile-rug designs but not the techniques or
   designs incorporated in the other textiles produced by the tribes. We
   anticipate that Bayesian phylogenetic tests for inferring cultural units
   will be of great value for researchers interested in studying the
   evolution of cultural traits including language, behavior, and material
   culture.

AB Background: The universality of marriage in human societies around the
   world suggests a deep evolutionary history of institutionalized
   pair-bonding that stems back at least to early modern humans. However,
   marriage practices vary considerably from culture to culture, ranging
   from strict prescriptions and arranged marriages in some societies to
   mostly unregulated courtship in others, presence to absence of
   brideservice and brideprice, and polyandrous to polygynous unions. The
   ancestral state of early human marriage is not well known given the lack
   of conclusive archaeological evidence.
   Methodology: Comparative phylogenetic analyses using data from
   contemporary hunter-gatherers around the world may allow for the
   reconstruction of ancestral human cultural traits. We attempt to
   reconstruct ancestral marriage practices using hunter-gatherer
   phylogenies based on mitochondrial DNA sequences.
   Results: Arranged marriages are inferred to go back at least to first
   modern human migrations out of Africa. Reconstructions are equivocal on
   whether or not earlier human marriages were arranged because several
   African hunter-gatherers have courtship marriages. Phylogenetic
   reconstructions suggest that marriages in early ancestral human
   societies probably had low levels of polygyny (low reproductive skew)
   and reciprocal exchanges between the families of marital partners (i.e.,
   brideservice or brideprice).
   Discussion: Phylogenetic results suggest a deep history of regulated
   exchange of mates and resources among lineages that enhanced the
   complexity of human meta-group social structure with coalitions and
   alliances spanning across multiple residential communities.

AB Background: Adult height is a useful biological measure of long term
   population health and well being. We examined the cohort differences and
   socioeconomic patterning in adult height in low-to middle-income
   countries.
   Methods/Findings: We analyzed cross-sectional, representative samples of
   364538 women aged 25-49 years drawn from 54 Demographic and Health
   Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1994 and 2008. Linear multilevel
   regression models included year of birth, household wealth, education,
   and area of residence, and accounted for clustering by primary sampling
   units and countries. Attained height was measured using an adjustable
   measuring board. A yearly change in birth cohorts starting with those
   born in 1945 was associated with a 0.0138 cm (95% CI 0.0107, 0.0169)
   increase in height. Increases in heights in more recent birth year
   cohorts were largely concentrated in women from the richer wealth
   quintiles. 35 of the 54 countries experienced a decline (14) or
   stagnation (21) in height. The decline in heights was largely
   concentrated among the poorest wealth quintiles. There was a strong
   positive association between height and household wealth; those in two
   richest quintiles of household wealth were 1.988 cm (95% CI 1.886,
   2.090) and 1.018 cm (95% CI 0.916, 1.120) taller, compared to those in
   the poorest wealth quintile. The strength of the association between
   wealth and height was positive (0.05 to 1.16) in 96% (52/54) countries.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic inequalities in height remain persistent.
   Height has stagnated or declined over the last decades in low-to
   middle-income countries, particularly in Africa, suggesting worsening
   nutritional and environmental circumstances during childhood.

AB While agricultural landscape change over the course of 20th century has
   generally resulted in substantial gains in productivity, there is
   growing concern that the spatially uniform, functionally homogenized
   agricultural landscapes lack both environmental resilience and
   socioeconomic sustainability. The State of Iowa, USA provides a specific
   example where agriculture is highly developed and functions in a highly
   modified, human-dominated landscape; yet, few spatially explicit,
   comprehensive, and consistent data are available from which to assess
   change. To begin filling this gap, we digitized land cover information
   from aerial photographs for three Iowa townships (Orient Township in
   Adair County, Bloomfield Township in Clinton County, and Denmark
   Township in Emmet County) at five time steps between 1937 and 2002 and
   analyzed landscape change using a case study approach, landscape
   metrics, and graphical analysis. Results showed several consistent
   patterns across townships, including increased area devoted to row
   crops; decreased area devoted to small grains, hay, and grass: decreased
   numbers of farm fields concomitant with an increase in average field
   size; and a loss of rural infrastructure, such as farmsteads and rail
   lines. This generalized pattern describes an overall loss in
   agricultural landscape diversity over time, which is clearest in Denmark
   Township, while more detailed analysis reveals fine-scale
   diversification in Orient and Bloomfield Townships due to the adoption
   of conservation practices. A comparison of the three case study
   landscapes suggested that technology, economics, and federal farm
   policies, as meditated by variability in natural resource constraints,
   were drivers of the changes we observed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Social groups are fundamental building blocks of human societies. While
   our social interactions have always been constrained by geography, it
   has been impossible, due to practical difficulties, to evaluate the
   nature of this restriction on social group structure. We construct a
   social network of individuals whose most frequent geographical locations
   are also known. We also classify the individuals into groups according
   to a community detection algorithm. We study the variation of
   geographical span for social groups of varying sizes, and explore the
   relationship between topological positions and geographic positions of
   their members. We find that small social groups are geographically very
   tight, but become much more clumped when the group size exceeds about 30
   members. Also, we find no correlation between the topological positions
   and geographic positions of individuals within network communities.
   These results suggest that spreading processes face distinct structural
   and spatial constraints.

   among these variables. Results from a nationally (US) representative
   sample of 1472 employed individuals who were married with children
   indicate that the relations between work-to-family interference and
   family strain were stronger for individuals with lower household incomes
   than for those with higher household incomes. Furthermore, family strain
   was more strongly associated with family-to-work interference for
   individuals in low-income households. Household income did not moderate
   other relations examined in the study. Potential explanations for these
   moderating effects are discussed, along with their implications for the
   generalizability of findings in the work-family literature across
   contexts. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Over the past few decades, pediatric obesity has become a national
   epidemic. Up to one third of American children and adolescents currently
   meet criteria as overweight or obese, placing them at risk for obesity
   into adulthood. Multiple acute and chronic medical conditions are
   increasing in prevalence among youth due to their overweight status. In
   addition, obesity can result in serious problems related to psychosocial
   functioning. Efforts at prevention and treatment must address the
   multifactorial causes and consequences of pediatric obesity. Though many
   programs have been proposed, more work is needed in this area to
   successfully combat the problem of pediatric obesity.

AB The authors provide context for the three articles in the special
   section of this issue of Teaching Sociology on the topic of assessment.
   They provide a brief discussion of assessment in higher education today,
   supported by research conducted by the American Sociological Association
   from a survey of department chairs. These data indicate that most
   sociology departments are in fact conducting some form of assessment,
   although faculty members often are critical of these activities. The
   authors argue that sociologists are well situated to play a major role
   in carrying out assessment plans by virtue of their disciplinary
   training and skills in analyzing data. Further, the authors appeal to
   readers of Teaching Sociology that assessment and the scholarship of
   teaching and learning are inextricably linked and that it requires only
   a small step from conducting research on the scholarship of teaching and
   learning to doing assessment.

   of student learning through direct means of assessment. Value-added
   assessment, which aims to document the development of student learning
   from the beginning of the university experience to the end, has been
   called ''accountability's new frontier'' by the American Association of
   State Colleges and Universities. In response to an internal university
   initiative, the Department of Sociology at the University of North
   Dakota conducted a value-added assessment of the sociology major. In
   this article, the authors describe the value-added approach and its
   strengths and limitations, detail the means by which they assessed
   student knowledge in the sociology major, and review findings from their

AB The authors use sociology of the college classroom to analyze their
   experiences as feminists teaching sociology courses in the
   ''unconventional setting'' of prison. Reflective writing was used to
   chronicle experiences in the classes. They apply the concepts of doing
   gender, interaction order, and emotion work to the prison classroom.
   Based on their analysis, the authors examine the challenges and
   opportunities for critical education in prison. They aimed to use their
   teaching efforts to reach out to marginalized students and develop
   students' sociological imaginations to assist them through the
   challenges of confinement and reentry. The authors' analysis has
   implications for both prison education and higher education more
   broadly. They conclude that the success of prison education is dependent
   on establishing democratic classrooms that can enable students to see

AB The use of informal writing is common in sociology. This article
   presents one model for integrating informal written work with learning
   goals through a theoretical framework known as concentric thinking. More
   commonly referred to as 'the PTA model' because of the series of
   cognitive tasks it promotes-prioritization,translation, and analogy
   (PTA)-concentric thinking practiced through PTA provides a basis for
   structuring students' informal writing over the course of a semester.
   The authors present data in which students use PTA to assess their
   journal entries as text at the end of the semester. The students'
   informal responses to their own writing demonstrate the achievement of
   an important course goal-the development of sociological
   mindfulness-while they also reveal a deeper understanding of the
   important features of written work. The authors conclude that when
   informal writing is purposefully linked to a set of thinking goals and
   learning outcomes that are necessary to complete formal course
   requirements, it can serve as a powerful teaching tool to enhance both
   thinking and the ability to convey thoughts in writing. Structured in
   this way, informal written work can enable us to observe and assess
   changes in students' learning that would otherwise remain invisible, and
   it can alter our pedagogy in fundamental ways.

   characteristics of 542 Mexican and Puerto Rican consumers and expressed
   value judgments on their willingness to buy ethnic produce that has been
   recently introduced or new to market. This study was based on a primary
   data set collected from interviewing 542 Latino consumers (Mexico and
   Puerto Rico origin). A bilingual questionnaire was prepared in Spanish
   and English for Mexicans and Puerto Ricans in 16 states (Connecticut,
   Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
   Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode
   Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Virginia) and Washington, DC.
   Attributes that contributed toward willingness to buy new ethnic produce
   include respondent's expenditure on total produce and ethnic produce,
   perceptions such as the importance of store availability, language,
   willingness to buy locally grown, organic, genetically modified, and
   country of origin labeled produce items. This information will assist
   market intermediaries and farmers better understand Latino consumers'
   (Mexico and Puerto Rico group) perceptions and factors that drive
   willingness to buy ethnic produce that is recently introduced or new to

AB This article examines Florida Seminole corporations and tribal

   state-society divide. In 2007, the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired
   Hard Rock International, a major corporation with cafe's, hotels, and
   casinos around the globe. This $965-million deal, which remains the
   largest purchase of a corporation by an indigenous nation, created a
   media storm and extended Seminoles' geographical and financial reach far
   beyond reservation borders. Like Seminole casino gaming, which is
   possible only because of tribal sovereignty, the Hard Rock deal called
   attention to the fuzzy boundaries of indigenous corporate and national
   forms. This has been the case insofar as Seminoles' governmental statues
   as a sovereign undergirds some of their economic activities while
   impeding others. Seminole corporations and tribal gaming show the
   project of differentiating economy from government and family to be a
   cultural and historical one that creates distinct yet broadly relevant
   dilemmas for indigenous peoples in the United States.

AB The origin of concessionary politics that shape forest use and
   management in equatorial Africa can be traced to precolonial and
   colonial practices. Yet these political processes are constantly being
   reinvented, and their consequences for ecological and social systems
   reach far into the future. Gleaned from fieldwork among residents of a
   protected area and logging zone in Central African Republic (CAR), this
   concept relates village-level analysis of traditional governance to
   national and international adoptions of legal concessions of land for
   the management of natural resources. Constituted through specific phases
   of prospecting, delimiting, and negotiating control over labor and
   territory, concessions can be characterized by particular cultural
   practices: negotiation at local or regional levels of concessionary
   rights that have been formally ceded at a national level; patron-client
   relationships involving expatriates and/or traditional authorities that
   mediate or even replace governance by the nation-state; and fields of
   territorialized identity politics that tend toward relationships of
   rivalry and alliance across groups for redistribution of wealth through
   services, gifts, and performances of collective contestation or
   celebration. Through interpretive analysis of a national holiday
   celebration in CAR, I explore the legacies and transformations in
   concessionary politics shaping conservation and logging in that region
   more broadly and consider their implications for changing environmental
   governance in equatorial Africa.

AB Indicators are rapidly multiplying as tools for assessing and promoting
   a variety of social justice and reform strategies around the world.
   There are indicators of rule of law, indicators of violence against
   women, and indicators of economic development, among many others.
   Indicators are widely used at the national level and are increasingly
   important in global governance. There are increasing demands for
   "evidence-based" funding for nongovernmental organizations and for the
   results of civil society organizations to be quantifiable and
   measurable. The reliance on simplified numerical representations of
   complex phenomena began in strategies of national governance and
   economic analysis and has recently migrated to the regulation of
   nongovernmental organizations and human rights. The turn to indicators
   in the field of global governance introduces a new form of knowledge
   production with implications for relations of power between rich and
   poor nations and between governments and civil society. The deployment
   of statistical measures tends to replace political debate with technical
   expertise. The growing reliance on indicators provides an example of the
   dissemination of the corporate form of thinking and governance into
   broader social spheres.

AB In this article I examine the new forms of citizenship that have
   resulted from the connections between the emergence of new corporate
   ethics (including fair trade) and outsourcing. The process I call
   "supply-chain citizenship" is based on a collection of long-distance

   transnational corporations. I analyze the trend toward what the New York
   Times recently called "activi[st]-capitalism" and how this move is
   changing relationships between corporations and consumers and consumers
   and people working along global corporate supply chains. This study
   builds on my previous research on workers' bodies, citizenship, and
   sovereignty, now examined along global corporate supply axes. I observe
   the kinds of political mobilization that are coming into being as the
   result of links between corporate governance, negotiations between
   corporate and nation-state sovereignty, and the related setting and
   enforcement of global labor and environmental standards. In my

AB The rapid expansion of ethanol plants across the U.S. state of Iowa has
   fueled debate about the burdens and benefits of local (in-state
   investors) versus non-local ownership of bio-refineries. Central to
   these concerns is the extent to which non-local, absentee owners might
   reap the benefits of the ethanol industry at the expense of local
   communities. A key argument within the rural development literature is
   that local ownership of firms has a positive effect on the long-term
   well-being and sustainability of the communities in which they are
   situated. This literature asserts that firms operate at different
   scales, with local firms embedded within local supply chains and
   institutions, and non-local firms embedded within national and
   international networks and institutions. Conversely, there is a growing
   body of work within the alternative agrifood systems literature that
   cautions against the 'local trap'; the assumption that the local scale
   is inherently good and therefore advantageous. Despite this broader
   debate, the literature on local ownership and renewable energy remains
   limited. This paper addresses this gap by drawing on case study research
   of the community effects of ethanol plant ownership structure from the
   perspective of community leaders. My findings suggest that differences
   between the structure and effects of local versus non-local ownership of
   firms on communities are rather more ambiguous than the literature
   asserts. Therefore, assumptions about the benefits of local ownership
   may be overstated and concepts of 'local' and 'non-local' may be
   inadequate for considering firm outcomes on the civic welfare and
   socioeconomic wellbeing of a community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB U.S. government policies and programs promoting agricultural bioenergy
   development have tended to prioritize national goals of energy security,
   economic growth and environmental improvement, while marginalizing the
   local experiences, views and concerns of farmers and rural communities
   that will produce the needed energy crops. Based on qualitative field
   interviews with 48 farming and non-farming participants in two
   switch-grass bioenergy projects (in southern Iowa and in northeastern
   Kentucky), this paper examines local perspectives on the potential
   opportunities, drawbacks, and tradeoffs of the emerging agricultural
   bioeconomy for rural people and places. Individual project participants
   expressed both positive and negative perceptions about the impacts of
   the agricultural bioeconomy, with local and regional revitalization
   being the benefit most desired and also least expected. Skepticism about
   the social impacts of the agricultural bioeconomy often stemmed from
   observations of corporate control in agriculture more generally. This
   research suggests that narrow instrumental views of farmers and rural
   communities as technical providers of energy feedstocks can be
   misleading, because they omit the local social and cultural context that
   complicates rural responses and receptivity to the development of the
   agricultural bioeconomy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Preterm children are at risk for behavior problems. Studies
   examining contributions of intellectual and environmental factors to
   behavior outcomes in preterm children are mixed.
   Aims: (1) To identify the nature of maladaptive behaviors in preterm
   children age 9 to 16 years born across the spectrum of gestational age
   and birth weight (BW). (2) To examine contributions of BW as a
   biological factor, socioeconomic status as an environmental factor, and
   intelligence quotient (IQ) as indicative of intellectual ability to
   behavior outcomes.
   Method: Using the Child Behavior Checklist, parent reports of behavior
   for 63 preterm children (gestational age 24 to < 36 weeks) were compared
   to 29 full term children of similar age, gender and socioeconomic
   status. Multiple regression models evaluated effects of prematurity,
   socioeconomic status, and intellectual ability on behavioral symptom
   scores.
   Results: Preterm children had higher total and internalizing problem
   scores compared to full term children. They also had lower IQ. BW was a
   significant predictor of total and internalizing behavior problems.
   Among the syndrome scales, anxious/depressed and attention problems were
   elevated. Socioeconomic status did not contribute to behavior scores. IQ
   contributed to total, but not to internalizing or externalizing, scores.
   IQ contributed to attention problems, but not to anxious/depressed
   scores.
   Conclusion: Preterm children had increased behavior problems, especially
   symptoms of inattention and anxiety. Lower BW predicted more behavior
   problems. IQ acted as a mediator between BW and attention scores, but
   not anxiety scores. These findings alert health care providers to assess
   anxiety in all preterm children regardless of intellectual ability and
   additional study on the influence of intellectual ability on behavioral
   outcomes in preterm children is needed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

   Americans, Mexican Americans, and refugees and immigrants from the
   former Soviet Union.
   MEASUREMENTS
   Participants responded to yes-or-no questions about the nature and
   causes of normal memory loss and AD and provided information on
   ethnicity, age, sex, acculturation, and experience with AD.
   RESULTS
   Groups held a common model of AD as a brain-based disease reflecting
   irreversible cognitive decline. Higher levels of acculturation predicted
   greater knowledge of AD. Russian speakers favored biological over
   psychological models of the disease. Groups also held a common model of
   normal memory loss, including the important belief that "normal"
   forgetting involves eventual recall of the forgotten material.
   CONCLUSION
   Popular models of memory loss and AD confirm that patients and
   clinicians are speaking the same "language" in their discussions of
   memory loss and AD. Nevertheless, the presence of coherent models of
   memory loss and AD, and the unequal distribution of that knowledge
   across groups, suggests that clinicians should include wider circles of
   patients' families and friends in their consultations. These results
   frame knowledge as distributed across social groups rather than simply
   the possession of individual minds.

AB In 2006, the Federal Collaboration on Health Disparities Research
   (FCHDR) identified the built environment as a priority for eliminating
   health disparities, and charged the Built Environment Workgroup with
   identifying ways to eliminate health disparities and improve health
   outcomes.
   Despite extensive research and the development of a new conceptual
   health factors framework, gaps in knowledge exist in areas such as
   disproportionate environmental and community hazards, individual and
   cumulative risks, and other factors.
   The FCHDR provides the structure and opportunity to mobilize and partner
   with built environment stakeholders, federal partners, and interest
   groups to develop tools, practices, and policies for translating and
   disseminating the best available science to reduce health disparities.

AB Objectives. We sought to identify and characterize areas with high rates
   of major trauma events in 9 diverse cities and counties in the United
   States and Canada.
   Methods. We analyzed a prospective, population-based cohort of injured
   individuals evaluated by 163 emergency medical service agencies
   transporting patients to 177 hospitals across the study sites between
   December 2005 and April 2007. Locations of injuries were geocoded,
   aggregated by census tract, assessed for geospatial clustering, and
   matched to sociodemographic measures. Negative binomial models were used
   to evaluate population measures.
   Results. Emergency personnel evaluated 8786 major trauma patients, and
   data on 7326 of these patients were available for analysis. We
   identified 529 (13.7%) census tracts with a higher than expected
   incidence of major trauma events. In multivariable models, trauma events
   were associated with higher unemployment rates, larger percentages of
   non-White residents, smaller percentages of foreign-born residents,
   lower educational levels, smaller household sizes, younger age, and
   lower income levels.
   Conclusions. Major trauma events tend to cluster in census tracts with
   distinct population characteristics, suggesting that social and
   contextual factors may play a role in the occurrence of significant
   injury events. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:669-677.

AB Although evidence has suggested that synchronized movement can foster
   cooperation, the ability of synchrony to increase costly altruism and to
   operate as a function of emotional mechanisms remains unexplored. We
   predicted that synchrony, due to an ability to elicit low-level
   appraisals of similarity, would enhance a basic compassionate response
   toward victims of moral transgressions and thereby increase subsequent
   costly helping behavior on their behalf. Using a manipulation of
   rhythmic synchrony, we show that synchronous others are not only
   perceived to be more similar to oneself but also evoke more compassion
   and altruistic behavior than asynchronous others experiencing the same
   plight. These findings both support the view that a primary function of
   synchrony is to mark others as similar to the self and provide the first
   empirical demonstration that synchrony-induced affiliation modulates
   emotional responding and altruism.

   longitudinal changes in self-reported adaptive socioemotional
   functioning. Data were collected from participants undergoing 3 months
   of intensive meditation training in an isolated retreat setting (Retreat
   1) and a wait-list control group that later underwent identical training
   (Retreat 2). A 32-min response inhibition task (RIT) was designed to
   assess sustained self-regulatory control. Adaptive functioning (AF) was
   operationalized as a single latent factor underlying self-report
   measures of anxious and avoidant attachment, mindfulness, ego
   resilience, empathy, the five major personality traits (extroversion,
   agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness to
   experience), difficulties in emotion regulation, depression, anxiety,
   and psychological well-being. Participants in Retreat I improved in Rh T
   performance and AF over time whereas the controls did not. The control
   participants later also improved on both dimensions during their own
   retreat (Retreat 2). These improved levels of RIT performance and AF
   were sustained in follow-up assessments conducted approximately 5 months
   after the training. Longitudinal dynamic models with combined data from
   both retreats showed that improvement in RIT performance during training
   influenced the change in AF over time, which is consistent with a key
   claim in the Buddhist literature that enhanced capacity for
   self-regulation is an important precursor of changes in emotional
   well-being.

AB Appraisal theories of emotion propose that the emotions people
   experience correspond to their appraisals of their situation. In other
   words, individual differences in emotional experiences reflect differing
   interpretations of the situation. We hypothesized that in similar
   situations, people in individualist and collectivist cultures experience
   different emotions because of culturally divergent causal attributions
   for success and failure (i.e., agency appraisals). In a test of this
   hypothesis, American and Japanese participants recalled a personal
   experience (Study 1) or imagined themselves to be in a situation (Study
   2) in which they succeeded or failed, and then reported their agency
   appraisals and emotions. Supporting our hypothesis, cultural differences
   in emotions corresponded to differences in attributions. For example, in
   success situations, Americans reported stronger self-agency emotions
   (e.g., proud) than did Japanese, whereas Japanese reported a stronger
   situation-agency emotion (lucky). Also, cultural differences in
   attribution and emotion were largely explained by differences in
   self-enhancing motivation. When Japanese and Americans were induced to
   make the same attribution (Study 2), cultural differences in emotions
   became either nonsignificant or were markedly reduced.

   exposed cohort. Methods: We analyzed longitudinal (13 years) health
   survey data and a cross-sectional behavioral health survey from the
   Drake Health Registry Study. Construct validity of the behavioral health
   survey scales was evaluated using factor analysis. Initial compliance
   and repeated adherence were examined in separate logistic regression
   models. Results: "Barriers to screening" and "social influence" were
   associated with initial participation. Lower or no alcohol consumption,
   comorbidities, worry that screening would find bladder cancer, and ease
   of arranging schedules were associated with continued adherence.
   Conclusions: Factors affecting adherence with bladder cancer screening
   change for initial participation and for continued adherence. To enhance
   overall adherence, specific strategies should be implemented when
   initiating a screening program and revised accordingly over time.

   fifth grade and to examine the ways in which participation influences
   sex differences in the trajectories of body mass index (BMI) through the
   eighth grade.
   Design: Longitudinal, secondary data analysis.
   Setting: Sample of low-income US children who entered kindergarten in
   1998.
   Participants: Girls (n = 574) and boys (n = 566) from low-income
   families who participated in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study,
   Kindergarten Cohort.
   Main Exposure: Participation in the NSLP.
   Main Outcome Measures: Temporary and persistent patterns of NSLP
   participation, and age-specific and sex-specific BMI raw scores
   calculated at 5 data points.
   Results: Among the low-income children who attended schools that
   participated in the NSLP, both the children who persistently
   participated in the program and those who temporarily participated in
   the program displayed similar socioeconomically disadvantaged factors.
   Nonlinear mixed models indicated a larger rate of change in BMI (ie, an
   increase) among low-income, participating girls than among low-income,
   nonparticipating girls; however, mean BMIs did not significantly differ
   between low-income girls who participated and those who did not
   participate. No significant differences were observed among low-income
   boys.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that participation in the NSLP is
   associated with rapid weight gain for low-income girls but not for
   low-income boys.

AB Little is known about the levels of air pollution at public parks where
   regular exercise takes place or in park-adjacent neighborhoods where
   people have easy access to parks. In this study we investigated the
   ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
   fine particulate (PM2.5) and ozone (O-3) at public parks and in
   park-adjacent neighborhoods for metropolitan Los Angeles. Socioeconomic
   and racial-ethnic inequalities in exposure to the three criteria
   pollutants were also investigated using multiple linear regression
   models. In addition, differences in inhalation doses from breathing the
   three + criteria pollutants were investigated for the top and bottom
   quartile racial composition in the parks and neighborhoods. Our research
   showed that although public parks had on average the lowest pollutant
   concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5, they had relatively high O-3
   concentrations. Park-adjacent neighborhoods, by contrast, had the
   highest NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, but the lowest O-3 concentrations.
   Higher exposures to NO2 and PM2.5 were systematically identified for the
   lower socioeconomic position or higher minority population
   neighborhoods. For children and adolescents aged 6-15 engaging in high
   and moderate intensity activities in and around public parks, those from
   the top quartile of primarily Hispanic neighborhoods had much higher
   (63%) inhaled doses of NO2 compared to the bottom quartile counterpart.
   PM2.5 showed a similar but less pronounced pattern of inhalation doses.
   Evidence of socioeconomic and racial-ethnic gradients was found in air
   pollution exposure and inhalation doses in and around the urban parks in
   Los Angeles. This suggests that patterns of exposure inequality found in
   other environmental justice research are present in exposures in and
   around urban parks. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Cooperation is ubiquitous in the natural world. What seems nonsensical
   is why natural selection favors a behavior whereby individuals would
   lose out by benefiting their competitor. This conundrum, for almost half
   a century, has puzzled scientists and remains a fundamental problem in
   biology, psychology, and economics. In recent years, the explanation
   that punishment can maintain cooperation has received much attention.
   Individuals who punish noncooperators thrive when punishment does not
   entail a cost to the punisher. However when punishment is costly,
   cooperation cannot be preserved. Most literature on punishment fails to
   consider that punishers may act corruptly by not cooperating when
   punishing noncooperators. No research has considered that there might be
   power asymmetries between punishers and nonpunishers that turn one of
   these type of individuals more or less susceptible to experiencing
   punishment. Here, we formulate a general game allowing corruption and
   power asymmetries between punishers and nonpunishers. We show that
   cooperation can persist if punishers possess power and use it to act
   corruptly. This result provides a new interpretation of recent data on
   corrupt policing in social insects and the psychology of power and
   hypocrisy in humans. These results suggest that corruption may play an
   important role in maintaining cooperation in insects and human
   societies. In contrast with previous research, we contend that costly
   punishment can be beneficial for social groups. This work allows us to
   identify ways in which corruption can be used to the advantage of a
   society.

AB The production of public goods by the contribution of individual
   volunteers is a social dilemma because an individual that does not
   volunteer can benefit from the public good produced by the contributions
   of others. Therefore it is generally believed that public goods can be
   produced only in the presence of repeated interactions (which allow
   reciprocation, reputation effects and punishment) or relatedness (kin
   selection). Cooperation, however, often occurs in the absence of
   iterations and relatedness. We show that when the production of a public
   good is a Volunteer's Dilemma, in which a fixed number of cooperators is
   necessary to produce the public good, cooperators and defectors persist
   in a mixed equilibrium, without iterations and without relatedness. This
   mixed equilibrium is absent in the N-person Prisoner's Dilemma, in which
   the public good is a linear function of the individual contributions. We
   also show that the Prisoner's Dilemma and the Volunteer's Dilemma are
   the two opposite extremes of a general public goods game, and that all
   intermediate cases can have a mixed equilibrium like the Volunteer's
   Dilemma. The coexistence of cooperators and defectors, therefore, is a
   typical outcome of most social dilemmas, which requires neither
   relatedness nor iterations.

AB Study Objectives: To advance our understanding of the interplay of

   African/Caribbean immigrant employees in long-term health care have
   shorter sleep duration than non-Hispanic white employees, and that low
   education, low income, and occupational exposures including night work
   and job strain account for some of the African/Caribbean immigrant-white
   difference in sleep duration.
   Design: Cross-sectional
   Setting: Four extended care facilities in Massachusetts, United States
   Participants: 340 employees in extended care facilities Measurements and
   Results: Sleep duration was assessed with wrist actigraphy for a mean of
   6.3 days. In multivariable regression modeling controlling for gender
   and age, African/Caribbean immigrants slept 64.4 fewer minutes (95% CI:
   -81.0, -47.9) per night than white participants; additional control for
   education and income reduced the racial gap to 50.9 minutes (-69.2,
   -32.5); additional control for the occupational factors of hours worked
   per week and working the night shift reduced the racial gap to 37.7
   minutes (-57.8, -17.6).
   Conclusions: This study provides support for the hypothesis that
   socioeconomic and occupational characteristics explain some of the
   African/Caribbean immigrant-white difference in sleep duration in the
   United States, especially among health care workers.

AB Objective. Understanding the factors that contribute to mortality and
   survival is central to health outcome research. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate the following: (1) differences in survival
   status by ethnicity and neighborhood median income level; and (2)
   individual- and neighborhood-level factors influencing cervical cancer
   survival.
   Methods. This study was based on data from 1811 cervical cancer cases
   obtained through the California Cancer Surveillance Program. The
   dependent variable was days of survival from date of cancer diagnosis.
   Zip code-based neighborhood-level variables were obtained from Census
   2000 data.
   Results. Ethnicity was significantly associated with survival (chi(2) =
   20.58: p < 0.001), with African-Americans showing the shortest survival.
   The 5-year survival rates of European-, African-, Latino-, and
   Asian-American patients for all stages combined were 85%, 75%, 85%, and
   84%, respectively. Differences in survival between high- and low-income
   regions were not observed. However, when ethnicity was considered,
   Asian-Americans who lived in high-income regions showed longer survival
   than their low-income community counterparts (chi(2) = 4.531; p < 0.05).
   The multilevel model demonstrated ethnicity, age at diagnosis, and
   cancer stage stratified by surgery to be significantly associated with
   cervical cancer survival at the individual level. At the neighborhood
   level, residing in neighborhoods with a high proportion of
   African-Americans increased the risk of death by 1%.
   Conclusions. The neighborhood context may be an influential contributor
   to survival for Asian- and African-Americans specifically. These
   findings necessitate closer examination of the unique contribution of
   ethnicity and neighborhood on cancer survival to disentangle the role of
   ethnic group membership, socio-ecological contexts and stress, and
   medical factors on disease outcomes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The quality of the social environment can have profound influences on
   the development and activity of neural systems with implications for
   numerous behavioral and physiological responses, including the
   expression of emotionality. Though social experiences occurring early in
   development may be particularly influential on the developing brain,
   there is continued plasticity within these neural circuits amongst
   juveniles and into early adulthood. In this review, we explore the
   evidence derived from studies in rodents which illustrates the social
   modulation during development of neural systems, with a particular
   emphasis on those systems in which a long-term effect is observed. One
   possible explanation for the persistence of dynamic changes in these
   systems in response to the environment is the involvement of epigenetic
   mechanisms, and here we discuss recent studies which support the role of
   these mechanisms in mediating the link between social experiences, gene
   expression, neurobiological changes, and behavioral variation. This
   literature raises critical questions about the interaction between
   neural systems, the concordance between neural and behavioral changes,
   sexual dimorphism in effects, the importance of considering individual
   differences in response to the social environment, and the potential of
   an epigenetic perspective in advancing our understanding of the pathways
   leading to variations in mental health. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Many comparative political economists hold that market performance
   depends on the presence of institutional complementarities. Some argue
   that when institutions reinforce similar incentives markets work best.
   Others disagree and argue that for markets to function well institutions
   must compensate for each other's shortcomings rather than reinforce each
   other's incentives. This paper uses evidence from the US financial
   crisis of 2008 to adjudicate this debate. It argues that different types
   of institutional complementarities are necessary in combination to
   ensure market stability and successful economic performance. Without
   such balance, complementarities that are beneficial for a while may go
   wrong later. In this regard, the paper also draws attention to the
   dynamic and historically specific nature of institutional
   complementarities.

AB Socially responsible investing (SRI) mutual funds are becoming a popular
   investment option for investors. Stemming from religious origins, these
   funds deliberately inject moral concerns into financial decision making.
   Focusing on religiously affiliated mutual funds, I garner empirical
   evidence to investigate whether the moral orientation of investors
   impacts their financial market behaviour. I partition mutual funds into
   religious SRI, religious non-SRI, secular SRI and conventional funds and
   look for differences in levels of fund asset stability using data from
   the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) from 1991 to 2007.
   This stability refers to the extent to which investors hold on to their
   fund shares with little regard to past return performance and over all
   fund flow volatility. Religious SRI assets are found to be the most
   stable fund category and I adjudicate whether the structural
   characteristics of religious groups or the moral orientation of
   religious investors best explains this empirical finding.

AB A major paradox in U. S. sociology has been the relative dearth of
   studies in recent. years on the black working class, despite the
   historic importance of this class in African American and U. S.
   historical development. Central to this anomaly have been
   "underclass"-informed studies that have artificially defined the black
   poor, especially black women, as distinct from the working class, and
   the elite-focused, new urban politics literature that has generally
   ignored the role of the black working class in contemporary urban
   economic and political change. The class-relational, historically and
   geographically sensitive understanding of class embedded in black urban
   regime theory, combined with theoretical and empirical "uplinks" to
   extra-local economic and political changes and influences, provides an
   effective strategy to redirect sociological research back toward the
   black working class.

AB Research on neighborhoods and health has been growing. However, studies
   have not investigated the association of specific neighborhood measures,
   including socioeconomic and built environments, with cancer incidence or
   outcomes. We developed the California Neighborhoods Data System (CNDS),
   an integrated system of small area-level measures of socioeconomic and
   built environments for California, which can be readily linked to
   individual-level geocoded records. The CNDS includes measures such as
   socioeconomic status, population density, racial residential
   segregation, ethnic enclaves, distance to hospitals, walkable
   destinations, and street connectivity. Linking the CNDS to geocoded
   cancer patient information from the California Cancer Registry, we
   demonstrate the variability of CNDS measures by neighborhood
   socioeconomic status and predominant race/ethnicity for the 7,049
   California census tracts, as well as by patient race/ethnicity. The CNDS
   represents an efficient and cost-effective resource for cancer
   epidemiology and control. It expands our ability to understand the role
   of neighborhoods with regard to cancer incidence and outcomes. Used in
   conjunction with cancer registry data, these additional contextual
   measures enable the type of transdisciplinary, "cells-to-society"
   research that is now being recognized as necessary for addressing
   population disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes.

AB Human economies and natural ecosystems (natural economies) share
   fundamental properties. Both are adaptive, cooperative systems where
   agents-individuals and groups-compete for locally limiting resources
   needed to live and reproduce. Successful competitors differentially
   propagate better knowledge and technology for making a living.
   Competition has favored innovations, diversification (of species or
   human occupations), higher productivity, greater interdependence among
   economic agents, and the emergence of more powerful, interactive
   individuals and groups, so productivity, diversity, and scales of
   activity have tended to increase over time. Because economic innovations
   accumulate, these trends have accelerated over time in both natural and
   human economies.
   The shift from mainly genetic origin and transmission of adaptation in
   natural economies to mainly cultural adaptation among human beings has
   accelerated these trends dramatically, and made the modern human economy
   extraordinarily dependent on nonrenewable resources and much more
   vulnerable to monopolies and tragedies of the commons, internally
   generated threats less common or less destructive in natural economies.
   In nature, these internal disruptions are overcome by the advent of new
   agents, often not involved in causing these disruptions, that compete in
   new ways. We argue that a comparable shift in societal norms, which
   govern individual and group status in human society, is needed to keep
   monopolies and tragedies of the commons from harming both the human
   economy and the ecosystems on which we depend.

AB We found that judgments of a perceptually ambiguous social category,
   sexual orientation, varied as a function of a perceptually obvious
   social category, race. Sexual orientation judgments tend to exploit a
   heuristic of gender inversion that often promotes accuracy. We predicted
   that an orthogonal social category that is itself gendered, race, would
   impact both sexual orientation categorizations and their accuracy.
   Importantly, overlaps in both the phenotypes and stereotypes associated
   with specific race and sex categories (e.g., the categories Black and
   Men and the categories Asian and Women) lead race categories to be
   decidedly gendered. Therefore, we reasoned that race categories would
   bias judgments of sexual orientation and their accuracy because of the
   inherent gendered nature. Indeed, both gay and straight perceivers in
   the United States were more likely to judge targets to be gay when
   target race was associated with gender-atypical stereotypes or
   phenotypes (e.g., Asian Men). Perceivers were also most accurate when
   judging the sexual orientation of the most strongly gender-stereotyped
   groups (i.e., Asian Women and Black Men), but least accurate when
   judging the sexual orientation of counter-stereotypical groups (i.e.,
   Asian men and Black Women). Signal detection analyses confirmed that
   this pattern of accuracy was achieved because of heightened sensitivity
   to cues in groups who more naturally conform to gendered stereotypes
   (Asian Women and Black Men). Implications for social perception are
   discussed.

AB Reality monitoring, or the ability to discriminate internal from
   external information present in short-term memory, is relevant in the
   study of schizophrenia. Previous research has linked monitoring
   impairments with psychotic symptoms and certain forms of communication
   disturbance. The focus of the present study was to test the hypothesis
   that there would be specific relationships between reality monitoring in
   patients with schizophrenia and current and pre-morbid social
   functioning, beyond the effects of general verbal ability. Fifty
   outpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were assessed
   for internal/external reality monitoring deficits, general verbal
   intelligence, and both current and pre-morbid social functioning.
   Associations between these variables were assessed. Exploratory analyses
   also were conducted to determine whether specific types of reality
   monitoring errors were related to social functioning. Results showed
   that (a) overall accuracy in reality monitoring was related to
   pre-morbid social functioning beyond the effects of verbal ability, (b)
   sensitivity to old versus new information in reality monitoring was
   related to current social functioning, and (c) a say-report-think
   reality monitoring error was significantly associated with pre-morbid
   social functioning. The results support the hypothesis of an association
   between reality monitoring sensitivity and social functioning. (C) 2010

AB Two distinct views are evident in research on how rural communities in
   developing countries cope with extreme weather events brought by climate
   change: (i) that the resource-reliant poor are acutely vulnerable and
   need external assistance to prepare for such events, and (ii) that
   climate-related shocks can offer windows of opportunity in which latent
   local adaptive capacities are triggered, leading to systemic
   improvement. Results from a longitudinal study in a Tawahka community in
   Honduras before and after Hurricane Mitch (1994-2002) indicate that
   residents were highly vulnerable to the hurricane-due in part to
   previous development assistance-and that the poorest households were the
   hardest hit. Surprisingly, however, the disaster enabled the poor to
   initiate an institutional change that led to more equitable land
   distribution, slowed primary forest conversion, and positioned the
   community well to cope with comparable flooding occurring 10 y later.
   The study provides compelling evidence that communities can seize on the
   window of opportunity created by climate-induced shocks to generate
   sustained social-ecological improvement, and suggests that future
   interventions should foster local capacities for endogenous
   institutional change to enhance community resilience to climate shocks.

AB Successful animal systems often manage risk through synchronous behavior
   that spontaneously arises without leadership. In critical human systems
   facing risk, such as financial markets or military operations, our
   understanding of the benefits associated with synchronicity is nascent
   but promising. Building on previous work illuminating commonalities
   between ecological and human systems, we compare the activity patterns
   of individual financial traders with the simultaneous activity of other
   traders-an individual and spontaneous characteristic we call synchronous
   trading. Additionally, we examine the association of synchronous trading
   with individual performance and communication patterns. Analyzing
   empirical data on day traders' second-to-second trading and instant
   messaging, we find that the higher the traders' synchronous trading is,
   the less likely they are to lose money at the end of the day. We also
   find that the daily instant messaging patterns of traders are closely
   associated with their level of synchronous trading. This result suggests
   that synchronicity and vanguard technology may help traders cope with
   risky decisions in complex systems and may furnish unique prospects for
   achieving collective and individual goals.

AB Contemporary humans exhibit spectacular biological success derived from

   patterns among 32 present-day foraging societies (total n = 5067
   individuals, mean experienced band size = 28.2 adults). We found that
   hunter-gatherers display a unique social structure where (i) either sex
   may disperse or remain in their natal group, (ii) adult brothers and
   sisters often co-reside, and (iii) most individuals in residential
   groups are genetically unrelated. These patterns produce large

   symbolizes. I argue that the adolescents living in this community
   develop a strong place identity, even when they identify flaws with it,

   Twenty-five African American women aged 46 to 87 years, participated in

   semistructured, in-depth interviews, a self-management questionnaire,
   and a demographic profile. Participant observation occurred at a
   cross-section of 5 diabetes self-management education classes.
   Participants were asked about nutritional changes, physical activity,
   medication use, blood glucose monitoring, physician-patient interaction,
   support systems, and patient education/knowledge. Findings indicated
   that a majority of participants used regular exercise, medications, and
   dietary modifications as a core components model of diabetes
   self-management. Successful self-management was affected by diabetes
   beliefs, types of behaviors initiated, and available support systems and
   resources. Difficulties experienced that affected behavioral outcomes
   included access to care, costs of medications, pain, testing supplies,
   and nutritional changes. Findings suggest that modifications to the
   recommended regimen support or impede participants' efficient
   self-management of clinically recommended behaviors. Thus, for African
   American women managing type 2 diabetes, the regimen may necessitate
   modification models of diabetes self-management, day-to-day behavioral

   was generally detrimental to health. Women also described limited, and
   in some cases maladaptive, strategies to cope with racist events,
   including eating unhealthy food choices and portions. There was
   consensus that the subjective nature of perceiving racism and
   accompanying social prohibitions often made it impossible to address
   racism directly. Many women described anger in such situations and the
   tendency to internalize anger and other negative emotions, only to find
   that the negative emotions would be reactivated repeatedly with exposure
   to novel racial stressors, even long after the original racist event
   remitted. African American women in this study believed that racism
   affects their diabetes self-management and control. Health beliefs can
   exert powerful effects on health behaviors and may provide an
   opportunity for health promotion interventions in diabetes.

AB Objectives: We hypothesized that the medical home model is an effective
   intervention to decreasing health care disparities in minority patients
   with diabetes.
   Setting: Set in a community-based health initiative in Jacksonville,
   Florida, the study's mission was to support and enhance the primary care
   infrastructure in an effort to improve quality of care and increase
   access while reducing costs.
   Intervention: We preformed a retrospective analysis of outcomes on 457
   patients identified by registry specialists and enrolled in the diabetes
   rapid access program (DRAP). Data were obtained on 457 diabetic patients
   enrolled in the 6 clinic centers of the program between June 1, 2006,
   and December 31, 2009.
   Main Outcome Measures: Improvements in hemoglobin A(1c) and proportion
   of patients with hemoglobin A(lc) of more than 8% according to gender,
   race, and clinic location.
   Results: The average hemoglobin A(lc) at the beginning of the study was
   8.2% (+/- 2.3), and decreased significantly by an average of 0.5% (p <
   .005). The mean improvement in hemoglobin A(lc) did not differ
   significantly by clinic location, race, or gender. Both African American
   and Caucasian patients as well as men and women with a hemoglobin A(lc)
   of at least 8% showed a significant improvement in their Atc after the
   intervention (p < .005).
   Conclusions: The DRAP medical home model presents an opportunity to
   decrease disparities in care and improve diabetes care.

AB Objective: To examine how medically uninsured patients who receive
   health care at federally qualified health centers and free clinics are
   able to successfully self-manage diabetes compared to patients who are
   less successful.
   Methods: Two distinct groups of patients with diabetes for 6 months or
   longer were enrolled: (1) successful, defined as those with glycated
   hemoglobin (HbA(lc)) of 7% or less or a recent improvement of at least
   2% (n = 17); and (2) unsuccessful, defined as patients with HbA(lc) of
   at least 9% (n = 9) and without recent improvement. Patients were
   interviewed about enabling factors, motivators, resources, and barriers
   to diabetes self-management. Data from interviews, chart reviews, and
   clinician surveys were analyzed using qualitative methods and
   statistical techniques.
   Results: African Americans comprised 57.7% of the sample and whites
   38.5% IN = 26). No significant differences were detected between
   successful and unsuccessful groups in age, race, education, or
   employment status. Clinicians rated unsuccessful patients as having more
   severe diabetes and significantly lower levels of control than
   successful patients. Compared to unsuccessful patients, successful
   patients more often reported having friends or family with diabetes,
   more frequently sought information about the disease, used
   evidence-based self-management strategies, held more accurate
   perceptions of their own diabetes control, and experienced "turning
   point" events that motivated increased efforts in disease management.
   Conclusions: Patients who successfully managed diabetes learned from
   diabetic family members and interpreted disease-related events as
   motivational turning points. It may be beneficial to incorporate social
   learning and motivational enhancement into diabetes interventions to
   increase patients' motivation for improved levels of self-management.

PY 2011
AB Objective: To pilot test and assess the feasibility of a culturally
   grounded approach to adolescent overweight and diabetes prevention.
   Study Design: Reach-Out, a family-based nutrition and exercise program
   for overweight African American youth aged 9 to 12 years and their
   families, is led by lay health leaders and conducted in a community
   setting on Chicago's south side (Illinois). Age-appropriate interactive
   sessions focus on skills building, problem solving, and setting goals
   during 14 weekly sessions, with monthly meetings thereafter. Pre-post
   comparisons were made for 29 families (62 subjects) using physical (body
   mass index [BMI), blood pressure, waist circumference), biochemical
   (glucose, insulin, lipid levels) and behavioral data. Statistical
   analyses included mixed-effects linear models and logistic regression.
   Results: Children's Mean BMI z score fell from 2.46 at baseline to 2.33
   at 14 weeks and 2.39 at 1 year (p =.02), while parents' BMI remained
   stable. Children reported increased walking (p = 0.07) and exhibited a
   corresponding rise in mean serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   from 49.4 to. 54.2 (p < .001). Qualitative assessment showed that
   participants enjoyed the program but felt the program could be improved
   by making the sessions even more interactive.
   Conclusion: A community-based program for overweight minority youth and
   families can successfully address over-weight, with the potential to
   decrease diabetes risk in youth.

AB This article examines Bourdieu's contributions to history and historical
   sociology. Bourdieu has often been misread as an ahistorical
   'reproduction theorist' whose work does not allow for diachronic change
   or human agency. The article argues both that reproduction and social
   change, constraint and freedom, are at the heart of Bourdieu's project.
   Bourdieu's key concepts - habitus, field, cultural and symbolic capital
   - are all inherently historical. Bourdieu deploys his basic categories
   using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the
   ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical
   discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu's historicism are traced to his
   teachers at the Ecole Normale Superieure and to the long-standing
   aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two
   disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu's work is also signalled
   by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his
   former students and colleagues. Bourdieu allowed sociology to
   historicize itself to a greater extent than other French sociologists.

AB Instead of trying to locate the economic sociology of Bourdieu, I argue
   that his analysis of the economy was developed over such a long time
   period, is so rich and goes in so many interesting directions, that we
   are justified in speaking of Bourdieu's economic sociologies in the
   plural. While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction
   (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the
   fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he
   had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work
   in Algeria on 'the economy of honour and "good faith" (1950s and 1960s);
   his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the
   economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three
   studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's
   attempt to formulate a general program for 'economic anthropology' in
   his article 'The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as
   field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at
   Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.

   at how customers influence this work and its management. It argues that
   customers affect several non-interactive dimensions of these jobs,
   including timing, pace and effort. These effects also influence
   managerial strategies for organising labour processes, making
   routinisation impossible and shaping alternatives. These findings
   indicate the need for a reconceptualisation of customer influence in

AB The "parks vs. people" debate - i.e., the dispute over whether
   conservation projects and policies should prioritize biodiversity and
   landscape protection or poverty alleviation and human livelihood
   improvement - should be quite familiar to most conservation scientists
   and policy scholars today. Yet, it is clearly a more expansive debate
   than the argument over whether a particular conservation project should
   emphasize biodiversity protection or development: it is also a wider
   disagreement about the proper value and ethical foundations of
   biological conservation in the age of sustainability, as well as the
   wisdom and consequences of making complex trade-offs among rivalrous
   conservation goals in practice. This essay introduces a special section
   of Biological Conservation focused on this larger dispute, what we are
   calling the "New Conservation Debate" to distinguish it from the
   historical debate in the US between "wise use" conservationists and
   preservationists at the turn of the 20th century. Articles in this
   special section explore the normative and ethical dimensions of the
   debate, as well as more pragmatic considerations relating to trade-off
   analysis and decision-making in real-world conservation plans and
   projects that impact both biodiversity and human well-being.
   Collectively, the papers in this section clarify many of the ethical and
   strategic divisions in the New Conservation Debate, while also revealing
   opportunities for reconciliation and principled compromise among
   advocates of strong nature protection and human welfare in the
   conservation community. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   defending a strong protected-areas approach ("nature protectionists")
   have become pitted against more development-oriented conservationists
   ("social conservationists") intent on reforming the dominant protected
   areas model to embrace sustainable use and poverty alleviation efforts.
   We focus in particular on identifying and clarifying the divergent
   normative and descriptive claims made by the two camps in the debate, an
   activity that we suggest will improve communication and understanding
   among conservationists. We suggest that more explicit discussion of the
   value and ethical dimensions of this debate is needed, and describe
   efforts to reduce value conflict and harmonize ethical positions. We
   conclude with a discussion of emerging planning and policy models that
   may facilitate a convergence of values in the new conservation debate on

AB Conservation organizations are asked to be responsive to a number of
   ethical obligations beyond that of the conservation of biodiversity: the
   reduction of poverty, the imperative of social justice and cultural
   integrity, and the improvement in human livelihoods. Yet how a
   conservation project is designed and structured can negatively impact
   people's access to resources, privilege one group of people over
   another, or protect some species at a cost to others. Ideological
   conflict among nature protectionists, advocates for indigenous people,
   those promoting a pro-poor agenda, and those seeking to move
   conservation into the economic mainstream has characterized the
   conservation debate. I argue that in practice, most conservation
   programs should adopt a pluralistic and pragmatic approach, adopting
   multiple goals and making decisions on the basis of what works. Choosing
   among approaches requires an appreciation of trade-offs, and
   consideration of biological, social, and cultural values. Ultimately
   conservation approaches must be sustainable - ecologically, culturally,
   socially, economically and politically - otherwise they will fail both
   practically and ethically. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB If a project team is integrating human socio-economic development into
   its conservation work, there are three options for structuring the
   project: (1) have an integrated mix of conservation and development
   ends, (2) use development means in service of strict conservation ends,
   and (3) explicitly link the project's conservation ends to broader
   development ends. Although Option #1 is the most common solution, in
   this essay I argue that careful articulation of the theories of change
   behind conservation strategies reveals that it is often the worst
   choice. Project teams ultimately have to select either conservation or
   development goals, or risk achieving neither, especially in cases in
   which there is minimal linkage between the goals. Instead, a far better
   choice is Option #2 under which conservation agencies and organizations
   use the resources allocated to them by society in service of strict
   conservation ends. Under this option, project teams cannot ignore
   development concerns. Instead, they need to consider human needs in the
   context of both the threats at the site and their strategies - to use
   development means to achieve their desired conservation ends. Finally,
   in situations in which conservation teams need to increase available
   resources, it may be useful to show how conservation ends can also be a
   means to help achieve broader development ends over the long-term. Under
   Option #3, creating a clear "results chain" showing the team's theory of
   change enables teams to explicitly explore and make use of the links
   between human and natural welfare needs, and provide appropriate
   authorities with the information needed to weigh tradeoffs and make
   required decisions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper elaborates, analyzes, and partly defends the normative and
   empirical foundations of a "social ecology" model for natural habitat
   and resource management. This model treats human societies as being
   irreducibly integrated with the natural systems in which they are
   embedded. It argues that any concept of biodiversity necessarily
   embodies cultural values for it to be operationalized for conservation
   decisions. It accepts the legitimacy of tradeoffs between biodiversity
   conservation and other values including human resource development. It
   prioritizes local control of decisions in regions which are often
   targeted by Northern conservationists: areas of the South, where
   cultural choices have led to the persistence of high biodiversity. This
   model is used to analyze an ongoing dispute over biodiversity
   conservation and natural resource control in Peru: the conflict over
   Kandozi territory in the Abanico del Pastaza. What the Kandozi want is
   more than just a rejection of what has been criticized as the national
   park/fortress model of conservation. It consists of an assertion of
   local institutionalized control over traditional lands which goes well
   beyond the purview of the usual alternative of the fortress model: the
   biosphere reserve model of external and internal joint control of
   natural resources. To the remarkable extent that Kandozi resource
   management practices have succeeded in maintaining biotic richness and
   variety in spite of multiple encroachments, the empirical evidence
   demands that today's conservationists pay adequate attention to these
   practices and the social institutions in which they are embedded. But,
   beyond such prudential concerns, the social ecology model of habitat
   conservation accepts the normative claims that resident communities
   should have control over their lands and livelihoods and that they
   should be allowed to maintain their habitats as cultural landscapes of
   their choice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Interpersonal deviance is a form of counterproductive workplace behavior
   that is directly harmful to other individuals within an organization
   (Bennett and Robinson 2000). We argue that an important piece to
   understanding why deviance occurs is to go straight to the source-by
   asking individuals why they did it. Using Felson and Tedeschi's (1993)
   social interactionist perspective of aggression and violence as a
   theoretical frame, the purpose of the current study was to explore
   individuals' justifications for engaging in interpersonal deviance. The
   sample for this study consisted of 291 full-time working individuals
   obtained through an online service. Constructs were measured through the
   use of a web-based survey. Iterative K-means cluster analyses revealed
   interesting patterns that demonstrate the differential importance of
   power, retaliation, and having "no reason" in the decision to be
   deviant.

   skills, literacy, mathematics, health and safety knowledge, social
   development, environmental awareness, and cultural awareness
   significantly improved from baseline to post-intervention. Those with
   the greatest exposure to Jalan Sesama performed the best, even after

AB Talk is easily regarded as having lesser value in studies of social

   important way in which humans act, interact, and organize themselves. In
   this article, I examine how talk has been used in recent decades in the
   study of religion and in related work on culture and institutions. I
   argue that careful empirical examination of talk has already
   significantly increased our understanding of both the micro and macro
   processes involved in the construction of social life. I discuss four
   objections to taking talk seriously and show that these objections
   should not deter investigations in which talk plays a central role. I
   offer examples of recent work that poses new conceptual and theoretical
   questions, complements quantitative studies, and provides insights about
   changing historical and contemporary social conditions.

AB <link rid="b5">Chaves (2010) argues that much of the work in the
   sociology of religion is susceptible to the religious congruence
   fallacy-the tendency to assume consistency between religious beliefs and
   one's attitudes and behaviors across situations when they are in fact
   highly variable. We build on and extend this argument by focusing on
   intersecting group identities as a mechanism for identifying such
   incongruence, not only within religious contexts, but also at the
   intersection of categories such as gender and race. To illustrate this
   argument, the analysis draws on data from the 2006 Panel Study of
   American Religion and Ethnicity (PS-ARE) to assess how race, gender, and
   religion interact to produce different levels of attitude and behavior
   incongruencies on key issues of the day, specifically conservative
   social values and voting behaviors. The results find marked differences
   and inconsistent relationships between attitudes and behaviors across
   racial-gender groups. We use the analysis to highlight the conditions
   that result in incongruence at the intersections of identity categories
   and pinpoint where social scientists are most vulnerable to committing
   the congruence fallacy.

AB Background: Ethnic minorities and low income families tend to be in
   poorer health and have worse outcomes for a spectrum of diseases. Health
   care provider bias has been reported to potentially affect the
   distribution of care away from poorer communities, minorities, and
   patients with a history of substance abuse. Trauma is perceived as a
   disease of the poor and medically underserved. Minorities are
   overrepresented in low income populations and are also less likely to
   possess health insurance leading to a potential overlapping effect.
   Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a predominant cause of mortality and
   long-term morbidity, which imposes a considerable social and financial
   burden. We therefore sought to determine the independent effect on
   outcome after TBI from race, insurance status, intoxication on
   presentation, and median income.
   Methods: A 5-year retrospective chart review of admitted trauma patients
   aged 18 years and older to a Level I trauma center. Zip code of
   residency was a surrogate marker for socioeconomic status, because
   median income for each zip code is available from the US Census. Charts
   review included race, insurance status, mechanisms of trauma, and
   injuries sustained. Outcomes were placement of tracheostomy, hospital
   length of stay (HLOS), leaving Against Medical Advice (AMA), and
   discharge to home versus rehabilitation and mortality.
   Results: A total of 3,101 TBI patients were included in the analyses.
   Multivariable logistic and proportional hazard regression analyses were
   undertaken adjusting for age, gender, Injury Severity Score, and
   mechanism. Rates of tracheostomy placement were unaffected by race,
   median income, or insurance status. Race and median income did not
   affect HLOS, but private insurance was associated with shorter HLOS and
   intoxication was associated with longer HLOS. Neither race nor
   intoxication affected rates of AMA, but higher income and private
   insurance was associated with lower rates of AMA. Non-Caucasian race and
   lack of insurance had significantly lower likelihood of placement in a
   rehabilitation center. Mortality was unaffected by race, increased in
   intoxicated patients, was variably affected by median income, and was
   lowest in patients with private insurance.
   Conclusions: An extremely complex interplay exists between socioethnic
   factors and outcomes after TBI. Few physicians would claim overt
   discrimination. Tracheostomy, the factor most directed by the surgeon,
   was unbiased by race, income, or insurance status. The likelihood of
   placement in a rehabilitation center was significantly impacted by both
   race and insurance status. Future prospective studies are needed to
   better address causation.

AB Members of a psychiatric psychosocial program designed to provide both
   supported employment and peer support were surveyed about their current
   social activities, sources of social support, and social life
   improvement since joining the program. Survey respondents who worked a
   mainstream job (n = 17) reported greater peer contact in community
   locations, and correspondingly greater social life improvement, than
   those who remained unemployed or worked volunteer jobs (n = 45). Results
   of a hierarchical regression analysis (N = 62) that explored this
   positive correlation between mainstream work, community-based peer
   contact, and social life satisfaction suggest that working a job in an
   integrated setting that paid at least minimum wage encouraged program
   participants to meet and interact in community locations, thereby
   strengthening peer mutual support while furthering social integration.
   This unique pattern of findings requires replication, and we recommend
   that other psychosocial programs conduct similar quality improvement
   studies to provide further insights into the relationship between peer
   support and community integration.

AB In contrast to recent US studies showing a decrease in core network
   size, our Kenyan data reveals substantial network growth. We attribute
   this to the diffusion of mobile telephones. Results from pooled survey
   data from Nairobi professionals and entrepreneurs in 2002 and 2007 as
   well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation
   in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of
   technology use. What explains this puzzle is a network effect of mobile
   telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a
   context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and
   the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data
   before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this
   interpretation, showing that mobile phones are a crucial resource in
   managing interpersonal networks for instrumental purposes. (C) 2010

AB Studies have demonstrated little to no heritability for adolescent
   religiosity but moderate genetic, shared environmental, and nonshared
   environmental influences on adult religiosity. Only one longitudinal
   study of religiosity in female twins has been conducted (Koenig et al.,
   Dev Psychol 44:532-543, 2008), and reported that persistence from mid to
   late adolescence is due to shared environmental factors, but persistence
   from late adolescence to early adulthood was due to genetic and shared
   environmental factors. We examined the etiology of stability and change
   in religious values and religious attendance in males and females during
   adolescence and early adulthood. The heritability of both religious
   values and religious attendance increased from adolescence to early
   adulthood, although the increase was greater for religious attendance.
   Both genetic and shared environmental influences contributed to the
   stability of religious values and religious attendance across
   adolescence and young adulthood. Change in religious values was due to
   both genetic and nonshared environmental influences specific to early
   adulthood, whereas change in religious attendance was due in similar
   proportions to genetic, shared environmental, and non-shared
   environmental influences.

AB Objective: This study examined the validity of criteria for
   indiscriminately social/disinhibited and emotionally withdrawn/inhibited
   reactive attachment disorder (RAD). Method: As part of a longitudinal
   intervention trial of previously institutionalized children, caregiver
   interviews and direct observational measurements provided continuous and
   categorical data used to examine the internal consistency, criterion
   validity, construct validity, convergent and discriminant validity,
   association with functional impairment, and stability of these disorders
   over time. Results: As in other studies, the findings showed
   distinctions between the two types of RAD. Evidencederived criteria for
   both types of RAD showed acceptable internal consistency and criterion
   validity. In this study, rates of indiscriminately social/disinhibited
   RAD at baseline and at 30, 42, and 54 months were 41/129 (31.8%), 22/122
   (17.9%), 22/122 (18.0%), and 22/125 (17.6%), respectively. Signs of
   indiscriminately social/disinhibited RAD showed little association with
   caregivirig quality. Nearly half of children with indiscriminately
   social/disinhibited RAD had organized attachment classifications. Signs
   of indiscriminately social/disinhibited RAD were associated with signs
   of activity/impulsivity and of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
   and modestly with inhibitory control but were distinct from the
   diagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. At baseline, 30,
   42, and 54 months, 6/130 (4.6%), 4/123 (3.3%), 2/125 (1.6%), and 5/122
   (4.1%) of children met criteria for emotionally withdrawn/inhibited RAD.
   Emotionally withdrawn/inhibited RAD was moderately associated with
   caregiving at the first three time points and strongly associated with
   attachment security. Signs of this type of RAD were associated with
   depressive symptoms, although two of the five children with this type of
   RAD at 54 months did not meet criteria for major depressive disorder.
   Signs of both types of RAD contributed independently to functional
   impairment and were stable over time. Conclusions: Evidencederived
   criteria for indiscriminately social/disinhibited and emotionally
   withdrawn/inhibited RAD define two statistically and clinically cohesive
   syndromes that are distinct from each other, shows stability over 2
   years, have predictable associations with risk factors and attachment,
   can be distinguished from other psychiatric disorders, and cause

AB Ideas from Randall Collins's Sociology of Philosophies are applied to
   U.S. criminology, a policy-oriented field and one case of
   differentiation out of a fragmented sociological discipline. Building on
   previous quantitative work, in-depth interviews with eight prominent
   scholars provide the empirical material. As in philosophy, vertical
   network ties are important. Yet, they may take different forms, with
   consequences for the shape of horizontal networks and the nature of
   scholarship. Comparable to philosophy, horizontal network ties provide
   social capital and opportunities for interaction rituals that generate
   collective effervescence and emotional energy. Further, the nature of
   these interactions is dependent on the changing institutional
   environment in which they are embedded. Such institutional settings,
   themselves affected by changes in the political economy, also provide
   material resources, constituting dependencies that produce mediated
   effects and, in this policy-oriented field, also direct effects on the
   nature of scholarship.

   "chains" of emotions over time. Qualitative and quantitative data
   together generate a multifaceted understanding of emotions' interactions
   over time and their independent and combined ability to predict who
   returns to the events a year later. Previous work on emotions and
   movement recruitment has confined itself to whether emotional
   experiences were positive or negative or focused in depth on one

AB This article employs evidence from a literature within social psychology
   on the malleability of scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a
   measure that is widely used to assess implicit attitudes, and other
   implicit cognition measures, to provide a theoretical framework for
   incorporating implicit processes into sociological accounts of culture.
   Studies from this literature demonstrate the fundamentally contextual
   and interactional nature of implicit cognition; that is, how the
   cultural environment shapes the activation of cognitive associations.
   Understanding how culture works to influence behavior requires attention
   to the interaction between the cultural environment-including symbols
   and media, place, situations, and networks-and cognitive
   representations. Using this theoretical framework, I discuss how
   evidence from the sociology of culture regarding the nature of this
   cultural environment can inform our understanding of culture in action.

AB OBJECTIVE: Cases of child abuse and neglect that involve black children
   are reported to and substantiated by public child welfare agencies at a
   rate approximately twice that of cases that involve white children. A
   range of studies have been performed to assess the degree to which this
   racial disproportionality is attributable to racial bias in physicians,
   nurses, and other professionals mandated to report suspected child
   victimization. The prevailing current explanation posits that the
   presence of bias among reporters and within the child welfare system has
   led to the current large overrepresentation of black children. A
   competing explanation is that overrepresentation of black children is
   mainly the consequence of increased exposure to risk factors such as
   poverty.
   METHODS: We tested the competing models by using data drawn from
   national child welfare and public health sources. We compared racial
   disproportionality ratios on rates of victimization from official child
   welfare organizations to rates of key public health outcomes not subject
   to the same potential biases (eg, general infant mortality).
   RESULTS: We found that racial differences in victimization rate data
   from the official child welfare system are consistent with known
   differences for other child outcomes. We also found evidence supporting
   the presence of cultural protective factors for Hispanic children,
   termed the "Hispanic paradox."
   CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings do not preclude the possibility of
   racial bias, these findings suggest that racial bias in reporting and in
   the child welfare system are not large-scale drivers of racial
   disproportionality. Our data suggest that reduction of black/white
   racial disproportionality in the child welfare system can best be
   achieved by a public health approach to reducing underlying risk factors
   that affect black families. Pediatrics 2011;127:471-478

AB OBJECTIVE: Racial and ethnic disparities in cerebral palsy have been
   documented, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. We
   determined whether low birth weight accounts for ethnic disparities in
   the prevalence of cerebral palsy and whether socioeconomic factors
   impact cerebral palsy within racial and ethnic groups.
   METHODS: In a retrospective cohort of 6.2 million births in California
   between 1991 and 2001, we compared maternal and infant characteristics
   among 8397 infants with cerebral palsy who qualified for services from
   the California Department of Health Services and unaffected infants.
   RESULTS: Overall, black infants were 29% more likely to have cerebral
   palsy than white infants (relative risk: 1.29 [95% confidence interval:
   1.19 -1.39]). However, black infants who were very low or moderately low
   birth weight were 21% to 29% less likely to have cerebral palsy than
   white infants of comparable birth weight. After we adjusted for birth
   weight, there was no difference in the risk of cerebral palsy between
   black and white infants. In multivariate analyses, women of all
   ethnicities who did not receive any prenatal care were twice as likely
   to have infants with cerebral palsy relative to women with an early
   onset of prenatal care. Maternal education was associated with cerebral
   palsy in a dose-response fashion among white and Hispanic women.
   Hispanic adolescent mothers (aged < 18 years) had increased risk of
   having a child with cerebral palsy.
   CONCLUSIONS: The increased risk of cerebral palsy among black infants is
   primarily related to their higher risk of low birth weight.
   Understanding how educational attainment and use of prenatal care impact
   the risk of cerebral palsy may inform new prevention strategies.

AB The emerging manifesto, center of the essay collection this commentary
   is part of, points out that primatology is a primate's science and field
   of endeavor. It is about primates, and constructed and carried out by
   primates. But the relationships between different primates involved in
   primatology cannot be described merely as scientific, zoological, or
   conservatory. A main point emerging from this perspective is that the
   relationships amongst primates (as scientists and as subjects) are
   affected by primatologists' experiences outside of academic science and
   within the cultural schema that we acquire as members of human
   societies. My contribution focuses on the primatologists and their
   sometimes discussed, but too often ignored, cultural and ethnic contexts
   as influences on how they study, think about, and interact with other
   primates. In our views and bonds with other primates, do national,
   class, and ethnic factors count? Am. J. Primatol. 73:233-237, 2011. (C)

AB This study compares employment rates and barriers to return to work in
   subjects burned at work with those burned outside of work. Further, this
   study examines the influence of electrical etiology on return to work
   outcomes. The electronic records of burn survivors treated at a Regional
   Burn Center outpatient clinic from 2001 to 2007 were retrospectively
   reviewed. Inclusion criteria included employment at the time of burn
   injury and age of 18 years or older. Demographic and medical data were
   collected. Documentation of barriers to return to work was reviewed and
   classified into eight categories. Return to employment was grouped into
   four time intervals: 0 to 3, 3 to 6, 6 to 12, and greater than 12 months
   after injury. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine
   predictors of unemployment at greater than 1 year for subjects burned at
   work, outside of work, and those burned at work without electric injury.
   The authors identified 197 patients for inclusion in the study. Their
   age was 37 +/- 0.8 years (mean +/- SEM), and TBSA burned was 16 +/- 1%.
   Fifty percent of subjects were burned at work. Electric etiology was
   seen only in those burned at work (n = 24). Forty-four percent (n = 43)
   of subjects injured at work remained unemployed at 1 year compared with
   22% (n = 22) of subjects injured outside of work. The most frequent
   employment barriers included pain (72%), neurologic problems (62%), and
   psychiatric problems (53%) for those burned at work; and pain (63%),
   neurologic problems (59%), and impaired mobility (54%) for those burned
   outside of work. Significant predictors of unemployment at greater than
   12 months included burn at work, pain, impaired mobility, other medical
   problems, and inpatient rehabilitation (P < .05). When the electrical
   injury subjects are removed from the analysis, significant predictors of
   unemployment at 12 months include burn at work, pain, inpatient
   rehabilitation, and length of stay (P < .05). Burn survivors experience
   multiple complex barriers in returning to work. Burn at work is a
   significant predictor of unemployment at 1 year even after controlling
   for electric etiology. Further study is required to better understand
   the influence of work setting on employment outcomes. (J Burn Care Res

AB Cultural competency training has been proposed as a way to improve
   patient outcomes. There is a need for evidence showing that these
   interventions reduce health disparities.
   The objective was to conduct a systematic review addressing the effects
   of cultural competency training on patient-centered outcomes; assess
   quality of studies and strength of effect; and propose a framework for
   future research.
   The authors performed electronic searches in the MEDLINE/PubMed, ERIC,
   PsycINFO, CINAHL and Web of Science databases for original articles
   published in English between 1990 and 2010, and a bibliographic hand
   search. Studies that reported cultural competence educational
   interventions for health professionals and measured impact on patients
   and/or health care utilization as primary or secondary outcomes were
   included.
   Four authors independently rated studies for quality using validated
   criteria and assessed the training effect on patient outcomes. Due to
   study heterogeneity, data were not pooled; instead, qualitative
   synthesis and analysis were conducted.
   Seven studies met inclusion criteria. Three involved physicians, two
   involved mental health professionals and two involved multiple health
   professionals and students. Two were quasi-randomized, two were cluster
   randomized, and three were pre/post field studies. Study quality was low
   to moderate with none of high quality; most studies did not adequately
   control for potentially confounding variables. Effect size ranged from
   no effect to moderately beneficial (unable to assess in two studies).
   Three studies reported positive (beneficial) effects; none demonstrated
   a negative (harmful) effect.
   There is limited research showing a positive relationship between
   cultural competency training and improved patient outcomes, but there
   remains a paucity of high quality research. Future work should address
   challenges limiting quality. We propose an algorithm to guide educators
   in designing and evaluating curricula, to rigorously demonstrate the
   impact on patient outcomes and health disparities.

AB Objective: We examined the moderating effects of parenting on the
   temporal relationship between negative affect and subsequent alcohol use
   in adolescents as an indicator of self-medication. Specifically, we
   tested whether youth are more likely to self-medicate if they receive
   less parental social support.
   Method: We used a multi-method, multi-reporter strategy and an
   experience sampling paradigm to examine these mechanisms in an
   elevated-risk sample preparing for the transition to high school.
   Seventy-one adolescents and their parents completed home-based
   interviews and adolescents completed a 21-day experience sampling
   protocol in which they reported their alcohol use daily and their affect
   thrice daily.
   Results: Parent-reported family communication, though no other parental
   support indicators, moderated the relation between daily negative affect
   and alcohol use. Plotting of interactions showed a greater likelihood of
   drinking on days characterized by greater negative affect only in
   adolescents with higher levels of parent-reported family communication.
   Conclusions: This study offers tentative support for parental support as
   a moderator of the relation between daily negative affect and alcohol
   use. Parental support may be a response to alcohol use and
   self-medication in teens such that parents become more involved and open
   in talking with their teens when they notice these patterns of behavior.

AB Broad social motives (not specific to alcohol use) have been established
   as an important predictor of alcohol use and problems among college
   students, but we have little understanding of the mechanisms through
   which such motives operate. Thus, the current study examined broad
   social motives prior to college entry as a predictor of college
   drinking/problems and sought to identify potential mechanisms through
   which they are associated with increased risk.
   Participants comprised a sample of 2245 incoming college students (59.9%
   women) transitioning from high school through the college years. The
   first web-based survey was completed during the summer prior to
   matriculation with participants reporting on their behavior during the
   spring of high school senior year. Additional surveys were administered
   each academic semester through the fall of the fourth year. High school
   social motives were examined as a predictor of changes in alcohol
   use/problems from high school through the senior year, with changes in
   descriptive norms, personal drinking values, and alcohol expectancies
   from high school to sophomore year examined as possible mediators of
   these relations. Descriptive norms, personal drinking values, and
   alcohol expectancies were robust mediators of broad social motives for
   both alcohol use and problems. Although there were a few differences by
   race/ethnicity in the alcohol use model, the mechanisms through which
   broad social motives operated were largely invariant across groups.
   These findings shed light on important mechanisms that can be targeted
   in prevention programs, particularly those that target groups who are
   likely to be high in broad social motives (e.g., fraternity/sorority
   members). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper is one of the first written that ties together the areas of
   wellness, social networking, and computational-complexity theory Our
   goal is to integrate these three fields in order to develop a system in
   which we can help people improve their well being. There are over one
   billion obese people in the world and that number is growing alarmingly
   fast. We must find a way to motivate unhealthy people to take care of
   themselves, so as to put less strain on economies around the world, less
   strain on natural resources, less strain on the health-care system, less
   strain on nearby individuals, and, most importantly, to save lives and
   to reduce suffering. We have gone from hunters and gathers to sitters
   and twitterers. As our standard of living increases, so does our size.
   While eating high-caloric foods, many people watch TV or play with the
   Internet all day long. And one particular Internet application, social
   networking, is amazingly popular-nations around the world have a
   significant percentage of their populations engaged in social-networking
   sites such as Facebook, Flickr, Friendster, hi5, LinkedIn, MySpace,
   Orkut, Qzone, and so on. In this paper we leverage the popularity of
   social networking to improve people's wellness. We propose a WELLNESS
   PROFILE MODEL that captures a social-network members' characteristics,
   preferences, activities, vitals, and other relevant information. We
   formulate dynamic-matching problems whose focus is to find groups of
   individuals with similar interests and time constraints, so that they
   can participate in activities together thereby contributing to each
   other's well being. We examine the computational complexity of the
   problems from both the sequential and parallel perspectives. Our results
   tell us how hard these problems are to solve. That is, we determine the
   complexity of these problems. The problems defined here involve a new
   type of dynamic matching, as opposed to traditional matching as is done
   in many of the current Internet social-networking sites and traditional
   graph theory. We intend to implement restricted versions of some of the
   algorithms in the systems being developed by Elbrys Networks, Inc.

AB William Edward Burghardt Du Bois is considered one of the most prolific
   and brilliant scholars of our time. While his contributions to civil
   rights, sociology, history, African American studies, and urban studies
   are universally recognized, his legacy in the public health and
   epidemiology discourses is not as widely acknowledged by contemporary
   health researchers. His seminal work The Philadelphia Negro: A Social
   Study (1899) and his report "The Health and Physique of the Negro
   American" (1906) may be considered early harbingers in general of public
   health-and more specifically, social epidemiology-research. During the
   late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Black and White
   differences in mortality and morbidity were largely attributed to
   notions of biological racial inferiority. Efforts by Du Bois to
   challenge these predominant notions resulted in the systematic empirical
   investigation of social factors contributing to Black health risk and
   health disparities. More than one hundred years after Du Bois's
   pioneering scholarship, racial/ethnic and social disparities remain a
   central challenge for public health and medical professionals. Given the
   persistence of health disparities and the increasing focus on
   neighborhood social and physical environments as fundamental factors
   contributing to health inequalities, this paper seeks to historically
   situate Du Bois's scholarship, describe the methodological and
   conceptual significance of his seminal studies, and articulate the
   importance of incorporating Du Bois's legacy to advance the next
   generation of racial/ethnic health inequality research.

AB Background: We aim to determine the economic and social impact of
   typical interventions proposed by the public health officials and
   preventive behavioral changes adopted by the private citizens in the
   event of a "flulike" epidemic.
   Method: We apply an individual-based simulation model to the New River
   Valley area of Virginia for addressing this critical problem. The
   economic costs include not only the loss in productivity due to sickness
   but also the indirect cost incurred through disease avoidance and caring
   for dependents.
   Results: The results show that the most important factor responsible for
   preventing income loss is the modification of individual behavior; it
   drops the total income loss by 62% compared to the base case. The next
   most important factor is the closure of schools, which reduces the total
   income loss by another 40%.
   Conclusions: The preventive behavior of the private citizens is the most
   important factor in controlling the epidemic. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB In recent decades, the migration that has long been characteristic of
   life in the Great Plains has meant the steady relocation of population
   from rural to metropolitan counties. While much has been written about
   the social and economic consequences of this migration, far less is
   known of its political consequences. In Nebraska, the least-populated
   counties experience the most severe out-migration, and are the most
   reliably Republican. To discern a relationship between population
   migration and political outcomes, this study analyzes the six open-seat
   races for United States senator that have occurred in Nebraska since
   1976. An econometric model that explains Democratic vote share at the
   county level demonstrates that larger growth in a county's population
   exerts a positive and significant influence on the proportion of the
   vote on by the Democratic candidate, when partisanship and other
   race-specific variables are controlled for. Consolidation of more of the
   state's population into fewer counties has increased the competitiveness
   of well-qualified Democratic candidates.

AB Like other native Amazonian peoples, the Yanesha of eastern Peru
   conceive of plants and trees as having been primordial human beings
   transformed into their present form at the end of mythic times. The
   events that led to their transformation can be described as being either
   "sublime" or "grotesque." Cultivated plants that underwent a sublime
   mode of transformation include manioc, the Yanesha staple, as well as
   maize, beans, peanuts, and cotton. These plants assumed their present
   form as the result of the self-transformation of powerful demiurges; a
   luminous, contained transformation that privileged the sensual
   capacities of the upper body. In contrast, the mode of transformation of
   barbasco, chili peppers, coca, peach palm, and yam falls on the side of
   the grotesque, and involves a series of immoral beings that had little
   control over the activities of their lower bodies. This article seeks to
   discern the Yanesha rationale behind this particular way of classifying
   plants. It proposes that sublime origin plants are those that were
   domesticated the earliest and have thus been part of Yanesha culture the
   longest. In contrast, those domesticated in more recent times - and thus
   less central to Yanesha cultural life-are attributed a more earthly,
   grotesque origin.

AB Enslaved African and African Americans in the American South during the
   17th through 19th centuries lived within a social order established by
   plantation owners and reinforced through the control of food. Therefore,
   the ways slaves acquired their food and other subsistence goods
   demonstrates aspects of the plantation's social relations. This article
   examines the connection between slaves' subsistence strategies and
   plantation social relations at Thomas Jefferson's Poplar Forest through
   the analysis of macrobotanical remains. Excavations at Poplar Forest
   uncovered a sub-floor pit of an antebellum slave cabin that was occupied
   from the 1840s through 1858 and possibly as late as the abolition of
   slavery. The seeds and wood indicate that the slaves' subsistence
   strategies included provisioning or receiving food from the plantation
   owner, production or slaves growing their own food, and procurement or
   the gathering of wild plants. By comparing the results from this
   sub-floor pit to analyses of macrobotanicals dating to Thomas
   Jefferson's ownership, I investigate aspects of plantation social
   relations at Poplar Forest and offer a better understanding of the
   social and natural environment in which the enslaved African Americans
   lived.

PD MAR 2011
PY 2011
AB Purpose: Even though pay-for-performance programs are being rapidly
   implemented, little is known about how patient complexity affects
   practice-level performance assessment in rural settings. We sought to
   determine the association between patient complexity and practice-level
   performance in the rural United States.
   Basic procedures: Using baseline data from a trial aimed at improving
   diabetes care, we determined factors associated with a practice's
   proportion of patients having controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A(lc) <=
   7%): patient socioeconomic factors, clinical factors, difficulty with
   self-testing of blood glucose, and difficulty with keeping appointments.
   We used linear regression to adjust the practice-level proportion with
   A(lc) controlled for these factors. We compared practice rankings using
   observed and expected performance and classified practices into
   hypothetical pay-for-performance categories.
   Main Findings: Rural primary care practices (n = 135) in 11 southeastern
   states provided information for 1641 patients with diabetes. For
   practices in the best quartile of observed control, 76.1% of patients
   had controlled diabetes vs 19.3% of patients in the worst quartile.
   After controlling for other variables, proportions of diabetes control
   were 10% lower in those practices whose patients had the greatest
   difficulty with either self testing or appointment keeping (p < .05 for
   both). Practice rankings based on observed and expected proportion of
   AI, control showed only moderate agreement in pay-for-performance
   categories (kappa = 0.47; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.56; p < .001).
   Principal Conclusions: Basing public reporting and resource allocation
   on quality assessment that does not account for patient characteristics
   may further harm this vulnerable group of patients and physicians.

AB Humans likely evolved precautionary systems designed to minimize the
   threats to reproductive fitness posed by highly interdependent
   ultrasociality. A review of research on the self-protection and disease
   avoidance systems reveals that each system is functionally distinct and
   domain-specific: each is attuned to different cues; engages different
   emotions, inferences, and behavioral inclinations; and is rooted in
   somewhat different neurobiological substrates. These systems share
   important features, however. Each system is functionally coherent, in
   that perceptual, affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes work in
   concert to reduce fitness costs of potential threats. Each system is
   biased in a risk-averse manner, erring toward precautionary responses
   even when available cues only heuristically imply threat. And each
   system is functionally flexible, being highly sensitive to specific
   ecological and dispositional cues that signal greater vulnerability to
   the relevant threat. These features characterize a general template
   useful for understanding not only the self-protection and disease
   avoidance systems, but also a broader set of evolved, domain-specific
   precautionary systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine patterns of comorbidity, functioning, and
   service use for US children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD).
   METHODS: Bivariate and multivariable cross-sectional analyses were
   conducted on data from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health on
   61 779 children ages 6 to 17 years, including 5028 with ADHD.
   RESULTS: Parent-reported diagnosed prevalence of ADHD was 8.2%. Children
   with ADHD were more likely to have other mental health and
   neurodevelopmental conditions. Parents reported that 46% of children
   with ADHD had a learning disability versus 5% without ADHD, 27% vs 2%
   had a conduct disorder, 18% vs 2% anxiety, 14% vs 1% depression, and 12%
   vs 3% speech problems (all P < .05). Most children with ADHD had at
   least 1 comorbid disorder: 33% had 1, 16% had 2, and 18% had 3 or more.
   The risk for having 3 or more comorbidities was 3.8 times higher for
   poor versus affluent children (30% vs 8%). Children with ADHD had higher
   odds of activity restriction (odds ratio: 4.14 [95% confidence interval:
   3.34-5.15]), school problems (odds ratio: 5.18 [95% confidence interval:
   4.47-6.01]), grade repetition, and poor parent-child communication,
   whereas social competence scores were lower and parent aggravation
   higher. Functioning declined in a stepwise fashion with increasing
   numbers of comorbidities, and use of health and educational services and
   need for care coordination increased.
   CONCLUSIONS: Clinical management of ADHD must address multiple comorbid
   conditions and manage a range of adverse functional outcomes.
   Therapeutic approaches should be responsive to each child's
   neurodevelopmental profile, tailored to their unique social and family
   circumstances, and integrated with educational, mental health and social
   support services. Pediatrics 2011;127:462-470
