AB Objective. This study investigated the long-term effects of
   socioeconomic status (SES) on atherosclerosis.
   Methods. Data from the Epidemiology of Hearing Loss Study and the Beaver
   Dam Eye Study (Beaver Dam, WI, 1998-2000), were used to examine adult
   SES (education, household income, and longest-held job) and childhood
   SES (household density and parental home ownership at age 13)
   associations with carotid intimamedia thickness (IMT) and carotid plaque
   in a cohort of 2042 men and women aged 53 to 94 years.
   Results. For education, income, and occupation (women), those in the
   lowest SES group had statistically larger age-sex-adjusted IMT than
   those in the highest SES group (< 12 vs. > 12 years education: 0.92 vs.
   0.86 mm respectively, P < 0.0001), (410,000 vs. >$45,000: 0.97 vs. 0.87
   mm, P < 0.0001), (operator/fabricator/labor vs. manager/professional:
   0.89 vs. 0.82 mm, P < 0.001). Associations were similar using carotid
   plaque as the outcome. Participants with low levels of both adult and
   childhood SES measures had age-sex-adjusted IMT greater than those with
   persistently high levels of SES (0.93 vs. 0.84 mm, P < 0.0001).
   Conclusions. Measures of SES at two points in the life-span were
   associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Abuse and neglect are highly prevalent in children and have enduring
   neurobiological effects. Stressful early life environments perturb the
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which in turn may predispose
   to psychiatric disorders in adulthood. However, studies of childhood
   maltreatment and adult HPA function have not yet rigorously investigated
   the differential effects of maltreatment subtypes, including physical
   abuse.
   In this study, we sought to replicate our previous finding that
   childhood maltreatment was associated with attenuated cortisol responses
   to stress and determine whether the type of maltreatment was a
   determinant of the stress response.
   Salivary cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) was
   examined in a non-clinical sample of women (n = 110). Subjects had no
   acute medical problems and were not seeking psychiatric treatment.
   Effects of five maltreatment types, as measured by the Childhood Trauma
   Questionnaire, on cortisol response to the TSST were investigated. To
   further examine the significant (p < 0.005) effect of one maltreatment
   type, women with childhood physical abuse (PA) (n = 20) were compared to
   those without past PA (n = 90).
   Women reporting childhood PA displayed a significantly blunted cortisol
   response to the TSST compared with subjects without PA, after
   controlling for estrogen use, age, other forms of maltreatment, and
   other potential confounds. There were no differences between PA and
   control groups with regard to physiological arousal during the stress
   challenge.
   In a non-clinical sample of women with minimal or no current
   psychopathology, physical abuse is associated with a blunted cortisol
   response to a psychosocial stress task.

AB Aims: This meta-analysis sought to identify which subgroups of clients
   with severe mental illness (SMI) benefited from evidence-based supported
   employment. Methods: We used meta-analysis to pool the samples from 4
   randomized controlled trials comparing the Individual Placement and
   Support (IPS) model of supported employment to well-regarded vocational
   approaches using stepwise models and brokered services. Meta-analysis
   was used to determine the magnitude of effects for IPS/control group
   differences within specific client subgroups (defined by 2 work history,
   7 sociodemographic, and 8 clinical variables) on 3 competitive
   employment outcomes (obtaining a job, total weeks worked, and job
   tenure). Results: The findings strongly favored IPS, with large effect
   sizes across all outcomes: 0.96 for job acquisition, 0.79 for total
   weeks worked, and 0.74 for job tenure. Overall, 90 (77%) of the 117
   effect sizes calculated for the 39 subgroups exceeded 0.70, and all 117
   favored IPS. Conclusions: IPS produces better competitive employment
   outcomes for persons with SMI than alternative vocational programs
   regardless of background demographic, clinical, and employment
   characteristics.

AB One type of study in the sociology of mental health examines how social
   and cultural factors influence the creation and consequences of
   psychiatric diagnoses. Most studies of this kind focus on how diagnoses
   emerge from struggles among advocacy organizations, economic and
   political interest groups, and professionals. In contrast,
   intraprofessional dynamics rather than external pressures generated
   perhaps the major transformation resulting from the Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, diagnostic
   revolution in 1980-the rise of Major Depressive Disorder as the central
   diagnosis of the psychiatric profession. Other interests, including the
   drug industry and advocacy groups, capitalized on the features of this
   diagnosis only after its promulgation. The social construction of
   depression illustrates how social and cultural processes can have
   fundamental influences over diagnostic processes even in the absence of
   struggles among forces external to the mental health professions. It
   also indicates how diagnoses themselves can have major professional,
   economic, political, and social consequences.

   in-depth interviews to surveys. This research note describes an
   alternative approach of amassing in-depth qualitative accounts and
   content coding them for statistical analysis. Funding requirements for
   such projects are minimal and students can easily be involved-providing
   important training opportunities that broaden their appreciation of and
   expertise in diverse methodologies. Such endeavors thus present valuable
   opportunities for advancing training and research. We illustrate how
   this approach has been applied in a project focusing on workplace
   ethnographies. We conclude with a discussion of additional bodies of
   ethnographic research similarly ripe for systematic analysis.

AB Within this paper we offer what is hopefully both a suggestive (as
   opposed to definitive) and generative (as opposed to suppressive)
   signposting of the ontological, epistemological, and methodological
   boundaries framing the putative intellectual project that is Physical
   Cultural Studies (PCS). Ground in a commitment toward engaging varied
   dimensions or expressions of active physicality, we deliberate on an
   understanding of, and approach to, the corporeal practices, discourses,
   and subjectivities through which active bodies become organized,
   represented, and experienced in relation to the operations of social
   power. Further, drawing on Toby Miller, we suggest that this approach
   requires a motivation toward progressive social change. We consider the
   political and axiological contingencies of PCS, how it is differentiated
   from the "sociology of sport," and how we may produce the type of
   knowledge that is able to intervene into the broader social world and
   make a difference. We are sure many will disagree-perhaps with good
   reason-with our assumptions. Indeed, such differences are welcomed for
   we feel that there is greater progressive potential in a field in
   tension, in healthy contestation, and, in which debates surrounding
   ontology, epistemology, political intent, method, interpretation,
   expression, and impact flow freely.

AB Using archival data from the four most popular gold investment websites,
   this study is a content analysis of gold investment enthusiast ('gold
   bug') commentaries over a six-month time period, from November 2007 to
   April 2008. We examine gold bug discourse as a conspiracy narrative
   whose central tenet is the criticism of inflationary monetary policy.
   Gold bugs argue that the continual presence of inflation demonstrates
   the fundamental flaws of global capitalism and the illegitimacy of the
   administrative system that operates it. The invocation of inflation is
   the primary way in which gold bugs forecast economic conditions and the
   inevitable failure of those who control global monetary policy. Based
   upon the ontological claim that gold is the only 'true' store of value,
   gold bugs posit a sharp rebuke of monetary policy, predicting a drastic
   increase in the price of gold and a consequent collapse of the world's
   fiat currencies.

AB Explanations for women's underrepresentation in math-intensive fields of
   science often focus on sex discrimination in grant and manuscript
   reviewing, interviewing, and hiring. Claims that women scientists suffer
   discrimination in these arenas rest on a set of studies undergirding
   policies and programs aimed at remediation. More recent and robust
   empiricism, however, fails to support assertions of discrimination in
   these domains. To better understand women's underrepresentation in
   math-intensive fields and its causes, we reprise claims of
   discrimination and their evidentiary bases. Based on a review of the
   past 20 y of data, we suggest that some of these claims are no longer
   valid and, if uncritically accepted as current causes of women's lack of
   progress, can delay or prevent understanding of contemporary
   determinants of women's underrepresentation. We conclude that
   differential gendered outcomes in the real world result from differences
   in resources attributable to choices, whether free or constrained, and
   that such choices could be influenced and better informed through
   education if resources were so directed. Thus, the ongoing focus on sex
   discrimination in reviewing, interviewing, and hiring represents costly,
   misplaced effort: Society is engaged in the present in solving problems
   of the past, rather than in addressing meaningful limitations deterring
   women's participation in science, technology, engineering, and
   mathematics careers today. Addressing today's causes of
   underrepresentation requires focusing on education and policy changes
   that will make institutions responsive to differing biological realities
   of the sexes. Finally, we suggest potential avenues of intervention to
   increase gender fairness that accord with current, as opposed to
   historical, findings.

AR e17207
DI 10.1371/journal.pone.0017207

AB Background: There is little empirical evidence in support of a
   relationship between rates of influenza infection and level of material
   deprivation (i.e., lack of access to goods and services) and social
   deprivation (i.e. lack of social cohesion and support).
   Method: Using validated population-level indices of material and social
   deprivation and medical billing claims for outpatient clinic and
   emergency department visits for influenza from 1996 to 2006, we assessed
   the relationship between neighbourhood rates of influenza and
   neighbourhood levels of deprivation using Bayesian ecological regression
   models. Then, by pooling data from neighbourhoods in the top decile
   (i.e., most deprived) and the bottom decile, we compared rates in the
   most deprived populations to the least deprived populations using
   age-and sex-standardized rate ratios.
   Results: Deprivation scores ranged from one to five with five
   representing the highest level of deprivation. We found a 21% reduction
   in rates for every 1 unit increase in social deprivation score (rate
   ratio [RR] 0.79, 95% Credible Interval [CrI] 0.66, 0.97). There was
   little evidence of a meaningful linear relationship with material
   deprivation (RR 1.06, 95% CrI 0.93, 1.24). However, relative to
   neighbourhoods with deprivation scores in the bottom decile, those in
   the top decile (i. e., most materially deprived) had substantially
   higher rates (RR 2.02, 95% Confidence Interval 1.99, 2.05).
   Conclusion: Though it is hypothesized that social and material
   deprivation increase risk of acute respiratory infection, we found
   decreasing healthcare utilization rates for influenza with increasing
   social deprivation. This finding may be explained by the fewer social
   contacts and, thus, fewer influenza exposure opportunities of the
   socially deprived. Though there was no evidence of a linear relationship
   with material deprivation, when comparing the least to the most
   materially deprived populations, we observed higher rates in the most
   materially deprived populations.

AB Human adults typically respond faster to their own face than to the
   faces of others. However, in Chinese participants, this self-face
   advantage is lost in the presence of one's supervisor, and they respond
   faster to their supervisor's face than to their own. While this "boss
   effect" suggests a strong modulation of self-processing in the presence
   of influential social superiors, the current study examined whether this
   effect was true across cultures. Given the wealth of literature on
   cultural differences between collectivist, interdependent versus
   individualistic, independent self-construals, we hypothesized that the
   boss effect might be weaker in independent than interdependent cultures.
   Twenty European American college students were asked to identify
   orientations of their own face or their supervisors' face. We found that
   European Americans, unlike Chinese participants, did not show a "boss
   effect" and maintained the self-face advantage even in the presence of
   their supervisor's face. Interestingly, however, their self-face
   advantage decreased as their ratings of their boss's perceived social
   status increased, suggesting that self-processing in Americans is
   influenced more by one's social status than by one's hierarchical
   position as a social superior. In addition, when their boss's face was
   presented with a labmate's face, American participants responded faster
   to the boss's face, indicating that the boss may represent general
   social dominance rather than a direct negative threat to oneself, in
   more independent cultures. Altogether, these results demonstrate a
   strong cultural modulation of self-processing in social contexts and
   suggest that the very concept of social positions, such as a boss, may
   hold markedly different meanings to the self across Western and East
   Asian cultures.

   readmissions has implications for efforts to reduce readmissions.
   Objective To determine whether black patients have higher odds of
   readmission than white patients and whether these disparities are
   related to where black patients receive care.
   Design Using national Medicare data, we examined 30-day readmissions
   after hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (MI), congestive
   heart failure (CHF), and pneumonia. We categorized hospitals in the top
   decile of proportion of black patients as minority-serving. We
   determined the odds of readmission for black patients compared with
   white patients at minority-serving vs non-minority-serving hospitals.
   Setting and Participants Medicare Provider Analysis Review files of more
   than 3.1 million Medicare fee-for-service recipients who were discharged
   from US hospitals in 2006-2008.
   Main Outcome Measure Risk-adjusted odds of 30-day readmission.
   Results Overall, black patients had higher readmission rates than white
   patients (24.8% vs 22.6%, odds ratio [OR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.11-1.14; P<.001); patients from minority-serving hospitals had
   higher readmission rates than those from non-minority-serving hospitals
   (25.5% vs 22.0%, OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.27; P<.001). Among patients
   with acute MI and using white patients from non-minority-serving
   hospitals as the reference group (readmission rate 20.9%), black
   patients from minority-serving hospitals had the highest readmission
   rate (26.4%; OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.28-1.42), while white patients from
   minority-serving hospitals had a 24.6% readmission rate (OR, 1.23; 95%
   CI, 1.18-1.29) and black patients from non-minority-serving hospitals
   had a 23.3% readmission rate (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.16-1.23; P<.001 for
   each); patterns were similar for CHF and pneumonia. The results were
   unchanged after adjusting for hospital characteristics including markers
   of caring for poor patients.
   Conclusion Among elderly Medicare recipients, black patients were more
   likely to be readmitted after hospitalization for 3 common conditions, a
   gap that was related to both race and to the site where care was
   received. JAMA. 2011;305(7):675-681 www.jama.com

AB Human populations have extraordinary capabilities for generating
   behavioural diversity without corresponding genetic diversity or change.
   These capabilities and their consequences can be grouped into three
   categories: strategic (or cognitive), ecological and
   cultural-evolutionary. Strategic aspects include: (i) a propensity to
   employ complex conditional strategies, some certainly genetically
   evolved but others owing to directed invention or to cultural evolution;
   (ii) situations in which fitness payoffs (or utilities) are
   frequency-dependent, so that there is no one best strategy; and (iii)
   the prevalence of multiple equilibria, with history or minor variations
   in starting conditions (path dependence) playing a crucial role.
   Ecological aspects refer to the fact that social behaviour and cultural
   institutions evolve in diverse niches, producing various adaptive
   radiations and local adaptations. Although environmental change can
   drive behavioural change, in humans, it is common for behavioural change
   (especially technological innovation) to drive environmental change (i.
   e. niche construction). Evolutionary aspects refer to the fact that
   human capacities for innovation and cultural transmission lead to
   diversification and cumulative cultural evolution; critical here is
   institutional design, in which relatively small shifts in incentive
   structure can produce very different aggregate outcomes. In effect,
   institutional design can reshape strategic games, bringing us full
   circle.

AB Background: The dimensions along which mortality is patterned in India
   remains unclear. We examined the specific contribution of social castes,
   household income, assets, and monthly per capita consumption to
   mortality differentials in India.
   Methods and Findings: Cross-sectional data on 217 363 individuals from
   41 554 households from the 2004-2005 India Human Development Survey was
   analyzed using multiple logistic regressions. Mortality differentials
   across social castes were attenuated after adjusting for household
   economic factors such as income and assets. Individuals living in the
   lowest income and assets quintiles had an increased risk of mortality
   with odds ratio (OR) of 1.66 (95% CI = 1.23-2.24) in the bottom income
   quintile and OR of 2.94 (95% CI = 1.66-5.22) in the bottom asset
   quintile. Counter-intuitively, individuals living in households with
   lowest monthly consumption per capita had significantly lower
   probability of death (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.20-0.38).
   Conclusions: Mortality burden in India is largely patterned on economic
   dimensions as opposed to caste dimensions, though caste may play an
   important role in predicting economic opportunities.

TI Meaningful Gesture in Monkeys? Investigating whether Mandrills Create

AB Background: Human societies exhibit a rich array of gestures with
   cultural origins. Often these gestures are found exclusively in local
   populations, where their meaning has been crafted by a community into a
   shared convention. In nonhuman primates like African monkeys, little
   evidence exists for such culturally-conventionalized gestures.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Here I report a striking gesture unique
   to a single community of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx) among nineteen
   studied across North America, Africa, and Europe. The gesture was found
   within a community of 23 mandrills where individuals old and young,
   female and male covered their eyes with their hands for periods which
   could exceed 30 min, often while simultaneously raising their elbow
   prominently into the air. This 'Eye covering' gesture has been performed
   within the community for a decade, enduring deaths, removals, and
   births, and it persists into the present. Differential responses to Eye
   covering versus controls suggested that the gesture might have a
   locally-respected meaning, potentially functioning over a distance to
   inhibit interruptions as a 'do not disturb' sign operates.
   Conclusions/Significance: The creation of this gesture by monkeys
   suggests that the ability to cultivate shared meanings using novel
   manual acts may be distributed more broadly beyond the human species.
   Although logistically difficult with primates, the translocation of
   gesturers between communities remains critical to experimentally
   establishing the possible cultural origin and transmission of nonhuman
   gestures.

AB Objective: To evaluate the impact of the American Heart Association
   (AHA) scientific statement regarding electrocardiograms (ECGs) and
   stimulant medications on the practice of community pediatricians.
   Design: Retrospective evaluation and survey analysis.
   Setting: Academic tertiary care center.
   Participants: Patients with ECGs referred to our institution by
   pediatricians with an indication of stimulant medication screening in
   the year after the AHA statement.
   Intervention: We compared the ECG ordering practices of community
   pediatricians and the outcomes of further evaluation and estimated the
   associated cost before and after the AHA scientific statement.
   Main Outcome Measures: Abnormal ECG findings, further workup, and change
   in clinical practice.
   Results: In the year after publication of the 2008 AHA scientific
   statement, 372 ECGs were ordered with an in-dication of stimulant
   medication screening. Before publication of this statement, a mean (SD)
   of 6.9 (3.2) ECGs per month were referred for this indication. Despite
   continuing controversy, this number increased 4-fold to 31.2 (9.5) ECGs
   per month in the subsequent year. Twentyfour ECGs (6.4%) had abnormal
   findings. Eighteen patients were referred for further evaluation, and,
   at last follow-up, none had been found to have definitive disease. Six
   of 24 patients with abnormal ECG findings (25.0%) had a perceived
   significant delay in therapy because of the process. In responding
   pediatricians, 34.6% reported that the scientific statement had clearly
   affected their practice.
   Conclusions: The clinical practice of community pediatricians in regard
   to screening ECGs and stimulant medications has been affected by the
   recent AHA scientific statement. The yield of performing ECGs with an
   indication of stimulant medication screening is very low.

AB This paper strengthens the basis for a key claim of contemporary
   economic sociology - that strong ties among capitalists cannot be
   reduced to rational considerations. Support for this claim has been
   limited by reliance on an external standard of rationality, whereby
   irrationality in commitment to a partner or network is based on an
   observer's evaluation of an actor's interests. In this article we
   address this limitation by developing an internal standard for assessing
   the rationality of an actor's commitment, which is derived from
   Davidson's (1980) definition of akrasia or 'incontinence.' In addition,
   we clarify the mechanisms that produce 'akratic' commitment among
   capitalists: (a) short-term emotions that overwhelm rational
   calculation; and (b) a sense of loyalty that leads one to incorporate
   others' interests into one's own. Finally, we provide systematic
   evidence of akratic commitment and the proposed mechanisms from studies
   of an industry peer network in the remodeling construction industry.

TI Different Types of Distrust in Clinical Research Among Whites and

SO JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
VL 103
IS 2
BP 123
EP 130
PD FEB 2011
PY 2011
AB Background: African Americans are thought to be more distrustful of
   clinical research compared to elderly whites, but it is unknown whether
   specific types of distrust in clinical research, such as interpersonal
   or societal distrust, vary according to race. The primary objective was
   to identify racial differences in interpersonal or societal distrust in
   clinical research among African Americans and whites.
   Methods: Seven hundred seventy-six older African Americans and whites
   were surveyed about their interpersonal and societal distrust using a
   7-item index of distrust in clinical research. We combined the 2
   societal distrust items into a societal distrust subscale. We also
   assessed trust in primary care physicians, access to care,
   health/functional status, previous exposure to clinical research,
   awareness of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, perceived discrimination in
   health care, and sociodemographic characteristics.
   Results: High societal distrust was more common among African Americans
   compared to whites (21% vs 7% in the top quartile of the societal
   distrust, p < .0001), but there were no racial differences in responses
   to the individual interpersonal distrust index items. In sequentially
   built multivariable analyses, the relationship between African American
   race and societal distrust (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.2-3.7) was not
   completely explained by other factors such as trust in one's physician,
   previous discrimination, or awareness of the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.
   Conclusions: Racial differences according to the type of distrust in
   clinical research may warrant assessing specific types of distrust
   separately among racially diverse populations in future studies.

AB Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is hypothesized
   to be an important pathway linking socioeconomic position and chronic
   disease.
   This paper tests the association between education and the diurnal
   rhythm of salivary cortisol.
   Up to eight measures of cortisol (mean of 5.38 per respondent) over 2
   days were obtained from 311 respondents, aged 18-70, drawn from the
   2001-2002 Chicago Community Adult Health Study. Multi-level models with
   linear splines were used to estimate waking level, rates of cortisol
   decline, and area-under-the-curve over the day, by categories of
   education.
   Lower education (0-11 years) was associated with lower waking levels of
   cortisol, but not the rate of decline of cortisol, resulting in a higher
   area-under-the-curve for more educated respondents throughout the day.
   This study found evidence of lower cortisol exposure among individuals
   with less education and thus does not support the hypothesis that less
   education is associated with chronic over-exposure to cortisol.

AB Differences in functional limitations between adults with and without
   diabetes are more evident in women than they are in men.
   This study aims to investigate if there are gender differences in
   biological, behavioral, and psychosocial variables, and how these
   gender-related variables explain the gender-functional limitations
   relationship in adults with type 2 diabetes.
   We drew data on 1,619 adults with type 2 diabetes from the Health and
   Retirement Study and its diabetes-specific mail survey. The fit of a
   series of mediation models to the data was assessed by structural
   equation modeling.
   Although women had better diet and blood glucose self-monitoring
   behaviors than did men, they reported less favorable body mass index,
   glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value, blood pressure, early
   complications, exercise behaviors, perceived control, self-efficacy,
   coping, depressive symptoms, and family support than did men.
   Psychosocial factors made an indirect contribution in the
   gender-functional limitations relationship by way of their strong
   association with biological and behavioral factors, two factors that
   directly and completely mediated the gender-functional limitations
   relationship.
   Interventions promoting psychosocial well-being and empowering perceived
   diabetes control, coping, and self-efficacy in women with type 2
   diabetes may help improve biological and behavioral determinants, and
   further, their long-term functional health.

AB A causal model developed by Koenig suggests that higher levels of

   Using structural equation modeling, we tested the model and expanded
   versions that use self-report data of patients with HIV (n = 345).
   All models demonstrated good overall fit with significant parameters.
   The final model found that increased spirituality/religiosity predicted
   increased religious coping, which influenced social support. Social
   support, in turn, positively influenced depressed mood (as a measure of
   mental health); depressed mood affected fatigue; and both variables
   predicted self-reported physical function. These three variables
   predicted health rating/utility for one's health state. Additional
   analyses found that two covariates, religiosity and race, differentially
   predicted spirituality/religiosity and religious coping.
   In patients with HIV, an expanded version of Koenig's model found that
   increased spirituality/religiosity is positively associated with

AB Background
   Little research has been conducted on the factors that may explain the
   higher rates of mental health problems in United States National Guard
   soldiers who have deployed to the Iraq War.
   Aims
   To examine whether financial hardship, job loss, employer support and
   the effect of deployment absence on co-workers were associated with
   depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
   Method
   Cross-sectional data were obtained from 4034 National Guard soldiers at
   two time points. All measures were assessed by self-report.
   Results
   The four factors were associated with depression and PTSD, with
   variability based on outcome and time point. For example, job loss
   increased the odds of meeting criteria for depression at 3 and 12 months
   and for PTSD at 12 months; the negative effect of deployment absence on
   co-workers increased the likelihood of meeting criteria for PTSD, but
   not depression, at both time points.
   Conclusions
   The findings demonstrate that National Guard soldiers have unique
   post-deployment social and material concerns that impair their mental
   health.

AB Treponemal disease is known to be associated with the compromised
   community health of permanent village settlement. This association
   explains its high visibility in the village-based, arguably chiefdom
   level, agriculturalist societies of late prehistoric (AD 1300-1600)
   North America. Within chiefdom-level societies, health differences have
   often been demonstrated between mortuary-defined "elite" and "nonelite"
   individuals. This theoretically should predict status-based differences
   in treponemal disease visibility. The prediction is tested in a
   five-site osteological sample (N = 650) from the Dallas phase (AD
   1300-1550), a simple mortuary-defined two-tiered presumptive chiefdom
   level maize agriculturalist socioeconomic context from lower east
   Tennessee. The Dallas phase results affirm a general pre-Colombian North
   American pattern of no sex differences and display comparable adult to
   subadult frequencies. The study also reveals that given a sufficient
   sample size, "elites" do indeed exhibit a significantly lower frequency
   of tertiary stage treponemal disease. This can be attributed to better
   baseline health, which has been previously demonstrated in this sample.
   It may also be affected by the mortuary inclusion of achieved status
   individuals whose good health may have facilitated sociopolitical
   advancement. Another pattern that emerged is an apparent young adult age
   bias in disease visibility. This suggests that tertiary treponemal
   disease morbidity may either directly or synergistically factor in early
   adult age at death. Future research will address the veracity of this
   association. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:185-195, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss,

AB Objectives. To (1) determine socio-demographic characteristics
   associated with a TV in the bedroom (BTV) and (2) examine relationship
   of BTV, independent of total viewing time, with social and behavioral
   characteristics.
   Methods. Children 6-17 years from the 2007 US National Survey of
   Children's Health were included (n = 48,687). BTV, daily TV viewing
   time, demographic, behavioral and social outcomes (community
   involvement, social skills, health habits and status, and family) were
   examined using logistic regression, and adjusted for total viewing time.
   Results. Overall prevalence of BTV was 49.3% in American children. Older
   age, non-Hispanic Black (71.3%), Hispanics (56.3%), higher level of
   poverty (>56.2%), non two-parent biological family structure (>62.6%),
   Midwest (47.1%), Northeast (46.7%), South Atlantic (56.4%) and South
   Central (59.8%) region of the country were associated with higher odds
   of BTV. Female gender (52.7%) and residence in Alaska (33.0%) were
   associated with lower prevalence of BTV. BTV was associated with higher
   prevalence of exhibiting problematic social behaviors (29%) and
   overweight status (44%). BTV was significantly associated with lower
   prevalence of regular family meals (13%), engagement in school (16%),
   participation in extracurricular activities (31%), regularly sleeping
   enough (20%), and participation in community service (25%) after
   adjustment for total viewing time.
   Conclusions. BTV appears associated with more social and behavioral

AB Small-scale, artisanal livestock production is framed as "other" by
   conventional livestock producers, and rural communities. This alterity,
   although not without cost, allows women to be involved as active
   entrepreneurs and managers in artisanal livestock production and also
   allows farmers to pursue management strategies with the explicit purpose
   of enhancing animal welfare. The case study presented here, an artisanal
   goat dairy farm managed by three women, demonstrates that by embracing
   feminine care identities, these women carve a space for themselves
   within livestock production in which they can pursue their own economic
   and affective goals. Analysis of ethnographic data also demonstrates
   that farmers' decision-making regarding animal production is based on
   both affective and instrumental concerns. If we are to understand and
   operationalize the affective component of farmer decision making based
   on the livestock-farmer relationship, we must begin to consider to what
   extent livestock themselves are social actors.

   developed by <link rid="b25">Finke and Dougherty (2002), which
   emphasizes both the social and religious capital gained during

   movement that has arisen in the last 25 years as a response to
   increasing distrust of institutional authority. This study helps to
   close the gap between institutional studies of organizations and the
   sociology of religion by suggesting that some, currently overlooked,
   organizational activities can be more accurately understood as
   deliberate attempts to resist institutionalizing forces.

AB The list experiment is used to detect latent beliefs when researchers
   suspect a substantial degree of social desirability bias from
   respondents. This methodology has been used in areas ranging from racial
   attitudes to political preferences. Meanwhile, social psychologists
   interested in the salience of physical attributes to social behavior
   have provided respondents with experimentally altered photographs to
   test the influence of particular visual cues or traits on social
   evaluations. This experimental research has examined the effect of skin
   blemishes, hairlessness, and particular racial attributes on
   respondents' evaluation of these photographs. While this approach
   isolates variation in particular visual characteristics from other
   visual aspects that tend to covary with the traits in question, it fails
   to adequately deal with social desirability bias. This shortcoming is
   particularly important when concerned with potentially charged visual
   cues, such as body mass index (BMI). The present article describes a
   novel experiment that combines the digital alteration of photographs
   with the list experiment approach. When tested on a nationally
   representative sample of Internet respondents, results suggest that when
   shown photographs of women, male respondents report differences in
   levels of attractiveness based on the perceived BMI of the photographed
   confederate. Overweight individuals are less likely than their normal
   weight peers to report different levels of attractiveness between
   high-BMI and low-BMI photographs. Knowing that evaluations of
   attractiveness influence labor market outcomes, the findings are
   particularly salient in a society with rising incidence of obesity.

AB Research on economic inequalities in health has been largely polarized
   between psychosocial and neomaterial approaches. Examination of symbolic
   capital the material display of social status and how it is structurally
   constrained is an underutilized way of exploring economic disparities in
   health and may help to resolve the existing theoretical polarization. In
   contemporary society, what people do with money and how they consume and
   display symbols of wealth may be as important as income itself. After
   tracing the historical rise of consumption in capitalist society and its
   interrelationship with economic inequality, I discuss evidence for the
   role of symbolic capital in health inequalities and suggest directions
   for future research. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:260-264.

AB Aims
   This study compares the personal, family and social functioning of older
   husbands and wives concordant or discordant for high-risk alcohol
   consumption and identifies predictors of changes in concordance and
   high-risk consumption.
   Design, Participants, Measurements
   Three groups of couples were identified at baseline and followed 10
   years later: (i) concordant couples in which husbands and wives engaged
   in low-risk alcohol consumption (n = 54); (ii) concordant couples in
   which husbands and wives engaged in high-risk alcohol consumption (n =
   38); and (iii) discordant couples in which one partner engaged in
   high-risk alcohol consumption and the other partner did not (n = 75). At
   each follow-up, husbands and wives completed an inventory that assessed
   their personal, family and social functioning.
   Findings
   Compared to the low-risk concordant group, husbands and wives in the
   high-risk concordant group were more likely to rely on tension-reduction
   coping, reported more friend approval of drinking, and were less
   involved in religious activities; however, they did not differ in the
   quality of the spousal relationship. The frequency of alcohol
   consumption declined among husbands in discordant couples, but not among
   husbands in concordant couples. Predictors of high-risk drinking
   included tension-reduction coping, friend approval of drinking and, for
   husbands, their wives' level of drinking.
   Conclusions
   High-risk and discordant alcohol consumption do not seem to be linked to
   decrements in family functioning among older couples in long-term stable
   marriages. The predictors of heavy alcohol consumption among older
   husbands and wives identify points of intervention that may help to
   reduce their high-risk drinking.

AB It is well established that breast milk is the ideal food for infants
   and that breastfeeding has short- and long-term health benefits for the
   mother and child. However, there is variation in breastfeeding patterns
   between populations. Women's work is thought to influence breastfeeding
   patterns and timing of supplementation and it is often assumed that
   women in subsistence-oriented societies can more easily integrate their
   productive and reproductive activities. This article reports
   longitudinal data, collected in three rounds (resguardo [<40 days], peak
   [2-4 months], and late [14-16 months] lactation), on breastfeeding
   structure, infant care, and work patterns of 17 rural Amazonian women in
   an effort to understand how breastfeeding structure and maternal time
   allocation changed over time, as well as the strategies women used to
   integrate their productive and reproductive roles. Women breastfed 10.6
   +/- 3.1, 9.4 +/- 3.4, and 9.6 +/- 5.5 times per 9-h period in the three
   rounds, respectively. Breastfeeding structure, specifically session
   duration, changed over time (P < 0.05). As lactation progressed, women
   spent less time breastfeeding and in infant care and more time in
   subsistence work. In peak lactation, subsistence work was negatively
   correlated with infant care (r = -0.4, P = 0.01), breastfeeding (r =
   -0.29, P = 0.05) and session duration (r = -0.39, P < 0.01) and in late
   lactation was negatively correlated with time spent breastfeeding (r =
   -0.39, P < 0.01) and in infant care (r = -0.50, P < 0.01) and positively
   correlated with inter-session interval (r = 0.40, P < 0.01). Generally,
   women reduced time in subsistence work when breastfeeding was more
   intense and returned to normal activity patterns once infants were being
   supplemented. The costs and benefits associated with women's strategies
   are discussed. Am J Phys Anthropol 144:226-237, 2011. (C) 2010

AB Objectives. We investigated associations of socioeconomic position (SEP)
   with chronic disease risk factors, and heterogeneity in this patterning
   by provincial-level urbanicity in Argentina.
   Methods. We used generalized estimating equations to determine the
   relationship between SEP and body mass index, high blood pressure,
   diabetes, low physical activity, and eating fruit and vegetables, and
   examined heterogeneity by urbanicity with nationally representative,
   cross-sectional survey data from 2005. All estimates were age adjusted
   and gender stratified.
   Results. Among men living in less urban areas, higher education was
   either not associated with the risk factors or associated adversely. In
   more urban areas, higher education was associated with better risk
   factor profiles (P<.05 for 4 of 5 risk factors). Among women, higher
   education was associated with better risk factor profiles in all areas
   and more strongly in more urban than in less urban areas (P<0.05 for 3
   risk factors). Diet (in men) and physical activity (in men and women)
   were exceptions to this trend.
   Conclusions. These results provide evidence for the increased burden of
   chronic disease risk among those of lower SEP, especially in urban
   areas. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:294-301.

AB Objective. To examine the relationship between functional limitation,
   socioeconomic inequality, and depression in a diverse cohort of patients
   with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
   Methods. The study design was cross-sectional and subjects were from the
   University of California, San Francisco RA Cohort. Patients were
   enrolled from 2 rheumatology clinics, an urban county public hospital
   and a university tertiary care medical center. Age, sex, race/ethnicity,
   disease activity, functional limitation, and medications were variables
   collected at clinical visits. The patient's clinic site was used as a
   proxy for his or her socioeconomic status. The outcome variable was
   depressive symptom severity measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire
   9. Differences in characteristics between depressed and nondepressed
   patients were calculated using 2-sided t-tests or the Pearson's
   chi-square test. For the multivariate analysis, repeated measures with
   generalized estimating equations were used.
   Results. There were statistically significant differences between
   depressed and nondepressed patients related to race/ethnicity, public
   versus tertiary care hospital rheumatology clinic, disability, and
   medications. In the multivariate analysis, increased functional
   limitation and public clinic site remained significantly associated with
   increased depression scores. A significant interaction existed between
   clinic site and disability. Mean depression scores rose more
   precipitously as functional limitation increased at the public hospital
   rheumatology clinic.
   Conclusion. There are disparities in both physical and mental health
   among individuals with low socioeconomic status. The psychological
   effects of disability vary in patients with RA such that a vulnerable
   population with functional limitations is at higher risk of developing
   depressive symptoms.

AB Environmental education traditionally has focused on changing individual

   education's lack of effectiveness in instilling an understanding of
   human's role within ecosystems has led us to an exploration of the
   relationship of learning and education to the larger social-ecological
   systems in which they are embedded. We draw from socio-cultural learning
   theory and from frameworks developed by long-term ecological research,
   hierarchy theory, and social-ecological systems resilience to suggest an
   "ecology of learning" and an "ecology of environmental education." In so
   doing, we hope to open up new research and practices that consider
   possibilities for environmental education to act in consort with other
   initiatives, such as local stewardship efforts, to foster social
   capital, ecosystem services, and other attributes of resilient
   social-ecological systems.

AB BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities in cancer care and survival
   are well documented. Patient navigation has been shown to improve timely
   follow-up of abnormal breast screenings for underserved patients. Few
   studies showed the impact of navigation on patient experiences of care.
   OBJECTIVE: We compared the experiences of patients enrolled in a patient
   navigator program and non-navigated patients referred to a hospital
   breast center for follow-up of abnormal mammogram in an underserved
   community health center population.
   DESIGN: Group comparison study using data from a mail and telephone
   survey to measure the experience of navigated and non-navigated
   patients.
   PARTICIPANTS: English-and Spanish-speaking patients with abnormal
   mammography attending the Avon Breast Center between April 1, 2005 and
   April 30, 2007. Seventy-two navigated patients and 181 non-navigated
   patients completed surveys; the survey response rate was 53.6%.
   MAIN MEASURES: Timeliness of care, preparation for the visit to the
   breast center, ease of access, quality of care, provider communication,
   unmet need and patient satisfaction.
   KEY RESULTS: Most measures of the patient experience did not differ
   between navigated and non-navigated patients. Overall quality of care
   was rated as excellent (55% vs 62%, p=0.294). Navigated patients were
   significantly more likely than non-navigated to 'definitely' understand
   what to expect at their visit (79% vs 60%, p=0.003), to receive a
   reminder letter or telephone call (89% vs 77%, p=0.029), and to feel
   welcome (89% vs 75%, p=0.012). Navigated patients were less likely than
   non-navigated to rate the concern shown for their cultural/religious
   beliefs as excellent (45% vs 54%, p=0.014).
   CONCLUSIONS: Assessing patient perspectives is essential to evaluate the
   success of quality improvement interventions. In our center, we measured
   few significant disparities in the perceptions of care of these two very
   different populations of patients, although, there are still areas in
   which our program needs improvement. Further research is needed to
   understand the effectiveness of patient navigation programs in reducing
   racial and ethnic disparities.

AB BACKGROUND: Lower mammography screening rates among minority and low
   income women contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from breast
   cancer.
   OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a patient navigation intervention
   on adherence rates to biennial screening mammography among women engaged
   in primary care at an inner-city academic medical center.
   DESIGN: Quality improvement intervention with a concurrent control
   group, conducted from February to November of 2008.
   STUDY SUBJECTS: All women in a hospital-based primary care practice aged
   51-70 years. Subjects were randomized at the level of their primary care
   provider, such that half of the patients in the practice received the
   intervention, while the other half received usual care.
   INTERVENTIONS: Intervention subjects whose last mammogram was >18 months
   prior received a combination of telephone calls and reminder letters
   from patient navigators trained to identify barriers to care. Navigators
   were integrated into primary care teams and interacted directly with
   patients, providers, and radiology to coordinate care. Navigators
   utilized an electronic report to track subjects. Adherence rates to
   biennial mammography were assessed in intervention and control groups at
   baseline and post-intervention.
   KEY RESULTS: A total of 3,895 women were randomized to intervention (
   n=1,817) and control (n=2,078) groups. Mean age was 60, 71% were
   racial/ethnic minorities, 23% were non-English speaking, and 63% had
   public or no health insurance. At baseline, there was no difference in
   mammography adherence between the control and intervention groups (78%,
   respectively, p=0.55). After the 9-month intervention, mammogram
   adherence was higher in the intervention group compared with the control
   group (87% vs. 76%, respectively, p<0.001). Except among Hispanic women
   who demonstrated high rates in both the intervention and control groups
   (85% and 83%, respectively), all racial/ethnic and insurance groups
   demonstrated higher adherence in the intervention group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigation improves biennial mammography rates for
   inner city, low income, minority populations.

AB The late Lower Paleolithic archaeofaunas of Qesem Cave in the southern
   Levant span 400-200 ka and associate with Acheulo-Yabrudian (mainly
   Amudian) industries. The large mammals are exclusively Eurasian in
   origin and formed under relatively cool, moist conditions. The
   zooarchaeological findings testify to large game hunting,
   hearth-centered carcass processing and meat sharing during the late
   Lower Paleolithic, not unlike the patterns known from Middle and Upper
   Paleolithic caves in the region. Well-defined hearth features are rarely
   preserved in Qesem Cave, but the heterogeneous distributions of burned
   bones indicate areas of frequent hearth rebuilding throughout the
   occupation sequence. The hominins delayed consumption of high quality
   body parts until they could be moved to the cave, where hearths were
   hubs of processing activities and social interaction. Paradoxically, the
   cut marks on the Qesem bones are both more abundant and more randomly
   oriented than those observed in Middle and Upper Paleolithic cases in
   the Levant. These results suggest that several individuals were directly
   involved in cutting meat from the bones and that the social mechanics of
   meat sharing during the late Lower Paleolithic at Qesem Cave differed
   from those typical of both the Middle and Upper Paleolithic in the
   region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: Disparities in limb salvage procedures may be driven by
   socioeconomic status (SES) and access to high-volume hospitals. We
   sought to identify SES factors associated with major amputation in the
   setting of critical limb ischemia (CLI).
   Methods: The 2003-2007 Nationwide Inpatient Sample was queried for
   discharges containing lower extremity revascularization (LER) or major
   amputation and chronic CLI (N = 958,120). The Elixhauser method was used
   to adjust for comorbidities. Significant predictors in bivariate
   logistic regression were entered into a multivariate logistic regression
   for the dependent variable of amputation vs LER.
   Results: Overall, 24.2% of CLI patients underwent amputation.
   Significant differences were seen between both groups in bivariate and
   multivariate analysis of SES factors, including race, income, and
   insurance status. Lower-income patients were more likely to be treated
   at low-LER-volume institutions (odds ratio [OR], 1.74; P < .001).
   Patients at higher-LER-volume centers (OR, 15.16; P < .001) admitted
   electively (OR, 2.19; P < .001) and evaluated with diagnostic imaging
   (OR, 10.63; P < .001) were more likely to receive LER.
   Conclusions: After controlling for comorbidities, minority patients,
   those with lower SES, and patients with Medicaid were more likely
   receive amputation for CLI in low-volume hospitals. Addressing SES and
   hospital factors may reduce amputation rates for CLI. (J Vasc Surg

   analyze the presence of selected diseases using geo-processing
   techniques. Five diseases with information available at the first
   sub-national level (states) were mapped, showing the presence of the
   disease ("hotspots'') and overlap of diseases ("major hotspots''). In
   the 45 countries/territories (approximately 570 states) of the Region,
   there is: lymphatic filariasis in four countries (29 states),
   onchocerciasis in six countries (25 states), schistosomiasis in four
   countries (39 states), trachoma in three countries (29 states), and
   human rabies transmitted by dogs in ten countries (20 states). Of the
   108 states with one or more of the selected diseases, 36 states present
   the diseases in overlapping areas ("major hotspots''). Additional
   information about soil-transmitted helminths was included. The analysis
   suggests a majority of the selected diseases are not widespread and can
   be considered part of an unfinished agenda with elimination as a goal.
   Integrated plans and a comprehensive approach, ensuring access to
   existing diagnostic and treatment methods, and establishing a
   multi-sectoral agenda that addresses social determinants, including
   access to adequate water and sanitation, are required. Future studies
   can include additional diseases, socio-economic and environmental
   variables.

AB Much existing work in the sociology of culture implicitly assumes actor
   motivations of status and domination. Yet this theoretical consensus
   attends only glancingly to the flip side of such behavior: those moments
   when people deploy culture, not only in a mobility project, but to
   connect. Based on a three-year ethnography of children's consumer
   culture in three diverse communities, I find that children often use
   consumer culture to belong both to connect to others, and to achieve
   visibility in their social worlds. I contend that children's common
   desires make inequality, particularly in their access to consumer goods,
   a challenge to the accomplishment of the connection for which they
   strive. Using insights from Erving Goffman and Randall Collins, I find
   children use processes of facework to navigate the problems arising from
   their differences from others, including those stemming from
   discrepancies in commodity possession. Out of five facework processes
   that I identify, 1 elaborate upon two that seem to challenge the notion
   that children seek sameness. Children's goals for consumer culture also
   differed from those of (particularly affluent) adults. I suggest
   scholars need to reconsider their theoretical emphasis on exclusion over
   inclusion, and document the circumstances under which each is
   particularly salient. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB It is well known that humans tend to associate with other humans who
   have similar characteristics, but it is unclear whether this tendency
   has consequences for the distribution of genotypes in a population.
   Although geneticists have shown that populations tend to stratify
   genetically, this process results from geographic sorting or assortative
   mating, and it is unknown whether genotypes may be correlated as a
   consequence of nonreproductive associations or other processes. Here, we
   study six available genotypes from the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health to test for genetic similarity between friends. Maps
   of the friendship networks show clustering of genotypes and, after we
   apply strict controls for population stratification, the results show
   that one genotype is positively correlated (homophily) and one genotype
   is negatively correlated (heterophily). A replication study in an
   independent sample from the Framingham Heart Study verifies that DRD2
   exhibits significant homophily and that CYP2A6 exhibits significant
   heterophily. These unique results show that homophily and heterophily
   obtain on a genetic (indeed, an allelic) level, which has implications
   for the study of population genetics and social behavior. In particular,
   the results suggest that association tests should include friends' genes
   and that theories of evolution should take into account the fact that
   humans might, in some sense, be metagenomic with respect to the humans
   around them.

AB Problems in real-world functioning are pervasive in schizophrenia and
   much recent effort has been devoted to uncovering factors which
   contribute to poor functioning. The goal of this study was to examine
   the role of four such factors: social cognition (theory of mind),
   neurocognition, negative symptoms, and functional capacity (social
   competence). 178 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective
   disorder completed measures of theory of mind, neurocognition, negative
   symptoms, social competence, and self-reported functioning. Path models
   sought to determine the relationships among these variables. Theory of
   mind as indexed by the Hinting Task partially mediated the relationship
   between neurocognition and social competence, and negative symptoms and
   social competence demonstrated significant direct paths with
   self-reported functioning. Study results suggest theory of mind serves
   as an important mediator in addition to previously investigated social
   cognitive domains of emotional and social perception. The current study
   also highlights the need to determine variables which mediate the
   relationship between functional capacity and real-world functioning. (C)

AB Previous investigations of the influence of paranoia on facial affect
   recognition in schizophrenia have been inconclusive as some studies
   demonstrate better performance for paranoid relative to non-paranoid
   patients and others show that paranoid patients display greater
   impairments. These studies have been limited by small sample sizes and
   inconsistencies in the criteria used to define groups. Here, we utilized
   an established emotion recognition task and a large sample to examine
   differential performance in emotion recognition ability between patients
   who were actively paranoid (AP) and those who were not actively paranoid
   (NAP). Accuracy and error patterns on the Penn Emotion Recognition test
   (ER40) were examined in 132 patients (64 NAP and 68 AP). Groups were
   defined based on the presence of paranoid ideation at the time of
   testing rather than diagnostic subtype. AP and NAP patients did not
   differ in overall task accuracy; however, an emotion by group
   interaction indicated that AP patients were significantly worse than NAP
   patients at correctly labeling neutral faces. A comparison of error
   patterns on neutral stimuli revealed that the groups differed only in
   misattributions of anger expressions, with AP patients being
   significantly more likely to misidentify a neutral expression as angry.
   The present findings suggest that paranoia is associated with a tendency
   to over attribute threat to ambiguous stimuli and also lend support to
   emerging hypotheses of amygdala hyperactivation as a potential neural
   mechanism for paranoid ideation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The Graduated Recovery Intervention Program (GRIP) is a new individual
   cognitive behavioral therapy program designed to facilitate functional
   recovery in people who have experienced an initial episode of psychosis.
   The purposes of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and
   tolerability of the GRIP intervention, and to compare the effectiveness
   of GRIP versus treatment as usual (TAU) for improving specific clinical
   and psychosocial outcomes. Forty-six individuals with first episode
   psychosis were randomized to GRIP +TAU or TAU alone. Primary outcomes
   focused on social and role functioning, and quality of life. Secondary
   outcomes included psychotic symptoms, depression, substance use, social
   support, attitudes toward medications, well-being, and hospitalizations.
   The results indicate that GRIP was well-tolerated, as evidenced by good
   attendance and low drop-out rates, and well-received (based on positive
   feedback from participants). Although the majority of mixed model
   analyses were not statistically significant, examination of within-group
   changes and effect sizes suggests an advantage for GRIP over TAU in
   improving functional outcomes. These advantages and the fact that the
   GRIP intervention demonstrated feasibility and tolerability suggest that
   this intervention is worthy of further investigation. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Background: While mass media communications can be an important source
   of health information, there are substantial social disparities in
   health knowledge that may be related to media use. The purpose of this
   study is to investigate how the use of cancer-related health
   communications is patterned by race, ethnicity, language, and social
   class.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In a nationally-representative
   cross-sectional telephone survey, 5,187 U.S. adults provided information
   about demographic characteristics, cancer information seeking, and
   attention to and trust in health information from television, radio,
   newspaper, magazines, and the Internet. Cancer information seeking was
   lowest among Spanish-speaking Hispanics (odds ratio: 0.42; 95%
   confidence interval: 0.28-0.63) compared to non-Hispanic whites.
   Spanish-speaking Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanic whites to
   pay attention to (odds ratio: 3.10; 95% confidence interval: 2.07-4.66)
   and trust (odds ratio: 2.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-4.47) health
   messages from the radio. Non-Hispanic blacks were more likely than
   non-Hispanic whites to pay attention to (odds ratio: 2.39; 95%
   confidence interval: 1.88-3.04) and trust (odds ratio: 2.16; 95%
   confidence interval: 1.61-2.90) health messages on television. Those who
   were college graduates tended to pay more attention to health
   information from newspapers (odds ratio: 1.98; 95% confidence interval:
   1.42-2.75), magazines (odds ratio: 1.86; 95% confidence interval:
   1.32-2.60), and the Internet (odds ratio: 4.74; 95% confidence interval:
   2.70-8.31) and had less trust in cancer-related health information from
   television (odds ratio: 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.32-0.62) and
   radio (odds ratio: 0.54; 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.86) compared to
   those who were not high school graduates.
   Conclusions/Significance: Health media use is patterned by race,
   ethnicity, language and social class. Providing greater access to and
   enhancing the quality of health media by taking into account factors
   associated with social determinants may contribute to addressing social
   disparities in health.

AB Voting referenda provide direct evidence of the demand for public goods.
   A number of previous studies have used referenda to analyze the support
   for public environmental goods. These studies have used aggregate data
   from large jurisdictional units (usually counties) and summary income
   measures such as the mean or median, and have usually found that higher
   income areas offer greater support for environmental propositions. We
   examine environmental referenda voting in California using census block
   group data, spatial dependence controls, and detailed income
   distribution data. We find that household income has a negative marginal
   effect on environmental referenda voting for most of the income range
   when using census block data. In addition, controls for spatial
   dependence significantly reduce the magnitude of most coefficients. This
   suggests that OLS estimates of referenda determinants are biased. We
   also show that county level data may be subject to severe aggregation
   bias and might not be appropriate for referenda studies. (c) 2010

   Dynamics, collected in a US population between 1984 and 2005, were used
   to fit marginal structural models and to estimate relative and absolute
   measures of effect. Wealth was specified as a 6-category variable: those
   with < 0 wealth and quintiles of positive wealth. There were a 16%-44%
   higher risk and 6-18 excess cases of poor/fair health (per 1,000
   persons) among the less wealthy relative to the wealthiest quintile.
   Less wealthy men, women, and whites had higher risk of poor/fair health
   relative to their wealthy counterparts. The overall wealth-mortality
   association revealed a 62% increased risk and 4 excess deaths (per 1,000
   persons) among the least wealthy. Less wealthy women had between a 24%
   and a 90% higher risk of death, and the least wealthy men had 6 excess
   deaths compared with the wealthiest quintile. Overall, there was a
   strong inverse association between wealth and poor health status and
   between wealth and mortality.

AB Background: International borders are unique social and environmental
   contexts characterized by high levels of mobility. Among drug users,
   mobility increases risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in part
   through its effects on the social environment. However, the social
   dynamics of drug users living in border regions are understudied.
   Methods: 1056 injection drug users (IDUs) residing in Tijuana, Mexico
   were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS) from 2006 to 2007,
   and underwent surveys and testing for HIV, syphilis, and tuberculosis
   (TB). Using logistic regression on baseline data, we identified
   correlates of having ever injected drugs with someone from the US.
   Results: Almost half (48%) reported ever injecting drugs with someone
   from the US. In RDS-adjusted logistic regression, factors independently
   associated with having ever injected with someone from the US included:
   having greater than middle school education (Adjusted Odds Ratio
   [AOR]2.91; 95% confidence interval [C.I.] 1.52, 5.91), speaking English
   (AOR 3.24, 95% C.I. 1.96, 5.36), age (AOR 1.10 per year; 95% C.I. 1.07,
   1.14), age at initiation of injection drug use (AOR 0.90 per year; 95%
   C.I. 0.86, 0.94), homelessness (AOR 2.61; 95% C.I. 1.27, 5.39), and
   having ever been incarcerated (AOR 11.82; 95% C.I., 5.22, 26.77). No
   associations with HIV, syphilis, TB, drug use, or injection risk
   behavior were detected.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that IOU networks in Mexico and the US may
   transcend international borders, with implications for cross-border
   transmission of infectious disease. Binational programs and policies
   need to consider the structure and geographic distribution of drug using
   networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives The purpose of this study was to examine the association
   between lower socioeconomic status (SES), as ascertained by years of
   education, and outcomes in patients with acute ST-segment elevation
   myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   Background Previous studies have shown an inverse relationship between
   SES and coronary heart disease and mortality. Whether a similar
   association between SES and mortality exists in STEMI patients is
   unknown.
   Methods We evaluated 11,326 patients with STEMI in the GUSTO-III (Global
   Use of Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries) trial study from
   countries that enrolled >500 patients. We evaluated clinical outcomes
   (adjusted using multivariate regression analysis) according to the
   number of years of education completed.
   Results One-year mortality was inversely related to years of education
   and was 5-fold higher in patients with <8 years compared with those with
   >16 years of education (17.5% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.0001). The strength of the
   relationship between education and mortality varied among different
   countries. Nonetheless, years of education remained an independent
   correlate of mortality at day 7 (hazard ratio per year of increase in
   education: 0.86; 95% confidence interval: 0.83 to 0.88) and also between
   day 8 and 1 year (hazard ratio per year of increase in education: 0.96;
   95% confidence interval: 0.94 to 0.98), even after adjustment for
   baseline characteristics and country of enrollment.
   Conclusions When the number of years of education was used as a measure
   of SES, there was an inverse relationship such that significantly higher
   short-term and 1-year mortality existed beyond that accounted for by
   baseline clinical variables and country of enrollment. Future studies
   should account for and investigate the mechanisms underlying this link
   between SES and cardiovascular disease outcomes. (J Am Coll Cardiol

   and causal interpretations must be undertaken with caution since
   individuals in most cases choose with whom to associate. In this paper
   we seek to empirically quantify the causal role of peer social networks
   in explaining marijuana usage among adolescents.
   Methods and Findings: Using data from a nationally representative sample
   of adolescents we utilize a multivariate structural model with
   school-level fixed effects to account for the problems of contextual
   effects, correlated effects and peer selections to purge the potential
   biases from the estimates of peer influence. Our peer group measures are
   drawn not only from the nomination of close friends (N = 6,377), but
   also from classmates (N = 19,335). Marijuana usage among the peer groups
   were constructed using the peers' own report of their marijuana
   consumption. Controlling for parent level characteristics, and other
   demographic parameters, we find that a 10% increase in the proportion of
   close friends and classmates who use marijuana increases the probability
   that an individual chooses to use marijuana by 5%.
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that peer effects are important
   determinants of marijuana use even after controlling for potential
   biases We also found evidence to show that the influence of close
   friends and the more exogenous classmates are quite similar in magnitude
   under our preferred specification, supporting theory predicting the
   importance of peer influence. Effective policy aimed at reducing
   marijuana usage among adolescents would consider these significant peer
   effects.

   between the particular phenomena of homeless service institutions and
   broad cultural contexts. While social science has been somewhat critical
   of the medicalization of homelessness, its shared supposition about the
   self has relegated it to structural critiques that offer little to the
   currently homeless and those who want to help them. In contrast, we
   illuminate a path toward the development of an alternative pedagogy of

   the medical model of homeless service provision.

AB Purpose - This concluding essay suggests how contemporary developments
   in cultural sociology can enrich and extend the American sociology of
   work. While recent studies in the sociology of work consider more fully
   the role of sense making and representations in workers' lives, we
   propose additional possibilities for conceptual and theoretical
   cross-pollination. We propose questions that a cultural sociologist
   might ask about European workers in the age of neo-liberalism.
   Methodology/approach - We examine how authors in this volume and its
   companion (Brady, 2011), and other students of workers approach
   culture-related phenomena. In particular we focus on how they use
   culture as explanans and explananda. Borrowing from Lamont and Small
   (2008) and Small, Harding, and Lamont (2010), we present a set of
   analytical tools that cultural sociologists use widely. We then draw
   from culturally focused studies of workers to illustrate how researchers
   have used these concepts.
   Findings - Research on European workers documents important political
   and economic trends that affect this group, but it examines less
   frequently how individuals understand, experience, and respond to these
   changes. With tools from cultural sociology, we can explore these
   understudied aspects of the conditions and lives of European workers.
   Originality/value of paper - To our knowledge, this is the first
   systematic discussion of how concepts from contemporary cultural
   sociology can enrich research on European workers.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to theorize the relationship
   between diagnosis and medicalization through an examination of the
   medicalization of childhood gender variance and the Gender Identity
   Disorder of Childhood diagnosis.
   Methodology/approach - The chapter examines textual data ( published
   clinical and research literatures, and critiques of the diagnosis
   appearing in a range of venues) to track how childhood gender variance
   is medicalized over time and the role of diagnosis in that
   medicalization.
   Findings - While diagnosis certainly plays a role in shoring up
   medicalization, this case study reveals the many ways in which diagnoses
   may also become key tools in attempts to curtail medicalization.
   Research limitations/implications - As a case study, the findings are
   not generalizable to all diagnoses. As a study of an instance of the
   medicalization of deviance, these findings may be particularly
   applicable to analogous cases.
   Social implications - These findings show the sometimes tenuous nature
   of medicalization processes, and the social uses of diagnoses in those
   processes.
   Originality/value of paper - This chapter sheds light on a relationship
   that is often assumed to be unidirectional (e. g., that the formation of
   diagnosis results in increased medicalization), and answers calls for a
   more nuanced sociology of diagnosis, including greater attention to the
   relationship between diagnosis and medicalization.

AB Purpose - In this chapter, I examine the ways that various trauma
   carriers, including social movements, self-identified survivors,
   professional organizations, and advocates make public claims about
   trauma and the PTSD diagnosis as they work to define moral and political
   issues.
   Methodology/approach - Employing the method of social pattern analysis,
   I analyze a variety of narrative data pertaining to issues such as child
   sexual abuse, war, slavery, and genocide.
   Findings - Trauma carriers engage in significant social memory work and
   collective identity work, define social problems, and practice social
   activism as they address the causes and consequences of psychological
   suffering. Within the context of modern diagnostic psychiatry, the PTSD
   diagnosis stands out as a unique narrative of social illness. The PTSD
   diagnosis is a powerful cultural script that various individuals and
   interest groups use to interpret mental health symptoms while
   attributing psychological consequences to social causes as opposed to
   problems rooted in the individual's psyche (as with psychoanalysis) or
   neurophysiology (as with modern diagnostic psychiatry). By implication,
   the social world must be "cured'' for the individual to be healthy.
   Originality/value of paper - I detail the unique sociocognitive
   implications of the PTSD diagnosis, highlighting its impact on our
   collective understanding of particular traumatic experiences and the
   shared nature of posttraumatic affect. I show the relevance of social
   memory studies, the more broadly conceived sociology of culture and
   cognition - especially as it pertains to collective identity and
   classification norms, the sociology of health-focused social movements,
   and the analysis of social problems claims-making to an emerging
   sociology of diagnosis.

AB Purpose - To assess labeling and social control of clients in
   contemporary mental health care organizations.
   Methodology/approach - Fifteen months of observation in two
   multi-service mental health care organizations, interviews with workers
   and clients, and analysis of organizational documents.
   Findings - The organizations used a variety of organizational labels,
   both official and informal, which served distinct purposes in
   organizational life and which did not always agree in their construction
   of the client. Official mental illness diagnosis was a bureaucratic
   label, while informal labels determined the types of social control to
   which clients were subjected. Clients who were informally labeled
   severely mentally ill were subject to integrative social control, while
   exclusionary social control was applied to those informally seen as not
   being severely mentally ill. Unlike in classic studies of mental health
   care, looping processes, in which client behaviors are viewed as
   symptoms, do not reliably predict the types of labels or social control
   applied to clients.
   Implications - It is important for a sociology of diagnosis to
   contextualize official diagnosis in the repertoire of organizational
   labels applied to clients in mental health care, recognizing that it
   plays a limited but important role in organizational life. Informal
   labels, which at time conflict with official diagnosis, play a more
   prominent role in the management of everyday organizational life.

AB Purpose - Intersexuality is examined from a sociology of diagnosis frame
   to show how the diagnostic process is connected to other social
   constructions, offer new support that medical professionals define
   illness in ways that sometimes carries negative consequences, and
   illustrate how the medical profession holds on to authority in the face
   of patient activism.
   Methodology/approach - Data collection occurred over a two-year period
   (October 2008 to August 2010). Sixty-two in-depth interviews were
   conducted with individuals connected to the intersex community including
   adults with intersexuality, parents, medical professionals, and intersex
   activists.
   Findings - Medical professionals rely on essentialist understandings of
   gender to justify the medicalization of intersexuality, which they
   currently are doing through a nomenclature shift away from intersex
   terminology in favor of disorders of sex development (DSD) language.
   This shift allows medical professionals to reassert their authority and
   reclaim jurisdiction over intersexuality in light of intersex activism
   that was successfully framing intersexuality as a social rather than
   biological problem.
   Practical implications - This chapter encourages critical thought and
   action from activists and medical professionals about shifts in intersex
   medical management.
   Social implications - Intersexuality might be experienced in less
   stigmatizing ways by those personally impacted.
   Originality/value - The value of this research is that it connects the
   sociology of diagnosis literature with gender scholarship. Additional
   value comes from the data, which were collected after the 2006
   nomenclature shift.

AB Purpose - I analyze how laypersons and professionals navigate challenges
   to the legitimacy of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD).
   The disorder is modeled as a cultural object manifested in the
   discursive practices of multiple actors forming a knowledge coalition of
   professionals, laypersons, governmental, and corporate actors. Coalition
   members faced challenges to the disorder derived from popular skepticism
   and from professional's contradictory knowledge claims and diagnostic
   practices.
   Methods - I observed these processes in a two-year, ethnographic case
   study supplemented with a two-stage, open-ended interview with core
   members of an AD/HD informational and support group.
   Findings - Parents and coalitional professionals managed these
   challenges differently depending on the status of the source
   (professional vs. nonprofessional) and the alignment (within the
   coalition vs. nonaligned) of the challenge. Nonprofessional skeptics
   were easily countered as ignorant moralists who lacked objective
   knowledge of the disorder - a tactic termed credentialism. The
   contradictory diagnoses and treatments of professionals were managed as
   instances of mal-diagnosis a construct employed by both professionals
   aligned with the diagnosis and laypersons associated with the disorder.
   Finally, while parents actively sought a diagnosis as an objective
   valorization of their status, they remained skeptical of AD/HD; however,
   in achieving diagnosis they also worried that the methods used to
   establish a diagnosis were possibly unreliable.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the emergent sociology of
   diagnosis by describing the techniques used by laypersons and some
   professionals in maintaining a contentious diagnosis.

AB Purpose - This chapter discusses the proposed changes in the Diagnostic
   and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), which eliminates
   Asperger's disorder (AD) and replaces it as "autism spectrum disorder.''
   Implications of these changes on the identity of adults with AD and the
   influence of everyday life experiences will be addressed.
   Methodology/approach - This research is based on 19 interviews with
   adults diagnosed or self-diagnosed with AD. Central themes surrounding
   issues of identity and everyday life experiences were determined using
   grounded theory approaches.
   Findings - This study demonstrates how the diagnosis and self-diagnosis
   of AD is fused with individual identity. It also shows how Asperger
   identity is positively embraced. The proposed changes to eliminate AD in
   DSM-V threaten these assertions of Asperger identity, which could
   potentially enhance stigma experienced by people with AD. Regardless of
   its removal, Asperger identity must be considered within the broader
   context of people's everyday lives and how experiences in social
   interaction and communication can be strong agents of identity
   construction.
   Social implications - The proposed changes to eliminate AD in DSM-V is a
   social issue that will impact individuals with Asperger's and their
   families, as well as health-care professionals, health insurers,
   researchers, state agencies, and educational providers.
   Originality/value of paper - This chapter offers a unique insight into
   identity construction based on the diagnosis and self-diagnosis of AD.

AB Purpose - The aim of this study was to examine the retrospective
   accounts of young adults who were diagnosed with ADHD in childhood to
   explore how children diagnosed with ADHD learn about and experience
   their diagnoses.
   Methodology - Ten 18-22 year-olds who were diagnosed with ADHD in
   childhood participated in semi-structured, in-depth interviews. The
   interviews were transcribed verbatim, coded, and emergent themes were
   identified.
   Findings - Data analysis revealed that children often experience both
   aspects of stigma and empowerment as they learn about and make sense of
   their diagnoses. The data suggest that parents, who often act as
   mediators between the medical community and their children, delivering
   and explaining diagnoses to their children, can influence this process
   greatly. Parents can help children utilize their diagnoses to develop
   coping strategies for their disorder, or exacerbate stigma by
   withholding information about diagnoses. Participants suggested that
   parents should talk openly about diagnoses with children and offer
   coping strategies to employ.
   Research limitations - Findings are based on retrospective accounts, and
   the participants' views are not intended to be representative of the
   views of all children with ADHD. A goal of future research is to expand
   this study to other pools of participants, including children.
   Practical implications - The findings can inform the delivery and
   management of children's ADHD diagnoses.
   Originality/value - The current study adds to research on the sociology
   of diagnosis and medicalization of mental health by examining the
   experiences of children diagnosed with ADHD.

AB Purpose - Since the mid-20th century, drug addiction in America has
   increasingly been redefined as a disease and diagnosed as a widespread
   yet treatable disorder. The idiosyncrasies of addiction as a disease,
   however, have tended to block the journey of the addict from stigmatized
   moral failure to therapeutic reprieve. Centering in on the process of
   the "court-led diagnosis'' of addiction, this qualitative case study
   uses ethnography and interviewing at a county drug court and one of its
   "partner'' therapeutic communities to examine the process in detail,
   from the first negotiations between treatment and court personnel over
   the eligibility of the client, to the gradual inculcation of an addict
   identity by means of intensive cognitive education and behavioral
   modification.
   Methodology/approach - Qualitative: ethnography and interviews.
   Findings - We demonstrate that a shift from moral judgment to
   therapeutic sympathy is particularly unlikely for the fast-growing mass
   of criminal offenders whose diagnosis is spearheaded by the state in the
   form of the therapeutic jurisprudence of the drug court. For this group,
   the emphasis on the need for comprehensive resocialization and the close
   cooperation between the intimacies of therapeutic "rehab'' and the
   strong arm of criminal justice "backup'' not only maintains, but
   intensifies, moral tutelage, and stigmatization.
   Social implications - The convergence of drug treatment and criminal
   justice tends to produce yet another stigmatizing biologization of
   poverty and race, lending scientific validity to new forms of
   criminalizing and medicalizing social hardship.

AB Purpose - To explore the ideological effects and social control
   potential of diagnostic biopsychiatry and encourage the sociology of
   diagnosis to retain key insights of early medicalization scholarship.
   Methodology - As the sociology of diagnosis emerges from medicalization,
   it is imperative that the new sub-specialty retains the critical edge of
   the early scholarship. With this in mind the paper reviews key aspects
   of the medicalization thesis, emphasizing the links between medical
   definitions and social control processes (e. g. Conrad, 1992; Conrad &
   Schneider, 1992; Zola, 1972). Based on this review scholars are urged to
   be mindful of the "diagnostic imaginary'' - a way of thinking that
   conceals the presence of the social in diagnoses, and which closes off
   critical analysis of the existential-connectedness and political nature
   of diagnoses.
   Findings - The paradigm shift from dynamic to diagnostic psychiatry in
   DSM-III opened the door to a new biomedical model that has enhanced
   American psychiatry's scientific aura and prestige. With the increased
   presence and ordinariness of diagnoses in everyday life, an illusory
   view of diagnoses as scientific entities free of cultural ties has
   emerged, intensifying the dangers of medical social control.
   Social implications - By illustrating that diagnoses are cultural
   objects imbued with political meaning, the ideological effects and
   social control potential of diagnostic biopsychiatry may be mitigated.

   Methodology - It builds on an analysis of ethnographic fieldnotes, which

   neighborhood.
   Findings - The case is made that the children were oppressed by adults
   in the school. Being in school was almost a wholly negative experience
   for children. Students' active strategies to protect the self were
   ineffective, which led to their shutting down emotionally. Like adults
   in similar social contexts, children's energy was devoted to
   self-protection rather than to being a student.

AB For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx
   are complementary contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist
   society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's
   critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of
   reification, Georg Lukacs contended that the combination of Marx's and
   Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially
   transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By
   comparing Lukacs's theory of reification with Habermas's theory of
   communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian
   Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of "doing theory'' has shifted
   from Marx's critique of economic determinism to Weber's idea of the
   inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an
   important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself
   as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions
   of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social
   value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second
   step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to
   each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of
   communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of
   social organization.

AB My main point is that the 1920s Chicago School got its scholastic or
   school-like quality primarily from its notion of what a human being is,
   from its social psychology, and only secondarily from its sociology.
   These sociologists developed the novel idea that humans are constituted
   by symbolic or cultural elements, not biological forces or instincts.
   They applied Franz Boas's discovery of culture to human nature and the
   self. In particular, they showed that ethnic groups and their
   subcultures are not biologically determined or driven by fixed
   instincts. In the 1910s and 1920s, the Americanization movement held
   that ethnic groups could be ranked on how intelligent, how criminal, and
   therefore how fit for democracy they were. This powerful movement, the
   extreme wing of which was lead by the Northern Ku Klux Klan, advocated
   different levels of citizenship for different ethnic groups. The Chicago
   sociologists spearheaded the idea that humans have a universal nature,
   are all the same ontologically, and therefore all the same morally and
   legally. In this way, they strengthened the foundations of civil
   liberties. The Chicago professors advanced their position in a quiet,
   low-keyed manner, the avoidance of open political controversy being the
   academic style of the time. Their position was nevertheless quite potent
   and effective. The actual sociology of the school, also quite important,
   was largely an expression of the democratic social psychology. In
   addition, the sociology was dignified and elevated by the moral capital
   of their theory of human nature.

AB Eliminating health disparities is a Healthy People goal. Given the
   diverse and sometimes broad definitions of health disparities commonly
   used, a subcommittee convened by the Secretary's Advisory Committee for
   Healthy People 2020 proposed an operational definition for use in
   developing objectives and targets, determining resource allocation
   priorities, and assessing progress.
   Based on that subcommittee's work, we propose that health disparities
   are systematic, plausibly avoidable health differences adversely
   affecting socially disadvantaged groups; they may reflect social
   disadvantage, but causality need not be established. This definition,
   grounded in ethical and human rights principles, focuses on the subset
   of health differences reflecting social injustice, distinguishing health
   disparities from other health differences also warranting concerted
   attention, and from health differences in general.
   We explain the definition, its underlying concepts, the challenges it
   addresses, and the rationale for applying it to United States public
   health policy. (Am J Public Health. 2011;101:S149-S155.

AB Approximately 300,000 child soldiers serve in various armed groups
   around the world, and become directly implicated in the perpetration of
   kidnappings, killings, and torture. Considering that children construct
   moral concepts and a sense of themselves as moral beings in the context
   of their everyday interactions with others, the concern with how their
   harrowing experiences of violence may affect their moral development is
   particularly compelling. To date, however, no research has been
   conducted examining how these youths grapple with the violence they have
   perpetrated and how they reconcile their own actions with a view of
   themselves as moral people. In this paper, I review the limitations of
   constructs relying on moral disengagement and post-traumatic stress,
   which are typically used for examining the aftermaths of violence
   perpetration, and outline a new framework grounded on the normative
   developmental process whereby children grapple with their experiences of
   wrongdoing. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This paper addresses the relationship between identity and learning and
   how their integration in adolescence is an important part of short- and

   stance' that puts emphasis on collaborative practice aimed at changing
   the world and enacted by individual activist contributions as the
   grounding for both identity and learning. We further focus on
   critical-theoretical knowledge as a tool for identity development and a
   catalyst for merging identity and learning. The developmental trajectory
   of an adolescent boy living in a group home and participating in a
   collaborative transformative project showcases a dramatic personal
   transformation from a victim of oppressive circumstances to an agent of
   social change with a meaningful life agenda resulting from a merger of
   his evolving commitment to contribute to transforming his present
   community practice and of his growing immersion in critical-theoretical
   learning. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Previous studies point out that family experience is strongly linked to
   adolescents' adjustment in school and has a central status in the field
   of educational sociology. However, the mechanism that operates between
   parental marital discord and Taiwanese adolescent children's future
   academic achievement is not clear. The purposes of this study were to
   examine the impact of parental marital conflict on adolescents' academic
   achievement and to determine if maternal parenting practices mediated or
   moderated the impact. Drawing on responses from 931 pairs of Taiwanese
   mothers and adolescent children, a longitudinal data collection approach
   using panel design provided repeated measurement of marital discord.
   Over the course of two years, adolescents reported on their academic
   achievements and their perceptions of maternal parenting practices while
   mothers completed questionnaires evaluating marital discord. The results
   of this study supported a spilled-over effect (partial mediation) model
   but failed to support a compensation (moderation) model. Overall,
   marital discord not only had a direct negative effect on adolescent
   academic achievement but also demonstrated an indirect impact through
   less desirable and adverse parenting practices with adolescent children.

AB Purpose - The paper aims to describe the inadequate nature of both
   "mono-objectivist" approaches, which deny any role of social influence
   in science, and relativist social constructions, which fail to
   distinguish between science and pseudoscience. It outlines an
   alternative conceptual framework that allows for the possibility of
   social construction of science, while preventing epistemological
   relativism.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes the cybernetic concept
   of recursion to show how science can bend back on itself, investigating
   its own foundations, without undermining its ability to improve our
   empirical understanding of the world. The paper makes use of several
   case studies to define specific mechanisms that show how the process of
   knowledge production in science can steer a course between reduction to
   a single "right answer," and fragmentation into subjective
   interpretations.
   Findings - The paper concludes by showing how the cybernetic recursion
   of multiple objectivity can also be applied to cybernetics itself. In
   particular, it suggests that such recursive investigations allow us to
   reconsider the Law of Requisite Variety, and envision an alternative
   form that can better account for the complexity that arises in
   self-generating systems.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is unlikely to be of
   use to scientists looking for epistemological proof of singular right
   answers, or social constructivists looking for proof of epistemological
   relativism.
   Practical implications - The paper suggests that researchers in
   constructivism need not limit their work for fear that it will lead to
   relativist conclusions.
   Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified need to offer an
   alternative to current developments in the field of science and
   technology studies.

   highlighting the integration of sociology with social policy. I discuss
   the personal, social, and intellectual experiences, ranging from
   childhood to adult life, that influenced my pursuit of studies in race
   and ethnic relations and urban poverty. I then focus on how the academic
   and public reaction to these studies increased my concerns about the
   relationship between social science and public policy, as well as my
   attempts to make my work more accessible to a general audience. In the
   process, I discuss how the academic awards and honors I received based
   on these studies enhanced my involvement in the national policy arena. I
   conclude this essay with some thoughts about public agenda research and
   productive controversy based on my own unique experiences. In short,
   this autobiographical essay shows how a scholar can engage academics,
   policy makers, and the media concerned with bow sociological knowledge
   can inform a policy agenda on some of the nation's most important social
   problems.

AB A common complaint about the sociology of deviance, particularly the
   perspective known as labeling theory or the societal reaction
   perspective, is that the field is dead. However, considerable evidence
   suggests that the core themes of societal reaction work live on in
   several areas of contemporary scholarship. After identifying and
   describing three key strands of the early societal reaction perspective,
   I consider how those strands are reflected in more recent work, much of
   which does not explicitly reference the earlier tradition. I identify
   the ways that recent scholarship builds upon and yet extends the earlier
   societal reaction tradition. I close by describing three trajectories
   emerging in recent work that should focus future inquiry: the contingent
   effects of labeling, the causes of gaps between social control discourse
   and practice, and the diffusion of social control practices from
   deviants to nondeviants.

AB Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociological attention to
   understanding the roots of self-destruction has been inconsistent. hi
   this review, we use three historical periods of interest (pre-Durkheim,
   Durkheim, post-Durkheim) to organize basic findings in the body of
   sociological knowledge regarding suicide. Much of the twentieth-century
   research focused on issues of integration and regulation, imitation, and
   the social construction of suicide rates. Innovations in the
   twenty-first-century resurgence of sociological research on suicide are
   described in detail. These newer studies begin to redirect theory and
   analysis toward a focus on ethnoracial subgroups, individual-level
   phenomena (e.g., ideation), and age-period-cohort effects. Our analysis
   of sociology's contributions, limits, and possibilities leads to a
   recognition of the need to break through bifurcations in individual- and
   aggregate-level studies, to pursue the translation of Durkheim's
   original theory into a network perspective as one avenue of guiding
   micro-macro research, and to attend to the complexity in both
   multidisciplinary explanations and pragmatic interventions.

AB Lion numbers are in steep decline in Africa. Lions have been eliminated
   from agricultural areas, and pastoralists have lost tolerance for
   predators; ready availability of cheap and effective poison poses a
   critical threat to their survival in Kenya outside of the largest
   national parks. However, lions still thrive on the commercial ranchlands
   of Laikipia District, where landowners use traditional low-cost African
   methods of livestock husbandry to effectively protect domestic stock
   from predators. Thus, Laikipia has been an ideal laboratory in which to
   investigate the ecology of predators living in human-dominated
   landscapes and factors in management of both livestock and lions which
   allow coexistence between them. Although socioeconomically
   unrepresentative of most African rangelands, the Laikipia experience
   shows that it is easy to raise livestock in the presence of viable
   populations of large carnivores if people have incentive and motivation
   to take basic, traditional measures to keep them apart. The current lack
   of financial incentives for rural Kenyans to tolerate wildlife, however,
   may limit the usefulness of the Laikipia model to privately owned lands.

AB The act of killing predators over livestock predation has been the
   principal cause of declining predator populations throughout Africa.
   Finding solutions for the coexistence of people with predators in the
   Ewaso region is of great importance for the local tourism industry and
   for the persistence of Kenya's wildlife outside of protected areas. We
   report results of an assessment of attitudes toward predators by
   landholders and land users in the Ewaso region and their tolerance of
   livestock losses, relative to socioeconomic factors. Although prospects
   are good for predator conservation on large-scale private ranches, the
   future of predators on communally owned properties remains uncertain.
   Prospects would be improved not only by finding solutions to reduce
   livestock depredation but also by ensuring that individuals tolerating
   losses from predators receive benefits from having predators on their
   land. Additionally, policy changes are needed to allow landholders to
   capitalize on benefits from wildlife, which would encourage their
   participation in wildlife conservation.

AB Between 1963 and 1997, the average carbon emissions intensity of all
   American states decreased by roughly 30%, meaning there was almost
   three-tenths less carbon emitted for every dollar of economic growth,
   adjusting for inflation. However, decreasing emissions intensity did not
   translate into a reduction in overall carbon emissions. A
   first-differenced, cross-sectional, autoregressive time-series analysis
   at the state level reveals that the increase in emissions still depended
   on inflation-adjusted economic growth, even when controlling for the
   effects of changes in population size and percent of economy in the
   industrial sector. For the period examined, 1963-1997, these findings
   represent the Jevons paradox as emphasized by political economists in
   environmental sociology. The implications suggest that the benefits to
   the climate from technological improvements have been minimal because
   the political economy of capitalism has not been addressed.

AB A growing demand for transparency and accountability in local
   decision-making has grown substantially in recent years due to an
   increasing awareness of finite natural resources. Sustainable
   development captures the interrelatedness of the economy, the
   environment and social expectations. In addition, transparency in the
   decision-making process provides the public a method of accountability
   for public funds. The Capital Structures Model developed in this paper
   addresses the demand for accountability by focusing on local development
   projects classified by type of capital (built, human, social and
   natural) in order to provide information to the average constituent
   regarding specific county and community development projects. Local
   assets are initially categorized according to the type of capital to
   which they most contribute, and then indicators are employed to measure
   the contribution of a project with respect to increasing the capacity of
   each type of capital. These indicators are then cross-referenced with
   local policy to demonstrate how that policy is implemented in local
   development projects, and which policies contribute to which type of
   capital. It is the intention of this model to create an informative tool
   for planners and constituencies that monitors how development projects
   contribute to communities in terms of each of the four types of capital.

AB Migration is arguably one of the most important processes that link
   ecological and social systems across scales. Humans (and other
   organisms) tend to move in pursuit of better resources (both social and
   environmental). Such mobility may serve as a coping mechanism for
   short-term local-scale dilemmas and as a means of distributing organisms
   in relation to resources. Movement also may be viewed as a shift to a
   larger scale; that is, while it may solve short-term local problems, it
   may simultaneously have longer term and larger scale consequences. We
   conduct a quantitative analysis using dynamic modeling motivated by an
   archaeological case study to explore the dynamics that arise when
   population movement serves as a link between spatial scales. We use the
   model to characterize how ecological and social factors can lead to
   spatial variation in resource exploitation, and to investigate the
   circumstances under which migration may enhance or reduce the capacity
   of the system to absorb shocks at different scales.

   propositions reported in a 2006 special feature, and 2) reflect on four
   main ideas that are more specific to the archaeological cases: i)
   societal choices are influenced by robustness-vulnerability trade-offs,
   ii) there is interplay between robustness-vulnerability trade-offs and
   robustness-performance trade-offs, iii) societies often get locked in to
   particular strategies, and iv) multiple positive feedbacks escalate the
   perceived cost of societal change. We then discuss whether these lock-in
   traps can be prevented or whether the risks associated with them can be
   mitigated. We conclude by highlighting how these long-term historical
   studies can help us to understand current society, societal practices,
   and the nexus between ecology and society.

PY 2011
AB Dendrochronological collections include continuously expanding
   multi-taxon records of tree growth that encompass millennia and often
   offer irreplaceable sources of biological, environmental, and cultural
   information. Nevertheless, each departure of a scholar from the field
   whether because of death, retirement, career change, shift in research
   priorities, or even move to a new institution places collections in
   increased danger of being lost as viable resources. Without an organized
   and concerted effort to address outstanding and future issues of
   specimen curation, dendrochronology as a whole may become mired in the
   same trap that befalls many other scientific fields: collections apathy.
   Dendrochronological collections exist as a result of decades of effort
   and should function to support current and future scientific endeavors,
   education, and outreach, but cannot do so without adequate attention to
   their future. Intended as a "call to arms" this paper, focused on
   dendrochronology in the academic and public sector, aims to encourage
   discussion and, more importantly, to provide a foundation for and to
   instill a sense of urgency regarding long-term preservation of
   dendrochronological specimens.

PY 2011
AB There are at least 21 dendro-data formats used in dendrochronology
   laboratories around the world. Many of these formats are read by a
   limited number of programs, thereby inhibiting collaboration, limiting
   critical review of analyses, and risking the long-term accessibility of
   datasets. Some of the older formats are supported by a single program
   and are falling into disuse, opening the risk for data to become
   obsolete and unreadable. These formats also have a variety of flaws,
   including but not limited to no accurate method for denoting measuring
   units, little or no metadata support, lack of support for variables
   other than whole ring widths (e.g. earlywood/latewood widths, ratios and
   density). The proposed long-term solution is the adoption of a universal
   data standard such as the Tree-Ring Data Standard (TRiDaS). In the short
   and medium term, however, a tool is required that is capable of
   converting not only back and forth to this standard, but between any of
   the existing formats in use today. Such a tool is also required to
   provide continued access to data archived in obscure formats. This paper
   describes TRiCYCLE, a new application that does just this. TRiCYCLE is
   an open-source, cross-platform, desktop application for the conversion
   of the most commonly used data formats. Two open source Java libraries
   upon which TRiCYCLE depends are also described. These libraries can be
   used by developers to implement support for all data formats within
   their own applications.

AB Drawing on Williams' distinction between thin and thick ethical
   concepts, I argue that current moral neuroscience and psychology
   unwarrantedly restrict their researches to thin morality only.
   Experiments typically investigate subjects' judgments about rightness,
   appropriateness, or permissibility, that is, thin concepts. The nature
   and workings of thick concepts - e. g., dignity, integrity, humanness,
   cruelty, pettiness, exploitation, or fanaticism - have not been
   empirically investigated; hence, they are absent from recent theories
   about morality. This may seem like a minor oversight, which some
   additional research can redress. I argue that the fix is not that
   simple: thick concepts challenge one of the theoretical backbones of
   much moral psychology and neuroscience; they challenge the conception of
   a hardwired and universal moral capacity in a way that thin concepts do
   not. In the conclusion I argue that the burgeoning science of morality
   should include both thin and thick, and that it should include the
   contributions of psychologists and neuroscientists as well as those of
   anthropologists, historians, and sociologists.

AB Restoring salmon is a complex organizational as well as technical
   endeavor. The Washington Salmon Recovery Planning Act has played a key
   role in these efforts by stimulating the creation of local planning
   organizations known as lead entities. This study utilizes conceptual and
   theoretical tools from organizational sociology to analyze regulative,
   normative, and cultural-cognitive institutional forces shaping the
   structure and behavior of lead entity organizations in the Puget Sound
   region. Findings demonstrate that the regulative influence of the act
   only partly explains the distinct structure and behavior of lead
   entities. Other institutional influences such as the normative
   importance of technically driven salmon recovery approaches and the
   culture of localism embedded in these multiparty groups are equally
   important in explaining the organization of lead entity planning.
   Results from this study illustrate how research built upon theoretical
   insights from organizational sociology may provide planners with novel
   insights into the organization of natural resource management.

AB Sociologists have developed a wide range of pedagogical strategies to
   facilitate student learning about racial/ethnic, class, and gender
   inequalities. Despite the growing subdiscipline of the sociology of the
   body and evidence pointing to the prevalence of inequalities based on
   physical attractiveness, the pedagogical literature has yet to develop
   strategies for teaching students about biases based on physical
   attractiveness. In this article, the authors report on a pedagogical
   module that involves student evaluations of photographs (depicting
   individuals ranging in levels of physical attractiveness) using semantic
   differential scales, and discuss the results of this evaluation. The
   authors test for student learning outcomes through (1) a one-group
   pretest-posttest design and (2) an assessment survey with both
   qualitative and quantitative components. Because this photograph
   evaluation typically illustrates students' beauty biases, a discussion
   of these results, paired with relevant readings, provides a powerful
   tool for the exchange of ideas about physical attractiveness biases.

   Through analyzing students' course reflection journals and the results
   of pre- and posttests, the authors demonstrate how CBR can help students
   gain a better command of the research process and enhance student
   attitudes toward community service. After participating in CBR, the
   authors find that students indicate greater proficiency in undertaking
   the entire research process, from creating and implementing a research

AB In the cosmology of Western industrial societies, oprogresso results
   from human creativity enacted in facilitating circumstances. In human
   history, creativity leading to progress was supposedly enabled by the
   development of agriculture, which provided surplus energy and freed
   people from needing to spend full time in subsistence pursuits. Applying
   this belief to the matter of sustainability today leads to the
   supposition that we can voluntarily reduce resource use by choosing a
   simpler way of life with lower consumption. Recent research suggests
   that these beliefs are deeply inaccurate. Humans develop complex
   behaviors and institutions to solve problems. Complexity and problem
   solving carry costs and require resources. Rather than emerging from
   surplus energy, cultural complexity often precedes the availability of
   energy and compels increases in its production. This suggests that, with
   major problems converging in coming decades, voluntary reductions in
   resource consumption may not be feasible. Future sustainability will
   require continued high levels of energy consumption.

   is actually completed. Third, the massive size of the project may also

   new imaginaries are to be discerned and effectively shared in ways that

AB Agricultural development and climate change will be two of the major

   Environmental licensing for rural properties is being implemented in
   several states in the Brazilian Amazon with the goal of restoring
   forests in agricultural landscapes and mediating the impacts of these
   stressors. This study presents an agent-based model of ranching and land
   exchange, informs it with empirical results from social research in the
   Ji-Parana River Basin, Rondonia, Brazil, and investigates the social,
   economic, and environmental outcomes that can be expected as a result of
   environmental licensing in the context of climate change. Model results
   informed by these data suggest that although an environmental licensing
   scheme with monitoring and enforcement may increase the level of
   forested land in ranching landscapes, it may do so at the expense of the
   small producer. To the extent that effective monitoring and enforcement
   exist, a focus on larger holdings will help to mediate this negative
   social impact. These results suggest that a middle ground can be found
   in cases where current environmental goals conflict with legacies of
   past colonization and resource-use regimes.

   knowledge that, for most areas in North America, indigenous people have
   intervened, with respect, for generations. The Mission Mountains Tribal
   Wilderness in Montana, though not part of the National Wilderness
   Preservation System, was designated to protect many of these same values
   but also extend to protect important cultural meanings assigned to this
   wild landscape. Protecting the relationship between indigenous people
   and relatively intact, complex systems, which we commonly refer to as
   wilderness in North America, can be an important contributor to
   sustainability of the landscape and cultural heritage.

AB Research into environmental concern and behavior has been extensive in
   the past few decades. The connection between the two, as well as other
   related variables, has however remained somewhat elusive. This study
   attempts to refine our understanding of how concern for the environment
   is related to pro-environmental behavior such as buying ecologically
   friendly products, driving less, conserving resources at home,
   recycling, etc., by considering the role played by social structural
   context and self-efficacy. Furthermore, through principle component
   analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is
   identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social
   structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators
   of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental
   behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the
   availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to
   additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling.

AB The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, in cooperation with
   United States Forest Service, has implemented a risk management program
   to fund local government action aimed at containing the exotic invasive
   oak tree pathogen, Ceratocystis fagacearum the causal agent of oak wilt.
   In administering the oak wilt ReLeaf program, the Minnesota Department
   of Natural Resources and United States Forest Service sought to
   facilitate efficient and effective management through enabling and
   mobilizing local land managers. Because the program is decentralized and
   because cities and counties are heterogeneous, local land managers take
   advantage of the program in different ways. Our goal in this study was
   to document the social and institutional variation in oak wilt
   management programs at the local (city and county) level, and provide
   preliminary insights into the causes of the variation. Specifically we
   asked: what factors constrain and facilitate oak wilt management at the
   local level; and how do ReLeaf program funds influence local management?
   To address these questions, we completed 12 in-depth qualitative
   interviews with foresters and private contractors, yielding information
   on 16 oak wilt management programs in the Minneapolis/St. Paul
   metropolitan area, Minnesota, USA. Through our analysis we identified
   five emergent themes that produce and reflect the overall variation in
   oak wilt management programs: (1) existence and enforcement of Potential
   Spore Producing Tree removal ordinances; (2) amount of local resources
   and potential effect of decrease in state funding; (3) differences
   across urban and rural areas; (4) differences in program goals and
   landowner cost sharing structures; and (5) ability to attain the
   Minnesota Department of Natural Resources' suppression goal. These
   findings describe factors contributing to variation across oak wilt
   management programs, illustrate challenges facing local invasive species
   management efforts, and provide insights for designing improved invasive
   species management programs at the federal, state and local level. (C)

AB Surveying three generations of comparative sociologists, separated by
   abrupt discontinuities, the study reaches the conclusion that the
   original promise of comparative sociology set in motion a century ago
   remains largely unfulfilled. It will then be argued that the work of the
   third generation of comparative sociologists on civilizational analysis
   and multiple modernities can redeem the promise of comparative sociology
   by rectifying the neglect of developmental patterns in other
   civilizations and recovering the fundamental relevance of the periphery.
   The third generation is thus seeking to undo the erasure of the
   historical experience of a very sizeable portion of humankind from the
   foundation of social theory. This argument is illustrated by selective
   reference to the concept of the nation- state, and comparisons of
   civilizational processes and developmental patterns that stem from
   different religions and traditions and generate varieties of
   nationalism, alternative modernities and patterns of secularization.

AB As the Industrial Revolution and the Electric Revolution turn our
   acoustic environment into a 'lo-fi' soundscape, modern communication
   tends to evolve into an escalating 'volume war' where one shouts, yells,
   cries and screams. This article challenges the assumption that 'volume
   is power' and explores an alternative mode of vocal emission the
   whisper. Weak in volume and yet persistent in resonance, evanescent in
   space and yet lingering in time, elusive to knowledge and yet haunting
   to unconscious desires, whispering questions some key assumptions about
   the relationships among voice, body, space and power. Commonly used in
   private address (by mothers, lovers and friends), whispering bears the
   imprint of domesticity and is seldom related to publicness. When
   associated with politics (e. g. the whispering politicians), it reminds
   us of secret plots, double dealings and the obscene underside of
   publicness. Is whispering doomed to turn sour when it enters the public
   space? Can we bring out its subversive power and make it a political
   act? This article explores the various ramifications of whispering in
   physiology, theology, sociology, psychoanalysis, ethics and theorizes a
   new type of political agency that is urgently needed in our contemporary
   lo-fi world - the world of acoustic claustrophobia and attention
   deficit.

AB This article proposes a novel theoretical vision on the motivations
   behind the usage of conservation tillage technology. The metaeconomic
   model focuses on the two basic driving factors of individual behavior:
   the drive fir closeness/unity with the environment that is shared with
   others, and a desire to control the environment while pursuing
   self-interest. This model integrates a more conventional approach to
   studying conservation with advances in sociology and psychology and
   suggests the presence of dual, often conflicting yet joint motives. Both
   the shared other-interest and the preference for control over outcomes
   temper the self-interest, as posited in metaeconomic theory.
   Metaeconomics gives both new theoretical ground and an empirical
   justification for designing policies that integrate and balance ethical
   suasion with financial incentives. It also gives a scientific basis for
   encouraging policy processes and programs directed at helping evolve a
   new shared other-interest in conservation outcomes within communities.

AB HIV prevalence has increased faster in the southern USA than in other
   areas, and persons living with HIV (PLWHIV) in the south are often
   rural, impoverished, or otherwise under-resourced. Studies of urban
   PLWHIV and those receiving medical care suggest that use of social
   services can enhance quality of life and some medical outcomes, but
   little is known about patterns of social service utilization and need
   among rural southern PLWHIV. The AIDS Alabama needs assessment survey,
   conducted in 2007, sampled a diverse community cohort of 476 adult
   PLWHIV representative of the HIV-positive population in Alabama (66%
   male, 76% Black, and 26% less than high school education). We developed
   service utilization/need (SUN) scores for each of 14 social services,
   and used regression models to determine demographic predictors of those
   most likely to need each service. We then conducted an exploratory
   factor analysis to determine whether certain services clustered together
   for the sample. Case management, assistance obtaining medical care, and
   financial assistance were most commonly used or needed by respondents.
   Black respondents were more likely to have higher SUN scores for alcohol
   treatment and for assistance with employment, housing, food, financial,
   and pharmacy needs; respondents without spousal or partner relationships
   had higher SUN scores for substance use treatment. Female respondents
   were more likely to have higher SUN scores for childcare assistance.
   Black respondents and unemployed respondents were more likely to have
   SUN scores in the highest quartile of the overall score distribution.
   Factor analysis yielded three main factors: basic needs, substance use
   treatment, and legal/medical needs. These data provide important
   information about rural southern PLWHIV and their needs for ancillary
   services. They also suggest clusters of service needs that often occur
   among PLWHIV, which may help case managers and other service providers
   work proactively to identify important gaps in care.

   overview of current arguments and frameworks for testing and developing
   a comprehensive set of health behavior theories. In addition, the
   authors make a unique contribution to the HIV health behavior theory
   literature by moving beyond current health behavior theory critiques to
   argue that one of the field's preexisting, but less popular theories,
   Social Action Theory (SAT), offers a pragmatic and broad framework to
   address many of the accuracy issues within HIV health behavior theory.
   The authors conclude this article by offering a comprehensive plan for
   validating model accuracy, variable influence, and behavioral

   (HAART) has recently increased. Between January and April 2008, we
   assessed the sexual behaviors of 247 HIV-infected South Indians in care.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine
   predictors of being in a HIV-seroconcordant primary relationship, being
   sexually active, and reporting unprotected sex. Over three-fourths (80%)
   of participants were HAART-experienced. Among the 58% of participants
   who were currently in a seroconcordant relationship, one-third were
   serodiscordant when enrolling into care. Approximately two-thirds
   (63.2%) of participants were sexually active; 9.0% reported unprotected
   sex. In the multivariable analyses, participants who were in a
   seroconcordant primary relationship were more likely to have children,
   use alcohol, report unprotected sex, and have been enrolled in care for
   >12 months. Sexually active participants were more likely to be on
   HAART, have a prior tuberculosis diagnosis, test Herpes simplex type 2
   antibody seropositive, and have low general health perceptions.
   Participants who reported unprotected sex were more likely to be in a
   seroconcordant relationship, be childless, want to have a child, and use
   alcohol. We did not document an association between HAART and
   unprotected sex. Among HIV-infected Indians in primary care, predictors
   of unprotected sex included alcohol use and desire for children.
   Prevention interventions for Indian couples should integrate
   reproductive health and alcohol use counseling at entry into care.

   differences exist across their sociodemographic backgrounds, immune
   functioning, and quality-of-life (i.e., symptom distress, physical, and
   mental quality-of-life).
   Methods: A secondary analysis of the cross-sectional subset of the
   population-based Collaborations HIV Outcomes Research US Cohort
   (CHORUS). Sample consists of 5521 HIV+ adults; median age 43 years (SD
   8.7); 88.6% male; 70.7% non-Hispanic White, 17.6% African-American, and
   7.8% Hispanic. Measures include the HIV Symptom Distress Scale and the
   SF-12. Analytical models included t-tests and multivariate linear
   regression.
   Results: HIV+ CGs have lower educational attainment than HIV+ NCGs
   (p=0.02). Seropositive CGs also experience greater HIV symptom distress
   (adjusted p<0.006) and poorer physical quality-of-life (adjusted
   p<0.001) than their seropostive NCG counterparts.
   Conclusion: HIV+ CGs may require different supportive services than HIV+
   NCGs, suggesting a need to develop tailored interventions to address
   modifiable factors, such as lower education and poor physical health.
   Both of these factors have been associated with suboptimal
   antiretroviral adherence, suggesting a role for the routine screening of
   adherence predictors amongst HIV+ CGs. These findings may have more
   relevance in resource-poor settings where the prevalence of HIV is
   higher, with a likely growing population of informal and family CGs
   infected with HIV.

AB Disclosure of HIV status after HIV voluntary counseling and testing has
   important implications for the spread of the HIV epidemic and the health
   of individuals who are HIV positive. Here, we use individual and couples
   level data for currently married respondents from an ongoing
   longitudinal study in rural Malawi to (1) examine the extent of HIV
   status disclosure by HIV serostatus; (2) identify reasons for not
   sharing one's HIV status with a spouse; and (3) evaluate the reliability
   of self-reports of HIV status disclosure. We find that disclosure of HIV
   status is relatively common among rural Malawians, where most have
   shared their status with a spouse, and many disclose to others in the
   community. However, there are significant differences in disclosure
   patterns by HIV status and gender. Factors associated with
   non-disclosure are also gendered, where women who perceive greater
   HIV/AIDS stigma and HIV positive are less likely to disclose HIV status
   to a spouse, and men who are worried about HIV infection from
   extramarital partners are less likely to disclose their HIV status to a
   spouse. Finally, we test the reliability of self-reported HIV status
   disclosure and find that self-reports of HIV-positive men are of
   questionable reliability.

   exploring the structure and dynamic process of a "Community
   Collaborative Board" (CCB). We use the term CCB to emphasize
   collaboration over advisement. The CCB membership, structure, and
   dynamics are informed by theory and research. The CCB is affiliated with
   Columbia University School of Social Work and its original membership
   included 30 members. CCB was built using six systematized steps meant to
   engage members in procedural and substantive research roles: (1)
   engaging membership; (2) developing relationships; (3) exchanging
   information; (4) negotiation and decision-making; (5) retaining
   membership; and (6) studying dynamic process. This model requires that
   all meetings be audio-taped to capture CCB dynamics. Using transcribed
   meeting data, we have identified group dynamics that help the CCB
   accomplish its objectives: (1) dialectic process helps exchange of
   information; (2) mutual support helps members work together despite
   social and professional differences; and (3) problem solving helps
   members achieve consensus. These dynamics also help members attain
   knowledge about HIV treatment and prevention and disseminate HIV-related
   knowledge. CABs can be purposeful in their use of group dynamics, narrow
   the knowledge gap between researchers and community partners, prepare
   members for procedural and substantive research roles, and retain
   community partners.

AB To date, research on the link between poverty and unsafe sexual
   behaviors has utilized limited measures of socioeconomic status and has
   overlooked key dimensions of poverty at the individual level. This study
   explored how various dimensions of socioeconomic status are associated
   with inconsistent condom use and how these associations vary by gender.
   We analyzed unique life history survey data from 261 young men and women
   in Kisumu, Kenya, and conducted analyses based on 959 person-months in
   which respondents had been sexually active in nonmarital relationships.
   Dependent variables were inconsistent condom use (not always using a
   condom) and never use of condoms. Condoms were used inconsistently in
   57% of months and were never used in 31%. Corroborating existing
   literature, lower household wealth and lower educational attainment were
   associated with inconsistent condom use. Lower individual economic
   status (lower earned income, food insufficiency, and larger material
   transfers from partners) were also important determinants of
   inconsistent condom use. There were no significant differences in these
   associations by gender, with the exception of food insufficiency, which
   increased the risk of inconsistent condom use for young women but not
   for young men. None of these individual measures of socioeconomic status
   were associated with never use of a condom. The findings suggest that
   both household-and individual-level measures of socioeconomic status are
   important correlates of condom use and that individual economic
   resources play a crucial role in negotiations over the highest level of
   usage. The results highlight the importance of poverty in shaping sexual
   behavior, and, in particular, that increasing individual access to
   resources beyond the household, including ensuring access to food and
   providing educational and work opportunities, could prove to be
   effective strategies for decreasing the risk of HIV among youth.

AB U. S. politicians and policymakers have been preoccupied with how to pay
   for health care. Hardly any thought has been given to what should be
   paid for-as though health care is a commodity that needs no
   examination-or what health outcomes should receive priority in a just
   society, i.e., rationing. I present a rationing proposal, consistent
   with U. S. culture and traditions, that deals not with "health care,"
   the terminology used in the current debate, but with the more modest and
   limited topic of medical care. Integral to this rationing proposal-which

   social contexts of all the actors in the research enterprise, including

   in which the actors are situated, including, but not limited to, their
   social, economic, political, cultural, and technological features. The
   utility of thinking about social contexts is introduced and exemplified
   by the presentation of a hypothetical case in which one central issue is
   limitation of the probability of injury to subjects by selection of
   individuals who are not expected to live long enough for the known risks
   of the study to become manifest as harms. Benefits of such
   considerations may include enhanced subject satisfaction and
   cooperation, community acceptance, and improved data quality, among
   other desirable consequences.

AB Health and Social Justice (Ruger 2009a) developed the "health capability
   paradigm," a conception of justice and health in domestic societies.
   This idea undergirds an alternative framework of social cooperation
   called " shared health governance" (SHG). SHG puts forth a set of moral
   responsibilities, motivational aspirations, and institutional
   arrangements, and apportions roles for implementation in striving for

AB Research has suggested that religion and spirituality may inform
   individuals' interpretation of and responses to uncertainty during
   pregnancy including the possibility of genetic disorders. In this study,
   25 qualitative interviews were undertaken with ultra-Orthodox [Haredi]
   Jewish women about their experiences with uncertainties related to
   pregnancy, prenatal care, and prenatal diagnosis. We found that women
   draw upon a particular set of faith-based concepts to cope with the
   uncertainties of pregnancy and to make decisions regarding prenatal
   testing. The women draw on the religious concepts of faith and
   certainty, which are based on trusting that God will not test them
   beyond what they can withstand. When prenatal screening indicates a
   possible fetal anomaly or when a disabled child is born, these women
   interpret the situation as a God-sent ordeal in which they are called
   upon to prove their trust and certainty in God's plan and to resist the
   uncertainties generated by the probability-based technologies. This
   research has implications for genetic service providers when discussing
   prenatal testing and fetal anomalies with Haredi women. (C) 2010

AB The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Commission to Build a Healthier
   America was charged to identify strategies beyond medical care to
   address health disparities in the U. S. related to social and economic
   disadvantage. Based on insights gained while providing scientific
   support for the commission's efforts, this paper presents an overview of
   major issues that arise when assessing evidence to inform policies and
   programs to address the social determinants of health. While many of the
   insights are not new, they have not been widely assimilated within
   medicine and public health. They have particular relevance now, given
   growing awareness of the important health influences of social factors.
   The discussion presented here is intended to highlight key
   considerations for researchers who study social determinants of health
   and policymakers whose decisions are shaped by research findings.
   Policies should be based on the best available knowledge, derived from
   diverse sources and methods.
   An array of tools and guidelines is now available to guide the
   assessment of evidence on the social determinants of health, building
   on-and going beyond-principles first articulated in the "Evidence-Based
   Medicine" movement. The central thesis of the current paper is that the
   standards for evidence to guide social policies must be equally rigorous
   but also more comprehensive than those traditionally used to inform
   clinical interventions, because social policies must deal with upstream
   factors that affect health through complex causal pathways over
   potentially long time periods. (Am J Prev Med 2011; 40(1S1): S58-S66)

AB Background: Several embedded religious minority populations in the US
   have experienced fertilities consistent with natural fertility
   populations. In 1996, Wenger Mennonite total fertility reached 8.31.
   Aim: This study updates Wenger fertility through 2006, highlights
   regional differences in fertility and identifies factors that may
   contribute to continuing high fertility.
   Subjects and methods: The Wengers are a religious minority who employ
   distinctive clothing, a rural farming lifestyle and limited use of
   technology. They publish a church directory every five years with
   detailed records of births, deaths and marriages. This directory was
   transformed into an SPSS database that allowed detailed analysis of
   fertility behaviour through 2006.
   Results: Wenger total marital fertility continues to be high (8.01).
   Wenger women have almost no premarital conceptions, do not marry until
   their early 20s, but achieve very high fertility immediately after they
   marry. Sharp differences exist among various settlements, with the
   highest fertilities in the newer Midwestern settlements.
   Conclusion: The Wengers continue to succeed in maintaining a distinct
   way of life and very high fertility in the midst of the larger US
   society. This fertility is tied to their high commitment to a rural
   farming way of life, strong community support and a pro-natalist
   ideology.

AB Recent scholarship on Durkheim draws attention to debates implicating
   his ideas about law, mainly in The Division of Labor in Society, but
   also in Professional Ethics and Civic Morals. Division is the better
   known work, and established readings-otherwise diverse-find in it a
   thesis about law as the expression of the collective conscience and
   functioning to maintain community norms. Durkheim's attention to the
   state in Civic Morals is often read as a continuation of that thesis on
   law, as if the state were the culmination of collective consciousness.
   This article reads these works differently, highlighting the
   discontinuity of states and collective consciousness as the opening for
   Durkheim's concerns with the moral legitimacy of public authority as
   well as his efforts to find a subject (literally and figuratively) for
   the emergent discipline of sociology. The article suggests that current
   events offer fresh terrain for sociolegal scholars to pursue the
   implications of Durkheim's insights on law and states, read otherwise.

AB The concept of the legal complex is a new addition to the lexicon of
   sociology and sociolegal scholarship. As a concept, the legal complex
   emerged from a series of interdisciplinary collaborations and primary
   research on the politics of lawyers and judges across the world. The
   review introduces this new collective actor to the political stage and
   elaborates its defining elements, morphology, varieties of mobilization,
   and repertoires of action. This review argues for a complementary
   methodological strategy for investigation of the politics of the legal
   complex, the longue duree and evenements. With respect to political
   liberalism, it shows the contexts and resources in which the legal
   complex thrives, with particular emphasis on civil society, information
   technology, the rise of constitutionalism, and international
   circumstances. The essay argues, however, that the explanatory reach of
   this concept can extend to any policymaking issues, national or
   supranational, that involve law, legal institutions, and legal actors.
   By adopting the logic of analysis developed in this review, not only do
   previously discrete areas of work on lawyers, judges, or prosecutors
   come into creative tension, but a lively politics of the legal complex
   will refine and extend theory across the landscape of law and society
   research.

AB In contrast to the antistructuralist and antipositivist agenda that has
   animated the "narrative turn" in the social sciences since the 1980s, a
   more uniquely sociological approach has studied stories in the
   interactional, institutional, and political contexts of their telling.
   Scholars working in this vein have seen narrative as powerful, but as
   variably so, and they have focused on the ways in which narrative
   competence is socially organized and unevenly distributed. We show how
   this approach, or cluster of approaches, rooted variously in
   conversational analysis, symbolic interactionism, network analysis, and
   structuralist cultural sociologies, has both responded to problems
   associated with the narrative turn and shed light on enduring
   sociological questions such as the bases of institutional authority, how
   inequalities are maintained and reproduced, why political challengers
   are sometimes able to win support, and the cultural foundations of
   self-interest and instrumental rationality.

AB Sociological theories about the political economy of the environment
   have appeared in two waves. The first wave has a productivist
   orientation, showing how the normal workings of industrial production
   damage the environment. It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT),
   the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource
   extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of
   theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements
   that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest
   over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist
   policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate
   environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged
   and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and
   sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded,
   articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns.
   Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of
   first- and second-wave theories. This theoretical focus may shift toward
   the political economy of disasters as climate change intensifies.

AB The economic crisis of 2008-2010 stimulated an already growing
   sociological interest in finance. Before the crisis, disintermediation
   and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as
   bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to
   originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size
   and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed
   financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital
   market integration and liberalization created greater global
   interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered
   their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and
   overall exposure to the stock market. Research reveals the importance of
   politics for many financial market developments, various implications
   for corporate governance, the continuing significance of social factors
   within finance, and the role of theoretical and material devices in
   shaping financial practices. Key directions for future research focus on
   finance in relation to social inequality, informal sectors, valuation,
   and social networks.

AB The American conservative movement that began to gain steam in the
   post-World War II era had, by the 1980s, emerged as a transformative
   political force in the United States and the world. Yet sociology has
   been slower than other disciplines to come to grips with conservatism.
   In the hope of spurring more research, we review the substantial
   literature on the conservative movement produced by historians,
   political scientists, and serious journalists since the mid-1990s, along
   with the more limited number of sociological contributions. After
   identifying what we see as a promising approach for conceptualizing
   conservatism, we illustrate the benefits of sociological engagement by
   showing how three areas of sociology that might at first glance seem
   disconnected from the movement the-sociology of intellectuals, theories
   of social change, and scholarship on stratification-could profit from
   consideration of the conservative case.

AB Twins have been extensively used in economics, sociology, and behavioral
   genetics to investigate the role of genetic endowments on a broad range
   of social, demographic, and economic outcomes. However, the focus in
   these literatures has been distinct: The economic literature has been
   primarily concerned with the need to control for unobserved
   endowmentsincluding as an important subset, genetic endowmentsin
   analyses that attempt to establish the impact of one variable, often
   schooling, on a variety of economic, demographic, and health outcomes.
   Behavioral genetic analyses have mostly been concerned with decomposing
   the variation in the outcomes of interest into genetic, shared
   environmental, and non-shared environmental components, with recent
   multivariate analyses investigating the contributions of genes and the
   environment to the correlation and causation between variables. Despite
   the fact that twins studies and the recognition of the role of
   endowments are central to both of these literatures, they have mostly
   evolved independently. In this paper, we develop formally the
   relationship between the economic and behavioral genetic approaches to
   the analyses of twins, and we develop an integrative approach that
   combines the identification of causal effects, which dominates the
   economic literature, with the decomposition of variances and covariances
   into genetic and environmental factors that are the primary goal of
   behavioral genetic approaches. We apply this integrative ACE- approach
   to an illustrative investigation of the impact of schooling on several
   demographic outcomes such as fertility and nuptiality and health.

   Trivers's theory of parental investment and sexual selection predicts
   that differential parental investment by biological sex will lead to
   divergent sex-based reproductive instincts. The sex bearing the larger
   parental investment will tend to be choosier, whereas the sex bearing
   the lesser investment will tend to be relatively indiscriminate and
   competitive for access to sexual resources. We hypothesized that men are
   more likely than women to offer objects of value in exchange for access
   to sexual resources. Using self-reports of sex-purchasing from Add

   theoretical and meta-theoretical level, leaving empirical analysis to a

   from the analytical in constructing scientific thought, thus showing the

AB BACKGROUND: The incidence patterns and socioeconomic distribution of
   cutaneous melanoma among Hispanics are poorly understood. METHODS: The
   authors obtained population-based incidence data for all Hispanic and
   non-Hispanic white (NHW) patients who were diagnosed with invasive
   cutaneous melanoma from 1988 to 2007 in California. By using a
   neighborhood-level measure of socioeconomic status (SES), the variables
   investigated included incidence, thickness at diagnosis, histologic
   subtype, anatomic site, and the relative risk (RR) for thicker (>2 mm)
   versus thinner (<= 2 mm) tumors at diagnosis for groups categorized by
   SES. RESULTS: Age-adjusted melanoma incidence rates per million were
   higher in NHWs (P < .0001), and tumor thickness at diagnosis was greater
   in Hispanics (P < .0001). Sixty-one percent of melanomas in NHWs
   occurred in the High SES group. Among Hispanics, only 35% occurred in
   the High SES group; and 22% occurred in the Low SES group. Lower SES was
   associated with thicker tumors (P < .0001); this association was
   stronger in Hispanics. The RR of thicker tumors versus thinner tumors
   (<= 2 mm) in the Low SES group versus the High SES group was 1.48 (95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.37-1.61) for NHW men and 2.18 (95% Cl,
   1.73-2.74) for Hispanic men. Patients with lower SES had less of the
   superficial spreading melanoma subtype (especially among Hispanic men)
   and more of the nodular melanoma subtype. Leg/hip melanomas were
   associated with higher SES in NHW men but with lower SES in Hispanic
   men. CONCLUSIONS: The socioeconomic distribution of melanoma incidence
   and tumor thickness differed substantially between Hispanic and NHW
   Californians, particularly among men. Melanoma prevention efforts
   targeted to lower SES Hispanics and increased physician awareness of
   melanoma patterns among Hispanics are needed. Cancer 2011;117:152-61.

AB BACKGROUND: Few data are available on how race/ethnicity, insurance, and
   socioeconomic status (SES) interrelate to influence breast cancer
   treatment. The authors examined care for a national cohort of breast
   cancer patients to assess whether insurance and SES were associated with
   racial/ethnic differences in care. METHODS: The authors used
   multivariate logistic regression to assess the probability of definitive
   locoregional therapy, hormone receptor testing, and adjuvant systemic
   therapy among 662,117 white, black, and Hispanic women diagnosed with
   invasive breast cancer during 1998-2005 at National Cancer Data Base
   hospitals. In additional models, the authors included insurance and
   area-level SES to determine whether these variables were associated with
   observed racial/ethnic disparities. RESULTS: Most women were white
   (86%), 10% were black, and 4% were Hispanic. Most had private insurance
   (51%) or Medicare (41%). Among eligible patients, 80.0% (stage I/II) had
   definitive locoregional therapy, 98.5% (stage I-IV) had hormone receptor
   testing, and 53.1% and 50.2% (stage I-III) received adjuvant hormonal
   therapy and chemotherapy, respectively. After adjustment, black (vs
   white) women had less definitive locoregional therapy (odds ratio [OR],
   0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88-0.94), hormonal therapy (OR,
   0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93), and chemotherapy (OR, 0.87; 95% CI,
   0.84-0.91). Hispanic (vs white) women were also less likely to receive
   hormonal therapy. Hormone receptor testing did not differ by
   race/ethnicity. Racial disparities persisted despite adjusting for
   insurance and SES. CONCLUSIONS: The modest association between black (vs
   white) race and guideline-recommended breast cancer care was insensitive
   to adjustment for insurance and area-level SES. Further study is
   required to better understand disparities and to ensure receipt of care.

AB The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 shook the Soviet Union to the core and
   provided the West with the iconic image of the freedom fighter willing
   to risk all for the cause of freedom. The pathos of the lost cause
   provided Hungarians with a new set of heroes akin to those of the failed
   1848 Revolution, the best known being Prime Minister Imre Nagy who was
   executed for siding with the revolutionaries in their bid to establish a
   sovereign republic. His belated funeral on June 16, 1989 undermined the
   moral and political authority of the communist regime that had attempted
   to consign Nagy and his confederates to oblivion and seemed to mimic
   Emile Durkheim's analysis of piaculum and the conscience collective. But
   the spectacle of Nagy's funeral only temporarily shrouded significant
   differences between and within those factions demanding pluralist
   society, most recently revealed in the acrimonious celebration of the
   50th anniversary of the Hungarian Revolution. These debates are rooted
   in Hungary's deeply troubled past that strongly questioned republican
   values in contrast to the authoritarian values of the Hapsburg monarchy,
   alliance with the Axis, genocide, and its relationship to communism in
   the wake of the disaster of World War II. Jacques Derrida tells us that
   it is not easy to exorcise our ghosts; instead, we are prompted to
   reconstruction. Memory studies, stimulated by studies of the Holocaust,
   transformed the sociological imagination (especially Friedlander, 1993;
   LaCapra, 1998a, 1998b, 1998c, 1998d). There has been what Michael Roth
   referred to as "a turning of oneself so as to be in relation to the
   past'' as an act of witness. The traumatic memory of the 1956 Revolution
   provides yet another case in which a traumatic past is still salient to
   the political actors in the contemporary arena. This chapter immerses
   itself in the emergence of historical sociology and with it "memory
   studies,'' that is: (1) the relationship between identity, memory, and
   embodiment; and (2) the relationship between historical circumstance and
   collective memory formation (described in diverse approaches such as
   Adorno, 1959; 1997; Nora, 1989; Postone, Martha, & Kobyashi 2009). In
   particular, there is in historical sociology an emergent interest in (1)
   commemorative practices, memorializing addresses, memento; and (2) the
   struggles over memory, remembering, and forgetting.

AB As a major concept in sociological theory, estrangement can be
   understood through a diversity of theoretical lenses. However, there is
   a tendency among sociologists to identify the idea of estrangement with
   a version of alienation. In this chapter, I counter this tendency to
   reduce estrangement to one of its conceptual possibilities. To provide a
   theoretical analysis of estrangement, I first examine the classical
   views of the issue. I argue that classical theories - both critical and
   interpretive fail to theorize sufficiently self-estrangement, a
   dimension of the concept that remains underexplored. Thus, I move beyond
   classical sociology to reconstruct the idea of self-estrangement,
   drawing on more recent interpretive and critical theories, especially
   theories of social interaction and the self. Specifically, I discuss
   several interactional forms of self-estrangement, and the connection
   between self-estrangement, institutional contexts, emotions and the
   body. Finally, I consider this concept in the context of civil society.
   This discussion demonstrates the merits of a focus on self-estrangement
   applied to the study of political exclusion.

AB Background: Very low birth weight infants (VLBW, <1500 g) have increased
   impact on families compared to term infants. However, there is limited
   research examining this impact in the first months post-discharge.
   Aim: To determine maternal, neonatal, and infant characteristics
   associated with greater impact on the family at 3 months corrected age
   in VLBW infants. It was hypothesized that social/environmental and
   medical risk factors would be associated with higher impact.
   Study design: Maternal, neonatal, and infant data were collected
   prospectively. Parents completed the Impact on Family, Family Support,
   and Family Resource Scales. Associations between characteristics and
   impact scores were analyzed by t-test and Pearson's correlation.
   Regression models for each impact score identified significant risk
   factors for impact.
   Subjects: 152 VLBW infants born February 28, 2007 to September 5, 2008
   who had a follow-up evaluation at 3 months corrected age. Outcome
   measure: Impact on family.
   Results: Siblings in the home, neonatal medical risk factors, longer
   hospitalization, more days on ventilator or oxygen, lower gestational
   age, lower social support, and poorer family resources were associated
   with increased impact. Multivariate analyses identified siblings in the
   home, poorer family resources, lower gestational age, and oxygen
   requirement at 3 months as the most important predictors of impact.
   Conclusions: Social/environmental and medical risk factors contribute to
   impact on family. Families with identified risk factors should receive
   support services to assist them in coping with the burden of caring for
   a VLBW infant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

PY 2011
AB The value of "diversity" in social and ecological systems is frequently
   asserted in academic and policy literature. Diversity is thought to
   enhance the resilience of social-ecological systems to varied and
   potentially uncertain future conditions. Yet there are trade-offs;
   diversity in ecological and social domains has costs as well as
   benefits. In this paper, we examine social diversity, specifically its
   costs and benefits in terms of decision making in middle range or tribal
   societies, using archaeological evidence spanning seven centuries from
   four regions of the U. S. Southwest. In these nonstate societies, social
   diversity may detract from the capacity for collective action. We ask
   whether as population density increases, making collective action
   increasingly difficult, social diversity declines. Further, we trace the
   cases of low diversity and high population density across our
   long-temporal sequences to see how they associate with the most dramatic
   transformations. This latter analysis is inspired by the claim in
   resilience literature that reduction of diversity may contribute to
   reduction in resilience to varied conditions. Using archaeological data,
   we examine social diversity and conformity through the material culture
   (pottery styles) of past societies. Our research contributes to an
   enhanced understanding of how population density may limit social
   diversity and suggests the role that this association may play in some
   contexts of dramatic social transformation.

AB Sociologists and other social scientists typically characterize
   financial markets as 'liquid', where capital can be readily purchased or
   sold in global electronic networks, so that trades can be completed
   nearly instantaneously. In contrast, drawing on ethnographic interviews
   in an emerging market, Malaysia, and on cross-national statistics,
   secondary survey data and econometric studies, this article argues that
   world stock markets are normally illiquid with temporal spikes of
   liquidity. As a consequence, professional investors in equities markets
   are large and frequently slow-moving behemoths, trading turgidly. To
   overcome illiquidity, professional investors conduct a range of
   practices I term distributed execution. Illiquidity and distributed
   execution have a number of implications for sociological debates
   regarding the relationship between investment firms and society.

AB H. J. Muller (1890-1967) was unusual as a scientist because he spoke out
   on numerous occasions about the uses and abuses of genetics in society.
   In this article, I follow Muller's efforts to do so and the consequences
   that they had on his career, his productivity as a research scientist,
   and his reputation. The shifting sites of Muller's work-which ranged
   from Columbia University to Texas, from Berlin to Moscow and Leningrad,
   from Madrid to Edinburgh, and from Amherst to Indiana University-made
   his activism unusual. Muller paid a price for his activism, and his
   reputation today is still marred by what most historians would consider
   risky judgments and reversals of position about genetics and society. My
   analysis is not a defense but rather an evaluation of the circumstances
   that led him to these positions and an analysis of the consequences of
   challenging society when scientists believe their science is being
   ignored or abused.

AB In this article we examine the non-economic, emotional meanings that
   men's economic migration has for the wives and mothers who stay in two
   rural communities in Honduras. Combining the literature on economic
   sociology and on the social meanings of relations within transnational
   families, we identify three areas that allow us to capture what the
   men's migration means for the women who stay - communication between the
   non-migrant women and migrant men, stress and anxiety in women's
   personal lives, and added household responsibilities. Through interviews
   with 18 non-migrant mothers and wives and qualitative fieldwork in
   Honduras, we find that women's interpretations of men's migration are
   not simple, black-and-white assessments. Instead, these are multifaceted
   and shaped by the social milieu in which the women live. Whereas the
   remittances and gifts that the men send improve the lives of the women
   and their families, these transfers also convey assurances that the men
   have not forgotten them and they become expressions of love.

AB The goal of this paper is to contribute to the revival of Heinz Werner's
   organismic-developmental theory by considering some of its key claims in
   relation to contemporary developmental theory and research. The
   organismic-developmental definition of development in terms of
   differentiation and integration is first discussed in relation to
   contemporary systems theory. It is then synthesized with contemporary
   sociocultural theory, specifically the position that development occurs
   as individuals participate with others in cultural practices.
   Ultimately, it is argued that defining development in terms of
   differentiation and integration offers a systematic framework for
   distinguishing between change and development. Some implications of

AB The public/private distinction is one of the fundamental categories of
   modern social life. Historically, the two functioned as a dichotomous
   pair both theoretically and practically. During the height of the
   separation of public and private, 'private' was code for the home,
   personal, and non-professional contexts; 'public', on the other hand,
   stood for the professional world outside the home. This dichotomous
   treatment of public and private informed many aspects of social life
   ranging from gender relations and the division of household labor to the
   development of suburbs as purely residential (private) areas
   geographically separate from the public sphere of work. Recently,
   however, this dichotomous vision of the public/private divide has become
   outdated. It no longer accurately describes the ways in which public and
   private operate in contemporary social life; where the two spheres were
   once separate, there is now significant overlap and interaction. This
   breakdown in the public and private divide has occurred at many levels
   and has a strong relationship with the development and ubiquity of
   information and communications technologies such as mobile telephones
   and the Internet. This paper describes the ways in which public and
   private are changing and proposes a new way of theorizing the
   public/private distinction, as a continuum rather than as a dichotomy.
   This way of thinking about public and private reflects contemporary
   social life much more accurately than does the dichotomous conception.

AB In the past few decades, the anti-immigrant sentiment in the United
   States has been influenced, in part, by the massive immigration of
   Latinos to the United States. The internet technology in the Web 2.0 age
   offers a new medium in which this anti-immigrant movement can appear and
   create what Cohen calls a 'moral panic', which we claim to has become a
   Latino cyber-moral panic. Of a subsample taken from 170 anti-immigrant
   websites, the authors examine the role of internet in the creation of a
   cyber-moral panic against Latinos in the United States in which they
   find the classic stages of moral panic must be modified and updated.
   Facilitated by the internet, a 'call for civil action' stage is added to
   the classic moral panic process in which donations and direct civil and
   political action are sought from online visitors. Recycled information
   is spread via other anti-immigrant websites, blogs, forums, and other
   social media, helping to accelerate the moral panic process due to the
   ability to quickly spread information, reach those who have access to
   online technologies and hardware, the assumption of anonymity, etc.
   Using the updated moral panic process model, the authors apply these
   stages to the current nativist movement which has resulted in a wave of
   hate crimes against immigrants, several pieces of new anti-immigrant
   legislation, and fostered an environment widespread discrimination,
   oppression, and dehumanization against the contemporary 'folk devils',
   or Latinos in the United States.

AB New findings pertinent to the human lineage origin (Ardipithecus
   ramidus) prompt a new analysis of the extrapolation of the social
   behavior of our closest relatives, the great apes, into human 'natural
   social behavior'. With the new findings it becomes clear that human
   ancestors had very divergent social arrangements from the ones we
   observe today in our closest genetic relatives.
   The social structure of chimpanzees and gorillas is characterized by
   male competition. Aggression and the instigation of fear are common
   place. The morphology of A. ramidus points in the direction of a social
   system characterized by female-choice instead of male-male competition.
   This system tends to be characterized by reduced aggression levels,
   leading to more stable arrangements. It is postulated here that the
   social stability with accompanying group cohesion propitiated by this
   setting is favorable to the investment in more complex behaviors, the
   development of innovative approaches to solve familiar problems, an
   increase in exploratory behavior, and eventually higher intelligence and
   the use of sophisticated tools and technology.
   The concentration of research efforts into the study of social animals
   with similar social systems (e.g., New World social monkeys
   (Callitrichidae), social canids (Canidae) and social rodents (Rodentia))
   are likely to provide new insights into the understanding of what
   factors determined our evolution into an intelligent species capable of
   advanced technology. Received! March 2010, accepted 17 May 2010, first

AB This article discusses the complexity of literary analysis and the
   implications of using fiction as a source of sociological data. This
   project infuses literary analysis with sociological imagination. Using a
   random sample of children's novels published between 1930 and 1980, this
   article describes both a methodological approach to the analysis of
   children's books and the subsequent development of two analytical
   categories of novels. The first category captures books whose narratives
   describe and support unequal social arrangements; the second category
   captures those whose narratives work instead to identify inequality and
   disrupt it. Building on Griswold's methodological approach to literary
   fiction, this project examines how children's novels describe,
   challenge, or even subvert systems of inequality. Through a sociological
   reading of three sampled texts-Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing, A
   Wrinkle in Time, and Hitty: Her First Hundred Years-readers learn how
   these analytical categories work and how the sociology of literature
   might be enriched by attention to structural forms of inequality within
   literary fiction. This essay investigates children's books in order to
   reinvigorate the discussion and use of novels by sociologists.

AB The Cat Tien National Park (CTNP) is located in South Vietnam. This park
   is home to many rare and endemic species. However, Park resources face
   heavy anthropogenic pressure and some species are vulnerable to
   extinction. In this context, this study assesses the efficacy of social
   capital and other socio-economic variables in influencing conservation
   attitude of local people towards CTNP resources. Using suitable survey
   tools and regression analysis, we find social capital to be a
   significant determinant of the overall conservation attitude of locals.
   All components of social capital, except trust, are significant in
   explaining one or more indicators of conservation attitude. Among
   socio-economic variables, education, income and ethnic groups were
   significant in explaining the overall conservation attitude. We suggest
   that participatory conservation programmes should incorporate suitable
   actions for promoting social capital among local people as a part of
   their institution-building efforts. This may improve institutional
   stability leading to better resource conservation and improved welfare
   of local people.

   identify factors associated with diagnostic instability using data from
   a national Web-based autism registry. A Cox proportional hazards model
   was used to assess the relative risk of change in initial ASD diagnosis
   as a function of demographic characteristics, diagnostic subtype,
   environmental factors and natural history. Autistic disorder was the
   most stable initial diagnosis; pervasive developmental disorder-not
   otherwise specified was the least stable. Additional factors such as
   diagnosing clinician, region, when in time a child was initially
   diagnosed, and history of autistic regression also were significantly
   associated with diagnostic stability in community settings. Findings
   suggest that the present classification system and other secular factors
   may be contributing to increasing instability of community-assigned

AB CASE: Gerardo is an 8-year-old Latino boy who saw his primary care
   pediatrician with a second asthma exacerbation this year. His
   frustration with his illness was immediately apparent when he said, "I
   hate having to go to the nurse's office to take my albuterol!" His
   mother expressed concern that her son frequently refused to take his
   prevention medication for asthma, montelukast, each morning. When
   questioned about compliance with his inhaled steroid, his mother
   hesitated and then admitted that she discontinued the controller
   medication because she is afraid to "poison his body with so many
   chemicals." She consistently gave her son the inhaled steroid for 12
   months, until care by the allergy specialist was unexpectedly
   transferred to a Spanish-speaking allergist. She complained that the new
   doctor is "cold and acts like a veterinarian, not a pediatrician."
   Gerardo is a first generation Mexican-American who was born in the
   United States to Spanish-speaking parents. There is no family history of
   asthma, although his mother fears that she may have contributed to
   Gerardo's condition. She explained that during pregnancy, she worked
   cleaning houses where she was exposed to many toxic household cleaners.
   She has always worried that by inhaling these fumes during pregnancy,
   she induced her son's asthma.
   Gerardo presented with his first episode of reactive airway disease at 9
   months of age. His mother vividly recalled his high temperature, rapid
   breathing, and their ambulance ride to the hospital. He was hospitalized
   for 3 days, and he has not been hospitalized since. Allergy testing
   revealed sensitivity to weed pollen only. Gerardo sleeps with a
   nonallergenic pillow and bed cover.
   Gerardo's mother explained that 3 days before his current exacerbation,
   he was playing at an amusement park with his friends on a hot day.
   Gerardo and his friends ran through a large fountain. His mother
   reported that he was soaked in water and stated, "He knows that he will
   get sick with asthma if he gets wet!" She recalled that 3 years ago at a
   friend's birthday party, Gerardo abstained from running through the
   sprinklers with the other children without instruction from his parents.
   Since that event, she has trusted Gerardo to care for his "weak lungs."
   She is frustrated now with his regression in self-care. (J Dev Behav
   Pediatr 32: 75-77, 2011)

AB Background Although chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
   common cause of death and disability, little is known about the effects
   of socioeconomic status (SES) and race-ethnicity on health outcomes.
   Methods The aim of this study is to determine the independent impacts of
   SES and race-ethnicity on COPD severity status, functional limitations
   and acute exacerbations of COPD among patients with access to
   healthcare. Data were used from the Function, Living, Outcomes and Work
   cohort study of 1202 Kaiser Permanente Northern California Medical Care
   Plan members with COPD.
   Results Lower educational attainment and household income were
   consistently related to greater disease severity, poorer lung function
   and greater physical functional limitations in cross-sectional analysis.
   Black race was associated with greater COPD severity, but these
   differences were no longer apparent after controlling for SES variables
   and other covariates (comorbidities, smoking, body mass index and
   occupational exposures). Lower education and lower income were
   independently related to a greater prospective risk of acute COPD
   exacerbation (HR 1.5; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.1; and HR 2.1; 95% CI 1.4 to 3.4,
   respectively).
   Conclusion Low SES is a risk factor for a broad array of adverse COPD
   health outcomes. Clinicians and disease management programs should
   consider SES as a key patient-level marker of risk for poor outcomes.

AB Background Social support may be particularly important in countering
   depression among systematically disadvantaged groups. Latino immigrants
   are an example of a disadvantaged population that has better than
   expected mental health outcomes. One explanation put forth for this
   pattern is strong social support from kin networks. Studies on the
   effect of social support on mental health often assess the quantity of
   social ties rather than the quality of the support they provide. In
   addition, such studies rarely specify the source of support and how
   support from family versus friends may differentially impact mental
   health.
   Methods In this study, data from the Project on Human Development in
   Chicago Neighbourhoods were used to disaggregate the effects of
   source-specific emotional support on risk of depression. Second, the
   relationship between ethnicity/nativity status and risk of depression
   was examined. Finally, whether the relationship between family-based and
   friend-based social support and depression differed across
   ethnic/nativity status was explored.
   Results Support from both family and friends had protective effects on
   risk of depression; however, when mutually adjusted, only kin support
   remained statistically significant. At higher levels of family support,
   foreign-born Mexicans and African Americans had decreased risk of
   depression than at low levels of family support.
   Conclusion This study provides evidence that family support may be more
   important than non-kin support for mental health. Findings also suggest
   that the effects of family support on risk of depression vary by
   ethnicity and nativity status. Preservation of naturally occurring
   support resources among some groups may be a way to maintain mental
   health.

   sustainability and cultural awareness. The experimental design had three
   components: a pretest, 7-week intervention, and post-test to assess
   participants' changes over time, regarding their cultural awareness and
   interests to pursue careers in agriculture. The experiment occurred in
   2009 and 2010. Participants agreed the course enhanced their cultural
   awareness and that as a student studying agriculture it was important
   for them to understand other cultures. They indicated the ability to
   apply their learning to their careers in the United States. In addition,
   within the open ended question section, 27 of the 33 students
   participating in the course reported that as a result of the course they
   would like to work with agriculture in an international capacity in the
   future. In summary, this study succeeded in reaching its goals to
   enhance students' cultural awareness.

   largely rural Brazos Valley in Central Texas using data from the 2006
   Brazos Valley Community Health Assessment (analytic N=1059, 74% response
   rate). Among older adults and seniors, 18.6% reported food insecurity
   (5.5% often and 13.1% sometimes), defined as running out of food and not
   having money to buy more. Low community social capital was reported by
   22.4% of participants, and 30.8% indicated they were single, widowed, or
   divorced, an indicator of limited familial social capital. A robust
   multinomial regression model found the odds of reporting greater food
   insecurity increased for individuals who were women, African American,
   residents of a household with a low or poverty-level income, individuals
   who perceived themselves to be worse off than others within their
   community, and those who had low social capital. The odds of being food
   insecure decreased for older respondents, partnered respondents and
   persons with more education (pseudo r2=0.27, p0.0000). Compositional
   level measures of collective social functioning are important associates
   of food insecurity among older adults and seniors, regardless of

AB Objective: We investigated drinking behavior and sources of alcohol
   among Native American and White youths, as well as how underage drinking
   behavior and sources of alcohol may be related to environmental factors.
   Method: Survey data from a sample of 18,916 youths (8th, 10th, and 12th
   grades) from Montana were analyzed using hierarchical linear modeling.
   Survey data were supplemented with county-level economic and census
   data. Results: Native American youths were more likely than White youths
   to report drinking and heavy episodic drinking and initiate drinking at
   a younger age. Native Americans were less likely than Whites to get
   alcohol from home or from someone younger than age 21 but were more
   likely to get it from other social sources or through theft from a
   store. Living in a county with more Native Americans was inversely
   related to access to alcohol for both White and Native American youths,
   as well as reduced lifetime, 30-day, and heavy episodic drinking. Living
   in a county with more single-parent households was positively related to
   lifetime drinking, 30-day drinking, heavy episodic drinking, and
   increased access to alcohol through someone younger than age 21 or a
   stranger. Median income was negatively related to lifetime drinking and
   ease of access to alcohol and was positively related to accessing
   alcohol from home without permission, theft, or purchase with a fake ID.
   Conclusions: Because Native American and White youths have different
   drinking patterns and obtain alcohol from different sources, strategies
   to prevent alcohol problems in these groups should take these
   differences into consideration. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 72, 53-60,2011)

PY 2011
AB Purpose: To examine the relationship among socioeconomic status,
   psychological factors (le, health locus of control, health
   satisfaction), and health behaviors (ie, physical exercise, eating
   patterns) in a volunteer sample of mid-life African American women
   residing within Washington, DC. 1
   Methods: The study's sample included 351 African American women who
   participated in the 12-week Prime Time Sister Circles (PTSC)
   intervention and completed the initial self-report survey. Of the women
   completing the baseline survey, clinical assessments were taken on 277
   participants.
   Results: The majority (64.4%) of the women were either obese or
   extremely obese based upon their body mass index (BMI). Fewer than
   one-third of the women were satisfied with their weight. Despite these
   outcomes, most (61.8%) of the sample rated their health, in comparison
   to other African American women, as either good or very good. Further,
   more than one-half of the women were somewhat to very satisfied with
   their health knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and their physical,
   emotional, and spiritual health. There was no significant relationship
   between obesity level and socioeconomic status, as measured by
   education, personal income, and total household income. Additionally,
   there were no significant differences in weight or eating behaviors by
   education, personal income, and total household income. The findings
   revealed a significant difference in the number of days the women
   reported engaging in physical exercise by personal income (p < .01) and
   total household income (p = .05), surprisingly, with the women in the
   lower-income categories reporting engaging in more days of physical
   exercise than women in the higher-income categories.
   Conclusions: This study documents the paradox of obesity in mid-life
   African American women related to socioeconomic status inasmuch as there
   were no differences observed in the prevalence of obesity by
   socioeconomic status indicators. The obese women of lower socioeconomic
   status reported exercising more than obese women of high socioeconomic
   status. Paradoxically, most of the obese women were dissatisfied with
   their body weight, shape, and physical health, but more than 50% were
   satisfied with their health attitudes and behaviors and 61.8% rated
   their health favorably. The paradoxes of obesity and African American
   women across various income levels are important to understand for
   interventions to success.

AB Objective: Poorer socioeconomic conditions early in life have been
   linked with memory, attention and learning deficits in adulthood, as
   well as with specific areas of educational achievement. It remains
   unclear, however, whether these distal associations are mediated by more
   current socioeconomic factors. In this study, we sought to confirm the
   relation between early-life socioeconomic position (SEP) and adult
   cognitive function, and to examine potential mediation by
   contemporaneous SEP. Methods: Data from 463 young adults from the Main
   Cohort of the Seychelles Child Development Study were analyzed using
   subtests of the Cambridge Neurological Test Automated Battery and the
   Woodcock Johnson Test of Scholastic Achievement in relation to maternal
   Hollingshead Social Status Index scores at study enrollment (infancy),
   follow-up at 107 months, and follow-up at 17 years. Results: Findings
   include evidence of a link between infant-period SEP and 17-year memory,
   which was not mediated by childhood and 17-year SEP. Verbal and
   mathematical achievement at 17 years was associated with SEP at all
   points in the life course. Conclusions: SEP at different points during
   the young-adult life course may affect different cognitive domains later
   in life, which may provide targets for societal investment in ensuring
   adequate family resources throughout childhood and adolescence.

AB Objective: The main purpose of this study was to evaluate whole-brain
   and hemispheric activation in normal adult volunteers to videos
   depicting positive and negative social encounters. There are few studies
   that have utilized dynamic social stimuli to evaluate brain activation.
   Method: Twenty young adults viewed videotaped vignettes during an
   functional magnetic resonance imaging procedure. The vignettes included
   positive and negative interaction scenes of social encounters. Results:
   Significant right greater than left activation for positive and negative
   conditions was found for the social interaction videos in the amygdaloid
   complex, the inferior frontal gyrus, the fusiform gyrus, and the
   temporal gyri (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: These findings support the
   hypothesis that the regions of the right hemisphere are more active in
   the interpretation of social information processing than those regions
   in the left hemisphere. This study is a first step in understanding
   processing of dynamic stimuli using ecologically appropriate stimuli
   that approximate the real-time social processing that is appropriate for
   use with populations who experience significant social problems.

AB The ecosystem has served as a central organizational concept in ecology
   for nearly a half century and continues to evolve. As a level in the
   biotic hierarchy, ecosystems are often viewed as ecological communities
   integrated with their abiotic environments. This has always been
   imperfect because of a mismatch of scales between communities and
   ecosystem processes as they are made operational for field study.
   Complexity theory has long been forecasted to provide a renewed
   foundation for ecosystem theory but has been slow to do so. Partly this
   has arisen from a difficulty in translating theoretical tenets into
   operational terms for testing in field studies. Ecosystem science has
   become an important applied science for studying global change and human
   environmental impacts. Vigorous and important directions in the study of
   ecosystems today include a growing focus on human-dominated landscapes
   and development of the concept of ecosystem services for human resource
   supply and well-being. Today, terrestrial ecosystems are viewed less as
   well-defined entities or as a level in the biotic hierarchy. Instead,
   ecosystem processes are being increasingly viewed as the elements in a
   hierarchy. These occur alongside landscape processes and socioeconomic
   processes, which combine to form coupled social-ecological systems
   across a range of scales.

AB Background: To evaluate the impact of religious adherence on a patient's
   outlook on disease in a glaucoma population. Methods: A prospective
   survey analysis of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular
   hypertension evaluating self-reported global religious adherence,
   adherence to specific basic activities and knowledge of faith
   ('maturity') and 'comfort' (ability to cope, attitude toward glaucoma,
   motivation to take medication and God's concern). This specific analysis
   was limited to self-professed Christians. Results: 248 patients were
   included and religious adherence was correlated to religious activity
   and knowledge (p < 0.0001). Patients who scored as adherent on at least
   1 of 4 maturity questions had greater benefit than less adherent
   patients from each of the 5 comfort questions (p < 0.0001). We found an
   increased statistical separation on each of the 5 comfort questions
   between religiously adherent and less adherent individuals for patients
   who scored as adherent on any 2 (n = 40), 3 (n = 50) or all 4 (n = 57)
   of the maturity questions (p < 0.001). Conclusions: This study suggests,
   at least for the Christian faith, that religious patients are
   subjectively more prone to cope with treatment and that religiosity
   increases the self-confidence, and possibly the quality of life, of
   patients with glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Whether this necessarily
   translates into better glaucoma practices remains to be demonstrated by
   further studies. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

   the various sustainability challenges facing the world today To
   contribute to this endeavor the authors conduct panel analyses of the
   per capita ecological footprints of nations to evaluate multiple
   theoretical traditions within environmental sociology and its sister
   approaches Findings indicate that the consumption-based environmental
   impacts of nations are tied to economic development urban population,
   militarization, and the structure of international trade Ecological
   conditions in the context of climate and biogeography also prove to
   partially shape the environmental harms of human activities Ultimately
   this research suggests that political-economic factors, ecological
   milieu and structural associations between nations all influence
   society/nature relationships Considering the globally unsustainable
   levels of resource consumption and concomitant increases in pollution
   for a growing number of nations throughout the world the authors contend

   investigate the consequences of organizational de-coupling from an
   inward-looking within organizational perspective Specifically we study
   how the de-coupling of flexible work program affects workers
   actualization of productivity Our data analysis suggests that the
   organizational de-coupling in which organizations only ceremonially
   adopt flexible work program without making it available to all workers,
   is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were
   bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of
   productivity actualization is associated with workers who enjoy a
   factual flexible work schedule which is nevertheless not formally
   adopted by the employer The implications of the findings are discussed

AB The practice of organic agriculture has recently grown and gained
   significant attention in many parts of the world. As alternative food
   systems proliferate into popular culture and take an increasingly large
   market share, social scientists from an array of disciplines have
   attempted to give meaning to the phenomenon. This article takes a unique
   approach to organic agriculture, by reframing it within the classical
   social theory of Tonnies and Durkheim and the new institutionalism in
   economic sociology. This theoretical lens illuminates the novelty of
   organic agriculture as a site where rationalities are shifting in the
   economic field of agriculture. Organic agriculture, I argue, has created
   an opportunity where economy, society, and environment are being
   ideologically blended together within an institutional environment in
   which they have been conceptually and pragmatically divided.

AB This article introduces a sociology role-playing game (RPG) used to
   demonstrate the broad range of social forces, institutions, and
   structures in a semester-long series of in-class and homework
   assignments. RPGs and other simulation games have been frequently
   suggested as a useful teaching methodology because of their unique
   ability to allow students to observe and analyze society from a new
   perspective; however, most games are limited in scope. We present a game
   that is based on a clearly articulated theoretical foundation, reflects
   contemporary American demographics, and recreates the full breadth of
   social structures and relationships. The result is a robust teaching
   tool that develops critical thinking skills, encourages the sociological
   imagination, and is applicable to a wide range of classes and topics.
   Informal student feedback and student evaluations indicate that students
   enjoy the game, that it aids students in understanding sociological
   concepts, and that it encourages social critique beyond the classroom.

AB We investigate the extent to which social ties between people can be
   inferred from co-occurrence in time and space: Given that two people
   have been in approximately the same geographic locale at approximately
   the same time, on multiple occasions, how likely are they to know each
   other? Furthermore, how does this likelihood depend on the spatial and
   temporal proximity of the co-occurrences? Such issues arise in data
   originating in both online and offline domains as well as settings that
   capture interfaces between online and offline behavior. Here we develop
   a framework for quantifying the answers to such questions, and we apply
   this framework to publicly available data from a social media site,
   finding that even a very small number of co-occurrences can result in a
   high empirical likelihood of a social tie. We then present probabilistic
   models showing how such large probabilities can arise from a natural
   model of proximity and co-occurrence in the presence of social ties. In
   addition to providing a method for establishing some of the first
   quantifiable estimates of these measures, our findings have potential
   privacy implications, particularly for the ways in which social
   structures can be inferred from public online records that capture
   individuals' physical locations over time.

AB The striking thing about the happiness-income paradox is that over the
   long-term - usually a period of 10 y or more-happiness does not increase
   as a country's income rises. Heretofore the evidence for this was
   limited to developed countries. This article presents evidence that the
   long term nil relationship between happiness and income holds also for a
   number of developing countries, the eastern European countries
   transitioning from socialism to capitalism, and an even wider sample of
   developed countries than previously studied. It also finds that in the
   short-term in all three groups of countries, happiness and income go
   together, i.e., happiness tends to fall in economic contractions and
   rise in expansions. Recent critiques of the paradox, claiming the time
   series relationship between happiness and income is positive, are the
   result either of a statistical artifact or a confusion of the short-term
   relationship with the long-term one.

AB Social networks can be used to represent group structure as a network of
   interacting components, and also to quantify both the position of each
   individual and the global properties of a group. In a series of
   simulation experiments based on dynamic social networks, we test the
   prediction that social behaviors that help individuals reach prominence
   within their social group may conflict with their potential to benefit
   from their social environment. In addition to cases where individuals
   were able to benefit from improving both their personal relative
   importance and group organization, using only simple rules of social
   affiliation we were able to obtain results in which individuals would
   face a trade-off between these factors. While selection would favor (or
   work against) social behaviors that concordantly increase (or decrease,
   respectively) fitness at both individual and group level, when these
   factors conflict with each other the eventual selective pressure would
   depend on the relative returns individuals get from their social
   environment and their position within it. The presented results
   highlight the importance of a systems approach to studying animal
   sociality, in which the effects of social behaviors should be viewed not
   only through the benefits that those provide to individuals, but also in
   terms of how they affect broader social environment and how in turn this
   is reflected back on an individual's fitness.

AB Human populations are arranged in social networks that determine
   interactions and influence the spread of diseases, behaviours and ideas.
   We evaluate the spread of long-term emotional states across a social
   network. We introduce a novel form of the classical
   susceptible-infected-susceptible disease model which includes the
   possibility for 'spontaneous' (or 'automatic') infection, in addition to
   disease transmission (the SISa model). Using this framework and data
   from the Framingham Heart Study, we provide formal evidence that
   positive and negative emotional states behave like infectious diseases
   spreading across social networks over long periods of time. The
   probability of becoming content is increased by 0.02 per year for each
   content contact, and the probability of becoming discontent is increased
   by 0.04 per year per discontent contact. Our mathematical formalism
   allows us to derive various quantities from the data, such as the
   average lifetime of a contentment 'infection' (10 years) or
   discontentment 'infection' (5 years). Our results give insight into the
   transmissive nature of positive and negative emotional states.
   Determining to what extent particular emotions or behaviours are
   infectious is a promising direction for further research with important
   implications for social science, epidemiology and health policy. Our
   model provides a theoretical framework for studying the interpersonal
   spread of any state that may also arise spontaneously, such as emotions,
   behaviours, health states, ideas or diseases with reservoirs.

AB Objective: HIV testing is necessary to curb the increasing epidemic.
   However, HIV-related stigma and perceptions of low likelihood of
   societal HIV testing may reduce testing rates. This study aimed to
   explore this association in South Africa, where HIV rates are
   extraordinarily high.
   Methods: Data were taken from the Soweto and Vulindlela, South African
   sites of Project Accept, a multinational HIV prevention trial.
   Self-reported HIV testing, stigma, and social norms items were used to
   study the relationship between HIV testing, stigma, and perceptions
   about societal testing rates. The stigma items were broken into 3
   factors: negative attitudes, negative perceptions about people living
   with HIV, and perceptions of fair treatment for people living with HIV
   (equity).
   Results: Results from a univariate logistic regression suggest that
   history of HIV testing was associated with decreased negative attitudes
   about people living with HIV/AIDS, increased perceptions that people
   living with HIV/AIDS experience discrimination, and increased
   perceptions that people with HIV should be treated equitably. Results
   from a multivariate logistic regression confirm these effects and
   suggest that these differences vary according to sex and age. Compared
   with people who had never tested for HIV, those who had previously
   tested were more likely to believe that the majority of people have
   tested for HIV.
   Conclusions: Data suggest that interventions designed to increase HIV
   testing in South Africa should address stigma and perceptions of
   societal testing.

AB Background: Structural interventions change the environment in which
   people act to influence their health behaviors. Most structural
   interventions research for HIV infection has focused on developing
   countries, with the United States receiving substantially less
   attention. This article identifies some social determinants of HIV
   vulnerability in the United States and structural interventions to
   address them.
   Methods: Review of the medical, public health, and social science
   literature.
   Results: Evidence supports widespread implementation of a number of
   structural interventions in the United States clearly proximate to HIV,
   including comprehensive sex education, universal condom availability,
   expanded syringe access for drug users, health care coverage, and stable
   housing. Sociological plausibility supports evaluation and
   implementation of other interventions that target social determinants
   more distal but of relevance to HIV, such as initiatives to eliminate
   racial and ethnic disparities in criminal sentencing, to promote early
   childhood education and to decrease poverty.
   Conclusions: Structural interventions that address social determinants
   of HIV infection may be among the most cost effective methods of
   preventing HIV infection in the United States over the long term.

AB Background: Depression is a leading contributor to the burden of disease
   worldwide, a critical barrier to HIV prevention and a common serious HIV
   co-morbidity. However, depression screening and treatment are limited in
   sub-Saharan Africa, and there are few population-level studies examining
   the prevalence and gender-specific factors associated with depression.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional population-based study of 18-49
   year-old adults from five districts in Botswana with the highest
   prevalence of HIV-infection. We examined the prevalence of depressive
   symptoms, using a Hopkins Symptom Checklist for Depression (HSCL-D)
   score of >= 1.75 to define depression, and correlates of depression
   using multivariate logistic regression stratified by sex.
   Results: Of 1,268 participants surveyed, 25.3% of women and 31.4% of men
   had depression. Among women, lower education (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]
   2.07, 95% confidence interval [1.30-3.32]), higher income (1.77
   [1.09-2.86]), and lack of control in sexual decision-making (2.35
   [1.46-3.81]) were positively associated with depression. Among men,
   being single (1.95 [1.02-3.74]), living in a rural area (1.63
   [1.02-2.65]), having frequent visits to a health provider (3.29
   [1.88-5.74]), anticipated HIV stigma (fearing discrimination if HIV
   status was revealed) (2.04 [1.27-3.29]), and intergenerational sex (2.28
   [1.17-4.41]) were independently associated with depression.
   Discussion: Depression is highly prevalent in Botswana, and its
   correlates are gender-specific. Our findings suggest multiple targets
   for screening and prevention of depression and highlight the need to
   integrate mental health counseling and treatment into primary health
   care to decrease morbidity and improve HIV management efforts.

AB Self-esteem is a facet of personality that influences perception of
   social standing and modulates the salience of social acceptance and
   rejection. As such, self-esteem may bias neural responses to positive
   and negative social feedback across individuals. During functional
   magnetic resonance imaging scanning, participants (n = 42) engaged in a
   social evaluation task whereby they ostensibly received feedback from
   peers indicating they were liked or disliked. Results demonstrated that
   individuals with low self-esteem believed that they received less
   positive feedback from others and showed enhanced activity to positive
   versus negative social feedback in the ventral anterior cingulate
   cortex/medial prefrontal cortex (vACC/mPFC). By contrast, vACC/mPFC
   activity was insensitive to positive versus negative feedback in
   individuals with high self-esteem, and these individuals consistently
   overestimated the amount of positive feedback received from peers.
   Voxelwise analyses supported these findings; lower self-esteem predicted
   a linear increase in vACC/mPFC response to positive versus negative
   social feedback. Taken together, the present findings propose a
   functional role for the vACC/mPFC in representing the salience of social
   feedback and shaping perceptions of relative social standing.

AB Abstinence-only sex education is based in part on the premise that
   parents are their children's best sex educators. In-depth interviews
   with 40 mothers of teenagers suggest, by contrast, that these mothers
   experience numerous challenges around talking to their children about
   sexuality. In this paper, I examine three of the most common barriers in
   mothers' accounts of "the talk." First, mothers perceive their teenagers
   as highly resistant to these conversations. Second, they experience
   embarrassment and discomfort around talking to their teens about sex and
   sexuality. Third, they expressed ambivalence about when, what, and how
   much to say to their children about these topics. I argue that these
   obstacles are shaped by cultural anxieties and contradictions around
   parenting, sexuality, and adolescence that are fueled by debates,
   policies, and programs over the past 30 years that have promulgated a
   danger discourse of child and teen sexuality. The conclusion discusses
   the social policy implications of this research.

   research includes the role of touch in early development, touch
   deprivation, touch aversion, emotions that can be conveyed by touch, the
   importance of touch for interpersonal relationships and how friendly
   touch affects compliance in different situations. MRI data are reviewed
   showing activation of the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate cortex
   during affective touch. Physiological and biochemical effects of touch
   are also reviewed including decreased heart rate, blood pressure and
   cortisol and increased oxytocin. Similar changes noted following
   moderate pressure massage appear to be mediated by the stimulation of
   pressure receptors and increased vagal activity. Increased serotonin and
   decreased substance P may explain its pain-alleviating effects. Positive
   shifts in frontal EEG also accompany moderate pressure massage along
   with increased attentiveness, decreased depression and enhanced immune
   function including increased natural killer cells, making massage
   therapy one of the most effective forms of touch. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article discusses the [development and] use of a video life-world
   schema to explore alternative orientations to the shared health
   consultation. It is anticipated that this schema can be used by
   practitioners and consumers alike to understand the dynamics of videoed
   health consultations, the role of the participants within it and the
   potential to consciously alter the outcome by altering behaviour during
   the process of interaction. The study examines health consultation
   participation and develops an interpretative method of analysis that
   includes image elicitation (via videos), phenomenology (to identify the
   components of the analytic framework), narrative (to depict the stories
   of interactions) and a reflexive mode (to develop shared meaning through
   a conceptual framework for analysis). The analytic framework is derived
   from a life-world conception of human mutual shared interaction which is
   presented here as a novel approach to understanding patient-centred
   care. The video materials used in this study were derived from
   consultations in a Walk-in Centre (WiC) in East London. The conceptual
   framework produced through the process of video analysis is comprised of
   different combinations of movement, knowledge and emotional
   conversations that are used to classify objective or engaged WiC health
   care interactions. The videoed interactions organise along an active or
   passive, facilitative or directive typical situation continuum
   illustrating different kinds of textual approaches to practice that are
   in tension or harmony. The schema demonstrates how practitioners and
   consumers interact to produce these outcomes and indicates the potential
   for both consumers and practitioners to be educated to develop practice
   dynamics that support patient-centred care and impact on health
   outcomes.

   specifically explore how the eponymous character of the US television
   series Dexter integrates conventional face-work and stigma management
   with 'reverse marking' in order to present an unmarked person. Reverse
   marking, following Brekhus's (1996) usage, involves perceptually
   attending to those aspects of identity typically regarded as mundane. I
   argue the role reverse marking plays in Dexter's performance of identity
   draws attention to the mundane as the result of 'doing,' grounding a
   critical reevaluation of the privileged cultural location of
   unmarkedness or normativity.

AB P>The current call for public scholarship and community engagement by
   universities and disciplinary organizations has created opportunities to
   develop innovative ways to integrate research, instruction, and
   outreach. This article discusses a collaboration among scholars at the
   University of Kentucky and alternative agrifood movement organizations
   that has evolved as they pursue an alternative agrifood system in
   Kentucky. This collaboration made instructional programs in sociology
   and the honors world food issues track places in which both students and
   instructors can examine "problems" of the conventional agrifood system,
   conduct research, and develop collaborative relationships with community
   activists. We draw on Burawoy's discussion of public sociology and its
   interface with professional, critical, and policy sociologies.
   Supplementing our discussion with literature from social movements and
   science studies, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can render
   sociological knowledge and skills useful as critical support of
   alternative agrifood movements. We argue that the "experiential
   classroom" is an excellent site for the critical examination within the
   agrifood movements of oppositional culture. This, in turn, makes
   possible students' recognition of injustice in the existing agrifood
   system.

AB While structure and culture often are proclaimed dual and yet
   autonomous, this paper spells out a processual approach in which
   structure and culture are seen as intertwined and interdependent
   formations. To that end, we aim at understanding how meanings come to
   be, then build into process, and become integrated in a set of
   constructs of differing scopes, scales, and levels collectively known as
   "culture." Meanings are "sparks" generated by irregular switchings
   across socio-cultural compounds called "netdoms," mixtures of social
   networks and semiotic domains. Switchings originate from identities
   mitigating uncertainty from biophysical sources and from attempts at
   control by other identities. A "story" concatenates meanings in a
   relational structure within a horizon of possibilities. Netdoms
   constitute the fabric of socio-cultural life, wherein domains-through
   stories-provide the interpretive texture, while networks-through
   relations-supply the social texture. Socio-cultural formations invoking
   more complex compounds of stories (story-lines and plots) thereby frame
   social time, enabling, through narratives, mobilization for social
   action. We further model a level of syncopated complexity, denoted
   "style," which illuminates the puzzle of how culture and structure fit
   together. (Earlier versions of this article were presented at the
   Seminar Series in Social Network Analysis in Manchester. UK on January
   15th, 2008, at the Harvard Business School on March 17, 2008, and at the

AB Differential investment in offspring by parental and progeny gender has
   been discussed and periodically analyzed for the past 80 years as an
   evolutionary adaptive strategy. Parental investment theory suggests that
   parents in poor condition have offspring in poor condition. Conversely,
   parents in good condition give rise to offspring in good condition. As
   formalized in the Trivers-Willard hypothesis (TWH), investment in
   daughters will be greater under poor conditions while sons receive
   greater parental investment under good conditions. Condition is
   ultimately equated to offspring reproductive fitness, with parents
   apparently using a strategy to maximize their genetic contribution to
   future generations. Analyses of sex ratio have been used to support
   parental investment theory and in many instances, though not all,
   results provide support for TWH. In the present investigation, economic
   strategies were analyzed in the context of offspring sex ratio and
   survival to reproductive age in a Zapotec-speaking community in the
   Valley of Oaxaca, southern Mexico. Growth status of children, adult
   stature, and agricultural resources were analyzed as proxies for
   parental and progeny condition in present and prior generations.
   Traditional marriage practice in Mesoamerican peasant communities is
   patrilocal postnuptial residence with investments largely favoring sons.
   The alternative, practiced by similar to 25% of parents, is matrilocal
   postnuptial residence which is an investment favoring daughters. Results
   indicated that sex ratio of offspring survival to reproductive age was
   related to economic strategy and differed significantly between the
   patrilocal and matrilocal strategies. Variance in sex ratio was affected
   by condition of parents and significant differences in survival to
   reproductive age were strongly associated with economic strategy. While
   the results strongly support TWH, further studies in traditional
   anthropological populations are needed. Am J Phys Anthropol 143:501-511,

AB Background: Although lack of affordable housing is common in the U.S.,
   few studies have examined the association between housing affordability
   and health.
   Purpose: Using quasi-experimental methods, the aim of this study was to
   examine whether housing affordability is linked to a number of important
   health outcomes, controlling for perceptions of neighborhood quality,
   and determining whether this association differs by housing tenure
   (renting versus owning).
   Methods: Data from the 2008 Southeastern Pennsylvania Household Health
   Survey, a telephone-based survey of 10,004 residents of Philadelphia and
   its four surrounding counties, were analyzed. The association between
   housing affordability and health outcomes was assessed using propensity
   score methods to compare individuals who reported living in unaffordable
   housing situations to similar individuals living in affordable ones.
   Results: Overall, 48.4% reported difficulty paying housing costs. People
   living in unaffordable housing had increased odds of poor self-rated
   health (AOR=1.75, 95% CI=1.33, 2.29); hypertension (AOR=1.34, 95%
   CI=1.07, 1.69); arthritis (AOR=1.92, 95% CI=1.56, 2.35); cost-related
   healthcare nonadherence (AOR=2.94, 95% CI=2.04, 4.25); and cost-related
   prescription nonadherence (AOR=2.68, 95% CI=1.95, 3.70). There were no
   significant associations between housing affordability and heart
   disease, diabetes, asthma, psychiatric conditions, being uninsured,
   emergency department visits in the past year, obesity, and being a
   current smoker. Renting rather than owning a home heightened the
   association between unaffordable housing and self-rated health
   (AOR=2.55, 95% CI=1.93, 3.37 for renters and not significant among
   homeowners) and cost-related healthcare nonadherence (AOR=4.74, 95%
   CI=3.05, 7.35 for renters and AOR=1.99, 95% CI=1.15, 3.46 for
   homeowners).
   Conclusions: The financial strain of unaffordable housing is associated
   with trade-offs that may harm health. Programs that target housing
   affordability for both renters and homeowners may be an important means
   for improving health. (Am J Prev Med 2010;39(6): 515-521) (C) 2010

AB Local, state, and national policies that limit the hours that alcoholic
   beverages may be available for sale might be a means of reducing
   excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. The methods of the
   Guide to Community Preventive Services were used to synthesize
   scientific evidence on the effectiveness of such policies. All of the
   studies included in this review assessed the effects of increasing hours
   of sale in on-premises settings (in which alcoholic beverages are
   consumed where purchased) in high-income nations. None of the studies
   was conducted in the U. S. The review team's initial assessment of this
   evidence suggested that changes of less than 2 hours were unlikely to
   significantly affect excessive alcohol consumption and related harms; to
   explore this hypothesis, studies assessing the effects of changing hours
   of sale by less than 2 hours and by 2 or more hours were assessed
   separately.
   There was sufficient evidence in ten qualifying studies to conclude that
   increasing hours of sale by 2 or more hours increases alcohol-related
   harms. Thus, disallowing extensions of hours of alcohol sales by 2 or
   more should be expected to prevent alcohol-related harms, while policies
   decreasing hours of sale by 2 hours or more at on-premises alcohol
   outlets may be an effective strategy for preventing alcohol-related
   harms. The evidence from six qualifying studies was insufficient to
   determine whether increasing hours of sale by less than 2 hours
   increases excessive alcohol consumption and related harms. (Am J Prev

AB Background: The impact of local availability of healthy foods on dietary
   intake and health has been established. Interventions to local
   environments are being evaluated for their efficacy and sustainability.
   Purpose: The aim of this paper is to provide an evaluation of a
   community-driven approach to transform neighborhood healthy food
   availability.
   Methods: The information provided comes from minutes of monthly meetings
   of the partners, newsletters, media, and other store and project
   documentation. In addition, qualitative interviews with key stakeholders
   and co-op members were conducted. All of the participating individuals
   were interviewed during 2008 and analysis took place in 2010. Each
   interview was audio-taped and transcribed to form verbatim transcripts,
   then content analyzed for themes.
   Results: The implementation phase of the initiative had long-standing
   negative repercussions on the ability of the store to be successful
   because of renting too large a space; not branding the store early;
   early misperceptions by community members about the store; and the
   changing of organizational partners and personnel, which resulted in a
   lack of leadership for the store. Equally important, the lack of project
   personnel or consultants with business experience directly related to
   operating a food store reverberated into issues related to marketing,
   price structuring, decisions about stocking the store, as well as
   accounting.
   Conclusions: Repercussions of these challenges included unmet goals in
   terms of attracting local residents to become members of the co-op, low
   sales levels, and reduced confidence in the long-term sustainability of
   the food cooperative. Approaches to modifications of local food
   environments are likely to require additional resources beyond funding
   in order to secure positive outcomes. (Am J Prev Med 2010;39(6):e31-e38)

   community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that?
   We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific
   contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box
   imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that
   as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall
   network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now
   considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the
   non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to
   currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular
   phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting
   meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a
   niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a
   typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en
   route to consensus.

AB Background Traditionally, weight management behavioral research has
   focused on individual-level influences, with little attention given to
   interpersonal factors that relate to the family behavioral context.
   Purpose This research examines the association between baseline family
   functioning scores and weight loss success in a sample of African
   Americans and Whites enrolled in a 20-week weight loss program with a
   weight loss goal of >= 4 kg.
   Methods Baseline surveys measuring six family functioning constructs
   were completed by 291 participants in a trial of weight loss
   maintenance. Analysis was limited to 217 participants in households with
   at least one other family member, and providing final weight
   measurements. We evaluated associations of family functioning, family
   composition, and demographic variables with weight loss success defined
   as losing >= 5% of initial body weight. Baseline predictors of weight
   loss success were determined using logistic regression analysis.
   Results Participants were on average 61 years of age with BMI of 34
   kg/m(2); 57% were female and 75% self-identified as African American.
   Sixty-two percent lost at least 5% of initial body weight. In bivariate
   analysis, weight loss success was associated with higher income and
   education (p<0.01 and p=0.05, respectively), ethnicity (p<0.01), and the
   presence of a spouse (p=0.01). After adjusting for socio-demographic
   covariates in a multivariable model, the odds of weight loss success
   were independently influenced by a significant interaction between
   ethnicity and family cohesion (p<0.01).
   Conclusions These findings suggest that family context factors influence
   weight loss behaviors.

AB Opponents and proponents of erotic representations (referred to
   hereafter as "pornography") have described the effects of pornography
   from their perspective. Little, however, has been done in the way of
   research to investigate these claims from the consumer's point of view.
   This especially has been so regarding the positive impact of such
   consumption on a person's sex life. Using a study group of 245 college
   students, we examined this question in a framework of scripting theory.
   We wanted to see whether viewing pornography appeared to expand sexual
   horizons through normalization and facilitate a willingness to explore
   new sexual behaviors and sexual relationships through empowerment. The
   data supported this viewpoint and further showed the effects to be
   mediated by gender and sexual preference identity. They suggested,
   however, that established scripts were extended rather than abandoned.
   We conclude with connections between our findings and the widespread
   viewing of pornography in contemporary society.

AB Vagal tone (VT), an index of autonomic flexibility, is linked to social
   and psychological well-being. We posit that the association between Wand
   well-being reflects an "upward spiral" in which autonomic flexibility,
   represented by W, facilitates capitalizing on social and emotional
   opportunities and the resulting opportunistic gains, in turn, lead to
   higher VT. Community-dwelling adults were asked to monitor and report
   their positive emotions and the degree to which they felt socially
   connected each day for 9 weeks. VT was measured at the beginning and end
   of the 9-week period. Adults who possessed higher initial levels of VT
   increased in connectedness and positive emotions more rapidly than
   others. Furthermore, increases in connectedness and positive emotions
   predicted increases in VT, independent of initial VT level. This
   evidence is consistent with an "upward spiral" relationship of
   reciprocal causality, in which VT and psychosocial well-being
   reciprocally and prospectively predict one another. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Within a physicalist-mechanistic worldview, in which we cannot be more
   than intelligent, self-reproducing biomachines or biobots, fundamentals
   of a new approach to the science of-human self-explanation are outlined.
   Some a priori logical necessities, or determinants, of any biobot's
   control system design are recognized. Evolution had to satisfy them, but
   neuroscience and cognitive science so far do not clearly see these
   basics. It is concluded that the old part of the brain (roughly brain
   stem) still contains the genetically fixed drives, responses, and the
   physiological control. Here is the seat of an ancient somatic self that
   is not intelligent but is still the active center of our life. The
   neocortex has evolved to serve the somatic self with intelligence by
   individually building a virtual model of the external material and
   social world. This model is used by the somatic self to "pre-play"
   intended actions and responses to see whether they would satisfy its
   needs. This schema of global brain function provides the neurological
   foundation for the ego-id dichotomy in analytic psychology, as well as
   some critique of it. Following the groundbreaking experiments by
   Benjamin Libet (1985) and John-Dylan Haynes et al. (2008), consciousness
   is taken as a "theater" that presents what the neural networks already
   have worked out, and freedom of the will is limited. The explosive
   growth of culture and civilization began when neocortical power exceeded
   a certain threshold. This can be taken as a quasi-mutation that
   projected us into a supra-biological space of existence that is new to
   natural history. It is not clear whether this event will lead to a
   positive future for humanity or to doom. Functional religion is seen as
   a neurosystemic attempt to bring back the earlier natural state. Thus,
   it can be valuable when cleared of mythological ballast.(1)

AB Background: Asians and Hispanics have the highest incidence rates of
   liver cancer in the United States, but little is known about how
   incidence patterns in these largely immigrant populations vary by
   nativity, acculturation, and socioeconomic status (SES). Such variations
   can identify high-priority subgroups for prevention and monitoring.
   Methods: Incidence rates and rate ratios (IRR) by nativity among 5,400
   Hispanics and 5,809 Asians diagnosed with liver cancer in 1988-2004 were
   calculated in the California Cancer Registry. Neighborhood ethnic
   enclave status and SES were classified using 2000 U.S. Census data for
   cases diagnosed in 1998-2002.
   Results: Foreign-born Hispanic males had significantly lower liver
   cancer incidence rates than U.S.-born Hispanic males in 1988-2004 (e.
   g., IRR = 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.50-0.59 in 1997-2004),
   whereas foreign-born Hispanic females had significantly higher rates in
   1988-1996 (IRR - 1.42, 95% CI - 1.18-1.71), but not 1997-2004.
   Foreign-born Asian males and females had up to 5-fold higher rates than
   the U. S.-born. Among Hispanic females, incidence rates were elevated by
   21% in higher-enclave versus lower-enclave neighborhoods, and by 24% in
   lower-versus higher-SES neighborhoods. Among Asian males, incidence
   rates were elevated by 23% in higher-enclave neighborhoods and by 21% in
   lower-SES neighborhoods. In both racial/ethnic populations, males and
   females in higher-enclave, lower-SES neighborhoods had higher incidence
   rates.
   Conclusions: Nativity, residential enclave status, and neighborhood SES
   characterize Hispanics and Asians with significantly unequal incidence
   rates of liver cancer, implicating behavioral or environmental risk
   factors and revealing opportunities for prevention.
   Impact: Liver cancer control efforts should especially target
   foreign-born Asians, U. S.-born Hispanic men, and residents of lower-SES
   ethnic enclaves. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 19(12); 3106-18. (C)

   assigned to the treatment conditions (2 schools in each condition).
   Children were followed over two academic years. At an 18-month
   assessment, the ATD program resulted in healthier alcohol and tobacco
   expectancies as compared to the HEE program. Children in the ATD program
   did not differ from those in the HEE program in alcohol, tobacco, or
   drug use prevalence. However, prevalence rates of use were very low
   across all schools. Findings can benefit future prevention efforts with
   young children and suggest that strategies for preventing continued
   smoking in this age group are needed.

AB We investigated individual differences in adherence to masculine norms
   (AMN) as predictors of concurrent and prospective depressive symptoms
   above and beyond negative attributional style and explanatory
   flexibility in a community sample of unemployed men. Sixty-two men from
   diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds were recruited from an
   unemployment center in a large industrial city and were followed for 3
   months. Adherence to the specific masculine norms of emotional control
   and self-reliance accounted for variance in concurrent depressive
   symptoms after statistically controlling for attributional processes. At
   the 3-month follow-up, only AMN predicted depressive symptoms after
   accounting for attributional processes and initial depressive symptoms.
   Negative attributional style was negatively associated with the
   likelihood of reemployment at the 3-month follow-up while AMN was
   positively associated with the likelihood reemployment. Results
   suggested that AMN may be an important sociocultural factor contributing
   to depression that is largely independent of attributional processes.

AB One of the primary approaches to environmental conservation emphasizes
   economic development. This conservation-and-development approach often
   ignores how development affects sociocultural characteristics that may
   motivate environmental behaviors (actions that actively benefit or limit
   one's negative impacts on the environment). Evolutionary anthropologists
   espouse a theoretical perspective that supports the
   conservation-and-development approach. Others believe sociocultural
   factors are the foundation of environmental behavior and worry that
   development will erode the values and norms that may shape such
   behavior. My research assistants and I surveyed 170 individuals from
   eight villages in two communities in Bhutan to explore whether economic
   (wealth, market integration) or social (religious behaviors,
   environmental values, social capital) factors are better indicators of
   environmental behavior. I used multilevel modeling to analyze use of
   fuelwood, use of agricultural chemicals, and tree planting, and to
   determine whether social norms were associated with these behaviors.
   Although economic factors were more often associated with these
   behaviors than social factors, local conditions and control variables
   were the best indicators of behaviors. Furthermore, economic factors
   were not always associated with positive environmental outcomes.
   Instead, farmers attempted to make the best economic decisions given
   their circumstances rather than seeking to conserve resources. Although
   religion was not a strong predictor of any of the behaviors I examined,
   I found evidence that the understanding of Buddhist philosophy is
   growing, which suggests that social factors may play a more prominent
   role as Bhutan's development progresses. My results highlight the need
   for conservation planners to be aware of local conditions when planning
   and implementing policies aimed at motivating environmental behaviors
   and that economic and social motivations for conservation may not be
   mutually exclusive.

   during DMPA use
   Study Design A multicenter prospective nonrandomized study of 181 female
   adolescents who initiated DMPA for contraception was conducted BMD (by
   dual-energy X ray absorptiometry) and serum estradiol were measured at
   initiation and every 6 months for 240 weeks of DMPA use
   Results Half of participants experienced BMD loss of >= 5% from baseline
   at the hip and a quarter experienced BMD loss of >= 5% it the lumbar
   spine (BMD substantial losers, SL) Hip and lumbar spine BMD SL received
   a significantly greater number of DMPA injections than non-SL (p<001)
   Decreased estradiol levels did not statistically differ between BMD loss
   subgroups Hip BMD-SL had significantly lower baseline body mass index

AB During the French Revolution, there appeared a striking and far-ranging
   medical literature on heredity, reproduction and biological
   'perfectibility'. In some ways anticipating ideas associated with modern
   eugenics, these writings emerged from radical revolutionary projects for
   'physical and moral regeneration' and incarnated deep-seated desires to
   transform French society and make a 'new man' in mind and body. But by
   breaking down boundaries between public and private life, doctors did
   more than just try to regulate intimate sexual behaviour. Instead, they
   proffered a more intimate vision of civic volunteerism, in which sexual
   hygiene and domestic practices allowed their patients to imagine new
   forms of society and gave them ways to attain these socio-political
   dreams. Moreover, they were responding to powerful new worries about
   heredity and sought to counsel their patients in the ways of family
   panning. By the end of revolutionary period, then, medical and lay
   thinkers had transformed the marriage bed and household into a specially
   controlled environment - a kind of affective laboratory - in which
   conscientious parents could make healthy children and raise them in the
   context of specific political and social values.

AB Recent years have witnessed the growth of new information technologies
   and their applications to various disciplines. The goal of this paper is
   to demonstrate how the two innovative methods, upper level set scan
   (ULS) hotspot detection and the multicriteria prioritization scheme,
   facilitate population health and break new ground in public health
   surveillance. It is believed that the social environment (i.e. social
   conditions and social capital) is one of the determinants of human
   health. Using infant health data and 10 additional indicators of social
   environment in the 159 counties of Georgia, ULS identified 52 counties
   that are in double jeopardy (high infant mortality and a high rate of
   low infant birth weight). The multicriteria ranking scheme suggested
   that there was no conspicuous spatial cluster of ranking orders, which
   improved the traditional decision making by visual geographic cluster.
   Both hotspot detection and ranking methods provided an empirical basis
   for re-allocating limited resources and several policy implications
   could be drawn from these analytic results.

AB This article describes the development of an innovative community-based
   program, One Hundred Intentional Acts of Kindness toward a Pregnant
   Woman (c) (100 Acts), which seeks to increase reproductive social
   capital for pregnant women in south and central Los Angeles communities.
   Reproductive social capital includes features such as networks, norms,
   and social trust that facilitate optimal reproductive health within a
   community. 100 Acts was designed and developed by the Healthy African
   American Families project, using community participatory methods, to
   increase local community and social network support for pregnant women.
   Dialog groups with pregnant women identified specific actions that
   families, friends, and strangers might do to support pregnancies.
   Participants primarily wanted emotional and instrumental support from
   family and friends. From strangers, they wanted respect for personal
   space and common courtesy. Based on these results, the 100 Acts was
   created for use in the Los Angeles community. 100 Acts encourages and
   engages active participation from community members in promoting healthy
   pregnancies. By seeking to increase community-level reproductive social
   capital, 100 Acts shifts the provision of social support during
   pregnancy from a high-risk approach to a population approach. 100 Acts
   also establishes new social norms about how pregnant women are valued,
   treated and respected. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20 [Suppl 2]:s2-36 s2-40)

AB Objectives: To: 1) review the historical contexts and current profiles
   of father involvement in African American families; 2) identify barriers
   to, and supports of, involvement; 3) evaluate the effectiveness of
   father involvement programs; and 4) recommend directions for future
   research, programs, and public policies.
   Methods: Review of observational and interventional studies on father
   involvement.
   Results: Several historical developments (slavery, declining employment
   for Black men and increasing workforce participation for Black women,
   and welfare policies that favored single mothers) led to father absence
   from African American families. Today, more than two thirds of Black
   infants are born to unmarried mothers. Even if unmarried fathers are
   actively involved initially, their involvement over time declines. We
   identified multiple barriers to, and supports of, father involvement at
   multiple levels. These levels include intrapersonal (eg, human capital,
   attitudes and beliefs about parenting), interpersonal (eg, the father's
   relationships with the mother and maternal grandmother), neighborhoods
   and communities (eg, high unemployment and incarceration rates),
   cultural or societal (eg popular cultural perceptions of Black fathers
   as expendable and irresponsible, racial stratification and
   institutionalized racism), policy (eg, Earned Income Tax Credit,
   Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child support enforcement), and
   life-course factors (eg,, father involvement by the father's father). We
   found strong evidence of success for several intervention programs (eg,
   Reducing the Risk, Teen Outreach Program, and Children's Aid Society -
   Carrera Program) designed to prevent formation of father-absent
   families, but less is known about the effectiveness of programs to
   encourage greater father involvement because of a lack of rigorous
   research design and evaluation for most programs.
   Conclusion: A multi-level, life-course approach is needed to strengthen
   the capacity of African American men to promote greater involvement in
   pregnancy and parenting as they become fathers. (Ethn Dis. 2010;

AB In the United States, Black infants have significantly worse birth
   outcomes than White infants. Over the past decades, public health
   efforts to address these disparities have focused primarily on
   increasing access to prenatal care, however, this has not led to closing
   the gap in birth outcomes. We propose a 12-point plan to reduce
   Black-White disparities in birth outcomes using a life-course approach.
   The first four points (increase access to interconception care,
   preconception care, quality prenatal care, and healthcare throughout the
   life course) address the needs of African American women for quality
   healthcare across the lifespan. The next four points (strengthen father
   involvement, systems integration, reproductive social capital, and
   community building) go beyond individual-level interventions to address
   enhancing family and community systems that may influence the health of
   pregnant women, families, and communities. The last four points (close
   the education gap, reduce poverty, support working mothers, and undo
   racism) move beyond the biomedical model to address the social and
   economic inequities that underlie much of health disparities. Closing
   the Black-White gap in birth outcomes requires a life course approach
   which addresses both early life disadvantages and cumulative allostatic
   load over the life course. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20 [Suppl 21:s2-62 s2-76)

AB Introduction: US disparities in Black:White infant mortality are
   persistent. National trends, however, may obscure local successes.
   Methods: Zero-corrected, negative binomial multivariable modeling was
   used to predict Black infant mortality (1999-2003) in all US counties
   with reliable rates. Independent variables included county population
   size, racial composition, educational attainment, poverty, income and
   geographic origin. Resilient counties were defined as those whose Black
   infant mortality rate residual score was <2.0. Mortality data was
   accessed from the Compressed Mortality File compiled by the National
   Center for Health Statistics and found on the CDC WONDER website.
   Demographic information was obtained from the US Census.
   Results: The final model included the percentage of Blacks, age 18 to 64
   years, speaking little or no English (P<.008), a socioeconomic index
   comprising educational attainment, poverty, and per capita income
   (P<.001), and household income in 1990 (P<.001). After accounting for
   these factors, a stratum comprising Essex and Plymouth Counties, Mass.;
   Bronx, N.Y.; and Multnomah, Ore. was identified as unusually resilient.
   Percentage of Black poverty and educational attainment in Black women in
   the resilient stratum approximated the average for all 330 counties. In
   1979, Black infant mortality in the resilient stratum (23.6 per 1,000
   live births) exceeded Black US infant mortality (22.6). By 2001, Black
   infant mortality in the resilient stratum (5.6) was below the
   corresponding value for Whites (5.7). Resilient county neonatal
   mortality declined both early and late in the observation period, while
   post-neonatal declines were most marked after 1996.
   Conclusions: Models for reduction/elimination of racial disparities in
   US infant mortality, independent from county-level contextual measures
   of socioeconomic status, may already exist. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20[Suppl

   America's Families to investigate the demographic and family
   characteristics and well-being of stepchildren who have been adopted by
   a stepparent (n = 140) relative to children with 2 biological parents,
   children with 2 adoptive parents, and children with 1 biological parent
   and 1 nonadoptive stepparent. Five percent of all stepchildren and one
   quarter of all adopted children have been adopted by a stepparent. How
   the characteristics of adopted stepchildren compare to those of other
   children depends on the child's age-whereas younger adopted stepchildren
   are most similar to children with 2 biological parents, older adopted
   stepchildren are most similar to nonadopted stepchildren. Adopted
   stepchildren of all ages have significantly more behavior and emotional
   problems than children with 2 biological parents, but have similar
   levels of school engagement. There were no significant differences
   between children with 2 adoptive parents, nonadopted stepchildren, and
   adopted stepchildren on any measure of well-being regardless of the
   child's age. Implications for practice and policy include increasing
   awareness of adopted stepchildren and paying greater attention to the
   legal context under which stepchildren are adopted.

AB School shootings have become more common in the United States in recent
   years. Yet, as media portrayals of these 'rampages' shock the public,
   the characterisation of this violence obscures an important point: many
   of these crimes culminate in suicide, and they are almost universally
   committed by males. We examine three recent American cases, which
   involve suicide, to elucidate how the culture of hegemonic masculinity
   in the US creates a sense of aggrieved entitlement conducive to
   violence. This sense of entitlement simultaneously frames suicide as an
   appropriate, instrumental behaviour for these males to underscore their
   violent enactment of masculinity.

   little empirical research has sought to investigate this phenomenon
   beyond anecdotal evidence. Utilising data from the Urban Men's Health
   Study (UMHS) (n = 2881), this research offers a unique opportunity to
   investigate empirically claims of-the down low beyond small
   opportunistic samples. We find significant support for the down low
   among Blacks and Latinos and its association with high-risk sexual
   behaviour. These findings highlight the need for future research that
   better understands the impact of the phenomenon within a cultural and

AB This qualitative study into Australian manhood featured 63 men
   discussing 'acceptable' masculinity. Homophobic humour emerged as
   central to the formation of Australian male identity, but it had the
   potential to induce violence and emotional damage when the 'humour'
   moved along a malleable continuum from good-natured banter to abuse.
   Significantly, it was men of all sexualities who were targeted,
   indicating that it was non-conformity to gender norms as well as
   sexuality being policed, as boys and men used humour to control and
   humiliate each other Recollections of these instances ranged from 'it
   was just a joke' for some perpetrators, to 'orchestrated cruelty' for
   men who had been victimised. Some of the latter group reported
   depression extending, into their adult lives based on their youthful
   experiences. Understanding the impact when humour goes 'beyond a joke'
   is important for policy makers, educators and healthcare workers, as a
   potential for emotional damage and physical violence is highlighted. The
   study highlights the importance of understanding masculinity as an
   influence on men's health and wellness.

AB To evaluate the interaction of gender with social network mechanisms and
   smoking behaviors in Seoul, South Korea, where smoking is common among
   men but not women.
   During 2002, telephone surveys were completed with 500 adults drawn from
   a probability sample in Seoul. Respondents described their smoking
   status, smoking rate (number of cigarettes smoked per day) and social
   networks by assessing who discouraged or encouraged smoking (smoking
   support) or smoked (smoking models). Multivariable regressions were used
   for analyses.
   Women encountered significantly less smoking support than men, 88% (95%
   confidence interval [95% CI], 85-91) versus 70% (95% CI 66-73) net
   discouragement of smoking in their network. A difference in smoking
   support from 25 to 75% net discouragement was associated with a 27% (95%
   CI 9-49) lower probability of smoking among women, significantly
   stronger (z = 3.18, p < 0.01) than among men who had a 19% (95% CI 8-27)
   lower probability of smoking. A similar difference in smoking support
   was associated with male smokers smoking 6.38 (95% CI 0.86-12.30) fewer
   cigarettes per day, or 2,329 (95% CI 314-4,490) fewer cigarettes per
   year. The later association could not be observed among women due to the
   small proportion of female smokers. Smoking models were not
   significantly associated with any smoking behaviors across genders.
   Social network mechanisms were differentially associated with the high
   smoking prevalence among men and low prevalence among women and should
   be targeted by interventions tailored to these differences.

   (APP=33%, 95% CI=22-45) and specialty care (APP=26%, 95% CI=16-39) than
   those aged 65 and older. Participants aged 50 to 64 were generally less
   likely to receive preventive services, including influenza and
   pneumococcal vaccines and colonoscopy than older participants, but women
   were more likely to receive mammograms. Participants aged 50 to 64 had
   more problems obtaining recommended preventive care and faced more
   delays in care than those aged 65 and older, particularly if they were
   uninsured. Providing insurance coverage for this group may improve
   access to preventive care and promote wellness.

AB Despite the lack of consensus regarding the meaning or significance of
   race or ethnicity amongst scientists and the lay public, there are legal
   requirements and guidelines that dictate the collection of racial and
   ethnic data across a range of institutions. Legal regulations are
   typically created through a political process and then face varying
   kinds of resistance when the state tries to implement them. We explore
   the nature of this opposition by comparing responses from businesses,
   scientists, and science-oriented businesses (pharmaceutical and
   biotechnology companies) to U.S. state regulations that used politically
   derived racial categorizations, originally created to pursue civil
   rights goals. We argue that insights from cultural sociology regarding
   institutional and cultural boundaries can aid understanding of the
   nature of resistance to regulation. The Food and Drug Administration's
   guidelines for research by pharmaceutical companies imposed race
   categories on science-based businesses, leading to objections that
   emphasized the autonomy and validity of science. In contrast, similar
   race categories regulating first business by the Equal Employment
   Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and later scientific research sponsored by
   the National Institutes of Health (NIH) encountered little challenge. We
   argue that pharmaceutical companies had the motive (profit) that
   NIH-supported scientists lacked and a legitimate discourse (boundary
   work of science) that businesses regulated by the EEOC did not have. The
   study suggests the utility of a comparative cultural sociology of the
   politics of legal regulation, particularly when understanding
   race-related regulation and the importance of examining legal
   regulations for exploring how the meaning of race or ethnicity are
   contested and constructed in law.

AB OBJECTIVE: Southeast Asian American families are underrepresented among
   recipients of special education and social services for people with
   developmental disabilities. Our aims were to use a community-based
   participatory research approach to examine Hmong and Mien families'
   perceptions of developmental disabilities and understand barriers to and
   facilitators of service provision among families experiencing
   developmental disabilities. We describe here a case study of a
   successful attempt to engage marginalized and underserved communities to
   understand their needs to improve access and services for persons with
   developmental disabilities.
   METHODS: We conducted 2 focus groups with 11 key informants and 1 focus
   group with 10 family members of persons with developmental disabilities,
   as well as in-depth interviews with 3 shamans. Using a thematic analysis
   approach, we coded notes and transcripts to assess community members'
   understanding of developmental disabilities, experiences negotiating
   educational and health care systems, and barriers to high-quality care.
   RESULTS: A predominant theme was the perception that reliance on
   governmental support services is not appropriate. Common barriers
   identified included lack of accurate information, language difficulties,
   lack of trust, and limited outreach. These perceptions and barriers,
   combined with limited access to services, interfere with community
   acceptance and use of available support services. Despite these
   barriers, participants indicated that with education, outreach, and
   culturally responsive support, families would likely accept services.
   CONCLUSIONS: Community-based participatory methods are effective for
   eliciting root causes of health inequities in marginalized communities.
   Outreach to community-based organizations and an inclusive research
   practice identified social and cultural reasons for low service uptake
   and provided a pathway for the community to improve services for persons
   with developmental disabilities. Pediatrics 2010; 126: S146-S150

AB Autobiographical narratives of illness and disability are influential in
   popular and medical discourses of illness and disability, in part
   because these narratives represent illness and disability within a
   sociocultural context, intersecting with other categories of difference.
   Clinicians can benefit patients through a critical understanding of the
   formal and social conventions that shape illness and disability
   narratives and the effect these conventions can have on the lived
   experience of illness and disability. I analyze the 2003 edition of Lucy
   Grealy's Autobiography of a Face to illustrate these socio-narrative
   conventions, especially in fight of an afterword that significantly
   revises the ending to C realy's narrative. I explore the parallels
   between narrative conventions-such as the "recovery narrative"-and
   caregivers' expectations that shape the role of the "good patient," as
   well as the resistance to conventions of closure, represented by the
   "renegotiated ending."

AB The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) is a relatively new
   measure of implicit cognition that tests cognition as relational
   behavior instead of an associative activity and thus may provide a more
   specific measure of cognitive repertoires, including those for social
   biases, than better known implicit measures such as the Implicit
   Association Test (IAT). A small body of IRAP research provides tentative
   evidence for this measure's potential. The current study adds to this
   research by using the IRAP to assess for social biases for race,
   religion, gender, and obesity. Overall results show medium to large
   effect sizes for all conditions except obesity, as well as interesting
   trends at the trial-type level. These outcomes and possible future
   directions of IRAP research are discussed.

AB In contemporary art, the curator plays an important role in the
   production of artistic meaning through exhibition-making. Although
   sociology has tended to see this work as the exercise of tacit or
   embodied knowledge, curatorial knowledge and plans may be elaborated and
   altered by the situated actions of exhibition installation. While
   curators know a successful installation "when they see it," this depends
   on the indexical particularities of artworks and environments which
   cannot be predicted in advance. In demonstrating the practical ways in
   which culture is mobilized in situations of object (inter) action, this
   paper emphasizes the "making" in artistic meaning-making.

   To determine how frequently disciplinary terminology moves from
   discipline to discipline and to measure how long it takes for a term to
   be established in another discipline.
   Methods
   Using sociology and political science as case studies, core concepts in
   each discipline are identified and their usage in the home and the other
   (adoptive) discipline assessed through a content analysis of three top
   journals in each field.
   Results
   Movement of concepts between the two disciplines is sparse, though
   political science is more of a borrower from sociology than the reverse.
   Conclusions
   Interdisciplinary ideas have not been likely to flourish in leading
   disciplinary outlets over the past century, and there seems to be little

AB Culture has long shaped individuals' response to problems. A classic
   puzzle in the sociology of health and illness is discrepancy between
   theory and research regarding cultural beliefs and medical care service
   use. "Utilization research," examining individuals' responses to the
   onset of health problems, has not consistently found an effect of
   culture on the uptake of formal treatment. While ethnographic research
   often describes how culture shapes illness behaviors, survey-based
   studies rarely find significant effects of predispositions once "need"
   is controlled. In quantitative studies, individuals report supportive
   treatment beliefs or predispositions to use services but low utilization
   levels, reinforcing claims about lack of utility of cultural ideologies
   in health-care decision making. We ask whether innovations in the
   sociology of culture and cognition provide the theoretical scaffolding
   to conceptualize and measure culture in health service utilization.
   Examining data from the General Social Survey, we focus on how different
   approaches to culture might explain the paradox of high cultural
   predispositions and low actual use. Children with mental health problems
   provide a comparison between suggestions and endorsements. Suggestions,
   sources of care offered by individuals in response to a case description
   without any other social cues, align with new cultural approaches, and
   are measured by responses to open-ended questions about what should be
   done for the child described (meeting clinical criteria for ADHD, major
   depression, asthma, or "daily troubles"). Endorsements, requiring less
   cognitive work and cultural resistance, align with traditional
   conceptualizations of culture, and are measured by closed-ended
   questions that ask respondents to agree or disagree with seeking help
   from different treatment options placed later in the survey. We find
   that suggestions reveal cultural predispositions to use services
   corresponding closely to reported utilization levels; endorsements
   reveal high, unrealistic cultural predispositions to use services.
   Further, suggestions are associated with sociodemographics that proxy
   culture (e.g., race), while endorsements are associated only with
   perceived need.

AB Despite sociology's longstanding interest in inequality, the
   internalization of racial oppression among the racially subordinated and
   its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been
   largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently,
   internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood
   components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by
   defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and
   the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the
   concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on
   critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a
   theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism,
   and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by
   offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance
   concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression.

AB Sociology requires a robust theory of how local circumstances create
   social order. When we analyze social structures not recognizing that
   they depend on groups with collective pasts and futures that are
   spatially situated and that are based on personal relations, we avoid a
   core sociological dimension: the importance of local context in
   constituting social worlds. Too often this has been the sociological
   stance, both in micro-sociological studies that examine interaction as
   untethered from local traditions and in research that treats culture as
   autonomous from action and choice. Building on theories of action, group
   dynamics, and micro-cultures, I argue that a sociology of the local
   solves critical theoretical problems. The local is a stage on which
   social order gets produced and a lens for understanding how particular
   forms of action are selected. Treating ethnographic studies as readings
   of ongoing cultures, I examine how the continuing and referential
   features of group life (spatial arenas, relations, shared pasts)
   generate action and argue that local practices provide the basis for
   cultural extension, influencing societal expectations through the
   linkages among groups.

AB Based on qualitative analysis of the Soviet press and official state

   simply as an ascetic ethos but in broader terms of the cult of
   individualism, I demonstrate that the Soviet party-state promoted ideas
   and values of individuality, self-expression, and pleasure seeking in
   the areas of work and consumption. By broadening our conception of the
   spirit of capitalism, tracing the formation of capitalist dispositions
   as well as institutions, and showing that the culture of capitalism can
   come from within the old regime, I further the agenda of neoclassical
   sociology of studying varieties of origins, paths, and destinations of
   modern capitalisms.

AB Christianity has expectations regarding appropriate gender roles, the

   themselves, move their bodies in new ways, become empowered, and feel
   sensual. Many Christian belly dancers also consider the dance to be
   spiritual. Yet, most of these women do not personally experience
   conflict between belly dance and Christianity. Utilizing interviews with
   27 Catholic and Protestant female belly dancers, this project examines
   how Christian belly dancers integrate their identities derived from both
   worlds without experiencing conflict. Results show that along with
   maintaining dual roles, selectively defining religion, and separating
   roles, belly dancers use a new strategy that I call "setting intention"
   to integrate their Christianity and belly dancing. These findings
   illustrate how identity integration techniques are used without a
   history of conflict, and how people combine their identities derived
   from religious institutions with spiritually meaningful leisure
   activities that challenge some of their religion's tenets.

   would create normative deregulation and elevated suicide rates over the

AB Background: In the 10 years since publication of the Institute of
   Medicine's report To Err Is Human, extensive efforts have been
   undertaken to improve patient safety. The success of these efforts
   remains unclear.
   Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of a stratified random
   sample of 10 hospitals in North Carolina. A total of 100 admissions per
   quarter from January 2002 through December 2007 were reviewed in random
   order by teams of nurse reviewers both within the hospitals (internal
   reviewers) and outside the hospitals (external reviewers) with the use
   of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Global Trigger Tool for
   Measuring Adverse Events. Suspected harms that were identified on
   initial review were evaluated by two independent physician reviewers. We
   evaluated changes in the rates of harm, using a random-effects Poisson
   regression model with adjustment for hospital-level clustering,
   demographic characteristics of patients, hospital service, and high-risk
   conditions.
   Results: Among 2341 admissions, internal reviewers identified 588 harms
   (25.1 harms per 100 admissions; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.4 to
   24.9). Multivariate analyses of harms identified by internal reviewers
   showed no significant changes in the overall rate of harms per 1000
   patient-days (reduction factor, 0.99 per year; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04;
   P=0.61) or the rate of preventable harms. There was a reduction in
   preventable harms identified by external reviewers that did not reach
   statistical significance (reduction factor, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.00;
   P=0.06), with no significant change in the overall rate of harms
   (reduction factor, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.04; P=0.47).
   Conclusions: In a study of 10 North Carolina hospitals, we found that
   harms remain common, with little evidence of widespread improvement.
   Further efforts are needed to translate effective safety interventions
   into routine practice and to monitor health care safety over time.

AB With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are
   playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the
   sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the
   lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding
   of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to
   characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the
   fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history
   of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear
   effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each
   city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events
   and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by
   the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators
   with population size, all with similar exponents (similar to 1.15). As a
   result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation,
   wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these
   general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle
   dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban
   performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective
   on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display
   long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size
   expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal
   correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U. S.
   metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but
   based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and
   patterns of crime.

AB PURPOSE: We sought to evaluate the association between childhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) at two time points and age at menarche in a
   multiracial sample of U.S. girls.
   METHODS: Our study population consisted of a cohort of female
   participants enrolled at birth at the New York site of the Collaborative
   Perinatal Project, who were born during the period 1959-1963 (n = 262).
   SES at birth, at age 7, and change between birth and age 7 were measured
   prospectively through an index score of family income, paternal
   occupation, and education. Data on age at menarche were collected
   retrospectively through adult self-report. We used multivariable linear
   regression to examine the association between SES and age at menarche
   after adjusting for childhood body mass index (BMI) and other covariates
   associated with age at menarche.
   RESULTS: After adjustment, SES at age 7 was positively associated with
   age at menarche (beta: 0.015, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.003-0.024
   per unit of SES index). Change in SES was significantly associated with
   age at menarche; a 20-unit decrease in SES was associated with a 4-month
   decrease in age at menarche.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that lower SES at 7 years and
   reductions in SES in early childhood are both associated with an earlier
   age at menarche. Ann Epidemiol 2010;20:836-842. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB This article investigates structural sources of earnings losses in the

   Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations
   Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model
   of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market
   between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that
   industry of employment represents a salient partition of the
   distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the
   current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were
   displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings
   losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment
   in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed
   determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that
   displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses
   in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch
   industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage
   industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those
   who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be
   explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs
   from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are
   re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural
   theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which
   represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic
   skill-based accounts of earnings differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   norms, which refer to the perceived acceptability of excessive drinking,
   and descriptive norms, which refer to perceptions of actual drinking.
   The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a brief
   injunctive norms manipulation on both injunctive and descriptive norms
   about drinking alcohol and to explore differences in the malleability of
   norms across referent groups, sex, and gender role. Participants were
   265 undergraduates (43% male, 70% freshmen) who completed a web-based
   survey for course credit. A randomly selected half was exposed to a page
   of information-based feedback about typical student injunctive norms.
   Relative to the control condition, the manipulation produced lower
   injunctive and descriptive norms related to typical students' drinking
   but no change in either type of norm related to close friends.
   Femininity was associated with less permissive normative beliefs about
   the acceptability of excessive drinking whereas masculinity was
   associated with elevated perceptions of peer drinking, but neither sex
   nor gender role moderated the manipulation effect. We conclude that
   perceptions of peer approval of drinking are malleable with a very brief
   information-based manipulation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Cannabis withdrawal can be a negative reinforcer for
   relapse, but little is known about its association with demographic
   characteristics. Objectives: Evaluate the association of demographic
   characteristics with the experience of cannabis withdrawal. Methods:
   Retrospective self-report of a "serious" cannabis quit attempt without
   formal treatment in a convenience sample of 104 non-treatment-seeking,
   adult cannabis smokers (mean age 35 years, 52% white, 78% male) with no
   other current substance use disorder (except tobacco) or chronic health
   problems. Reasons for quitting, coping strategies to help quit, and 18
   specific withdrawal symptoms were assessed by questionaire. Results:
   Among withdrawal symptoms, only anxiety, increased sex drive, and
   craving showed significant associations with age, race, or sex. Women
   were more likely than men to report a physical withdrawal symptom (OR =
   3.2, 95% CI = .99-10.4, p = .05), especially upset stomach. There were
   few significant demographic associations with coping strategies or
   reasons for quitting. Conclusions and Scientific Significance: This
   small study suggests that there are few robust associations between
   demographic characteristics and cannabis withdrawal. Future studies with
   larger samples are needed. Attention to physical withdrawal symptoms in
   women may help promote abstinence.

AB Background: Previous research among drug-using men who have sex with men
   (MSM) indicates that trading sex for methamphetamine may be common.
   Objectives: This study identified background characteristics, substance
   use variables, contextual factors, and sexual risk behaviors associated
   with trading sex for methamphetamine in a sample of HIV-positive MSM.
   Baseline data were gathered from 155 participants who were enrolled in a
   sexual risk-reduction intervention. Logistic regression was used to
   compare MSM who traded sex for methamphetamine with men who did not.
   Results: Forty-three percent of the sample reported trading sex for
   methamphetamine in the past 2 months. Trading sex for methamphetamine
   was associated with being a binge user, homelessness, having an income
   of less than $20,000 per year, being less assertive at turning down
   drugs, engaging in more anal sex without a condom, and seeking out risky
   sex partners when high on methamphetamine. Conclusions and Scientific
   Significance: These data suggest that the trading of sex for
   methamphetamine may be a primary source of new HIV infections within and
   outside of the MSM community, necessitating targeted interventions with
   this vulnerable subgroup.

AB Objectives. We compared health behaviors and health outcomes among
   US-born, African-born, and Caribbean-born pregnant Black women and
   examined whether sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics
   explained differences among these population subgroups.
   Methods. We analyzed data from a prospective cohort study conducted in
   Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with a series of nested logistic regression
   models predicting tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and measures of
   physical and mental health.
   Results. Foreign-born Black women were significantly less likely to
   engage in substance use and had better self-rated physical and mental
   health than did native-born Black women. These findings were largely
   unchanged by adjustment for sociodemographic and psychosocial
   characteristics. The foreign-born advantage varied by place of birth: it
   was,somewhat stronger for African-born women than for Caribbean-born
   women.
   Conclusions. Further studies are needed to gain a better understanding
   of the role of immigrant selectivity and other characteristics that
   contribute to more favorable health behaviors and health outcomes among
   foreign-born Blacks than among native-born Blacks in the United States.

AB Objectives. We investigated the association of health-related quality of
   life (HRQOL) with sexual orientation among lesbians and bisexual women
   and compared the predictors of HRQOL between the 2 groups.
   Methods. We used multivariate logistic regression to analyze Washington
   State Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System population-based data
   (2003 to 2007) in a sample of 1496 lesbians and bisexual women and
   examined determinants of HRQOL among lesbians and bisexual women.
   Results. For lesbians and bisexual women, frequent mental distress and
   poor general health were associated with poverty and lack of exercise;
   poor general health was associated with obesity and mental distress.
   Bisexual women showed a higher likelihood of frequent mental distress
   and poor general health than did lesbians. The odds of mental distress
   were higher for bisexual women living in urban areas as compared with
   nonurban areas. Lesbians had an elevated risk of poor general health and
   mental distress during midlife.
   Conclusions. Despite the standard practice of collapsing sexual minority
   women into a single group, lesbian and bisexual women in this study
   emerge as distinct groups that merit specific attention. Bisexual women
   are at elevated risk for poor HRQOL. (Am J Public Health.

AB PURPOSE: Research suggests a relationship between birth weight and
   season of birth, but findings vary across countries and underlying
   factors are not well understood. We examine the seasonality of birth
   weight and explore alternative hypotheses for its etiology exposure to
   environmental factors and varying socioeconomic composition of mothers
   in Chile.
   METHODS: Birth weight of approximately 5 million Chilean singleton live
   births 37 of 41 weeks of gestation between 1987 and 2007 were analyzed
   for seasonality by using regression models with month dummies and
   parametric sinusoidal specifications. Multivariate models with
   socioeconomic covariates and interactions across geographic regions
   examine potential factors accounting for seasonal variation.
   RESULTS: Marked 12-month and 6-month periodic cycles were found. The
   amplitude and phase of the seasonal variation change across geographic
   regions. In the low-latitude northern region, there is a spring peak and
   a fall nadir, while in middle-latitude colder regions, a bimodal
   periodicity emerges with peaks in spring and fall, a pronounced winter
   nadir, and smaller nadir in the summer. Socioeconomic composition of
   mothers is found to vary with annual periodicity, but it does not
   account for the seasonality in birth weight.
   CONCLUSIONS: Environmental factors rather than the socioeconomic
   composition of mothers likely account for seasonal variation in birth
   weight. The change in periodicity of birth weight across latitudes is
   consistent with a beneficial exposure to sunlight both early and late in
   the pregnancy, and a detrimental late exposure to cold temperatures only
   in areas with low winter temperatures. Ann Epidemiol 2010;20:818-826.

AB PURPOSE: By using a longitudinal cohort, we assessed the association
   between neighborhood disadvantage and incidence of poor health and
   function in three domains.
   METHODS: More than 4,000 enrollees aged 55 to 65 years in the national
   Health and Retirement Study were assessed biennially from 1998 through
   2006 for incidence of fair/poor self-rated health, elevated depressive
   symptoms, and limitations in six basic activities of daily living
   (disability). Each analysis was restricted to subjects without that
   condition in 1994 or 1996. Neighborhoods (census tracts, time-updated
   for moves), were considered disadvantaged if they fell below the 25th
   percentile in an index comprising six socioeconomic status indicators.
   Repeated measures logistic regressions, inverse probability weighted to
   account for individual confounders, selective survival, and loss to
   follow-up were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incidence of each
   outcome in the wave after exposure to disadvantaged neighborhood.
   RESULTS: After covariate adjustment, neighborhood disadvantage predicted
   onset of fair/poor SRH (OR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.59)
   but not disability (OR, 0.97; 0.81-1.16) or elevated depressive symptoms
   (OR, 0.97; 0.81-1.16).
   CONCLUSIONS: Results confirmed previous findings that neighborhood
   disadvantage predicts self-rated health in a longitudinal context but
   did not support an association between neighborhood disadvantage and
   onset of disability or elevated depressive symptoms. Ann Epidemiol

AB Analyses of the pattern of associations, social interactions,

   ursinus) in the Okavango Delta of Botswana over a 16-year period
   indicate that adult females form close, equitable, supportive, and
   enduring social relationships. They show strong and stable preferences
   for close kin, particularly their own mothers and daughters. Females
   also form strong attachments to unrelated females who are close to their
   own age and who are likely to be paternal half-sisters. Although
   absolute rates of aggression among kin are as high as rates of
   aggression among nonkin, females are more tolerant of close relatives
   than they are of others with whom they have comparable amounts of
   contact. These findings complement previous work which indicates that
   the strength of social bonds enhances the fitness of females in this
   population and support findings about the structure and function of
   social bonds in other primate groups.

AB While the probability of a woman developing invasive breast cancer at
   age < 40 is low (< 1%), mammography use reported among younger women
   (age < 40) is substantial, and varies by race/ethnicity. Little detail
   is known about mammography use among women aged < 40, particularly by
   race/ethnicity. We describe racial/ethnic differences in: (1)
   mammography indication after considering underlying risk factors (breast
   symptoms and family history); (2) follow-up recommendations, and (3)
   mammography outcomes for first mammograms in women aged < 40. These
   1996-2005 Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium data are prospectively
   pooled from seven U.S. mammography registries. Our community-based
   sample included 99,615 women aged 18-39 who self-reported race/ethnicity
   and presented for a first mammogram (screening or diagnostic) with no
   history of breast cancer. Multivariable analyses controlled for registry
   site, age, family history of breast cancer, symptoms, and exam year.
   Overall, 73.6% of the women in our sample were seen for a screening
   mammogram. Following screening mammography, African American (AA) women
   were more likely than white women to be recommended for additional
   workup [relative risk (RR): 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07-1.23)]. Following
   diagnostic mammography, AA [RR: 1.30 (95% CI: 1.17-1.44)] and Asian [RR:
   1.44 (95% CI: 1.26-1.64)] women were more likely to be recommended for
   biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, or surgical consultation. Depending on
   race/ethnicity, and considering the rate of true positive to total first
   screening mammograms of younger women, a women has a likelihood of a
   true positive of 1 in 363-1,122; she has a likelihood of a false
   positive of 1 in 7-10. This study of community-based practice found
   racial/ethnic variability in mammography indication, recommendations,
   and outcomes among women undergoing first mammography before 40. These
   findings highlight important areas for future research to understand the
   motivating factors for these practice patterns and the implications of
   early mammography use.

AB Background: Melanoma incidence has been correlated strongly and
   positively with both socioeconomic status (SES) and lower latitude and
   other measures of ambient UV radiation (UVR). However, because high-SES
   populations may be colocated in areas of high UVR, we assessed their
   joint influences on melanoma occurrence to better target subpopulations
   for melanoma education and screening.
   Methods: We obtained from the California Cancer Registry information
   regarding 23,564 incident cases of invasive cutaneous melanoma among
   non-Hispanic white residents between January 1, 1998, and December 31,
   2002. We geocoded each case based on residence at diagnosis and linked
   previously tested neighborhood measures of SES and average annual UVR to
   calculate age-adjusted incidence rates, rate ratios, and the
   corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Poisson regression was used to
   calculate multi-variately adjusted rate ratios.
   Results: UVR was significantly and positively associated with melanoma
   incidence only among persons living in the top 40% of California
   neighborhoods ranked by SES. People in neighborhoods of the highest SES
   and UVR categories had 60% higher rates of melanoma than those from
   neighborhoods in the lowest categories (rate ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence
   interval, 1.02-2.51).
   Conclusion: Our findings indicate that UVR and SES interact to influence
   melanoma occurrence and suggest that socioeconomic gradients in melanoma
   incidence are not explained entirely by UVR.
   Impact: Cancer prevention and early detection educational efforts should
   be targeted to high-SES groups in areas of high UVR exposure. Contextual
   measures of both SES and UVR should be considered important determinants
   of melanoma occurrence in future studies. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

AB Background: Ethnic minorities and lower-income adults have among the
   highest rates of obesity and lowest levels of regular physical activity
   ( PA). The Positive Action for Today's Health (PATH) trial compares
   three communities that are randomly assigned to different levels of an
   environmental intervention to improve safety and access for walking in
   low income communities.
   Design and setting: Three communities matched on census tract
   information (crime, PA, ethnic minorities, and income) were randomized
   to receive either: an intervention that combines a
   police-patrolled-walking program with social marketing strategies to
   promote PA, a police-patrolled-walking only intervention, or no-walking
   intervention (general health education only). Measures include PA (7-day
   accelerometer estimates), body composition, blood pressure, psychosocial
   measures, and perceptions of safety and access for PA at baseline, 6,
   12, 18, and 24 months.
   Intervention: The police-patrolled walking plus social marketing
   intervention targets increasing safety (training community leaders as
   walking captains, hiring off-duty police officers to patrol the walking
   trail, and containing stray dogs), increasing access for PA (marking a
   walking route), and utilizes a social marketing campaign that targets
   psychosocial and environmental mediators for increasing PA.
   Main hypotheses/outcomes: It is hypothesized that the police-patrolled
   walking plus social marketing intervention will result in greater
   increases in moderate-to-vigorous PA as compared to the
   police-patrolled-walking only or the general health intervention after
   12 months and that this effect will be maintained at 18 and 24 months.
   Conclusions: Implications of this community-based trial are discussed.

AB This article develops a non-reductive approach to celebrity, treating it
   as an iconic form of collective representation central to the meaningful
   construction of contemporary society. Like other compelling material
   symbols, the celebrity-icon is structured by the interplay of surface
   and depth. The surface is an aesthetic structure whose sensuous
   qualities command attention and compel attachment; the depth projects
   the sacred and profane binaries that structure meaning even in
   postmodern societies. While celebrity worship displays elements of
   totemism, it also reflects the eschatological hopes for salvation that
   mark post-Axial Age religion. The attacks on celebrity culture that
   inform critical public and intellectual thinking resemble iconoclastic
   criticisms of idol worship more than they do empirical social scientific

   substance use were examined using linear regression analysis (for
   average number of drinks and average number of cigarettes per day) and
   negative binomial regression analysis (for frequency of past month
   marijuana use).
   Results: Youth with more substance users in their networks reported
   greater alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana consumption regardless of
   whether these network members provided tangible or emotional support.
   Marijuana use was more frequent for youth who met more network members
   through homeless settings, but less frequent among those who met more
   network members through treatment or AA/NA. Greater alcohol use occurred
   among youth who met more network members through substance use-related
   activities. Youth having more adults in positions of responsibility in
   their networks consumed less alcohol, and those with more school
   attendees in their networks consumed less alcohol and cigarettes.
   Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of social context in
   understanding substance use among homeless youth. Results also support
   the relevance of network-based interventions to change social context
   for substance-using youth, in terms of both enhancing pro-social
   influences and reducing exposure to substance use. (C) 2010 Elsevier

   certain ingredients (e.g., phthalates) in personal care products, usage
   patterns of similar to 30 types of personal care products (e.g.,
   shampoo, sunscreen, fragrance, etc.) were collected in 604 California
   households through a telephone interview. Preferences in selecting
   products, e.g., scented or unscented, aerosol, and brand loyalty, were
   also investigated. Participants were recruited in three age groups,
   children (mostly preschoolers), their parents, and adults age 55 or
   older. Use frequencies of various product types varied by sex, age
   group, race, education, and climatic region. Product use by parent and
   child from the same household were correlated. Use frequencies of
   products in the same class (e.g., skincare) were moderately correlated,
   which may impact aggregate exposures. Use frequencies observed in this
   study were generally in the same range as those reported in the EPA
   Exposure Factor Handbook, but we found differences for some individual
   products. Our study provides additional data on population-based usage
   patterns of a large collection of commonly used personal care products
   pertaining to several age groups and socio-demographic strata. This
   information will be valuable for exposure and risk assessments. (C) 2010

AB Objective: The study aim was to identify and describe health consumer
   perspectives on social barriers to care for eating disorders in an
   ethnically diverse sample.
   Method: We conducted an exploratory secondary analysis of qualitative
   data comprising transcripts from semi-structured interviews with past
   and prospective consumers of eating disorder treatment (n = 32).
   Transcripts were inputted into NVivo 8 for coding, sorting, and
   quantifying thematic content of interest within strata defined by ethnic
   minority and non-minority participants. We then examined the influence
   of key social barriers including stigma and social stereotypes on
   perceived impact on care.
   Results: The majority of respondents (78%) endorsed at least one social
   barrier to care for an eating or weight concern. Perceived stigma (or
   shame) and social stereotyping identified both within social networks
   and among clinicians had adversely impacted care for 59% and 19% of
   respondents, respectively.
   Discussion: Social barriers to care for eating and weight related
   concerns may be prevalent in the U.S. and impact both ethnic minority
   and non-minority health care consumers. (C) 2009 by Wiley Periodicals,

AB Given increasing evidence from international surveys that concern for

   this article were interested in conducting an in-depth analysis of
   environmental concerns, values and behavior in the Beijing and Detroit
   metropolitan areas. Because of the attention that has been given to the
   influences of dominant social values and neighborhood environmental
   context on environmental attitudes cross-nationally, the authors were
   especially interested in examining what impact these have. In so doing,
   they attempted to introduce several important innovations in their
   comparative study, including new measures of commitment to the Dominant
   Social Paradigm (DSP) and indicators of neighborhood environmental
   quality. Using face-to-face interviews with probability samples surveys
   of residents in the Beijing and Detroit metropolitan areas, the study
   also determined, from open-ended questions, people's understandings of
   'the environment' and 'economic growth' and the priority trade-offs
   between them that are often implied and debated. The analyses found
   striking similarities as well as differences in the two metropolitan
   areas.

AB This conceptual article draws on literature in the sociology of science
   on modelling. The authors suggest that if state theory can be
   conceptualized as an 'engine' rather than merely a 'camera', in that
   policy is mobilized to make the world fit the theory, then this has
   implications for conceptualizing states. To examine this possibility the
   authors look through the lens of actor-network theory (ANT) and in doing
   so articulate a relationship between two models of the state in the
   literature. They find that an 'actor model' of the state is accepted by
   many scholars, few of whom develop 'network models' of the state. In
   response, this study introduces an actor-network model and proposes that
   its contribution to state theory is in rethinking the character of
   modern states to be the outcome of actually performed assemblages of all
   those practices of building it, protecting it, governing it and
   theorizing about it.

   outcomes in schizophrenia. In a sample of 60 Mexican American caregivers
   and their ill relatives, we first assessed whether EE and its indices
   (criticism, emotional overinvolvement [EOI], and warmth) related to
   relapse. Second, we extended the analysis of EE and its indices to a
   longitudinal assessment of symptomatology. Last, we tested whether
   bidimensional acculturation moderated the relationship between EE (and
   its indices) and both relapse and symptom trajectory over time. Results
   indicated that EOI was associated with increased relapse and that
   criticism was associated with increased symptomatology. Additionally, as
   patients' Mexican enculturation (Spanish language and media involvement)
   decreased, EE was increasingly related to relapse. For symptomatology,
   as patients' U.S. acculturation (English language and media involvement)
   increased, EE was associated with increased symptoms longitudinally. Our
   results replicate and extend past research on how culture might shape
   the way family factors relate to the course of schizophrenia.

   different levels of infertility. First, the paper focuses on the life
   experiences of individual women across the two communities and second,
   it compares these experiences with those of their fertile counterparts,
   in each community. In doing this, women who are childless are
   distinguished from those with subfertility and compared with
   high-fertility women. The research is based on interdisciplinary
   research conducted among the Ijo and Yakurr people of southern Nigeria,
   which included a survey of approximately 100 childless and subfertile
   women and a matching sample of 100 fertile women as well as in-depth
   ethnographic interviews with childless and subfertile women in two
   communities: Amakiri in Delta State and Lopon in Cross River State. The
   findings indicate that while there are variations in the extent to which
   childlessness is considered to be problematic, the necessity for a woman
   to have a child remains basic in this region.

AB Objective: To increase understanding of the interrelationship between a
   patient's social network and patient drinking, the Important People and
   Activities (IPA) instrument was developed. To meet the aims of the
   COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study, the
   IPA was modified to create the Important People Inventory (IPI), which
   was used to measure the contextual influence of the patient's social
   network on patient outcomes and treatment effects. The aims of the
   present article were to describe the I PI and its differences from the
   IPA and to test the relationship of network support as measured by the
   IPI in predicting drinking during and following treatment. Method:
   Alcohol-dependent patients (N = 1,373) seeking outpatient treatment in
   the COMBINE randomized clinical trial were administered the IPI before
   treatment. Six network constructs were tested for predicting patient
   drinking. Results: As unique effects, alcohol-specific support, as
   measured by network drinking and opposition to patient drinking, is
   predictive of patient abstinent days during and following treatment and
   heavy drinking days following treatment. Other measures of network
   support have variable relationships to patient drinking at different
   phases: Some are predictive of patient drinking during treatment but
   diminish, whereas others are unrelated to drinking during treatment but
   become increasingly predictive of drinking as time from treatment
   increases. Conclusions: The IPI is a useful instrument for describing
   network support of alcohol-use disorder patients entering treatment.
   Measures of alcohol-specific support are prognostic of drinking
   outcomes. The patient's network support should be systematically
   assessed prior to tailored treatment planning. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs,

AB Purpose: Most prostate cancer research is based on relatively homogenous
   cohorts of men, often with comparatively high socioeconomic status. We
   describe prostate cancer characteristics in men treated in a public
   health system and hypothesize a disproportionate burden of high risk
   disease in this population.
   Materials and Methods: We created a clinical registry from a review of
   the medical records of 377 men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the San
   Francisco General Hospital system, which provides care to underserved,
   uninsured populations. We compared sociodemographic data and cancer
   characteristics with those in 2 large prostate cancer databases from a
   community (CaPSURE (TM)) and an academic (University of California-San
   Francisco tumor registry) setting to assess differences in risk
   distribution using the D'Amico and Cancer of the Prostate Risk
   Assessment scoring systems.
   Results: Compared to men in CaPSURE or the University of California-San
   Francisco tumor registry those in the San Francisco General Hospital
   cohort were nonwhite (76%), insured under Medicaid (31%) or uninsured
   (8%) and had adverse clinical characteristics, including median prostate
   specific antigen greater than 10 ng/ml at diagnosis and higher Gleason
   grade. In addition, the majority of patients (67%) had intermediate or
   high risk disease based on the D'Amico classification and a higher mean
   Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment score. Using ANOVA for continuous
   variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables, all
   comparisons were statistically significant (p <0.001).
   Conclusions: Men in the San Francisco General Hospital public health
   system bear a substantially higher burden of high risk disease that
   those in an academic or a community setting. Populations such as this
   would benefit most from targeted efforts for early detection and
   treatment to decrease prostate cancer morbidity and mortality.

AB Rural residency and low socioeconomic status (SES) are associated with
   increased likelihood of chronic pain. Other demographics are also
   differentially associated with the experience of pain. This study
   examines the relations between demographic and pain-related variables in
   a virtually unstudied population of rural Alabama chronic pain patients.
   One hundred and fifteen patients completed validated measures of pain
   catastrophizing, depression, pain intensity, pain interference,
   perceived disability, and life satisfaction. Average age of study
   participants was 52-years, 79% were female, 74% were African-American,
   72% reported annual income between 00,000-12,999, and 61% were
   unemployed. Although average years of reported education was 12.26,
   reading level percentile (primary literacy indicant) was 17.33.
   Cross-sectional multivariate and univariate analyses were conducted to
   examine associations among demographic and psychosocial variables in
   relation to various pre-treatment pain-related variables. The mediating
   role of pain catastrophizing and depression was investigated. Results
   indicate that race was significantly associated with pain intensity and
   pain interference, such that African-Americans reported higher scores
   than White-Americans. Pain catastrophizing was uniquely associated with
   pain intensity, pain interference, and perceived disability; depression
   was uniquely associated with pain interference and life satisfaction.
   Pain catastrophizing mediated the relation between primary literacy and
   pain intensity; age effects were differentially mediated by either pain
   catastrophizing or depression. These analyses provide an insight into
   the specific demographic and psychosocial factors associated with
   chronic pain in a low-literacy, low-SES rural population. (C) 2010

AB Study Objectives: To examine the effects of socially enriched versus

   during sleep deprivation in extraverts versus introverts.
   Design: Participants (n = 29 men, n = 19 women) were assigned to
   socially enriched (n = 24; 13 introverts, 11 extraverts) or socially
   impoverished (n = 24; 12 introverts, 12 extraverts) conditions
   (activities matched) for 12 hours (1000-2200) on Day 1 followed by 22
   hours of sleep deprivation (2200-2000; 36 h awake total), monitored by
   actigraphy. The median split of volunteers' Eysenck Extraversion scores
   was used for extravert/introvert categorization. The Psychomotor
   Vigilance Task (PVT), modified Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT),
   and Stanford Sleepiness Scale (SSS) were administered every 2 hours
   throughout. PVT speed, transformed lapses, modified MWT sleep-onset
   latency, and SSS were analyzed using mixed-model analyses of variance,
   with covariates of age and total actigraphic activity during enrichment
   or impoverishment.
   Setting: Residential sleep/performance testing facility.
   Participants: Forty-eight healthy adults (aged 18-39).
   Interventions: Twelve hours of socially enriched or isolated
   environments in extraverts and introverts prior to sleep deprivation.
   Results: Social experience interacted with personality type to affect
   alertness and vigilance. Social enrichment, as compared with social
   impoverishment, was associated with more PVT lapses at 04:00 overall.
   Similarly, following social enrichment, PVT speed was significantly
   slower among extraverts than among introverts during sleep deprivation,
   but no personality-group differences emerged following social
   impoverishment. MWT sleep latency and SSS subjective sleepiness did not
   show significant personality or social-condition effects during sleep
   deprivation.
   Conclusions: The effect of social exposure on vulnerability or
   resiliency to sleep deprivation was modulated by introversion and
   extraversion. Extraverts exposed to social environments were more
   vulnerable to subsequent sleep deprivation than were introverts.

AB Although law prohibits race-based exclusion in college sororities and
   fraternities in the United States, racial segregation prevails. As a
   result, nonwhite membership in white Greek-letter organizations (WGLOs)
   is often hailed as a transformative step toward equality and unity. The
   bulk of work on such cross-racial membership centers on
   comparative-historical and survey data and treats integrated membership
   as the successful end, rather than a problematic beginning, of analysis.
   Drawing upon in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in three
   university campuses on the East Coast, I shift the focus from resource
   factors that either prevent or enable membership to the strategies of
   action that nonwhite members employ in their everyday lives in order to
   be perceived as full, belonging members. By drawing upon the insights of
   the sociology of culture, I argue that robust racialized schemas
   simultaneously enable and constrain inclusion. Rather than hide explicit
   racial-ethnic difference or accede to traditional expectations of Anglo
   conformity, I find that nonwhite members are enmeshed in a paradox of
   participation: their ability to frame themselves as equal and belonging
   Greek "brothers and sisters" remains tied to a patterned reproduction of
   their racial and ethnic identities as essentially different and
   inferior. Such a paradox emerges as an important theoretical and
   pragmatic dilemma with implications for an array of institutional
   contexts. Keywords: whiteness, identity, schema, segregation,
   fraternity, sorority.

AB Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located
   stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC).
   Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that
   Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor,
   unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a
   shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper
   examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of
   176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the
   US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are
   disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with
   a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three
   further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First,
   findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and
   economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated
   rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town.
   Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race,
   town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly,
   future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological
   implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison
   impact. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   some of the thinking at the time. The discussion centres on the view
   that Goffman and Garfinkel helped open up notions of the political. As
   Collins explains, the effect of their work was not merely to create a
   'micro-politics', as it came to be called, but over the subsequent ways
   others like Collins could then widen political understandings about the

AB At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative,
   based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The
   article highlights the structural features of narrative-basically, the
   organization of the genre around the semantic template
   actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but
   where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the
   verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet,
   such as time and space of action-and shows how to implement this
   structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological
   tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism,
   1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An
   Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color
   circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from
   Newton to Goethe-and the quality versus quantity debate-to Goethe and
   Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.

AB In this article, I attempt to address some enduring problems in
   formulation and practical use of the notion of structure in contemporary
   social science. I begin by revisiting the question of the fidelity of
   Anthony Giddens' appropriation of the idea of structure with respect to
   Levi-Strauss. This requires a reconsideration of Levi-Strauss' original
   conceptualization of "social structure" which I argue is a sort of
   "methodological structuralism" that stands sharply opposed to Giddens'
   ontological reconceptualization of the notion. I go on to show that
   Bourdieu's contemporaneous critique of Levi-Strauss is best understood
   as an attempt to recover rather than reject the central implication of
   Levi-Strauss' methodological structuralism, which puts Bourdieu and
   Giddens on clearly distinct camps in terms of their approach toward the
   idea of structure. To demonstrate the-insurmountable-conceptual
   difficulties inherent in the ontological approach, I proceed by
   critically examining what I consider to be the most influential attempt
   to resolve the ambiguities in Giddens structuration theory: Sewell's
   argument for the "duality of structure." I show that by retaining
   Giddens' ontological focus, Sewell ends up with a notion of structure
   that is at its very core "anti-structuralist" or only structuralist in a
   weak sense. I close by considering the implications of the analysis for
   the possibility of developing the rather neglected "methodological
   structuralist" legacy in contemporary social analysis.

AB Indirect reciprocity, a key concept in behavioral experiments and
   evolutionary game theory, provides a mechanism that allows reciprocal
   altruism to emerge in a population of self-regarding individuals even
   when repeated interactions between pairs of actors are unlikely. Recent
   empirical evidence show that humans typically follow complex assessment
   strategies involving both reciprocity and social imitation when making
   cooperative decisions. However, currently, we have no systematic
   understanding of how imitation, a mechanism that may also generate
   negative effects via a process of cumulative advantage, affects
   cooperation when repeated interactions are unlikely or information about
   a recipient's reputation is unavailable. Here we extend existing
   evolutionary models, which use an image score for reputation to track
   how individuals cooperate by contributing resources, by introducing a
   new imitative-trust score, which tracks whether actors have been the
   recipients of cooperation in the past. We show that imitative trust can
   co-exist with indirect reciprocity mechanisms up to a threshold and then
   cooperation reverses-revealing the elusive nature of cooperation.
   Moreover, we find that when information about a recipient's reputation
   is limited, trusting the action of third parties towards her (i.e.
   imitating) does favor a higher collective cooperation compared to
   random-trusting and share-alike mechanisms. We believe these results
   shed new light on the factors favoring social imitation as an adaptive
   mechanism in populations of cooperating social actors.

AB Background: The role of the private health sector in developing
   countries remains a much-debated and contentious issue. Critics argue
   that the high prices charged in the private sector limits the use of
   health care among the poorest, consequently reducing access and equity
   in the use of health care. Supporters argue that increased private
   sector participation might improve access and equity by bringing in much
   needed resources for health care and by allowing governments to increase
   focus on underserved populations. However, little empirical exists for
   or against either side of this debate.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We examine the association between
   private sector participation and self-reported measures of utilization
   and equity in deliveries and treatment of childhood respiratory disease
   using regression analysis, across a sample of nationally-representative
   Demographic and Health Surveys from 34 SSA economies. We also examine
   the correlation between private sector participation and key background
   factors (socioeconomic development, business environment and governance)
   and use multivariate regression to control for potential confounders.
   Private sector participation is positively associated with greater
   overall access and reduced disparities between rich and poor as well as
   urban and rural populations. The positive association between private
   sector participation and improved health system performance is robust to
   controlling for confounders including per capita income and maternal
   education. Private sector participation is positively correlated with
   measures of socio-economic development and favorable business
   environment.
   Conclusions/Significance: Greater participation is associated with
   favorable intermediate outcomes in terms of access and equity. While
   these results do not establish a causal link between private sector
   participation and health system performance, they suggest that there is
   no deleterious link between private sector participation and health
   system performance in SSA.

AB Many emerging adults who have dropped out of high school are known to
   misuse alcohol. Expectancies and motives for drinking are pivotal in
   shaping the drinking behavior of emerging adults, especially those
   related to social influences. We tested a motivational model of
   problematic alcohol use using drinking motives (enhancement, social,
   conformity, coping) as multiple mediators to explain the association
   between social alcohol expectancies and alcohol misuse. A community
   sample of 104 individuals between ages 16 and 21 attending a General
   Educational Development (GED) program completed self-report measures of
   alcohol expectancies, drinking motives, quantity and frequency of
   drinking, and a structured interview that assessed the symptoms of
   alcohol use disorders. Results of multiple regression analysis testing
   multiple mediators indicated that social alcohol expectancies were
   associated with alcohol misuse through the mediated pathways of
   enhancement drinking motives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   groups: social norms media marketing campaign, buffer, and control. Four
   random samples of Montanans between the ages of 21 and 34 were assessed
   at four time points over 18 months via phone surveys. Findings suggest
   that the social norms media campaign was successful at exposing the

   intervention region. Moreover, results demonstrate the campaign reduced
   normative misperceptions, increased use of designated drivers, and
   decreased drinking and driving among those young adults in counties
   within the intervention region. Social norms media marketing can be

AB Background:
   There have been limited trend studies examining variations on the
   patterns of alcohol consumption among Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in
   the United States. The current paper reports national trends in drinking
   patterns, volume of drinking (number of drinks per month), binge
   drinking, and drinking to intoxication among Blacks, Whites, and
   Hispanics over a period of 10 years and identifies sociodemographic
   predictors of these behaviors across the 3 ethnic groups.
   Methods:
   Data are from the 1991 to 1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol
   Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES; n = 42,862) and the 2001 to 2002 National
   Epidemiologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC; n =
   43,093). Both surveys used multistage cluster sample procedures to
   select respondents 18 years of age and older from the U.S. household
   population.
   Results:
   Trends varied across different dimensions of drinking and ethnic groups.
   There were no statistically significant differences in the mean number
   of drinks consumed per month among men and women in any of the 3 ethnic
   groups between 1992 and 2002, but there was a significant rise in the
   proportion of current drinkers in both genders and in all 3 ethnic
   groups. Multivariate analysis indicated that, compared to Whites in
   1992, Blacks and Hispanics did not increase their volume of drinking,
   but Whites did. Drinking 5 or more drinks in day at all did not increase
   between 1992 and 2002, but drinking 5 or more drinks at least once a
   month was more likely for all groups in 2002 compared to Whites in 1992.
   Drinking to intoxication at all was more likely among Whites in 2002
   than 1992, but drinking to intoxication at least once a month was more
   likely among Whites and Blacks in 2002 than 1992.
   Conclusion:
   The only common trend between 1992 and 2002 across both genders and 3
   ethnic groups was a rise in the proportion of drinkers. There was also a
   rise in drinking 5 or more drinks in a day (Whites, Blacks, and
   Hispanics) and drinking to intoxication (Whites and Blacks), but this
   was limited to those reporting such drinking at least once a month. The
   reasons for these changes are many and may involve complex
   sociodemographic changes in the population. It is important for the
   field to closely monitor these cross-ethnic trends in alcohol
   consumption.

AB BACKGROUND
   Masked hypertension (MH) is a risk factor for cardiovascular and
   cerebrovascular diseases. However, little is known about the effect of
   psychosocial stressors on MH.
   METHODS
   Daily interpersonal conflict was examined as a predictor of elevated
   ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) in a community sample of 240 unmedicated
   black and Latino(a) adults (63% women; mean age 36 years) who had
   optimal office blood pressure (BP) readings (<= 120/80 mm Hg).
   Electronic diaries were used to assess daily interpersonal conflict
   (i.e., perceptions of being treated unfairly/harassed during social
   interactions). Participants rated the degree to which they experienced
   each interaction as unfair or harassing on a scale of 1-100. Systolic
   and diastolic ABP (SysABP and DiaABP, respectively) were collected using
   a validated 24-h ABP monitor. Participants were classified as having
   marked MH (MMH) if the average of all readings obtained yielded SysABP:
   >= 135 mm Hg or DiaABP: >= 85 mm Hg. Logistic regression was used to
   examine whether daily interpersonal conflict is an independent predictor
   of MMH.
   RESULTS
   This form of MMH (i.e., optimal office BP plus elevated ABP) was present
   in 21% of participants (n = 50). Those with MMH (vs. without) were
   significantly more likely to be men (P < 0.001). Daily harassment and
   unfair treatment scores were significant predictors of MMH group status
   (P < 0.05). Participants with harassment scores >30 were significantly
   more likely to be in the MMH group.
   CONCLUSION
   MH may be a concern, even for patients with optimal office BP.
   Evaluating exposure to psychosocial stressors, including routine levels
   of interpersonal conflict may help to identify those patients who might
   benefit from further clinical follow-up.

AB Background We aimed to estimate the proportion of nursing assistants

   socio-economic resources by race/ethnicity.
   Methods Data from the 2004 National Nursing Assistant Survey (NNAS), a
   nationally representative sample survey of NAs employed in United States
   nursing homes, were analyzed accounting for the complex survey design.
   Results Among 2,880 participants, 44% reported "scratch, open wounds, or
   cuts" followed by "back injuries" (17%), "black eyes or other types of
   bruising" (16%), and "human bites" (12%). When compared to non-Hispanic
   white NAs, the adjusted rate ratio (RR) for wound/cut was 0.74 for
   non-Hispanic black NAs (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-0.85). RRs
   for black eyes/bruises were 0.18 for non-Hispanic black NAs (95% CI:
   0.12-0.26), and 0.55 for Hispanic NAs (95% CI: 0.37-0.82).
   Conclusions Minority racial and ethnic groups were less likely to report
   having experienced injuries compared with non-Hispanic white NAs. Future
   research should focus on identifying preventable risk factors, such as
   differences by race and ethnicity in the nature of NA jobs and the
   extent of their engagement in assisting patients with activities of

AB Background Often in exposure assessment for epidemiology, there are no
   highly accurate exposure data and different measurement methods are
   considered. The objective of this study was to use various statistical
   techniques to explore agreement between individual reports and expert
   ratings of workplace exposures in several industries and investigate the
   sociodemographic influences on this agreement.
   Methods A cohort of 1,282 employees at 4 industries/14 worksites
   answered questions on workplace physical, chemical, and psychosocial
   exposures over the past 12 months. Occupational hygienists constructed
   job exposure matrices (JEMs) based on worksite walkthrough exposure
   evaluations. Worker self-reports were compared with the JEMs using
   multivariable analyses to explore discord.
   Results There was poor agreement between the self-reported and expert
   exposure assessments, but there was evidence that agreement was modified
   by sociodemographic characteristics. Several characteristics including
   gender, age, race/ethnicity, hourly wage and nativity strongly affected
   the degree of discord between self-reports and expert raters across a
   wide array of different exposures.
   Conclusions Agreement between exposure assessment tools may be affected
   by sociodemographic characteristics. This study is cross-sectional and
   therefore, a snapshot of potential exposures in the workplace.
   Nevertheless, future studies should take into account the social
   contexts within which workplace exposures occur. Am. J. Ind. Med. 53:

AB OBJECTIVE: Recommendations by health care providers have been found to
   vary by patient race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status and may
   contribute to health disparities. This study investigated the effect of
   these factors on recommendations for contraception.
   STUDY DESIGN: One of 18 videos depicting patients of varying
   socio-demographic characteristics was shown to each of 524 health care
   providers. Providers indicated whether they would recommend
   levonorgestrel intrauterine contraception to the patient shown in the
   video.
   RESULTS: Low socioeconomic status whites were less likely to have
   intrauterine contraception recommended than high socioeconomic status
   whites (odds ratio [OR], 0.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.69);
   whereas, socioeconomic status had no significant effect among Latinas
   and blacks. By race/ethnicity, low socioeconomic status Latinas and
   blacks were more likely to have intrauterine contraception recommended
   than low socioeconomic status whites (OR, 3.4; and 95% CI, 1.1-10.2 and
   OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.0-9.6, respectively), with no effect of
   race/ethnicity for high socioeconomic status patients.
   CONCLUSION: Providers may have biases about intrauterine contraception
   or make assumptions about its use based on patient race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status.

AB Recent and long-term sympatries between humans and nonhuman primates (
   hereafter primates) are central to the behavioral ecology, conservation,
   and evolutionary trajectories of numerous primate species.
   Ethnoprimatology emphasizes that interconnections between humans and
   primates should be viewed as more than just disruptions of a "natural''
   state, and instead anthropogenic contexts must be considered as
   potential drivers for specific primate behavioral patterns. Rather than
   focusing solely on the behavior and ecology of the primate species at
   hand, as in traditional primatology, or on the symbolic meanings and
   uses of primates, as in socio-cultural anthropology, ethnoprimatology
   attempts to merge these perspectives into a more integrative approach.
   As human pressures on environments continue to increase and primate
   habitats become smaller and more fragmented, the need for a primatology
   that considers the impact of human attitudes and behavior on all aspects
   of primate lives and survival is imperative. In this special issue, we
   present both data-driven examples and more general discussions that
   describe how ethnoprimatological approaches can be both a contribution
   to the core theory and practice of primatology and a powerful tool in
   our goal of conservation action. Am. J. Primatol. 72: 841-847, 2010. (C)

AB The island of Sulawesi is an ecologically diverse and anthropogenically
   complex region in the Indonesian archipelago; it is home to multiple
   macaque species and a key locus of human-nonhuman primate
   interconnections. Here, we review the ethnoprimatology of Sulawesi by
   exploring two primary domains of the human-macaque interface:
   overlapping resource use and cultural perceptions of macaques. Crop
   raiding is the primary form of overlapping resource use. While the
   raiding of cacao plantations predominates in Central and South Sulawesi,
   subsistence crops ( e. g., sweet potato and maize) are most vulnerable
   on Buton, Southeast Sulawesi. Despite this overlap levels of conflict
   are generally low, with farmers showing considerable tolerance. This
   tolerance can be explained by positive perceptions of the macaques
   despite their crop raiding behavior, and the finding that in some areas
   macaques figure prominently in local folklore, hence affording them
   protection. These findings provide some hope for the future management
   and conservation of these endemic macaques. Am. J. Primatol. 72:

AB As a social species, humans rely on a safe, secure social surround to
   survive and thrive. Perceptions of social isolation, or loneliness,
   increase vigilance for threat and heighten feelings of vulnerability
   while also raising the desire to reconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for
   social threat alters psychological processes that influence
   physiological functioning, diminish sleep quality, and increase
   morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this paper is to review the
   features and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive
   theoretical framework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness.
   We review physical and mental health consequences of loneliness,
   mechanisms for its effects, and effectiveness of extant interventions.
   Features of a loneliness regulatory loop are employed to explain
   cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and
   to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness. Loneliness is not simply
   being alone. Interventions to reduce loneliness and its health
   consequences may need to take into account its attentional,
   confirmatory, and memorial biases as well as its social and behavioral
   effects.

AB PURPOSE: Self-rated health (SRH) is widely used to study health
   inequalities by socioeconomic status (SES), but concern has arisen that
   SRH may not correspond to objective health in the same way for different
   SES groups. We test whether levels of biological risk differ by SES for
   those with the same SRH.
   METHODS: We analyzed a U.S. nationally representative sample of 13,877
   adults aged 25 to 80 years. We tested whether education modifies the
   association between SRH and 14 biomarkers representing metabolic,
   cardiovascular, inflammatory, and organ function using both interaction
   models and models stratified by four levels of SRH. Estimated education
   coefficients in the stratified models indicated whether biomarker levels
   varied by educational attainment within a given self-rated health
   category.
   RESULTS: Significant variation in biological risk by education within
   the same self-rated health category was found, especially at higher
   levels of SRH. In general, respondents with more education had healthier
   levels of biomarkers for the same level of SRH.
   CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the relation of self-reported
   health to objective health, as measured by biological risk factors,
   differs by socioeconomic status. Caution should be exercised when using
   SRH to compare health risks across SES groups. Ann Epidemiol

AB Teen motherhood is the prevalent childbearing pattern in most
   traditional populations. Yet early motherhood is associated with
   negative biological and social outcomes in the developed world. We
   review the teen pregnancy literature in light of this discrepancy,
   emphasizing two core debates. The first debate centers on whether teens
   have poor pregnancy outcomes compared to older women, and whether
   negative outcomes are biologically based. Second, we consider the debate
   over the confounding effects of socio-economic conditions associated
   with being young. When teens are considered as a group, results are
   inconsistent across studies. When teens are disaggregated by age, the
   strongest finding across studies is that biological risk is concentrated
   in only the youngest of mothers. Negative consequences are associated
   with teen motherhood not because of chronological age per se, but
   because of relative developmental maturity and the availability of
   non-maternal support. In most traditional societies as well as in some
   sectors of developed societies, teen motherhood occurs within the
   context of extended kin networks and is subsidized through reliable
   economic and childcare assistance. Child-rearing practices, rather than
   pregnancy per se, may explain much of the discrepancy in the prevalence,
   success and attitudes toward teen motherhood in traditional and
   developed societies.

AB This article addresses the challenges in our work as social critics and
   engaged anthropologists. Within this context, it will show how
   academically trained anthropologists respond to the tensions between
   cultural specificities and universal values that they encounter in their
   research. To develop the argument, the article relies on ethnographic
   research among women workers in Karachi's ready-to-wear export garment
   industry to show how lower-class women live and navigate the gendered
   public spaces in Karachi. Following this theme, the article introduces
   the process through which grass roots activists inspired by a language
   of universal rights and women's empowerment seek to address
   working-class women's social and work-related problems. However,
   juxtaposing this with women's own voices, the article shows that such
   developmental priorities may suppress women's own points of view. In
   doing so, it will foreground the larger structural forces that create
   socioeconomic uncertainties in their lives. It will then share women's
   own experiences to argue that these voices, while asserting their
   independence, their right to work, and their right to equal wages-a sign
   of contractual and assertive individualized agency-also simultaneously
   hint at their emphasizing of familial honor and respectability.

AB The material evidence from sites across the Aleutian Islands reflects
   colonization events, subsequent adaptations, and influxes of ideas
   and/or people from the east. The occurrence in the eastern Aleutians of
   bifacial technology around 7000 BP, of artifacts similar to the Arctic
   Small Tool tradition between 4000 and 3500 BP, and of slate and jet
   objects around 1000 BP reflects repeated surges of influence or movement
   of peoples from further east into the eastern end of the chain. In the
   central and western Aleutians, influence or perhaps colonization from
   east of the Aleutians is also marked by the occurrence of bifacial
   technology about 6500 BP and the appearance of slate artifacts after
   1000 BP, suggesting the movement of ideas or people from further east.
   Basic trends across the archipelago include a decrease in formal
   chipped-stone tools, an increase in the use and the complexity of bone
   technology, and the increase in use and variety of ground-stone tools.
   In addition, increasing village site sizes and denser midden deposits
   are seen later in time throughout the archipelago. The similarity in
   sites and assemblages, albeit with regional variations, reflects trends
   that are seen across the chain and indicates that these island
   communities were not isolated from one another or from mainland Alaska.

AB The Aleut language, currently spoken along the Aleutian chain and the
   Pribilof and Commander islands, is the only language in its branch of
   the Eskimo-Aleut language family, and traditional methods of linguistic
   reconstruction have neither satisfactorily explained its relationship
   with languages on the Asian continent nor its development from
   Proto-Eskimo-Aleut. Linguistic reconstruction has always been important
   in understanding the prehistory and history of the Aleuts, and new
   approaches in comparative linguistics, more comprehensive information on
   typological features of neighboring languages, and continuing language
   documentation allow us to propose a rich and continuous history of
   contact with various groups of people. I evaluate evidence that the
   Aleut language may have been shaped by contact with neighbors in Asia
   and Alaska, eventually giving rise to its differentiation from the
   Eskimo languages. I look at dialect differentiation along the Aleutian
   chain and what this differentiation reveals about the migration trends
   of the Aleut along the chain. I look at the colonial expansion of the
   Aleut-speaking area and resulting additional varieties of Aleut in the
   historical period. Finally, I review the effects of the Russian and
   American colonial periods on the Aleut language and the severe
   endangerment that the language faces today as a result. I conclude that
   there is evidence of possible Aleut contact with both neighboring
   peoples; however, much of this evidence has not yet been subjected to
   systematic comparative reconstructions. Linguistic evidence supports
   theories of at least two westward expansions of Aleuts along the island
   chain, but it is not yet clear what motivated the dialect
   differentiations. Finally, I offer some thoughts on directions for
   future dialect studies and the continuing documentation of Aleut.

AB Historical, economic, and political influences on Aleut demography and
   social organization are considered in relation to an apparent deficit of
   Aleut males in the early 20th century. Ethnohistoric records detail
   persistent waves of explorers, fur hunters, missionaries, bureaucrats,
   and foreign fishermen coming to the Aleutian region for economic
   exploitation, with some making it their home. The first major wave
   consisted of Russian and Siberian crews in pursuit of sea otters and fur
   seals. These entrepreneurs moved Aleut men to hunting grounds and
   replaced a large portion of them in the villages. The second wave
   consisted of Scandinavian and other European immigrants who followed
   cod, halibut, and herring fisheries and who married into eastern Aleut
   villages. These movements resulted in two genealogical deficits of Aleut
   men with concomitant shifts in social organization and economic emphases
   that contribute to the modern diversity of Aleut society. Aleut
   evacuation during World War II exacerbated these sex imbalances in the
   villages of the western Aleutian and Pribilof islands.

   transmission with implications for the evolution of groups, competition,
   and scale of socio-political organization among this island population.
   While these kinds of studies often draw upon assemblages of decorated
   ceramics, here we show how analysis of variability unconstrained by
   performance allows us to measure aspects of inheritance related to the
   manufacture of these artifacts. In the case of mata'a from Rapa Nui, we
   demonstrate that it is possible to reach falsifiable conclusions about
   the evolutionary dynamics that shaped the remarkable archaeological

   research in humor in childhood. Emerging work on the neuroanatomy of
   humor was discussed with findings of right hemispheric involvement for
   the comprehension and appreciation of humor for the affective network
   and the left hemisphere for cognitive understanding. These findings are
   intriguing when examining humor functioning in children with various
   disabilities, particularly the right hemisphere for children with
   autistic spectrum disorders or nonverbal learning disabilities.
   Examination of research in humor in childhood disabilities found most
   articles on humor in children with autistic spectrum disorder or mental
   retardation, with few to none in learning disabilities or attention
   deficit hyperactivity disorder. It was concluded that further study is

AB Patients with mental illness often return for further treatment after an
   initial episode of care. Two processes that may contribute to the return
   for further treatment are the severity of patients' initial social and
   clinical status; and/or deterioration in their status over time,
   regardless of their initial status. This study examined these processes
   in an administrative database of war zone veterans who had received
   outpatient treatment from a Veterans Affairs specialized posttraumatic
   stress disorder program. The results suggest that both initial severity
   and deterioration of status contribute to return to treatment and
   involve changes in both social functioning and psychopathology.
   Determination of the direction of effects between social functioning and
   psychopathology showed that psychopathology in the form of PTSD, other
   Axis I disorder or violent behavior generally affected subsequent social
   functioning, but not vice versa. Psychopathology in the form of alcohol
   or drug abuse/dependence, however, showed reciprocal effects with social
   functioning. These results point to the importance of emphasizing
   interventions that address social dysfunction and that address
   psychopathology, from the beginning of treatment as a way of maximizing
   the benefits and minimizing the need for recurrent care.

   framework was used with participation as the dependent category and (a)
   body function/structure; (b) activities; (c) personal factors; and (d)
   environment as independent categories.
   Results A nationally representative sample of 130 youth with spina
   bifida (mean age 15 years) representing 5171 individuals with spina
   bifida was followed up for 4 years. The general health of the sample
   declined over the 4-year study period. Although each outcome using the
   WHO ICF model had its own pattern of factors that related to it, being
   Latino or not speaking English at home was negatively associated with
   each of the outcomes.
   Conclusion The general health of individuals with spina bifida declines
   during adolescence and early adulthood. Social participation is affected
   by many factors, and each outcome appears to have its own set of factors
   that affect it. Future interventions to improve health, well-being, and
   social participation in adults with spina bifida will need to address
   factors in all domains. (J Pediatr 2010; 157:584-8).

AB Background: African American infant's are at higher risk for sudden
   infant death syndrome (SIDS) and accidental suffocation than other
   infants and are up to 4 times more likely to bedshare with their
   parents.
   Objective: To investigate, using qualitative methods, factors
   influencing African American parents' decisions regarding infant sleep
   location (room location and sleep surface).
   Methods: Eighty-three mothers participated in focus groups or individual
   interviews. Questions probed reasons for infant sleep location decisions
   and influences on decision making.
   Results: Most of the mothers in this study slept in the same room as
   their infant. Reasons for roomsharing included space, convenience, and
   safety. Mothers largely decided on infant sleep surface because of space
   for/availability of crib, comfort, convenience, and safety. Both
   roomsharing and bedsharing were often chosen to make feeding and
   checking on the infant more convenient. Mothers who chose not to
   bedshare cited privacy, concern that the infant would become attached to
   the parents' bed, and fears about suffocation. Mothers who chose to
   bedshare often cited the ability to maintain vigilance while asleep.
   Low-income mothers also used bedsharing as a defense against
   environmental dangers.
   Conclusion: African American mothers in this study viewed both
   roomsharing and bedsharing as strategies to keep their infants safe.
   Efforts to encourage roomsharing without bedsharing must address
   parental concerns about space for/availability of a crib, convenience,
   infant and parent comfort, and infant safety.

AB Purpose: To examine effects of race and predictors of socioeconomic
   status (SES) on nutrient-based diet quality and their contribution to
   health disparities in an urban population of low SES.
   Design: Data were analyzed from a sample of the Healthy Aging in
   Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span (HANDLS) Study
   participants examining effects of age, sex, race, income, poverty income
   ratio, education, employment, and smoking status on nutrient-based diet
   quality as measured by a micronutrient composite index of nutrient
   adequacy ratios and a mean adequacy ratio. Regression models were used
   to examine associations and t tests were used to look at racial
   differences.
   Subjects: African American and white adults ages 30 to 64 years residing
   in 12 predefined census tracts in Baltimore, Maryland.
   Results: Sex, age, education, poverty income ratio, and income were
   statistically significant predictors of diet quality for African
   Americans, while sex, education, and smoking status were statistically
   significant for whites. African Americans had lower mean adequacy ratio
   scores than whites (76.4 vs 79.1). Whites had significantly higher
   nutrient adequacy ratios scores for thiamin, riboflavin, folate, B(12),
   vitamins A and E, magnesium, copper, zinc, and calcium, while African
   Americans had higher vitamin C scores.
   Conclusion: Education significantly impacted diet quality in the HANDLS
   sample, but race cannot be discounted. Whether the racial differences in
   diet quality are indicative of cultural differences in food preferences,
   selection, preparation, and availability, or disparities in
   socioeconomic status remains unclear.

AB The aim of this study was to examine the incidence and mortality of
   cutaneous melanoma (CM) in Hong Kong. The epidemiology, clinical, and
   pathological features of melanoma in Asians are different from those in
   the European population, yet there is little in the literature that
   describes about melanoma in Asians. Data from the Hong Kong Cancer
   Registry from 1983 to 2002 were collected and reviewed. Population-based
   data were analyzed, focusing on the mortality and incidence rates over
   this 20-year period. The mean Hong Kong CM incidence rate between 1983
   and 2002 was 0.8/100 000 for men and 0.6/100 000 for women. There was an
   overall decrease in the incidence of CM in Hong Kong between 1983 and
   2002 (P < 0.001). The crude mortality rate of melanoma varied from
   year-to-year in Hong Kong between 1983 and 2002, showing an overall
   increase within this period (P < 0.001). Unlike most parts of the world,
   the overall incidence in Hong Kong is shown to trend downward between
   1983 and 2002. Various factors including ethnic shifts within the Hong
   Kong population and the organization of the health care system may play
   a role in this observation. In addition, the mortality of melanoma
   increased between 1940 and 1990 in most parts of the world, but in Hong
   Kong, the mortality rate in the past 20 years reveals a modest upward
   trend. Its significance requires further investigation. Melanoma Res 20:

AB Increasingly, educators have called on colleges and universities to
   prepare their students for a more interdependent world. While sociology
   has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to
   implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus
   on what ''internationalizing'' or ''globalizing'' the classroom actually
   means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose
   of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of
   internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest
   teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of
   teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology
   courses-Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and
   Migration in a Global Context-are used to illustrate how a more
   systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve
   course design.

AB With the support of the National Science Foundation, the American
   Sociological Association conducted a longitudinal survey of sociology
   majors from the class of 2005, following them from senior year into
   careers or graduate school. The first part of this article provides a
   context for the results from the What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree
   in Sociology? study and a summary of its key findings. Wave I data
   demonstrate strong student interest in sociological concepts, perceived
   mastery of some research skills but not others, and general satisfaction
   with the major. Sociology majors are both idealists and careerists. The
   majority expects to enter the job market after graduation but is not
   satisfied with the career advising they receive. Key findings from Wave
   II demonstrate that more respondents go directly into the job market
   than expected, job search strategies are important in finding a job that
   matches what students learned in their sociology programs, and those who
   find such jobs are more satisfied with the major. The second part
   discusses how the survey findings can be used to enhance curriculum,
   advising, and assessment without vocationalizing the curriculum and
   without adding extra burdens to faculty members' already heavy
   schedules. Finally, the article discusses how the data can be used as a
   baseline for department assessment.

   linked views of nature with restoration from mental fatigue and stress
   reduction. How important are such views for students while they are at
   school? This study investigated 101 public high schools in southeastern
   Michigan to examine the role played by the availability of nearby nature
   in student academic achievement and behavior. The analyses revealed
   consistent and systematically positive relationships between nature
   exposure and student performance. Specifically, views with greater
   quantities of trees and shrubs from cafeteria as well as classroom
   windows are positively associated with standardized test scores,
   graduation rates, percentages of students planning to attend a four-year
   college, and fewer occurrences of criminal behavior. In addition, large
   expanses of landscape lacking natural features are negatively related to
   these same test scores and college plans. These featureless landscapes
   included large areas of campus lawns, athletic fields, and parking lots.
   All analyses accounted for student socio-economic status and
   racial/ethnic makeup, building age, and size of school enrollment. (C)

AB Suicide is a leading cause of death in individuals 15-34 years of age in
   China. Highly lethal pesticides are a common method used for suicide in
   Chinese rural areas. This case-control study aimed to test hypotheses
   concerning the suicide risks associated with pesticide access. Subjects
   included 370 rural completed suicides aged 15-34 years and 370 living
   controls matched on age, gender and residence (rural/urban location).
   Data were collected by a psychological autopsy design with proxy
   respondents. Pesticide access was a significant risk factor for suicide
   even after controlling for other known risk factors in social and
   psychiatric domains, such as education level, living situation, marital
   status, family annual income and mental disorder. Increased risk was
   accounted for by access to insecticide rather than other types of
   pesticides. Suicide intervention in China should focus on restricting
   access to pesticides, especially highly toxic insecticide, improving the
   resuscitation skills of rural primary-care health providers, promoting
   psychological and social support networks in rural areas and educating
   the general public about the suicide risk of having pesticides stored at

   among middle-aged US participants (2,503 black and 8,519 white) in the
   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. Early-life SEP
   indicators assessed included parental education, occupation, and home
   ownership. From 1987 to 2004, 221 and 537 incident heart failure events
   were identified in blacks and whites, respectively. In Cox proportional
   hazards regression, early-life SEP was inversely related to incident
   heart failure after adjustment for age, gender, and study center (for
   blacks, hazard ratio (HR) = 1.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00,
   1.95; for whites, HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.64). Additional adjustment
   for young and mid-to-older adulthood SEP and established heart failure
   risk factors attenuated this association towards the null in both blacks
   and whites. Of the SEP measures, mid-to-older adulthood SEP showed the
   strongest association with incident heart failure in both blacks (HR =
   1.32, 95% CI: 0.90, 1.96) and whites (HR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.75).
   SEP over the life course is related to the risk of incident heart
   failure, with SEP later in adulthood having a more prominent role than
   earlier SEP.

AB Players in Axelrod and Hamilton's model of cooperation were not only in
   a Prisoner's Dilemma, but by definition, they were also trapped in a
   dyad. But animals are rarely so restricted and even the option to
   interact with third parties allows individuals to escape from the
   Prisoner's Dilemma into a much more interesting and varied world of
   cooperation, from the apparently rare 'parcelling' to the widespread
   phenomenon of market effects. Our understanding of by-product mutualism,
   pseudo-reciprocity and the snowdrift game is also enriched by thinking
   'beyond the dyad'. The concepts of by-product mutualism and
   pseudo-reciprocity force us to think again about our basic definitions
   of cooperative behaviour (behaviour by a single individual) and
   cooperation (the outcome of an interaction between two or more
   individuals). Reciprocity is surprisingly rare outside of humans, even
   among large-brained 'intelligent' birds and mammals. Are humans unique
   in having extensive cooperative interactions among non-kin and an
   integrated cognitive system for mediating reciprocity? Perhaps, but our
   best chance for finding a similar phenomenon may be in delphinids, which
   also live in large societies with extensive cooperative interactions
   among non-relatives. A system of nested male alliances in bottlenose
   dolphins illustrates the potential and difficulties of finding a complex
   system of cooperation close to our own.

AB Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and
   cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other
   in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression.
   The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused
   with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is
   ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely
   unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i)
   altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the
   actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by
   acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour
   that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if
   return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of
   an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second
   category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic
   impulse, which-as in humans-may be born from empathy with the
   recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for
   prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional
   state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of
   cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There
   is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for
   this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous
   nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews
   observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms
   that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as
   a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.

AB Vocalizations are important components of social behaviour in many
   vertebrate species, including our own. Less well-understood are the
   hormonal mechanisms involved in response to vocal cues, and how these
   systems may influence the course of behavioural evolution. The
   neurohormone oxytocin (OT) partly governs a number of biological and
   social processes critical to fitness, such as attachment between mothers
   and their young, and suppression of the stress response after contact
   with trusted conspecfics. Rodent studies suggest that OT's release is
   contingent upon direct tactile contact with such individuals, but we
   hypothesized that vocalizations might be capable of producing the same
   effect. To test our hypothesis, we chose human mother-daughter dyads and
   applied a social stressor to the children, following which we randomly
   assigned participants into complete contact, speech-only or no-contact
   conditions. Children receiving a full complement of comfort including
   physical, vocal and non-verbal contact showed the highest levels of OT
   and the swiftest return to baseline of a biological marker of stress
   (salivary cortisol), but a strikingly similar hormonal profile emerged
   in children comforted solely by their mother's voice. Our results
   suggest that vocalizations may be as important as touch to the
   neuroendocrine regulation of social bonding in our species.

AB Objective
   We hypothesized that the drinking behavior of adolescents in China is
   influenced by expectancies and self-efficacy and that adolescents'
   cultural orientation towards western versus traditional Chinese values
   influences expectancies, self-efficacy and drinking behavior, with
   western values leading to more dysfunctional patterns of beliefs and
   drinking, and that these beliefs are influenced by students' gender and
   school environment.
   Methods
   A total of 1020 high school students from Beijing completed the Chinese
   Adolescent Alcohol Expectancy, the Chinese Cultural Orientation and the
   Chinese Self-regulation Self-efficacy questionnaires.
   Results
   Results generally confirmed our hypotheses. Higher negative expectancies
   and higher self-efficacy reduced the likelihood of drinking
   significantly. Higher positive expectancies increased the likelihood of
   regular drinking but not occasional drinking. Having western cultural
   orientation increased the likelihood of drinking. Higher levels of
   western cultural orientation also increased positive expectancies,
   lowered negative expectancies and lowered self-efficacy. Having more
   western (less traditional) views towards traditional Chinese values
   decreased positive and negative expectancies. Gender influenced beliefs,
   with males having higher positive and lower negative expectancies, lower
   self-efficacy and more traditional cultural orientation. Students in key
   and general schools had less traditional cultural orientation and key
   school students had higher self-efficacy.
   Conclusions
   Results indicate that cultural orientation influences adolescent
   drinking and this influence is mediated partially through cultural
   orientation influences on adolescent drinking expectancies and
   self-efficacy. Having more western and less traditional Chinese cultural
   orientation leads to more drinking, lower self-efficacy for regulating
   drinking and more risk-promoting alcohol expectancies.

AB The telomere length is an indicator of biologic aging, and shorter
   telomeres have been associated with coronary artery calcium (CAC), a
   validated indicator of coronary atherosclerosis. It is unclear, however,
   whether healthy lifestyle behaviors affect the relation between telomere
   length and CAC. In a sample of subjects aged 40 to 64 years with no
   previous diagnosis of coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus,
   or cancer (n = 318), healthy lifestyle behaviors of greater fruit and
   vegetable consumption, lower meat consumption, exercise, being at a
   healthy weight, and the presence of social support were examined to
   determine whether they attenuated the association between a shorter
   telomere length and the presence of CAC. Logistic regression analyses
   controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and Framingham risk score
   revealed that the relation between having shorter telomeres and the
   presence of CAC was attenuated in the presence of high social support,
   low meat consumption, and high fruit and vegetable consumption. Those
   with shorter telomeres and these characteristics were not significantly
   different from those with longer telomeres. Conversely, the subjects
   with shorter telomeres and less healthy lifestyles had a significantly
   increased risk of the presence of CAC: low fruit and vegetable
   consumption (odds ratio 3.30, 95% confidence interval 1.61 to 6.75),
   high meat consumption (odds ratio 3.33, 95% confidence interval 1.54 to
   7.20), and low social support (odds ratio 2.58, 95% confidence interval
   1.24 to 5.37). Stratification by gender yielded similar results for men;
   however, among women, only fruit and vegetable consumption attenuated
   the shorter telomere length and CAC relation. In conclusion, the results
   of the present study suggest that being involved in healthy lifestyle
   behaviors might attenuate the association between shorter telomere
   length and coronary atherosclerosis, as identified using CAC. (C) 2010

AB Objectives Few Canadian data sources allow the examination of
   disparities by ethnicity, language, or immigrant status in occupational
   exposures or health outcomes. However; it is possible to document the
   mechanisms that can create disparities, such as the over-representation
   of population groups in high-risk jobs. We evaluated, in the Montreal
   context, the relationship between the social composition of jobs and
   their associated risk level.
   Methods We used data from the 2001 Statistics Canada census and from
   Quebec's workers' compensation board for 2000-2002 to characterize job
   categories defined as major industrial groups crossed with three
   professional categories (manual, mixed, non-manual). Immigrant, visible,
   and linguistic minority status variables were used to describe job
   composition. The frequency rate of compensated health problems and the
   average duration of compensation determined job risk level. The
   relationship between the social composition and risk level of jobs was
   evaluated with Kendall correlations.
   Results The proportion of immigrants and minorities was positively and
   significantly linked to the risk level across job categories. Many
   relationships were significant for women only. In analyses done within
   manual jobs, relationships with the frequency rate reversed and were
   significant, except for the relationship with the proportion of
   individuals with knowledge of French. only, which remained positive.
   Conclusions Immigrants, visible, and linguistic minorities in Montreal
   are more likely to work where there is an increased level of compensated
   risk. Reversed relationships within manual jobs may be explained by
   under-reporting and under-compensation in vulnerable populations
   compared to those with knowledge of the province's majority language.

AB Genetic discrimination may be experienced in the day-to-day lives of
   people at risk for Huntington disease (HD), encompassing occurrences in
   the workplace, when seeking insurance, within social relationships, and
   during other daily encounters. At-risk individuals who have tested
   either positive or negative for the genetic expansion that causes HD, as
   well as at-risk persons with a 50% chance for developing the disorder
   but have not had DNA testing completed the International RESPOND-HD
   (I-RESPOND-HD) survey. One of the study's purposes was to examine
   perceptions of genetic stigmatization and discrimination. A total of 412
   out of 433 participants provided narrative comments, and 191 provided
   related codable narrative data. The core theme, Information Control,
   refers to organizational policies and interpersonal actions. This theme
   was found in narrative comments describing genetic discrimination
   perceptions across employment, insurance, social, and other situations.
   These reports were elaborated with five themes: What They Encountered,
   What They Felt, What Others Did, What They Did, and What Happened.
   Although many perceptions were coded as hurtful, this was not true in
   all instances. Findings document that reports of genetic discrimination
   are highly individual, and both policy as well as interpersonal factors
   contribute to the outcome of potentially discriminating events. (C) 2010

AB Context: Adverse birth outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth
   weight, have serious health consequences across the life course.
   Socioeconomic disparities in birth outcomes have not been the subject of
   a recent systematic review. The aim of this study was to systematically
   review the literature on the association of socioeconomic disadvantage
   with adverse birth outcomes, with specific attention to the strength and
   consistency of effects across socioeconomic measures, birth outcomes,
   and populations.
   Evidence acquisition: Relevant articles published from 1999 to 2007 were
   obtained through electronic database searches and manual searches of
   reference lists. English-language studies from industrialized countries
   were included if (1) study objectives included examination of a
   socioeconomic disparity in a birth outcome and (2) results were
   presented on the association between a socioeconomic predictor and a
   birth outcome related to birth weight, gestational age, or intrauterine
   growth. Two reviewers extracted data and independently rated study
   quality; data were analyzed in 2008-2009.
   Evidence synthesis: Ninety-three of 106 studies reported a significant
   association, overall or within a population subgroup, between a
   socioeconomic measure and a birth outcome. Socioeconomic disadvantage
   was consistently associated with increased risk across socioeconomic
   measures, birth outcomes, and countries; many studies observed
   racial/ethnic differences in the effect of socioeconomic measures.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic differences in birth outcomes remain
   pervasive, with substantial variation by racial or ethnic subgroup, and
   are associated with disadvantage measured at multiple levels
   (individual/family, neighborhood) and time points (childhood,
   adulthood), and with adverse health behaviors that are themselves
   socially patterned. Future reviews should focus on identifying
   interventions to successfully reduce socioeconomic disparities in birth
   outcomes. (Am J Prey Med 2010;39(3);263-272) (C) 2010 American Journal

AB This paper focuses on some basic issues that have been an object of
   debate in the last few years in the field of human-animal studies,
   namely the meaning and definition of animal abuse, the methods used to
   investigate it, and the relation between animal abuse and interpersonal
   violence. The interconnections among these issues are discussed within a
   theoretical framework that underlines the role of cultures in affecting
   people's attitudes and behaviors toward animals. Some of our assumptions
   are: a) in the study of animal abuse experiences it is necessary to
   understand participants' conceptualizations of animal abuse; b) it is
   important to use qualitative, in addition to quantitative, data,
   especially if we want to gain a deeper insight into animal abuse
   experiences, in particular into perpetrators' motivations; c) it is
   imperative that the field of animal abuse research is considered an
   integral and important component not only of psychiatry and clinical
   psychology but also of sociology and social psychology; d) the
   commonalities between animal abuse and interpersonal violence are deep
   and numerous. Some general issues regarding the development of
   instruments to assess animal abuse are also discussed. A significant
   support to our theoretical considerations is provided by some
   qualitative data we obtained from a study that involved 137 pupils aged
   9-16 years (70 girls and 67 boys) in three Italian schools and whose
   main aim was to field-test and validate the Italian version of the child
   self-report form of The Children and Animals Inventory (CAI).

AB This paper illustrates how varieties of cosmopolitanism are shaped
   through a mutually constitutive set of cultural dispositions and
   institutional practices that emerge at the interstices of global human
   right norms and local legal practices. Converging pressures of
   'cosmopolitan imperatives' and the multiplicity of particularized
   manifestations are co-evolving in the context of intercrossings during
   which distinctive cosmopolitanisms are established. This complex
   relationship of global normative expectations and their local
   appropriations is elucidated through the dynamic of recursive
   cosmopolitization. Suggesting that, local problems are resolved with
   recourse to global prescriptions while local solutions are inscribed in
   international institutions consolidating the global Human Rights Regime.
   The Argentinean case carries conceptual and empirical weight as it
   underscores the recursivity of cosmopolitization by calibrating the
   tensions of universalism and particularism at the intersection of
   global, national and regional scales. Argentina is a paradigmatic
   instantiation for how cosmopolitanism can emanate in the periphery as
   local problems are globalized. This, in turn, has resulted in the
   institutionalization of a global Human Rights Regime which exercises
   normative and political-legal pressures on how states legitimately deal
   with human rights abuses. It is this cosmopolitan balance, rather than
   presuppositions of universalistic exogenous pressures or particularistic
   national exceptions, which is shaping the cultural and political
   relevance of human rights norms.

AB More than half a decade has passed since the December 26th 2004 tsunami
   hit the Indian coast leaving a trail of ecological, economic and human
   destruction in its wake. We reviewed the coastal ecological research
   carried out in India in the light of the tsunami. In addition, we also
   briefly reviewed the ecological research in other tsunami affected
   countries in Asia namely Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and Maldives in
   order to provide a broader perspective of ecological research after
   tsunami. A basic search in ISI Web of Knowledge using keywords "tsunami"
   and "India" resulted in 127 peer reviewed journal articles, of which 39
   articles were pertaining to ecological sciences. In comparison, Sri
   Lanka, Indonesia, Thailand and Maldives had, respectively, eight, four,
   21 and two articles pertaining to ecology. In India, bioshields received
   the major share of scientific interest (14 out of 39) while only one
   study (each) was dedicated to corals, seagrasses, seaweeds and
   meiofauna, pointing to the paucity of research attention dedicated to
   these critical ecosystems. We noted that very few interdisciplinary
   studies looked at linkages between pure/applied sciences and the social
   sciences in India. In addition, there appears to be little correlation
   between the limited research that was done and its influence on policy
   in India. This review points to gap areas in ecological research in
   India and highlights the lessons learnt from research in other
   tsunami-affected countries. It also provides guidance on the links
   between science and policy that are required for effective coastal zone
   management.

AB Racial and ethnic disparities in obesity persist despite a narrowing in
   obesity risk associated with socioeconomic status. The household
   environment has been shown to be important in understanding
   obesity-promoting behaviors in diverse populations. Our current study
   was designed to examine the relationship between household density and
   obesity in young Black and White adults aged 18-30 years from the
   Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort. All
   sociodemographic and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) information
   for this study was collected by questionnaire between 1990-1991. Height
   was collected using a mounted centimeter ruler. Weight was measured on a
   balance beam scale. Obesity was defined as a body mass index >= 30
   kg/m.(2) Household density (HD) was defined as the ratio of people to
   bedrooms in the home. High HD was defined as a ratio > 1. Bivariate
   analysis showed that more women tend to live in high density households
   compared to men (45.4% vs 38.9%; P<.01) and more Blacks tend to live in
   high density households compared to Whites (53.7% vs 31.8%).
   Leisure-time physical activity index was lower in Blacks than in Whites
   (2.5% vs 2.6%; P<.01). Blacks had a higher prevalence of obesity than
   Whites (27.1% vs 11.8%; P<.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that
   Black women within high HD were at highest risk for obesity compared to
   White women living within low HD (OR=4.88%; 95% CI: 3.56-6.67). HD may
   provide an important context in understanding racial disparities in
   obesity-promoting behaviors. (Etn Dis. 2010;20:366-369)

AB Objective: Abdominal fat deposition has been shown to be related to
   hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. Studies have shown a
   correlation between cortisol (a stress hormone) and abdominal fat
   deposition. Low socioeconomic position (SEP) has also been shown to be
   related to abdominal fat deposition. It is hypothesized that chronic
   stress associated with low SEP leads to high cortisol levels which in
   turn lead to abdominal fat deposition. Previous research in this area
   has included mainly European subjects. The purpose of this study was to
   examine the evidence for the SEP-chronic stress-cortisol-abdominal fat
   hypothesis in a sample of African American and White American women.
   Design: Data from the Regional Assessment Health Surveillance Study
   (RAHSS), a survey and physical examination of a representative sample of
   African American and White adults residing in six counties in Georgia,
   were utilized. The study population included 111 African American and
   119 White women. Abdominal fat deposition was measured by waist
   circumference (inches). Education and income were the measures of SEP.
   Other exposures examined included serum cortisol, self-reported daily
   stress level, cigarette smoking, marital status, and number of children.
   Associations were examined using multiple linear regression models
   adjusted for age and body mass index (BMI).
   Results: Among White women, less-educated women had a waist
   circumference 2.22 inches larger (P<.05) than more highly educated
   women. Among African American women, separated or divorced women (+2.29
   in, P<.05) and widowed women (+3.13 in, P<.01) had larger waist
   circumferences than married women. No other factors were significantly
   associated with waist circumference.
   Conclusions: The SEP-chronic stress abdominal fat accumulation
   hypothesis was only partially supported by the data. Different stressors
   and pathways may be important in producing abdominal fat accumulation in
   African American and White women. (Ethn Dis. 2010;20:376-382)

AB Objectives: To better understand how obesity and low levels of physical
   activity (PA) contribute to racial health disparities, we examined the
   association of PA domains (work, home life, and leisure) with indicators
   of socioeconomic status and markers of obesity in African Americans.
   Methods: These cross sectional analyses of interview and clinical
   measures from the baseline visit of the Jackson Heart Study of
   cardiovascular disease (CVD) in African Americans of the Jackson,
   Mississippi metropolitan statistical area included 3,174 women and 1,830
   men aged 21-95 years. The main measures were active living, sport, work,
   home life, and total PA scores; participation in regular moderate or
   vigorous intensity leisure physical activity (MVLPA); demographics, body
   mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and CVD risk factors.
   Results: The sample was 63% female, 81% high school or college
   graduates, with 51% aged 45-64 years, and mostly overweight (32%) or
   obese (53%). Women were less active than men in all domains except home
   life. Total PA was inversely associated with WC in women and men. The
   overweight (BMI 25-29.9) group was most active in all domains except
   work; active living and sport PA and prevalence of MVLPA then declined
   in a dose response association with increasing BMI. Work PA was
   associated with the lowest BMI but otherwise with indicators of less
   favorable socioeconomic status and health.
   Conclusions: Observed differences in PA in African Americans by domain
   and association with obesity biomarkers suggest areas for future study
   and intervention to reduce health disparities. (Ethn Dis.

AB Background. Small-scale poultry production has the potential to increase
   animal-source food consumption, improve household income, and reduce
   food insecurity
   Objective. To assess the impact of a chicken Newcastle disease
   vaccination program on consumption of chicken and eggs among women and
   children, income, and food insecurity in rural Tanzanian households.
   Methods. Comparisons were made between households from three project
   villages, which participated in a Newcastle disease vaccination program
   for chickens, and three control villages, which did not participate.
   Household interviews were done with mothers from a random sample in
   March 2008 (237 households) and March 2009 (261 households).
   Results. After the first year of vaccinations (three rounds), project
   households kept significantly more chickens and tended to be more food
   secure than control households. Mothers from project households ate
   significantly more eggs than their counterparts in control households. A
   similar trend was observed among children. In 2009, fewer chickens were
   vaccinated in the project villages than in 2008, and more chickens were
   independently vaccinated in the control villages. This corresponded with
   an increase in ownership of chickens, a reduction in food insecurity,
   and improved consumption of eggs in control villages, whereas chicken
   ownership and egg consumption decreased and food insecurity remained
   relatively stable in project villages. We saw no differences between
   project and control villages in income earned from chicken and egg
   sales.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggest that an increase in chicken Newcastle
   disease vaccination can lead to an increase in ownership of chickens and
   egg consumption and may also have an effect on reducing household food
   insecurity.

AB Little is known about the lay public's awareness and attitudes
   concerning genetic testing and what factors influence their
   perspectives. The existing literature focuses mainly on ethnic and
   socioeconomic differences; however, here we focus on how awareness and
   attitudes regarding genetic testing differ by geographical regions in
   the US. We compared awareness and attitudes concerning genetic testing
   for disease risk and ancestry among 452 adults (41% Black and 67%
   female) in four major US cities, Norman, OK; Cincinnati, OH; Harlem, NY;
   and Washington, DC; prior to their participation in genetic ancestry
   testing. The OK participants reported more detail about their personal
   ancestries (p = 0.02) and valued ancestry testing over disease testing
   more than all other sites (p < 0.01). The NY participants were more
   likely than other sites to seek genetic testing for disease (p = 0.01)
   and to see benefit in finding out more about one's ancestry (p = 0.02),
   while the DC participants reported reading and hearing more about
   genetic testing for African ancestry than all other sites (p < 0.01).
   These site differences were not better accounted for by sex, age,
   education, self-reported ethnicity, religion, or previous experience
   with genetic testing/counseling. Regional differences in awareness and
   attitudes transcend traditional demographic predictors, such as
   ethnicity, age and education. Local sociocultural factors, more than
   ethnicity and socioeconomic status, may influence the public's awareness
   and belief systems, particularly with respect to genetics.

AB In this article we explore a life course perspective on fandom, with
   particular emphasis on fandom and adult development. While there is
   growing interest in issues of age and aging within fan studies and
   within media studies more broadly, there is a tendency in this
   literature to discuss aging and the life course atheoretically, ignoring
   a rich body of scholarship in gerontology, sociology, psychology and
   human development that examines how lives unfold over time. Our goal in
   this manuscript is to make explicit what is typically rendered implicit
   in fan studies by drawing directly on life course perspectives to enrich
   our understanding of long-term and later-life fandom, and to suggest
   ways that fan studies might more fully account for fandom over time.
   This article thus synthesizes two bodies of literature that rarely
   inform one another: fan studies and life course scholarship.

AB Inner-city relationships face numerous challenges including illegal drug
   use and its consequences. The nature of this challenge, however, has
   changed dramatically with a shift from the crack subculture of the 1980s
   and early 1990s to the subsequent marijuana/blunts subculture. This
   study presents data concerning 95 inner-city relationships where illegal
   drug use was present from people who were interviewed in 2004-2006 and
   reinterviewed in 2008. Hard drug use was still problematic in the 2000s
   even with the passing of the crack epidemic and its associated
   behavioral norms. Hard drug (primarily crack) users reported drug use
   was a problem, reported conflict over drugs, reported higher levels of
   conflict than others and were the most likely to have broken up with
   their partner. On the other hand, the experiences and subcultural norms
   associated with marijuana use appeared to be much less detrimental to
   relationship harmony. Subjects who used marijuana but not hard drugs
   reported much less relationship conflict. Indeed, many reported that
   they enjoyed using marijuana with their partner. These subcultural
   insights further the understanding that young adults have constructed a
   much more socially productive subculture regarding marijuana use than
   their predecessors had constructed around use of crack.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION

PD SEP 2010

AB Background. The authors conducted a critical review of the literature to
   ascertain the strength of the scientific and professional evidence
   supporting an association between dental caries and the experience and
   severity of asthma.
   Types of Studies Reviewed. In March 2010, the authors searched Medline
   (1976-2010) by using the Ovid Web Gateway for the terms "asthma" and
   ["dental caries" or "dental caries susceptibility"] appearing in studies
   of humans published in English. The authors eliminated conference
   proceedings and abstracts, opinion pieces and unpublished studies; they
   included case series, cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies
   and clinical trials.
   Results. The review yielded 27 studies described in 29 articles. The
   authors found that researchers have investigated the hypothesized
   relationship between asthma and caries by means of diverse strategies,
   often using asthma cases clustered in pools of patients seeking clinical
   care. The strongest methodological designs were more likely to reveal
   little support for a positive association. The authors found no strong
   evidence suggesting that a causal link exists. Future research
   incorporating better-defined covariates and longitudinal designs is
   needed.
   Clinical Implications. Asthma per se may not be a risk factor for
   caries. Patients who have extreme dryness of the mouth, whose use of
   nebulizers is persistent, whose consumption of carbohydrates is
   frequent, and who have used multiple medications or have used
   medications over the long term necessitate cautious dental health care.

AB Different aspects of personal relationships including social
   integration, social support, and social conflict have been related to
   inflammation. This article summarizes evidence linking the quality and
   quantity of relationships with gene expression, intracellular signaling
   mechanisms, and inflammatory biomarkers, and highlights the biological
   and psychological pathways through which close relationships impact
   inflammatory responses. Relationship conflict and lower social support
   can effectively modulate proinflammatory cytokine secretion both
   directly (via CNS/neural/endocrine/immune biobehavioral pathways), and
   indirectly, by promoting depression, emotional stress responses, and
   detrimental health behaviors. Accordingly, thorough assessments of
   health behaviors and attention to key methodological issues are
   necessary to identify the contributions of relationships to
   inflammation, and thus we highlight procedural issues to be considered
   in the design of studies. Despite some notable methodological
   challenges, the evidence suggests that learning more about how close
   relationships influence inflammation will provide important new insights
   into the ways that relationships impact health. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

   science are resolved on the basis of a consideration of the epistemic
   merits of the theories. Subjective factors merely ensure that competing

   are exposed. Epistemic considerations are what ultimately lead to

   one of the first to approach the philosophy of science by examining the
   dynamics of scientific communities. I will show how this approach is
   vital to the epistemology of science by showing how two dynamics that
   Kuhn discusses, shared tacit knowledge and professional hierarchies,
   directly bear on Popper's epistemic thesis that the possibility of
   criticism is the crucial feature of science. Without this methodological
   shift, the potential social hindrances to science being a critical
   enterprise remain beyond the scope of our philosophies.

AB Objectives. We examine the association between perceived neighborhood
   disorder and self-rated physical health. Building on previous research,
   we test whether this association is mediated by sleep quality.
   Methods. We use data from the 2004 Survey of Texas Adults (n = 1323) to
   estimate a series of ordinary least squares regression models. We
   formally assess mediation by testing for significant changes in the
   effect of neighborhood disorder before and after adjusting for sleep
   quality.
   Results. We find that residence in a neighborhood that is perceived as
   noisy, unclean, and crime-ridden is associated with poorer self-rated
   physical health, even with controls for irregular exercise, poor diet
   quality, smoking, binge drinking, obesity and a host of relevant
   sociodemographic factors. Our results also indicate that the
   relationship between neighborhood disorder and self-rated physical
   health is partially mediated by lower sleep quality.
   Conclusion. Targeted interventions designed to promote sleep quality in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods may help to improve the physical health of
   residents in the short-term. Policies aimed at solving the problem of
   neighborhood disorder are needed to support sleep quality and physical
   health in the long-term. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Although social status plays a crucial role in the generation and
   maintenance of social inequalities, how status processes operate in
   naturalistic social contexts remains less clear. In the following
   article, I provide a case study of doormen-individuals who
   simultaneously represent status experts and status judges-at a highly
   exclusive nightclub to investigate how people draw status distinctions
   in micro-social settings. Using interview and ethnographic data, I
   analyze on what bases doormen evaluate the relative worth of patrons and
   confer the status prize of admission. I find that in making such
   decisions, doormen drew from a constellation of competence and esteem
   cues, which were informed by contextually specific status schemas about
   the relative material, moral, and symbolic worth of particular client
   groups. Moreover, the ways in which doormen used these cues and schema
   depended on the identity of the specific patron being evaluated. As
   such, I argue that processes of interpersonal evaluation and status
   conferral are contextually specific, culturally embedded, and
   interpersonally variable. Despite such variations, a patron's perceived
   social connections seemed to outweigh other types of cues in admissions
   decisions. I conclude by discussing these findings in light of both
   status characteristics theory and Bourdieu's work on the
   transubstantiation of capital to suggest that social capital is a
   powerful status cue that can, under certain conditions, be a more potent
   source of social distinction and status advantage, or hold a greater
   conversion value, in systems of stratification than other types of
   qualities.

   extends those studies by implementing Bourdieu's relational perspective
   of social space to systematically explore the homology between drivers'
   social characteristics and their involvement in specific types of motor
   vehicle accident. Using a large database that merges official Israeli
   road-accident records with socioeconomic data from two censuses, this
   research maps the social order of road accidents through multiple
   correspondence analysis. Extending prior studies, the results show that
   different social groups indeed tend to be involved in motor vehicle
   accidents of different types and severity. For example, we find that
   drivers from low socioeconomic backgrounds are overinvolved in severe
   accidents with fatal outcomes. The new findings reported here shed light
   on the social regularity of road accidents and expose new facets in the
   social organization of death.

   strong levels of camaraderie and cohesion within its ranks. Based on
   interviews with gay and lesbian military veterans, I find that DADT is a
   site of multiple paradoxes around both gay identity and the military as
   a whole. Rather than protect or strengthen the camaraderie and cohesion
   in the military, these bonds that connect members of the military are
   weakened by requiring gay and lesbian personnel to hide part of
   themselves from fellow soldiers. Further, in prohibiting gay identities
   from being openly expressed, DADT actually creates a queer space in

AB Ambivalence is a widely experienced psychological state, but
   inter-disciplinary studies, to a certain extent, define and
   conceptualize ambivalence independently. In spite of its lack of
   clarity, ambivalence has become an increasingly popular concept,
   utilized in hypotheses concerning a variety of social phenomena. This
   study provides an overview of extant studies on ambivalence, and
   summarizes the similarities and differences in how practitioners of
   social psychology, political science, and sociology have adopted the
   concept. A survey of literature from the three fields suggests four
   distinctive definitions of ambivalence or antecedents that have caused
   ambivalence: (1) co-activation of both positivity and negativity; (2)
   co-emergence of conflicting attitudes; (3) co-constraint of conflicting
   values; and (4) co-existence of conflicting reference groups. Some
   potential problems, such as inconsistent findings and lack of relevant
   measures or indices are indicated, and alternative methods are
   suggested. The paper concludes by suggesting a more sophisticated and
   precise integrative model of ambivalence. (C) 2010 Western Social

   argue for a focus on the experiential and relational dynamics of
   celebrity from the point of view of celebrities themselves, something
   which has so far been difficult for researchers to achieve. One way to
   accomplish this goal is to move in the direction celebrity itself seems
   to be headed: toward local or subcultural celebrities and their smaller,
   more segmented audiences. Empirical research on the lived experiences of
   local celebrities provides a practical way to generate celebrity-level
   data and makes an important sociological contribution to broader
   theorizing about the cultural phenomenon of celebrity.

AB How do activists create cultural change? Scholars have investigated the
   development and maintenance of collective identities as one avenue for
   cultural change, but to understand how activists foster change beyond
   their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for
   changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look
   at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals
   and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural
   changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with
   animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on
   research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main
   strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as
   well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries
   through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross
   boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study
   contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural
   changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a
   useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and
   maintenance in the sociology of culture.

AB Following up on Zirin's (2008)challenge that sports sociologists "get
   off the bench," and Karen and Washington's (2001) plea to make sports
   sociology more central to analyses of social power, this article
   empirically reviews and assesses the sociology of sports from 1977-2008.
   Using a sample of 441 articles selected from the three major sports
   sociology journals during that period, we conclude that sports sociology
   exhibits a strong and increasing bias toward micro-level analyses of
   (for example) how the content of sports frames and constructs the social
   world. A smaller and shrinking body of work examines more macro-oriented
   issues such as the economics and politics of sports, and there seem to
   be few attempts to meaningfully synthesize these micro and macro
   orientations. We think this partiality toward micro-oriented frameworks
   is rooted in factors unique to sports sociology while also reflecting
   larger trends within sociology as a whole. As advocates of popularly
   accessible public sociology, we respectfully suggest that sports
   sociologists try harder to weave macro analyses into their work, not
   necessarily replacing micro-level approaches, but complementing them. We
   believe that sports sociology is well-positioned to become a standard
   bearer for public sociology, but only if it pays more attention to the
   way organized sports intertwines with the organizational, political, and
   economic forces that perpetuate and exacerbate social inequality.

   social problems remains an important resource for learning. I describe
   how my own journey from social investigator, witness, and activist not

   Committee (PAC) contributors and roll call voting in eight U.S. Houses,
   1991-2006, I approach the issue using a novel, sociological approach
   that focuses on social ties between lawmakers and mutually shared

   contributor influence via these ties in seven of the eight Houses. I
   discuss the implications of these findings for contributor-lawmaker
   reciprocal exchange, the social embeddedness of policymaking, and

AB Sociologists are fond of game metaphors. However, such metaphors rarely
   go beyond casual references to generic games. Yet games are little
   social systems, and each game offers a distinctive perspective on the
   relationship between rules and constraints, on the one side, and
   emergent order, on the other. In this article, we examine three
   games-chess, go, and (Texas hold 'em) poker-for sociological insights
   into contested social arenas such as markets, warfare, politics, and the
   professions. We describe each game's rules and emergent properties, and
   then offer a brief theorization of the social world through the "lens"
   of that game. Then we show how a study of the three games advances the
   sociology of strategy by enriching ideas about skill, position, and
   strategic dilemma.

AB According to the religious economies model, religious supply in open
   religious economies should adapt to the demands of diverse market
   niches. This proposition is inconsistent with the finding that, although
   women constitute the majority of religious consumers, the majority of
   the religions produced in the American religious marketplace favor men's
   interests relative to women's. Three modifications to the religious
   economies model are suggested to account for this contradiction. The
   first modification is a respecification of "religious capital" that
   takes into account unequal distributions of power among producers of
   religious value and their differential effects on the beneficiaries and
   targets of religious norms. The second modification theorizes religion's
   linkages to other social institutions as sources of cost and benefit
   that are taken into account by religious entrepreneurs. The third
   modification accounts for status-based discrimination and unequal
   distributions of capital as sources of constraint that influence the
   production of religious supply. Several directions for future research
   are proposed.

AB The diversity of contemporary "capitalisms" underscores the need to
   supplant the amorphous concept of structure with more precise concepts,
   particularly institutions and networks. All institutions entail both
   embodied and relational aspects. Institutions are relational insofar as
   they map obligatory patterns of "getting by and getting
   along"-institutional orders-that steer stable social fields over time.
   Institutions are simultaneously embodied as institutional paradigms,
   part of a larger bodily agency Pierre Bourdieu called habitus.
   Institutions are in turn tightly coupled to networks between various
   people based on, but not reducible to, strategic interests. Yet social
   interaction sometimes exceeds institutional boundaries, giving rise to
   disjunctive fields and underscoring the prominence of institutional
   failures in the unfolding of antagonistic relations such as warfare.
   Such disjunctive fields can be tracked in relation to some transnational
   networks at the global level without assuming developmental convergence.
   This last point underscores the meaning of neoclassical sociology, which
   eschews assumptions of developmental convergence at the global level.

AB A question that continues to attract researchers in the sociology of
   religion is what factors lead to religious growth. This article examines
   three well-known Christian religious groups that share many
   characteristics (i.e., supply-side factors): Mormonism, Jehovah's
   Witnesses, and Seventh-day Adventists. Membership data from these groups
   were gathered from 1960 through 2006 for most countries around the
   world. Membership growth rates were analyzed while controlling for
   country-level characteristics (i.e., demand-side factors). The results
   of this analysis indicate that both supply- and demand-side factors are
   important in determining growth. The strongest predictors of growth are:
   growth momentum in a country, the level of economic development, and
   several country-level characteristics. We conclude that socioeconomic
   development of countries ultimately leads to a secular transition,
   curtailing the growth of these religious groups.

AB If we are to believe the proponents of the Theory of Practice and of
   Rational Choice, the gap between these two paradigmatic approaches
   cannot be bridged. They rely on ontological premises, theories of
   motivations and causal models that stand too far apart. In this article,
   I argue that this theoretical antinomy loses much of its edge when we
   take as objects of sociological investigation processes of historical
   change, that is, when we try to specify in theoretical terms how and in
   which conditions historical actors enact and endorse shifts in patterns
   of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories
   that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in
   light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change:
   first, the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of
   moments of breaks and ruptures. Along the way, I develop an argument
   about the conditions of emergence of self-limiting norms and the
   centrality of epistemic beliefs in situations of high disruption.

AB Forest land conversion leads to ecological effects (e.g., changes in
   water quality and wildlife habitat) and socioeconomic effects (e.g.,
   expanding urban-forest interface, reduced long-term timber production
   possibilities and loss of open space). Socioeconomic drivers of land use
   change such as population totals and personal income levels have
   increased substantially since World War II. Human land use is the
   primary force driving changes in forest ecosystem attributes. Land use
   changes affecting forests since 1990 have been heavily concentrated in
   the South. Nationwide, more than 60 percent of housing units built in
   the 1990s were constructed in or near wildland vegetation. More than 44
   million acres of private forest are projected to experience housing
   density increases between 2000 and 2030, with the majority of the most
   heavily impacted watersheds in the East. The United States population is
   projected to grow by more than 120 million people by 2050, and
   deforestation associated with this growth is projected to exceed 50
   million acres. Fragmentation of remaining forests is also projected and
   expected to be concentrated in distinct subregions; in the South, these
   include urbanizing areas and areas close to interstate highway
   corridors. As urban lands expand into surrounding areas, retaining trees
   can have significant benefits. Current benefits of urban vegetation on
   environmental quality nationally are on the order of several billion
   dollars per year.

AB As highly managed ecosystems, urban areas should reflect the social
   characteristics of their managers, who are primarily residents. Since
   landscape features develop over time, we hypothesize that present-day
   vegetation should also reflect social characteristics of past residents.
   Using an urban-to-suburban watershed in the Baltimore Metropolitan
   Region, this paper examines the relationship between demographics,
   housing characteristics, and lifestyle clusters from 1960 and 2000 with
   areas of high woody and herbaceous vegetation cover in 1999. We find
   that 1960 demographics and age of housing are better predictors of high
   woody or tree coverage in 1999 than demographics and housing
   characteristics from 2000. Key variables from 1960 are percent in
   professional occupations (+), percent of pre-WWI housing (-), percent of
   post-WWII housing (+), and population density (-). Past and present
   demographic and housing variables are poor predictors of high herbaceous
   cover in 1999. Lifestyle clusters for 2000 are very good predictors of
   high herbaceous coverage in 1999, but lifestyle clusters from 1960 and
   2000 are poor predictors of high woody vegetation coverage. These
   findings suggest that herbaceous or grassy areas, typically lawns, are
   good reflections of contemporary lifestyle characteristics of residents
   while neighborhoods with heavy tree canopies have largely inherited the
   preferred landscapes of past residents and communities. Biological
   growth time scales of trees and woody vegetation means that such
   vegetation may outlast the original inhabitants who designed, purchased,
   and planted them. The landscapes we see today are therefore legacies of
   past consumption patterns.

AB Feasting is one of humanity's most universal and unique social
   behaviors. Although evidence for feasting is common in the early
   agricultural societies of the Neolithic, evidence in pre-Neolithic
   contexts is more elusive. We found clear evidence for feasting on wild
   cattle and tortoises at Hilazon Tachtit cave, a Late Epipaleolithic
   (12,000 calibrated years B. P.) burial site in Israel. This includes
   unusually high densities of butchered tortoise and wild cattle remains
   in two structures, the unique location of the feasting activity in a
   burial cave, and the manufacture of two structures for burial and
   related feasting activities. The results indicate that community members
   coalesced at Hilazon to engage in special rituals to commemorate the
   burial of the dead and that feasts were central elements in these
   important events. Feasts likely served important roles in the
   negotiation and solidification of social relationships, the integration
   of communities, and the mitigation of scalar stress. These and other
   social changes in the Natufian period mark significant changes in human
   social complexity that continued into the Neolithic period. Together,
   social and economic change signal the very beginning of the agricultural
   transition.

AB Two types of models aim to account the origins of rank differentiation
   and social hierarchy in human societies. Conflict models suggest that
   the formation of social hierarchies is synonymous with the establishment
   of relationships of coercive social dominance and exploitation.
   Voluntary or 'integrative' models, on the other hand, suggest that rank
   differentiation - the differentiation of leader from follower, ruler
   from ruled, or state from subject - may sometimes be preferred over more
   egalitarian social arrangements as a solution to the challenges of life
   in social groups, such as conflict over resources, coordination
   failures, and free-riding in cooperative relationships. Little formal
   theoretical work, however, has established whether and under what
   conditions individuals would indeed prefer the establishment of more
   hierarchical relationships over more egalitarian alternatives. This
   paper provides an evolutionary game theoretical model for the acceptance
   of leadership in cooperative groups. We propose that the effort of a
   leader can reduce the likelihood that cooperation fails due to
   free-riding or coordination errors, and that under some circumstances,
   individuals would prefer to cooperate in a group under the supervision
   of a leader who receives a share of the group's productivity than to
   work in an unsupervised group. We suggest, in particular, that this
   becomes an optimal solution for individual decision makers when the
   number of group members required for collective action exceeds the
   maximum group size at which leaderless cooperation is viable. (C) 2010

AB Divorce appears to be one of the least studied demographic processes,

   study mathematical as well as biological implications of the assumption
   that the divorce rate is positively affected by the amount of single
   (i.e., unmarried/unpaired) individuals in the population. We do that by
   modifying the classical exponential two-sex model accounting for pair
   formation and separation. We model the divorce rate as an increasing
   function of the single population size and show that the single
   population pressure on the established couples alters the exponential
   behavior of the classical model in which the divorce rate is assumed
   constant. In particular, the total population size becomes bounded and a
   unique positive equilibrium exists. In addition, a Hopf bifurcation
   analysis around the positive equilibrium shows that the modified model
   may exhibit sustained oscillations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB In social epidemiology, one often considers neighborhood or contextual
   effects on health outcomes, in addition to effects of individual
   exposures. This paper is concerned with the estimation of an individual
   exposure effect in the presence of confounding by neighborhood effects,
   motivated by an analysis of National health Interview Survey (NHIS)
   data. In the analysis, we operationalize neighborhood as the secondary
   sampling unit of the survey, which consists of small groups of
   neighboring census blocks. Thus the neighborhoods are sampled with
   unequal probabilities, as are individuals within neighborhoods. We
   develop and compare several approaches for the analysis of the effect of
   dichotomized individual-level education on the receipt of adequate
   mammography screening. In the analysis, neighborhood effects are likely
   to confound the individual effects, due to such factors as differential
   availability of health services and differential neighborhood culture.
   The approaches can be grouped into three broad classes: ordinary
   logistic regression for survey data, with either no effect or a fixed
   effect for each cluster; conditional logistic regression extended for
   survey data; and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) regression for
   survey data. Standard use of GLMMs with small clusters fails to adjust
   for confounding by cluster (e.g. neighborhood); this motivated us to
   develop an adaptation. We use theory, simulation, and analyses of the
   NIIIS data to compare and contrast all of these methods. One conclusion
   is that all of the methods perform poorly when the sampling bias is
   strong; more research and new methods are clearly needed. Copyright (C)

   This study examined the association between life events and common
   mental disorders while accounting for social networks and social
   supports.
   Method:
   Participants included 1920 adults in the Baltimore Epidemiologic
   Catchment Area Cohort who were interviewed in 1993-1996, of whom 1071
   were re-interviewed in 2004-2005. Generalized estimating equations were
   used to analyze the data.
   Results:
   Social support from friends, spouse or relatives was associated with
   significantly reduced odds of panic disorder and psychological distress,
   after experiencing specific life events. Social networks or social
   support had no significant stress-buffering effect. Social networks and
   social support had almost no direct or buffering effect on major
   depressive disorder, and no effect on generalized anxiety disorder and
   alcohol abuse or dependence disorder.
   Conclusion:
   The significant association between social support and psychological
   distress, rather than diagnosable mental disorders, highlights the
   importance of social support, especially when the severity of a mental
   health related problem is low.

AB Growing evidence suggests that neighborhood characteristics may

   explored associations of neighborhood attributes with subclinical

   (1,699 women, 1,275 men) aged 32-50 years in 2000 from the Coronary
   Artery Disease Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study and 2000
   US Census block-group-level data, the authors estimated
   multivariable-adjusted associations of neighborhood socioeconomic
   deprivation and perceived neighborhood cohesion with odds of coronary
   artery calcification (CAC) 5 years later. Among women, the quartiles of
   highest neighborhood deprivation and lowest cohesion were associated
   with higher odds of CAC after adjustment for individual-level
   demographic and socioeconomic factors (for deprivation, odds ratio =
   2.49, 95% confidence interval: 1.22, 5.08 (P for trend = 0.03); for
   cohesion, odds ratio = 1.87, 95% confidence interval: 1.10, 3.16 (P for
   trend = 0.02)). Associations changed only slightly after adjustment for
   behavioral, psychosocial, and biologic factors. Among men, neither
   neighborhood deprivation nor cohesion was related to CAC. However, among
   men in deprived neighborhoods, low cohesion predicted higher CAC odds
   (for interaction between neighborhood deprivation and cohesion, P =
   0.03). This study provides evidence on associations of neighborhood
   deprivation and cohesion with CAC in younger, asymptomatic adults.
   Neighborhood attributes may contribute to subclinical atherosclerosis.

AB Conquest of indigenous peoples in North America is understood primarily
   through ethnohistorical documents, archaeological evidence, and
   osteological analyses. However, in the Central Andes, the colonial
   enterprise and its effects are understood only from post-contact
   historical and ethnohistorical sources. Few archaeological and
   bioarchaeological studies have investigated Spanish Conquest and
   colonialism in the Andean region [for exceptions see Klaus and Tam: Am J
   Phys Anthropol 138 (2009) 356-368; Wernke, in press; and Quilter, in
   press]. Here we describe bioarchaeological evidence of violence from the
   cemeteries of Huaquerones and 57AS03 within the archaeological zone of
   Puruchuco-Huaquerones, Peru (circa A.D. 1470-1540). A total of 258
   individuals greater than 15 years of age were analyzed for evidence of
   traumatic injuries. Individuals were examined macroscopically and
   evidence of traumatic injuries was analyzed according to the skeletal
   element involved, the location of the injury on the skeletal element,
   and any additional complications of the injury. This study examines and
   compares the evidence of perimortem injuries on skeletonized individuals
   from the two cemeteries and focuses specifically on the interpretation
   of weapon-related perimortem injuries. Evidence of perimortem trauma is
   present in both cemeteries (18.6%, 48/258); however, the frequency of
   injuries in 57AS03 is greater than that in Huaquerones (25.0% vs.
   13.0%). Several injuries from 57AS03 are consistent with documented
   cases of injuries from firearms and 16th Century European weapons. We
   believe that the nature and high frequency of perimortem trauma at
   57AS03 provide evidence of the violence that occurred with Spanish
   Conquest of the Inca Empire. Am J Phys A.nthropol 142:636-649, 2010. (C)

AB This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes
   on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council.
   Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses
   demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of
   religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is
   important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood
   only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social
   environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which
   we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests
   and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions'
   legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice
   theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the
   population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold
   firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational
   field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts
   firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.

AB PURPOSE: To quantity socioeconomic status and ethnic differences in risk
   for coronary heart disease (CHD) accrued from major risk factors in the
   United States.
   METHODS: Data came from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey 2001-2006. Outcomes examined were (a) 10-year risk for CHD events
   as predicted by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
   Treatment Panel 111 2004 Updated Guidelines; and (b) the prevalence of
   the metabolic syndrome and overt diabetes mellitus (a CHD
   risk-equivalent).
   RESULTS: Strong inverse socioeconomic gradients with risk were present
   in all race/ethnicity groups except foreign-born Mexican American men,
   and were attenuated by controls for physical activity, smoking, and
   abdominal obesity. In contrast, race/ethnicity disparities were seen in
   some but not all socioeconomic strata, with some non-Hispanic Blacks and
   US-born Mexican Americans having higher risk and some foreign-born
   Mexican Americans having lower risk.
   CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in cardiovascular risk in the United States are
   primarily related to socioeconomic status and less to race/ethnicity.
   Socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals should be targeted for
   lifestyle counseling and early screening for risk factors, regardless of
   race/ethnicity, to reduce social disparities in cardiovascular outcomes.

AB Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of the Fostering Healthy Futures
   program in reducing mental health problems and associated problems.
   Design: Randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: Denver metropolitan area.
   Participants: Children aged 9 to 11 years who were maltreated and placed
   in foster care.
   Intervention: Children in the control group (n=77) received an
   assessment of their cognitive, educational, and mental health
   functioning. Children in the intervention group (n=79) received the
   assessment and participated in a 9-month mentoring and skills group
   program.
   Main Outcome Measures: Children and caregivers were interviewed at
   baseline prior to randomization, immediately following the intervention,
   and 6 months after the intervention. Teachers were interviewed 2 times
   after baseline. Measures included a multi-informant index of mental
   health problems, youth-reported symptoms of posttraumatic stress,
   dissociation, and quality of life, and caregiver- and youth-reported use
   of mental health services and psychotropic medications.
   Results: After adjusting for covariates, intent-to-treat analyses
   demonstrated that the treatment group had fewer mental health problems
   on a multi-informant factor 6 months after the intervention (mean
   difference, -0.51; 95% confidence interval, -0.84 to -0.19), reported
   fewer symptoms of dissociation 6 months after the intervention (mean
   difference, -3.66; 95% confidence interval, -6.58 to -0.74), and
   reported better quality of life immediately following the intervention
   (mean difference, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.03 to 0.19). Fewer
   youths in the intervention group than in the control group had received
   recent mental health therapy 6 months after the intervention according
   to youth report (53% vs 71%, respectively; relative risk=0.75; 95%
   confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.98).
   Conclusions: A 9-month mentoring and skills group intervention for
   children in foster care can be implemented with fidelity and high uptake
   rates, resulting in improved mental health outcomes.

   men's mean performance exceeded women's on these two visuospatial tasks.
   Gender equality (as assessed by United Nations indices) and economic
   development (as assessed by per capita income and life expectancy) were
   significantly associated, across nations, with larger sex differences,
   contrary to the predictions of social role theory. For both men and
   women, across nations, gender equality and economic development were
   significantly associated with better performance on the two visuospatial
   tasks. However, these associations were stronger for the mental rotation
   task than for the line angle judgment task, and they were stronger for
   men than for women. Results were discussed in terms of evolutionary,
   social role, and stereotype threat theories of sex differences.

AB Adolescent Latinas continue to report higher levels of suicide attempts
   than their African-American and White peers. The phenomenon is still not
   understood and is theorized to be the result of the confluence of many
   cultural, familial, and individual level factors. In Latino cultures,
   belief in the importance of the family, the value known as familism,
   appears to protect youth's emotional and behavioral health, but
   parent-adolescent conflict has been found to be a risk factor for
   suicide attempts. The role of familism in relation to parent-adolescent
   conflict, self-esteem, internalizing behaviors, and suicide attempts has
   not been studied extensively. To address this question, we interviewed
   226 adolescent Latinas, 50% of whom had histories of suicide attempts.
   Using path analysis, familism as a cultural asset was associated with
   lower levels of parent-adolescent conflict, but higher levels of
   internalizing behaviors, while self-esteem and internalizing behaviors
   mediated the relationship between parent-adolescent conflict and suicide
   attempts. Our findings point to the importance of family involvement in
   culturally competent suicide prevention and intervention programs.
   Reducing parent-daughter conflict and fostering closer family ties has
   the added effect of improving self-esteem and shrinking the likelihood
   of suicide attempts.

AB While matters of security have appeared as paramount themes in a
   post-9/11 world, anthropology has not developed a critical comparative
   ethnography of security and its contemporary problematics. In this
   article I call for the emergence of a critical "security anthropology,"
   one that recognizes the significance of security discourses and
   practices to the global and local contexts in which cultural
   anthropology operates. Many issues that have historically preoccupied
   anthropology are today inextricably linked to security themes, and
   anthropology expresses a characteristic approach to topics that today
   must be considered within a security rubric. A focus on security is
   particularly important to an understanding of human rights in
   contemporary neoliberal society. Drawing on examples from Latin America
   and my own work in Bolivia, I track the decline of neoliberalism and the
   rise of the security paradigm as a framework for organizing contemporary
   social life. I suggest that security, rather than a reaction to a
   terrorist attack that " changed everything," is characteristic of a
   neoliberalism that predates the events of 9/11, affecting the subjects
   of anthropological work and shaping the contexts within which that work
   is conducted.

AB Patterns in infant and young child feeding behaviors have been the focus
   of much anthropological, nutritional, and demographic exploration
   because of their relationship to morbidity and mortality. Researchers
   often label these patterns as cultural, which, by definition, means that
   the patterns are linked to ideational factors that are shared within
   cultural groups. Although widely discussed, empirical tests of the
   shared aspect of this theory are lacking. We hypothesized a broad match
   between attitudes about early child feeding practices and feeding
   practices at the population level. We also hypothesized that proxy
   indicators of interaction frequency between mothers would predict
   sharing in responses to a set of statements about infant feeding. Data
   from four different ethnic groups living in two sites in rural Tanzania
   are examined to test these hypotheses. The results indicate that
   mothers' attitudes do not correspond to current public health
   recommendations for infant and young child feeding. Moreover, site-and
   ethnic-group-level differences emerge that may be consistent with the
   social learning hypothesis. Limitations and suggestions for future
   research are discussed.

AB This paper summarizes a series of events that were historical milestones
   in Latin America and the Caribbean in the long road toward restructuring
   and setting up psychiatric and mental health services to shift from the
   old and obsolete psychiatric hospital models to other, community-based
   models. This has been and largely remains the principal challenge that
   we face. The burden of mental illness is described in terms of
   morbidity, mortality, and disability. In 1990, it was estimated that
   psychiatric and neurological disorders accounted for 8.8% of the
   disability-adjusted life years in Latin America and the Caribbean; in
   2004 that burden had grown to 21%. However, the treatment gap (sick
   people who remain untreated) exceeds 60%; added to that there is a
   prevailing gap in funding and resources for the treatment of mental
   health problems.
   In response to these problems, the Pan American Health Organization
   (PAHO/WHO) has continued to strengthen its technical cooperation with
   the countries. The 49th Directing Council of PAHO/WHO approved the
   Strategy and Plan of Action on Mental Health for the region of the
   Americas, which constitutes a major historical landmark; for the first
   time, the ministries of health in every country in the hemisphere
   studied and approved a work programme to improve mental health care
   based on the experiences gained and expressing a technical and political
   commitment.
   It is a key priority to continue working to restructure mental health
   services and strengthen intersectoral initiatives to promote mental
   health; specific problems, such as care for vulnerable groups, child and
   adolescent mental health, suicide, alcohol abuse, and violence, also
   pose a great challenge for mental health programs today.

   murdered his fiancee. The dominant wisdom is that men kill their female
   partners as an expression of their power and control or because their
   power and control is ebbing. Employing a sociological imagination and
   Avery Gordon's notion of haunting, the author draws on feminist and
   social psychological discourses to highlight the contextual importance
   of the power relations of gender and the central role of shame and
   humiliated fury in the killing. The contextual importance of power
   relations and the central role of shame and humiliated fury constitute
   necessary but not sufficient conditions for the commission of
   intimate-partner homicide because such killings also involve
   inexplicable forces. The author discusses some of the practical and
   theoretical implications of the findings.

AB Background Elevated antibodies to latent herpesviruses have been
   demonstrated to be a reliable marker of diminished cellular immunity and
   recently have been associated with low socioeconomic position (SEP) in
   older adults. Extending these observations in a community-based study
   over a wide age range would provide an important new direction for
   investigating mechanisms underlying poor health outcomes in individuals
   with low SEP.
   Methods Anti-herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 and anti-Epstein- Barr virus
   (EBV) antibodies were measured in blood samples from 1457 adults aged
   25-90. Regression models were then used to determine the relationships
   between viral reactivation, age, gender, ethnicity and SEP.
   Results Individuals were significantly more likely to have higher
   antiviral antibodies (ie, reactivation) to both EBV and HSV-1 than one
   virus alone. Individuals in the lowest age group had less reactivation,
   whereas greater reactivation was observed in women and those with the
   least education. Compared to white non-Hispanics, Hispanics and black
   non-Hispanics experienced more viral reactivation. These relationships
   remained strong after controlling for sociodemographic factors as well
   as smoking status, body mass index and physical activity.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate that herpesvirus reactivation is
   associated with variables such as age, gender, ethnicity and education,
   and may play a role in poorer health outcomes in both younger and older
   adults.

AB Four studies investigated whether political allegiance and salience of
   outgroup membership contribute to the phenomenon of acceptance of false,
   stigmatizing information (smears) about political candidates. Studies
   1-3 were conducted in the month prior to the 2008 U.S. Presidential
   election and together demonstrated that pre-standing opposition to John
   McCain or Barack Obama, as well as the situational salience of
   differentiating social categories (i.e., for Obama, race; for McCain,
   age), contributed to the implicit activation and explicit endorsement of
   smearing labels (i.e., Obama is Muslim; McCain is senile). The influence
   of salient differentiating categories on smear acceptance was
   particularly pronounced among politically undecided individuals. Study 4
   clarified that social category differences heighten smear acceptance,
   even if the salient category is semantically unrelated to the smearing
   label, showing that, approximately 1 year after the election, the
   salience of race amplified belief that Obama is a socialist among
   undecided people and McCain supporters. Taken together, these findings
   suggest that, at both implicit and explicit cognitive levels, social
   category differences and political allegiance contribute to acceptance
   of smears against political candidates.

AB Race differences in the receipt of invasive cardiac procedures are
   well-documented but the etiology remains poorly understood.
   We examined how social contextual variables were related to race
   differences in the likelihood of receiving cardiac catheterization in a
   sample of veterans who were recommended to undergo the procedure by a
   physician.
   Prospective observational cohort study.
   A subsample from a study examining race disparities in cardiac
   catheterization of 48 Black/African American and 189 White veterans who
   were recommended by a physician to undergo cardiac catheterization.
   We assessed social contextual variables (e.g., knowing somebody who had
   the procedure, being encouraged by family or friends), clinical
   variables (e.g., hypertension, maximal medical therapy), and if
   participants received cardiac catheterization at any point during the
   study.
   Blacks/African Americans were less likely to undergo cardiac
   catheterization compared to Whites even after controlling for age,
   education, and clinical variables (OR = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.13, 0.75). After
   controlling for demographic and clinical variables, three social
   contextual variables were significantly related to increased likelihood
   of receiving catheterization: knowing someone who had undergone the
   procedure (OR = 3.14; 95% CI, 1.70, 8.74), social support (OR = 2.05;
   95% CI, 1.17, 2.78), and being encouraged by family to have procedure
   (OR = 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.90). After adding the social contextual
   variables, race was no longer significantly related to the likelihood of
   receiving catheterization, thus suggesting that social context plays an
   important role in the relationship between race and cardiac
   catheterization.
   Our results suggest that social contextual factors are related to the
   likelihood of receiving recommended care. In addition, accounting for
   these relationships attenuated the observed race disparities between
   Whites and Blacks/African Americans who were recommended to undergo
   cardiac catheterization by their physicians.

AB Intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence paradigms suggest that
   emotional relationships between generations consist of both positive and
   negative sentiments. We applied latent class analysis to measures of
   affection and conflict in 2,698 older parent-child relationships in 6
   developed nations: England, Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain, and the
   United States (Southern California). The best fitting model consisted of
   4 latent classes distributed differently across nations but with a
   cross-nationally invariant measurement structure. After controlling for
   demographics, health, coresidence, contact, and support, the following
   classes were overrepresented in corresponding nations: amicable
   (England), detached (Germany and Spain), disharmonious (United States),
   ambivalent (Israel). We discuss policy and cultural differences across
   societies that may explain why the prevalence of particular emotional
   types varied by nation.

AB Background: Intervention effects estimated from nonrandomized
   intervention studies are plagued by biases, yet social or structural
   intervention studies are rarely randomized. There are underutilized
   statistical methods available to mitigate biases due to self-selection,
   missing data, and confounding in longitudinal, observational data
   permitting estimation of causal effects. We demonstrate the use of
   Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to evaluate the effect of
   participating in a combined clinical and social sexually transmitted
   infection/human immunodeficiency virus prevention intervention on
   reduction of incident chlamydia and gonorrhea infections among sex
   workers in Brazil.
   Methods: We demonstrate the step-by-step use of IPW, including
   presentation of the theoretical background, data set up, model selection
   for weighting, application of weights, estimation of effects using
   varied modeling procedures, and discussion of assumptions for use of
   IPW.
   Results: A total of 420 sex workers contributed 840 data points on
   incident chlamydia and gonorrhea infection. Participators were compared
   with nonparticipators following application of inverse probability
   weights to correct for differences in covariate patterns between
   exposure groups and between those who remained in the intervention and
   those who were lost-to-follow-up. Estimators using 4 model selection
   procedures provided estimates of intervention effect between odds ratio
   0.43 (95% CI, 0.22-0.85) and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.26-1.1).
   Conclusions: After correcting for selection bias, loss-to-follow-up, and
   confounding, our analysis suggests a protective effect of participating
   in the intervention. Evaluations of behavioral, social, and multilevel
   interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infection can benefit by
   introduction of weighting methods such as IPW.

   introductory essay chronicles developments and new debates around
   emotional labor, worker-customer relationships in the service triangle,
   and the nexus of gender and control in service work. Several neglected
   themes are highlighted, including the relationship between race and the
   organization of work on the shop floor, as well as a number of themes
   that were once prominent in industrial sociology but which have fallen
   into relative neglect in the sociology of service work despite their

AB Sociologists of service work have firmly established that clients may
   become crucial allies for either workers or managers at conflict
   throughout the labor process. However, less attention has been given to
   how these colluding relations may extend beyond the limits of a service
   interaction. An ethnographic approach into the nature of the alliances
   between bus drivers and their passengers in Monterrey, Mexico, revealed
   a subterranean gender system that systematically structured workers'
   struggle against management in ways that have not been considered by the
   sociology of service work. How might personal, emotional, and sexualized
   connections weave into class struggle? In this article, the author
   traces a series of strategies and counterstrategies developed by male
   bus owners and bus drivers in their quest for control over profit,
   highlighting the gendered motivations and means that sustain this
   gendered class struggle. The article concludes with a hypothetical
   overview of the contradictory ways class and gender systems may be
   articulated and how further research along these lines might deepen the
   understanding of class struggle.

AB The subfield that is the sociology of service labor continues to
   generate vibrant internal dialogue. It was the author's original intent
   to push forward the frontier of theory within this field, by performing
   an ethnography of service work in a non-American context (that of
   post-apartheid South Africa). Once in the field, however, he found
   himself moving backward as he was forced to problematize basic
   assumptions concerning the very category of service. In brief, the
   author discovered that managers in a competitive tourism industry
   refused to label their employees' interactive labor as "service,"
   whereas workers themselves actively advocated for such a designation. To
   document the interplay between material and symbolic politics of
   production, the author turned to the work of Pierre Bourdieu-especially
   his theory of political representation and the accompanying concept of
   nomination struggles.

   satisfaction is higher among the traditional neighborhood residents,
   even after controlling for sociodemographics and other characteristics.
   Differences in the characteristics associated with satisfaction in each
   group include the perception of liveliness and diversity, contributing
   significantly only among the segment of the sample living in traditional
   neighborhoods, and the perception of economic homogeneity, contributing
   significantly only among the suburban segment. Features such as parking,
   yards, and school quality do not emerge as important predictors of
   satisfaction for either group. The most important features for
   neighborhood satisfaction among both groups are the attractive
   appearance and perceived safety of neighborhoods, suggesting that any
   innovative neighborhood designs are most likely to succeed in attracting
   residents if able to foster these qualities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Effective conservation and management of natural resources requires
   integrating knowledge of ecological systems with an understanding of the
   cultural, social and economic characteristics of people who live and
   work in ecological landscapes. This study explores how people with
   distinctive social attributes are situated spatially across the
   landscape at the level of ecological section and subsection in Missouri.
   We identify prominent (statistically significant) social variables that
   may have implications for policy making at these two levels. We also
   examine the composition and spatial distribution of social groups within
   each level. To do so, we link non-urban, statewide U.S. Census data with
   units of the Missouri Ecological Classification System. Results show
   that: (1) education trumps other social variables such as income and
   employment as the most prominent variable differentiating people by
   ecological section in Missouri; (2) housing and income also emerge as
   prominent partitioning variables for people across ecological sections;
   and (3) social groups tend to be more spatially fragmented in ecological
   subsections with low physiographic gradients. The findings suggest a
   variety of research questions for addressing regional policies relative
   to education and homestead tenure as well as the ecological effects of
   spatial distributions of people with different social attributes. The
   findings establish a broad socio-ecological context for natural resource
   studies at more magnified levels of ecological scale at which more
   specific hypotheses can be designed and tested. We discuss possible
   research questions and hypotheses underling each finding as well as
   management implications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   Second, approximately half of the customers saw a variation in which
   half of the revenue went to charity. At a standard fixed price, the
   charitable component only slightly increased demand, as similar studies
   have also found. However, when participants could pay what they wanted,
   the same charitable component created a treatment that was substantially

AB Background: This study was designed to evaluate the hypothesis that the
   prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) among children in the
   United States is positively associated with socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was implemented with data from the
   Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network, a multiple
   source surveillance system that incorporates data from educational and
   health care sources to determine the number of 8-year-old children with
   ASD among defined populations. For the years 2002 and 2004, there were
   3,680 children with ASD among a population of 557 689 8-year-old
   children. Area-level census SES indicators were used to compute ASD
   prevalence by SES tertiles of the population.
   Results: Prevalence increased with increasing SES in a dose-response
   manner, with prevalence ratios relative to medium SES of 0.70 (95%
   confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.76) for low SES, and of 1.25 (95% CI
   1.16, 1.35) for high SES, (P<0.001). Significant SES gradients were
   observed for children with and without a pre-existing ASD diagnosis, and
   in analyses stratified by gender, race/ethnicity, and surveillance data
   source. The SES gradient was significantly stronger in children with a
   pre-existing diagnosis than in those meeting criteria for ASD but with
   no previous record of an ASD diagnosis (p<0.001), and was not present in
   children with co-occurring ASD and intellectual disability.
   Conclusions: The stronger SES gradient in ASD prevalence in children
   with versus without a pre-existing ASD diagnosis points to potential
   ascertainment or diagnostic bias and to the possibility of SES disparity
   in access to services for children with autism. Further research is
   needed to confirm and understand the sources of this disparity so that
   policy implications can be drawn. Consideration should also be given to
   the possibility that there may be causal mechanisms or confounding
   factors associated with both high SES and vulnerability to ASD.

   properties affected past-month smoking at both time points via the flow
   of emotional support. We observed a feedback loop from personal network
   properties to emotional support and then to past-month smoking.
   Past-month smoking at time 1 fed back to positively affect in-degree

   ethnohistoric data for the 'Oro war cult, including its relationship to
   new temple styles in the Windward group constructed from worked rounded
   stones. Such temples are found in both inland and coastal contexts.
   Extant chronological data on Windward marae of the 'Oro style are
   synthesized. A new spatio-temporal case study of four 'Oro style temples
   from the 'Opunohu Valley, Mo'orea demonstrates considerable variability
   in temple morphology and chronology. This is linked to differences among
   socio-political maneuverings of high status lineage chiefs versus lower
   status lineage chiefs in the 'Opunohu Valley and perhaps to functional
   variation among the types of 'Oro style marae structures found in inland
   contexts. The new chronology suggests a rapid translocation of the 'Oro
   style war cult into the Windward group, somewhat earlier than previous
   archaeological work had suggested.

AB Subsistence harvesting and wild food production by Athabascan peoples is
   part of an integrated social-ecological system of interior Alaska. We
   describe effects of recent trends and future climate change projections
   on the boreal ecosystem of interior Alaska and relate changes in
   ecosystem services to Athabascan subsistence. We focus primarily on
   moose, a keystone terrestrial subsistence resource of villages in that
   region. Although recent climate change has affected the boreal forest,
   moose, and Athabascan moose harvesting, a high dependence by village
   households on moose persists. An historical account of 20th century
   socioeconomic changes demonstrates that the vulnerability of Athabascan
   subsistence systems to climatic change has in some respects increased
   while at the same time has improved aspects of village resilience. In
   the face of future climate and socioeconomic changes, communities have
   limited but potentially effective mitigation and adaptation
   opportunities. The extent to which residents can realize those
   opportunities depends on the responsiveness of formal and informal
   institutions to local needs. For example, increases in Alaska's urban
   population coupled with climate-induced habitat shifts may increase
   hunting conflicts in low-moose years. This problem could be mitigated
   through adaptive co-management strategies that project future moose
   densities and redirect urban hunters to areas of lower conflict.

   prospectively assessed the change in social support patterns before and
   after injury.
   Objective: To examine the preinjury and postinjury social support
   patterns among male and female collegiate athletes.
   Design: Prospective observational study.
   Setting: A Big Ten Conference university.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 256 National Collegiate
   Athletic Association Division I male and female collegiate athletes aged
   18 or older from 13 sports teams.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Injury incidence was identified using the
   Sports Injury Monitoring System. Social support was measured using the
   6-item Social Support Questionnaire. Data on preinjury and postinjury
   social support patterns were compared.
   Results: Male athletes reported more sources of social support than
   female athletes, whereas female athletes had greater satisfaction with
   the support they received. Athletes' social support patterns changed
   after they became injured. Injured athletes reported relying more on
   coaches (P = .003), athletic trainers (P < .0001), and physicians (P =
   .003) for social support after they became injured. Athletes also
   reported greater postinjury satisfaction with social support received
   from friends (P = .019), coaches (P = .001), athletic trainers (P <
   .0001), and physicians (P = .003).
   Conclusions: Our findings identify an urgent need to better define the

   scores. Results revealed that sex (F(1,2929) = 18.63, P = .001) and
   race/ethnicity (F(1,2925) = 6.76, P = .01) were indicators of cultural
   competence levels. However, we found no differences for years of
   experience (F(1,2932) = 2.34, P = .11) or NATA district (F(1,2895) =
   1.09, P = .36) and cultural competence levels.
   Conclusions: Our findings provide a baseline for level of cultural
   competence among ATs. Educators and employers can use these results to
   help develop diversity training education for ATs and athletic training
   students. The ATs can use their knowledge to provide culturally
   competent care to athletes and patients and promote a more holistic
   approach to sports medicine.

AB Hispanic Americans with HIV/AIDS experience lower quality care and worse
   outcomes than non-Hispanic whites. While deficits in patient-provider
   communication may contribute to these disparities, no studies to date
   have used audio recordings to examine the communication patterns of
   Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white patients with their health care
   providers.
   To explore differences in patient-provider communication for
   English-speaking, HIV-infected Hispanic and non-Hispanic white patients.
   Cross-sectional analysis.
   Two HIV care sites in the United States (New York and Portland)
   participating in the Enhancing Communication and HIV Outcomes (ECHO)
   study.
   Nineteen HIV providers and 113 of their patients.
   Patient interviews, provider questionnaires, and audio-recorded,
   routine, patient-provider encounters coded with the Roter Interaction
   Analysis System (RIAS).
   Providers were mostly non-Hispanic white (68%) and female (63%).
   Patients were Hispanic (51%), and non-Hispanic white (49%); 20% were
   female. Visits with Hispanic patients were less patient-centered (0.75
   vs. 0.90, p = 0.009), with less psychosocial talk (80 vs. 118
   statements, p < 0.001). This pattern was consistent among Hispanics who
   spoke English very well and those with less English proficiency. There
   was no association between patient race/ethnicity and visit length,
   patients' or providers' emotional tone, or the total number of patient
   or provider statements categorized as socioemotional, question-asking,
   information-giving, or patient activating. Hispanic patients gave higher
   ratings than whites (AOR 3.05 Hispanic vs. white highest rating of
   providers' interpersonal style, 95% CI 1.20-7.74).
   In this exploratory study, we found less psychosocial talk in
   patient-provider encounters with Hispanic compared to white patients.
   The fact that Hispanic patients rated their visits more positively than
   whites raises the possibility that these differences in patient-provider
   interactions may reflect differences in patient preferences and
   communication style rather than "deficits" in communication. If these
   findings are replicated in future studies, efforts should be undertaken
   to understand the reasons underlying them and their impact on the
   quality and equity of care.

AB Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis B-associated liver cancer is a major
   health disparity among Vietnamese Americans, who have a chronic
   hepatitis B prevalence rate of 7-14% and an incidence rate for liver
   cancer six times that of non-Latino whites.
   Describe factors associated with hepatitis B testing among Vietnamese
   Americans.
   A population-based telephone survey conducted in 2007-2008.
   Vietnamese Americans age 18-64 and living in the Northern California and
   Washington, DC areas (N = 1,704).
   Variables included self-reports of sociodemographics, health care
   factors, and hepatitis B-related behaviors, knowledge, beliefs, and
   communication with others. The main outcome variable was self-reported
   receipt of hepatitis B testing.
   The cooperation rate was 63.1% and the response rate was 27.4%. Only 62%
   of respondents reported having received a hepatitis B test and 26%,
   hepatitis B vaccination. Only 54% knew that hepatitis B could be
   transmitted by sexual intercourse. In multivariable analyses, factors
   negatively associated with testing included: age 30-49 years, US
   residence for > 10 years, less Vietnamese fluency, lower income, and
   believing that hepatitis B can be deadly. Factors positively associated
   with testing included: Northern California residence, having had
   hepatitis B vaccination, having discussed hepatitis B with
   family/friends, and employer requested testing. Physician recommendation
   of hepatitis B testing (OR 4.46, 95% CI 3.36, 5.93) and respondent's
   request for hepatitis B testing (OR 8.37, 95% CI 5.95, 11.78) were
   strongly associated with test receipt.
   Self-reports of hepatitis B testing among Vietnamese Americans remain
   unacceptably low. Physician recommendation and patient request were the
   factors most strongly associated with test receipt. A comprehensive
   effort is needed to promote hepatitis B testing in this population,
   including culturally-targeted community outreach, increased access to
   testing, and physician education.

AB Religiously affiliated hospitals provide nearly 20% of US beds, and many
   prohibit certain end-of-life and reproductive health treatments. Little
   is known about physician experiences in religious institutions.
   Assess primary care physicians' experiences and beliefs regarding
   conflict with religious hospital policies for patient care.
   Cross-sectional survey.
   General internists, family physicians, and general practitioners from
   the AMA Masterfile.
   In a questionnaire mailed in 2007, we asked physicians whether they had
   worked in a religiously affiliated hospital or practice, whether they
   had experienced conflict with the institution over religiously based
   patient care policies and how they believed physicians should respond to
   such conflicts. We used chi-square and multivariate logistic regression
   to examine associations between physicians' demographic and religious
   characteristics and their responses.
   Of 879 eligible physicians, 446 (51%) responded. In analyses adjusting
   for survey design, 43% had worked in a religiously affiliated
   institution. Among these, 19% had experienced conflict over religiously
   based policies. Most physicians (86%) believed when clinical judgment
   conflicts with religious hospital policy, physicians should refer
   patients to another institution. Compared with physicians ages 26-29
   years, older physicians were less likely to have experienced conflict
   with religiously based policies [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)
   compared with 30-34 years: 0.02 (0.00-0.11); 35-46 years: 0.07
   (0.01-0.72); 47-60 years: 0.02 (0.00-0.10)]. Compared with those who
   never attend religious services, those who do attend were less likely to
   have experienced conflict [attend once a month or less: odds ratio 0.06
   (0.01-0.29); attend twice a month or more: 0.22 (0.05-0.98)].
   Respondents with no religious affiliation were more likely than others
   to believe doctors should disregard religiously based policies that
   conflict with clinical judgment (13% vs. 3%; p = 0.005).
   Hospitals and policy-makers may need to balance the competing claims of
   physician autonomy and religiously based institutional policies.

AB Objective: This study focuses on the health, family, and social
   functioning of spouses of late-life remitted and continuing problem
   drinkers, and on predictors of spouses' alcohol-related functioning and
   depressive symptoms. Method: Three groups of spouses were compared at
   baseline and a 10-year follow-up: (a) spouses (n = 73) of older adults
   who had no drinking problems at baseline or followup, (b) spouses (n =
   25) of older adults who had drinking problems at baseline but not
   follow-up, and (c) spouses (n = 69) of older adults who had drinking
   problems at both baseline and follow-up. At each contact point, spouses
   completed an inventory that assessed their alcohol-related, health,
   family, and social functioning. Results: At baseline, compared with
   spouses of problem-free individuals, spouses of older adults whose
   drinking problems later remitted reported more alcohol consumption,
   poorer health, more depressive symptoms, and less involvement in
   domestic tasks and social and religious activities. At the 10-year
   follow-up, spouses of remitted problem drinkers were comparable to
   spouses of problem-free individuals, but spouses of continuing problem
   drinkers consumed more alcohol, incurred more alcohol-related
   consequences, and had friends who approved more of drinking. Overall,
   spouses whose friends approved more of drinking and whose partners
   consumed more alcohol and had drinking problems were likely to consume
   more alcohol and to have drinking problems themselves. Conclusions:
   Spouses of older adults whose late-life drinking problems remit can
   attain normal functioning; however, spouses of older adults with
   continuing late-life drinking problems experience some ongoing deficits.

AB Objective: The aims of this paper are as follows: to present past-year
   prevalence data for DSM-IV disorders in the early elementary school
   years; to examine the impact of impairment criteria on prevalence
   estimates; to examine the relation of sociodemographic and psychosocial
   risk factors to disorders; and to explore associations between
   "internalizing" and "externalizing" disorders and social competence and
   family burden as further validation of the impairing nature of these
   disorders. Method: As part of a longitudinal representative population
   study of children born healthy between July 1995 and September 1997 in
   the New Haven-Meriden Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area of the 1990
   Census (n = 1,329), parents of a subsample enriched for child
   psychopathology (n = 442; 77.6% response rate, 69.5% of eligible sample)
   were interviewed in the child's kindergarten or first-grade year with
   the Diagnostic interview Schedule for Children, Version IV (DISC-IV).
   Parents were surveyed about sociodemographic and psychosocial
   characteristics, and both parents and teachers were surveyed about
   social competence. Results: Approximately one in five (21.6%) children
   met criteria for psychiatric disorder(s) with impairment.
   Sociodemographic and psychosocial correlates included persistent poverty
   beginning in early childhood, limited parental education, low family
   expressiveness, stressful life events, and violence exposure. Finally,
   diagnostic status was significantly associated with poorer social
   competence and family burden. Conclusions: That approximately one in
   five children evidenced a psychiatric disorder with impairment during
   the transition to formal schooling highlights the importance of
   integrating psychiatric epidemiological and developmental approaches to
   inform conversations about school readiness and intervention planning.

AB Background: While disparities in abuse-related mortality between
   minority and white infants have been reported, the influence of
   socioeconomic status on outcome has not been evaluated. The goal of this
   study was to determine the impact of socioeconomic status and race on
   outcomes for abused infants using multiinstitutional data.
   Methods: Data on infants (<12 months old) with abusive injuries over a
   5-year period were obtained from nine U. S. pediatric trauma centers.
   Demographics, insurance status, Injury Severity Scores, Glasgow Coma
   Scale scores, median household income and outcomes were recorded.
   Logistic regression was used to evaluate the impact of race, income and
   insurance status on mortality.
   Results: There were 867 patients identified with a mortality of 8.8%.
   Patients without private insurance had a 3.8 times greater odds (give
   95% confidence interval) of dying. Those in the lower three quartiles of
   income also had a higher odds of death even after controlling for race,
   injury severity, and Glasgow Coma Scale. Although African American
   infants had a higher overall mortality than whites (11.2% vs. 7.8%, p =
   0.14), race was not an independent predictor of mortality (p = 0.98).
   Conclusions: There are significant differences in mortality among abused
   infants associated with insurance status and income even after
   controlling for injury severity. These associations show a need to
   better understand and address socioeconomic variations in outcome.

AB This article treats the meanings people associate with news outlets as
   important cultural resources that are used to construct and reinforce
   social realities. It focuses on US-based public broadcasting (PBS) and
   draws on a modified version of uses-and-gratifications theory to examine
   how people use news outlets and programs to establish confident social
   realities. People use PBS as a supplemental news provider and in ways
   that allow them to overcome the lack of trust they have towards the
   larger news media environment. As such, PBS's news and public affairs
   programming serves as a news safety-net in that it is used to 'capture'
   that which escapes the more porous commercialized news-net. The article
   concludes by considering how using PBS in such ways speaks towards
   symbolic and media powers, and related issues of control and social
   change.

AB OBJECTIVE: To characterize the prevalence of objections to assisted
   reproductive technologies among obstetrician-gynecologists.
   METHODS: We conducted a national probability sample mail survey of 1,800
   practicing U.S. ob-gyns. Criterion variables were whether physicians
   object to artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization. We also
   presented seven patient scenarios and asked respondents if they would
   discourage use of assisted reproductive technologies and if they would
   help patients access such technologies. Covariates included physician
   demographic and religious characteristics.
   RESULTS: Of 1,760 eligible ob-gyns, 1,154 responded (66%). Few (less
   than 5%) object to artificial insemination or in vitro fertilization,
   and even fewer (less than 3%) would not help patients access these
   technologies. However, the majority of ob-gyns would discourage using
   assisted reproductive technologies if pregnancy has a 25% mortality risk
   (95%), if the patient is 56 years old (88%), or if the patient has human
   immunodeficiency virus (73%). Fewer would discourage use of assisted
   reproductive technologies if the patient already has five healthy
   biological children (24%), if she plans to be a single parent (17%), if
   she is not married to her male sexual partner (14%), or if her sexual
   partner is female (14%). Male (odds ratio, 2.2-2.8) and religious
   physicians (3.6-4.7) were more likely to discourage using assisted
   reproductive technologies if the patient was lesbian, single, or
   unmarried.
   CONCLUSION: Few ob-gyns object to assisted reproductive technologies.
   Most discourage use of such technologies for patients with advanced age
   or medical comorbidities. Male and religious physicians are more likely
   to limit access for lesbian, single, or unmarried patients. (Obstet

AB Background: The quality and quantity of individuals' social
   relationships has been linked not only to mental health but also to both
   morbidity and mortality.
   Objectives: This meta-analytic review was conducted to determine the
   extent to which social relationships influence risk for mortality, which
   aspects of social relationships are most highly predictive, and which
   factors may moderate the risk.
   Data Extraction: Data were extracted on several participant
   characteristics, including cause of mortality, initial health status,
   and pre-existing health conditions, as well as on study characteristics,
   including length of follow-up and type of assessment of social
   relationships.
   Results: Across 148 studies (308,849 participants), the random effects
   weighted average effect size was OR = 1.50 (95% CI 1.42 to 1.59),
   indicating a 50% increased likelihood of survival for participants with
   stronger social relationships. This finding remained consistent across
   age, sex, initial health status, cause of death, and follow-up period.
   Significant differences were found across the type of social measurement
   evaluated (p<0.001); the association was strongest for complex measures
   of social integration (OR = 1.91; 95% CI 1.63 to 2.23) and lowest for
   binary indicators of residential status (living alone versus with
   others) (OR = 1.19; 95% CI 0.99 to 1.44).
   Conclusions: The influence of social relationships on risk for mortality
   is comparable with well-established risk factors for mortality.

AB Objective: Most Americans do not meet physical activity recommendations.
   Statewide campaigns can effectively increase activity levels. Reported
   herein are physical activity outcomes from Shape Up Rhode Island (SURI)
   2007, a statewide campaign to increase steps through team-based
   competition. Given the importance of social networks in behaviour
   change, this paper focused on the effects of team and team
   characteristics on activity outcomes.
   Method: For 16 weeks, 5333 adults comprising 652 teams wore pedometers
   and reported their steps online.
   Results. Participants' daily steps increased from 7029(3915) at baseline
   to 9393(5976) at SURI end (p<0.001). There was a significant intraclass
   correlation for step change among team members (ICC=0.09); thus, an
   individual's change in steps was influenced by what team they were on.
   Moreover, baseline team increases in acitivity for individual members
   (P<0.001), whereas being on a team with a broad range of steps was
   associated with smaller changes in activity for individual members
   (p=0.02).
   Conclusion: These findings are the first to suggest that team members
   influence indivdiual activity outcomes in team-based statewide
   campaigns. Future research should explore ways to use social network
   factors to enhance team-based physical activity programs. (C) 2010

AB Homelessness represents a context of extreme poverty and risk for child

   of risk in the context of homelessness. Levels of socioeconomic
   resource-related risk and negative lifetime events were examined with
   respect to morning cortisol levels and cortisol response to a set of
   cognitive tasks. Participants were 66 children between the ages of 4 and
   7 years staying in an emergency shelter for families. Adversities
   largely reflecting family level negative life events predicted higher

AB It has often been hypothesized that stress and its biological
   consequences mediate the relationship between low socioeconomic status
   (SES) or minority status and poor cardiovascular disease outcomes. The
   objective of this study was to determine if daily cortisol patterns, a
   biomarker of the stress response, differ by race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic status. Data were collected from 935 Black, White and
   Hispanic adults age 48-90 years old. Salivary cortisol samples were
   collected six times per day over 3 days: at awakening, 30 min later, at
   1000 h, noon, 1800 h and at bedtime. Blacks and Hispanics had lower
   levels of wake-up cortisol and less steep early declines, while Blacks
   had flatter and Hispanics steeper late day declines relative to Whites.
   Similarly the low socioeconomic status group also had lower levels of
   wake-up cortisol and less steep decline during the early part of the
   day. These patterns remained after adjustment for health behaviors and
   psychosocial factors. This study finds an association between salivary
   cortisol and race/ethnicity and SES in a multi-ethnic study population.
   Further work is needed to determine the health consequences of these
   differences. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Cryopreservation of gametes and embryos allows for children to be
   conceived after the death of their genetic parents through the process
   of posthumous assisted reproduction (PAR). Although the techniques are
   routine, the moral and ethical details are controversial and remain
   unsettled. Furthermore, there are numerous medicolegal implications that
   complicate matters. The principal parties to be considered are the
   decedent, the child who will be born of PAR, the significant other
   requesting the procedure, other living children, and even society at
   large. Numerous case studies exist and expert opinions have been
   published recognizing PAR as a vexing ethical issue. Most experts agree
   that explicit written consent forms signed at the time of
   cryopreservation are the best method to minimize some of the controversy
   involved with PAR.

AB Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory
   expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative
   experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and
   others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these
   opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a
   key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of
   an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We
   connect different strands of theory and research in the social
   psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between
   occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from
   the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are
   consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two
   opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to
   experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's
   macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.

   practices we term 'rural constituencies' when relations are bounded
   materially and 'constituencies of the rural' when they are bounded
   symbolically. We apply this framework to a critique of contemporary

AB Objective: The aim of this study was to identify the degree of burnout
   among resident physicians enrolled in seven postgraduate training
   programs at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center (TTUHSC), Paul
   L. Foster School of Medicine, El Paso, Texas, as it related to
   residents' age, gender, marital status, number of hours worked per week,
   primary language, race/ethnicity, and cultural background.
   Method: The Maslach Burnout Inventory Human Service Survey (MBI) was
   administered to measure the level of burnout according to the prevalence
   of emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and reduced
   personal accomplishment (PA).
   Results: Eighty-one percent of the residents at TTUHSC participated in
   the study. Residents raised in the United States or Canada comprised 28%
   and 35% of the study, and all reported English as their primary
   language. The EE scale was significant for obstetrics/gynecology
   (OB/GYN) residents (prevalence odds ratio [POR] = 13.55, P = 0.02) and
   psychiatry (PSY) residents (POR = 6.50, P = 0.03). Emergency medicine
   (EM) residents (POR = 23.35, P = 0.002), OB/GYN (POR = 10.89, P = 0.02),
   and general surgery (GS) (POR = 6.24, P = 0.03) residents had high DP.
   Internal medicine (IM) residents (primarily Spanish-speaking) reported
   significantly low EE (POR = 0.22, P = 0.03) and PA (POR = 0.09, P =
   0.001) scores. Residents from the United States or Canada who reported
   English as their primary language and noted their race as white, had
   high EE (POR = 3.06, P = 0.03; POR = 5.61, P = 0.0001; POR = 2.91, P =
   0.004), DP (POR = 3.19, P = 0.02; POR = 8.34, P <= 0.0001; POR = 4.70, P
   <= 0.0001) and PA (POR = 2.61, P = 0.02; POR = 2.35, P = 0.05, POR 0.29,
   P = 0.3) scores.
   Conclusion: Using valid measures, this pilot study identified a
   statistically significant relationship between burnout and residents'
   race/ethnicity, primary language, and cultural background. Larger
   studies with similar focus would be necessary to generalize these
   findings. At-risk residents in bilingual locations should be provided
   with cultural awareness workshops, language assistance programs, as well
   as senior resident and faculty mentors.

AB Quantitative and computer literacy are increasingly recognized as core
   components of a liberal education in sociology. This study draws on
   student, faculty, and alumni questionnaires to identify the kinds of
   quantitative literacy skills that are perceived to be most critical for
   students enrolled in sociology courses. Respondents at Lehman College
   highlighted the need for proficiencies in a number of key areas,
   including (a) basic mathematical and statistical skills, such as
   measures of central tendency, ratios, and percentages; (b) the
   presentation and interpretation of quantitative data, including tables
   and charts; (c) the research process, such as developing hypotheses,
   sampling, and interpreting data; and (d) computer-based presentation and
   data analysis, including the use of software programs such as SPSS and
   Excel. Moreover, hands-on work in data analysis was highly valued by all
   respondents, particularly as a strategy for mastering these skills. This
   study suggests that effective education in quantitative literacy
   requires both (a) the removal of barriers to the incorporation of data
   analysis in sociology courses and (b) a well-sequenced sociology
   curriculum that pinpoints specific quantitative and computer literacy
   learning objectives at multiple course levels.

AB Background: India experienced a rapid economic boom between 1991 and
   2007. However, this economic growth has not translated into improved
   nutritional status among young Indian children. Additionally, no study
   has assessed the trends in social disparities in childhood
   undernutrition in the Indian context. We examined the trends in social
   disparities in underweight and stunting among Indian children aged less
   than three years using nationally representative data.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the three cross-sectional rounds of
   National Family Health Survey of India from 1992, 1998 and 2005. The
   social factors of interest were: household wealth, maternal education,
   caste, and urban residence. Using multilevel modeling to account for the
   nested structure and clustering of data, we fit multivariable logistic
   regression models to quantify the association between the social factors
   and the binary outcome variables. The final models additionally included
   age, gender, birth order of child, religion, and age of mother. We
   analyzed the trend by testing for interaction of the social factor and
   survey year in a dataset pooled from all three surveys.
   Results: While the overall prevalence rates of undernutrition among
   Indian children less than three decreased over the 1992-2005 period,
   social disparities in undernutrition over these 14 years either widened
   or stayed the same. The absolute rates of undernutrition decreased for
   everyone regardless of their social status. The disparities by household
   wealth were greater than the disparities by maternal education. There
   were no disparities in undernutrition by caste, gender or rural
   residence.
   Conclusions: There was a steady decrease in the rates of stunting in the
   1992-2005 period, while the decline in underweight was greater between
   1992 and 1998 than between 1998 and 2005. Social disparities in
   childhood undernutrition in India either widened or stayed the same
   during a time of major economic growth. While the advantages of economic
   growth might be reaching everyone, children from better-off households,
   with better educated mothers appear to have benefited to a greater
   extent than less privileged children. The high rates of undernutrition
   (even among the socially advantaged groups) and the persistent social
   disparities need to be addressed in an urgent and comprehensive manner.

AB Background Although objective and subjective indicators of socioeconomic
   status (SES) are linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD), little is known
   about their relationship to endothelial dysfunction, which often
   precedes CVD.
   Purpose This study examined how objective and subjective SES relate to
   brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD).
   Methods FMD was assessed in 72 healthy adults (mean age 36 years). The
   MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status assessed perceived social
   standing in the USA (SSS-USA) and local community (SSS-Community).
   Objective SES measures included income and the Hollingshead Two-Factor
   Index of Social Position (education, occupation).
   Results Adjusted regressions revealed that SSS-Community positively
   correlated with FMD (p<0.05) and explained 8% of the variance. No other
   SES measures were significant for FMD. The association between FMD and
   SSS-Community remained significant (p<0.01) after adjustment for
   objective SES and other covariates.
   Conclusions Lower subjective social status in one's community may be
   linked to CVD via impaired vasodilation.

   understanding the mechanisms underlying emotional-interpersonal traits
   relevant to health, such as hostility. In this study, cigarette smokers
   with low (LH; n = 49) and high (HH; n = 43) trait hostility completed
   the Emotional Interference Gender Identification Task (EIGIT), a newly
   developed behavioral measure of socioaffective processing biases toward
   facial affect. The EIGIT involves quickly categorizing the gender of
   facial pictures that vary in affective valence (angry, happy, neutral,
   sad). Results showed that participants were slower and less accurate in
   categorizing the gender of angry faces in comparison to happy, neutral,
   and sad faces (which did not differ), signifying interference indicative
   of a socioaffective processing bias toward angry faces. Compared to LH
   individuals, HH participants exhibited diminished biases toward angry
   faces on error-based (but not speed-based) measures of emotional
   interference, suggesting impaired socioaffective processing. The EIGIT
   may be useful for future research on the role of socioaffective
   processing in traits linked with poor health.

AB Urban sociology, often and quite reasonably, emphasizes the effects of
   large-scale and corporate cultures of cities and yet, at the smaller
   scale, there is a diverse and complex set of practices that reinvigorate
   the urban landscape. By pairing ethnographic fieldnotes with interviews,
   this paper offers a limited rejoinder to these narratives, evincing the
   lived interactions of one set of characters that reenchants cities. For
   the purposes of this article, walking tour guides serve as examples of
   "urban alchemists," and three of their practices are advanced for
   discussion: their use of myths and revelatory stories to uproot banal
   visions of the city; their aim to incorporate chance and serendipity
   into their interactions; and their attempts to transform their
   participants into "better" urban dwellers.

AB Although nature in the form of "environment" has sometimes been part of
   sociological discussions of the city, it is typically treated as
   background, as a social construction, or as a metaphor for social
   processes. Less familiar is a view of nature as an active participant in
   a relationship of codetermination, an "actor" that constructs outcomes
   along with human beings in the communities that they inhabit. In this
   essay, I explore this more agentic reading of nature, bringing together
   insights from environmental and urban/community sociology. I explore
   four areas in which taken-for-granted boundaries between nature and city
   are shifting: ecological restoration projects, human-animal
   interactions, "postnatural" environments of toxic pollution, and
   simulated/artificial environments that substitute for nature. I suggest
   that urban sociology would benefit from a socioecological approach that
   enriches our understanding of nature and city and that allows us to
   participate more fully in discussions of sustainability.

AB Philosopher Gilles Deleuze emphasizes the primacy of desire over power
   and the openness and flux of social fields. In this article, we place
   our ethnographic projects among the urban poor in Brazil and
   Bosnia-Herzegovina in dialogue with Deleuze's cartographic approach to
   subjectivity and his reflections on control and the transformative
   potential of becoming. As people scavenge for resources and care, they
   must deal with the encroachment of psychiatric diagnostics and
   treatments in broken public institutions and in altered forms of common
   sense. By reading our cases in light of Deleuze's ideas, we uphold the
   rights of microanalysis, bringing into view the immanent fields that
   people, in all their ambiguity, invent and live by. Such fields of
   action and significance-leaking out on all sides-are mediated by power
   and knowledge, but they are also animated by claims to basic rights and
   desires. In making public a nuanced understanding of these fields-always
   at risk of disappearing-anthropologists still allow for larger
   structural and institutional processes to become visible and their true
   effect known. This fieldwork/philosophical dialogue highlights the
   limits of psychiatric models of symptoms and human agency and
   supplements applications of concepts such as biopolitics, structural
   violence, and social suffering in anthropology. Continually adjusting
   itself to the reality of contemporary lives and worlds, the
   anthropological venture has the potential of art: to invoke neglected
   human potentials and to expand the limits of understanding and
   imagination-a people yet to come.

AB Archaeological and historical reconstructions and interpretations of the
   origins and development of early state organizations and
   nomadic-sedentary relations have been viewed primarily from the
   perspective of sedentary farmers and urban centers. Implicit in such
   models are assumptions of asymmetric power relationships in which nomads
   are viewed as not only dependent on settled farmers but also
   encapsulated within the sphere of urban civilizations. This
   unidirectional view of political economy also derives from an
   overdependence on the skewed and biased ancient literature and some
   twentieth century ethnographic views of nomads in relation to powerful
   nation-states. This paper offers a series of alternative inferences that
   are based on well-known archaeological data, as well as a few recent
   lines of evidence, and a review of relevant archaeological evidence for
   the existence of social hierarchy and stratification in prehistoric
   pastoral nomadism in southwestern Iran. In addition, we discuss how
   vertical mobile pastoralism in the region could have developed
   independent of settled farmers and how the events that developed in
   highland Iran resulted in the peculiar characters and features of what
   we know as Elamite civilization.

AB Self-knowledge is a Muslim psychological ideal, but social theory
   suggests that the dynamics of narcissism and self-esteem may challenge
   the stability of Muslim society. In Iranian university students, an
   Integrative Self-Knowledge Scale displayed relationships with
   narcissism, self-esteem, and empathy that reflected relative mental
   health; and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory included factors that
   pointed toward adjustment as well as maladjustment. Evidence that
   narcissism predicted positive forms of self-functioning was more obvious
   in men than in women. Outcomes further confirmed that self-knowledge is
   as an adaptive process in Iran and that narcissism and self-esteem may
   have noteworthy implications for understanding Muslim society.

AB Background: Studies showing that adolescents are more likely to smoke if
   they have friends who smoke typically infer that this is the result of
   peer influence. However, it may also be due to adolescents choosing
   friends who have smoking behaviors similar to their own (i.e.,
   selection). One of the most influential studies of influence and
   selection effects on smoking concluded that these processes contribute
   about equally to peer group homogeneity in adolescent smoking (Ennett
   and Bauman, 1994). The goal of this study was to conduct a partial
   replication of these findings.
   Methods: Data are from 1223 participants in the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health. Spectral decomposition techniques identified
   friendship cliques, which were then used as the unit of analysis to
   examine influence and selection effects over a one-year period.
   Results: Non-smokers were more likely to become smokers if they
   initially belonged to a smoking (vs. non-smoking) group, and smokers
   were more likely to become non-smokers if they initially belonged to a
   non-smoking (vs. smoking) group, indicating an influence effect on both
   initiation and cessation. Further, group members who changed groups
   between waves were more likely to select groups with smoking behavior
   congruent to their own, providing evidence of a selection effect.
   Conclusions: While our results generally replicate the group analyses
   reported by Ennett and Bauman (1994), they suggest that peer influence
   and selection effects on adolescent smoking may be much weaker than
   assumed based on this earlier research. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Background: According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and
   Health, 4.6% of American women reported use of an illicit drug during
   pregnancy. Previous studies on illicit drug use during pregnancy and
   perinatal outcomes allowed inconsistent results.
   Methods: This population-based study included mothers who delivered
   live-born infants without birth defects between 1997 and 2004 and
   completed interviews for the National Birth Defects Prevention Study
   (response rate 69%; n=5871). Prevalence of self-reported illicit drug
   use (specifically cannabis, cocaine, and stimulants) during pregnancy
   and its associations with demographic and social factors were assessed.
   We used multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses to study
   the associations of cannabis use with birth weight and gestational age.
   Results: The prevalence of reported illicit drug use during pregnancy
   was 3.6% (standard error 0.24). Pregnant users of cannabis, cocaine, and
   stimulants were younger, had a lower level of education and lower
   household income, and were less likely to have used folic acid in the
   periconceptional period than nonusers. Illicit drug users were also more
   likely to have used alcohol and tobacco. After adjustment for
   confounding, cannabis use was not associated with mean birth weight or
   gestational age or with low birth weight or preterm delivery.
   Conclusion: Women who report use of illicit drugs during pregnancy
   differ in demographic and socioeconomic background from nonusers.
   Reported cannabis use does not seem to be associated with low birth
   weight or preterm birth. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB Previous cross-cultural comparisons of correlations between positive and

   to feel dialectical emotions. However, not much is known about the
   co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions in a given situation.
   When asked to describe situations in which they felt mixed emotions,
   Japanese and American respondents listed mostly similar situations. By
   presenting these situations to another group of respondents, we found
   that Japanese reported more mixed emotions than Americans in the
   predominantly pleasant situations, whereas there were no cultural
   differences in mixed emotions in the predominantly unpleasant situations
   or the mixed situations. The appraisal of self-agency mediated cultural
   differences in mixed emotions in the predominantly pleasant situations.
   Study 2 replicated the findings by asking participants to recall how
   they felt in their past pleasant, unpleasant, and mixed situations. The
   findings suggest that both Americans and Japanese feel mixed emotions,
   but the kinds of situation in which they typically do so depends on
   culture.

AB Researchers have identified the association between the use of cocaine
   and sexual behavior as an important risk factor for HIV infection and
   have attempted to elucidate the nature of this association. Several
   lines of research have suggested that facilitation of sexual behavior
   during intoxication with cocaine may be because of the direct
   pharmacological effects of the drug (e.g., increase in sexual desire),
   whereas others have pointed to the importance of factors related to the
   context of drug use (e.g., opportunities for sexual behavior,
   expectations about the effects of the drug, social norms). The present
   study explored the perceived effects of cocaine and heroin on sexual
   behavior, as well as the social context of drug use as a function of
   drug type (cocaine vs. heroin), among 46 inner-city drug users who
   reported a history of regular use of both crack cocaine and heroin.
   Results indicated that compared to heroin, cocaine had deleterious
   effects on participants' perceived sexual desire and performance.
   Despite such deleterious effects on sexual behavior, cocaine was more
   frequently used with an intimate partner than heroin. Furthermore,
   participants did not differ in the extent to which they used the two
   drugs in other social contexts (e.g., with friends, family, or
   neighbors). These preliminary results suggest that the relationship
   between cocaine and sexual behavior, especially among long-term cocaine
   users, may be facilitated by opportunities for sex that exist in the
   context of cocaine use, rather than by the pharmacological effects of
   the drug.

AB Recent studies in West Africa and other parts of the world suggest that
   globalization and modernization make extended forms of domestic
   organization untenable in the face of modern economic and ecological
   circumstances. Unlike the large and extended domestic groups of
   pre-industrial and pre-colonial periods, households today tend to be
   small and nuclear. Thirty years ago, a series of case studies conducted
   on the Central Plateau of Burkina Faso documented this nucleation
   process among Mossi rural communities and predicted the decline and
   demise of Mossi extended households. This article tests the degree to
   which these predictions were correct based on ethnographic fieldwork in
   three villages in 2004. The results indicate that extended households
   indeed persist. Their persistence is explained by analyzing the roles of
   environmental and social change on the twin processes of household
   extension and fragmentation. Regional desiccation, off-farm
   income-generating opportunities, and agricultural intensification have
   created conditions that equally promote both household extension and
   fragmentation.

   and environmental institutions on foreign investment location in
   less-developed countries. Results from static score design panel OLS
   models of 52 countries provide mixed results. Less-developed countries
   with higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross

   less-developed countries with environmental ministries attract lower
   levels of foreign investment. Other independent variables-including
   sulfur dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, environmental treaty

AB Obesity and depression are two diseases of major public health
   importance. While both correlate with each other, potential pathways
   involving depression that would link socioeconomic status (SES) to
   lifestyle factors and obesity have not been systematically examined
   using nationally representative data. Using rich data on 2217 US young
   adults aged 20-39 years from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition
   Surveys (NHANES) and multivariate linear and logistic regression models,
   we examined associations between major depressive disorder (MDD),
   dietary intake, physical activity (PA), and measured body mass index
   (BMI) controlling for socio-demographic factors. Further, structural
   equation models (SEM) were fit to test pathway explaining SES
   disparities in BMI through MOD and lifestyle factors. Recent prevalence
   of MDD was lower among young US men than women (6.4% vs. 9.2%) although
   their prevalence of obesity was similar (21.2% vs. 22.7%). Among women,
   MDD was associated with higher BMI and inversely associated with PA, but
   not among men. MDD was specifically associated with increased risk of
   morbid obesity (BMI >= 40) among women (OR: 2.88 (1.32, 6.30)). Using
   SEM, a main pathway linking SES to BMI among women was linking SES ->
   food insecurity -> MDD -> PA -> BMI. A main pathway linking MDD to BMI
   in both genders was going through PA rather than overall dietary
   quality. Gender and ethnic differences existed underlying how MDD. SES
   and lifestyle factors were associated with adiposity. Future prospective
   studies are needed to examine potential mechanisms using physiological
   markers of depression, lifestyle and obesity. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB An individually costly act that benefits all group members is a public
   good. Natural selection favours individual contribution to public goods
   only when some benefit to the individual offsets the cost of
   contribution. Problems of sex ratio, parasite virulence, microbial
   metabolism, punishment of noncooperators, and nearly all aspects of
   sociality have been analysed as public goods shaped by kin and group
   selection. Here, I develop two general aspects of the public goods
   problem that have received relatively little attention. First, variation
   in individual resources favours selfish individuals to vary their
   allocation to public goods. Those individuals better endowed contribute
   their excess resources to public benefit, whereas those individuals with
   fewer resources contribute less to the public good. Thus, purely selfish
   behaviour causes individuals to stratify into upper classes that
   contribute greatly to public benefit and social cohesion and to lower
   classes that contribute little to the public good. Second, if group
   success absolutely requires production of the public good, then the
   pressure favouring production is relatively high. By contrast, if group
   success depends weakly on the public good, then the pressure favouring
   production is relatively weak. Stated in this way, it is obvious that
   the role of baseline success is important. However, discussions of
   public goods problems sometimes fail to emphasize this point
   sufficiently. The models here suggest simple tests for the roles of
   resource variation and baseline success. Given the widespread importance
   of public goods, better models and tests would greatly deepen our
   understanding of many processes in biology and sociality.

AB Adolescents have poor dietary behaviors and high overweight prevalence.
   Economic contextual factors such as food prices and food store and
   restaurant availability are hypothesized and increasingly being explored
   empirically as contributors to the obesity epidemic. Evidence showed
   that healthful compared with less healthful foods increasingly cost more
   and that fast food restaurants are increasingly available. In addition,
   racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic disparities have been documented in
   access to food outlets, particularly chain supermarkets, and such
   disparities have been shown to be increasing recently. Empirical
   evidence based on nationally representative U.S. adolescent data
   revealed that lower fruit and vegetable prices, higher fast food prices,
   and greater supermarket availability were related to higher fruit and
   vegetable consumption and lower BM I, in particular for BMI among teens
   who are overweight or at risk for overweight and who are low-to
   middle-socioeconomic status. The availability of fast food restaurants
   was not associated with youth BMI. Overall, this research implies that
   pricing interventions of taxes on energy-dense foods such as fast food
   and/or subsidies to healthful foods such as fruits and vegetables and
   policy efforts to improve access to supermarkets may help to improve
   adolescent weight outcomes. J. Nutr. 140: 1175S-1180S, 2010.

   education and zip code-based annual household income (Z-AHI)] and

   with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
   Methods. Data on 211 subjects from a cross-sectional study (LupusPRO
   (c)) using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 questionnaire to
   evaluate physical health scores (PCS) and mental health scores were used
   to obtain education and zip code. The 2000 US Census was used to obtain
   each zip code's median annual household income.
   Results. Education and Z-AHI correlated with PCS (education standardized
   beta = 0.17, 95% CI 0.47, 3.65, p = 0.01 r(2) = 0.03; Z-AHI standardized
   beta = 0.15, 95% CI 0.57, 8.30, p = 0.02, r(2) = 0.02) on regression
   analysis. Z-AHI was linked to PCS, independent of education. Ethnicity
   was associated with PCS through disease activity and SES.
   Conclusion. SES is associated with HRQOL in SLE. and education are
   equally predictive surrogates of SES; however, Z-AHI, independent of
   education, was predictive of HRQOL. Z-AHI has less subject bias and is
   easily obtainable, therefore its use for future HRQOL studies is
   suggested. (First Release April 1 2010; J Rheumatol 2010;37:1150-7;

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal was to examine racial/ethnic and language
   disparities in family-centered care (FCC) and in FCC components for
   children with special health care needs (CSHCN).
   METHODS: Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of data
   from the 2005-2006 National Survey of CSHCN were performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 66% of CSHCN with a health visit in the past year
   received FCC. In adjusted analyses, we found lower odds of FCC for
   Latino (odds ratio: 0.53 [95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.63]),
   African-American (odds ratio: 0.60 [95% confidence interval:
   0.52-0.69]), and other (odds ratio: 0.58 [95% confidence interval:
   0.43-0.78]) children, compared with white children, and for children in
   households with a non-English primary language (odds ratio: 0.48 [95%
   confidence interval: 0.36-0.64]), compared with those in households with
   English as the primary language. These disparities persisted after
   adjustment for child health (condition severity and emotional,
   behavioral, and developmental needs), socioeconomic (poverty level,
   parental education, household composition, and residing in a
   metropolitan statistical area), and access (insurance type, usual source
   of care, and having a personal physician) factors. Of these factors,
   only condition severity was significantly associated with the
   racial/ethnic disparities; none was significantly associated with the
   language disparities. Disparities were found for Latino and
   African-American children and children in households with a non-English
   primary language for the FCC components of time spent with the provider
   and sensitivity to the family's values and customs.
   CONCLUSIONS: Robust FCC racial/ethnic and language disparities exist for
   CSHCN; initial efforts to address these disparities should focus on
   increasing provider time and cultural sensitivity. Pediatrics 2010; 125:

AB Background:
   The aim of the present study was to test the notion that Brazilian
   children entering private school have a motor function advantage over
   those entering their first year in public school.
   Methods:
   Four hundred and two children from the two cultural settings were
   examined for motor function in the first and 10th month of school (first
   grade). Participants were assessed based on age-level standards and by
   total score for all items for children 3 to 7 years of age.
   Results:
   The private school group outperformed their public setting peers on the
   first and second assessment; both groups improved over the school year.
   The most interesting outcome was the type of motor task that most
   clearly differentiated the groups: activities requiring gross motor
   (interlimb) coordination.
   Conclusion:
   Among the recommendations given, it is suggested that motor skill
   activities, especially those involving interlimb coordination, be
   included with any type of motor programming for young children.

AB Sociology has long identified place as an important theoretical
   category, and a basic element of social life, but the discipline has
   largely left implicit the role of place as a structuring element of
   social perception. We reinterpret two debates in cultural sociology
   cosmopolitan omnivorism and cultural reception to show how place has
   been used as a static category, not a productive source of meanings, in
   these fields. We then introduce how scholars can further develop an
   analysis of place meanings, and apply this fresh perspective to our
   empirical study, a discourse analysis of elite music critics' taste for
   rap music. We find that critics base their judgments of the genre on
   three place-based criteria, that: (1) rap must be "emplaced" to be
   meaningful, (2) "ghettoes" are central to rap's meaningfulness and (3)
   international scenes are privileged as politically and aesthetically
   more important than American scenes. These data suggest that the
   omnivorous taste pattern among American elites follows an intra-genre
   logic of appropriation that incorporates or rejects cultural objects
   influenced by the meanings associated with their context of production.
   We conclude by highlighting the analytic benefit of recognizing place as
   a constituent element of social perception in cultural sociology. (C)

AB Psychological well-being (WB) includes a person's overall appraisal of
   his or her life (Global WB) and affective state (Hedonic WB), and it is
   considered a key aspect of the health of individuals and groups. Several
   cross-sectional studies have documented a relation between Global WB and
   age. Little is known, however, about the age distribution of Hedonic WB.
   It may yield a different view of aging because it is less influenced by
   the cognitive reconstruction inherent in Global WB measures and because
   it includes both positive and negative components of WB. In this study
   we report on both Global and Hedonic WB assessed in a 2008 telephone
   survey of 340,847 people in the United States. Consistent with prior
   studies, Global WB and positive Hedonic WB generally had U-shaped age
   profiles showing increased WB after the age of 50 years. However,
   negative Hedonic WB variables showed distinctly different and stronger
   patterns: Stress and Anger steeply declined from the early 20s, Worry
   was elevated through middle age and then declined, and Sadness was
   essentially. at. Unlike a prior study, men and women had very similar
   age profiles of WB. Several measures that could plausibly covary with
   the age-WB association (e.g., having children at home) did not alter the
   age-WB patterns. Global and Hedonic WB measures appear to index
   different aspects of WB over the lifespan, and the postmidlife increase
   in WB, especially in Hedonic WB, deserves continued exploration.

   within the common culture is described, after which a number of
   sociobiologically related studies are presented to illustrate how its
   component dimensions can be defined. These are evolutionary adaptation,
   affectional ties, subjective experiences, and positive psychology. The
   relevance of spiritually related issues in psychiatric diagnosis are
   illustrated, along with examples of their role in symptom relief. The
   paper concludes with a description of a program implemented to integrate
   the issue of spirituality into resident training and into group support

AB Sensuous scholarship refers to research about the human senses, through
   the senses, and for the senses. Sensuous scholarship asks us to
   recognize the meaningfulness of our somatic experience of the world, to
   understand the skilful activities through which we actively make and
   remake the world through our senses, and to develop evocative strategies
   of representation to write sensuously. In this article, the authors
   reflect on one particular genre of sensuous scholarship, which they
   refer to as the somatic layered account. The authors draw upon
   participant observation data collected at wine festivals at seven sites
   scattered across western British Columbia and Southern California. The
   authors examine how people express taste sensations and preferences to
   others, as well as what role wine's material properties play in these
   social dramas. In formulating and developing the concepts of somatic
   accounts, taste vocabularies, and somatic joint acts, the authors
   contribute to a growing understanding of the social aspects of the
   senses and of sensations, as well as how people perceive the material
   world-and the sense of taste in particular-in active and reflexive ways.

   1972-1976, we construct a measure of research specialization and add it
   to a traditional attainment model that includes productivity,

AB P>How people respond to questions involving the environment depends
   partly on individual characteristics. Characteristics such as age,
   gender, education, and ideology constitute the well-studied "social
   bases of environmental concern," which have been explained in terms of
   cohort effects or of cognitive and cultural factors related to social
   position. It seems likely that people's environmental views depend not
   only on personal characteristics but also on their social and physical
   environments. This hypothesis has been more difficult to test, however.
   Using data from surveys in 19 rural U.S. counties, we apply
   mixed-effects modeling to investigate simple place effects with respect
   to locally focused environmental views. We find evidence for two kinds
   of place effects. Net of individual characteristics, specific place
   characteristics have the expected effect on related environmental views.
   Local changes are related to attitudes about regulation and growth. For
   example, respondents more often perceive rapid development as a problem,
   and favor environmental rules that restrict development, in rural
   counties with growing populations. Moreover, they favor conserving
   resources for the future rather than using them now to create jobs in
   counties that have low unemployment. After we controlled for county
   growth, unemployment and jobs in resource-based industries, and
   individual social-position and ideological factors, there remains
   significant place-to-place variation in mean levels of environmental
   concern. Even with both kinds of place effects in the models, the
   individual-level predictors of environmental concern follow patterns
   expected from previous research. Concern increases with education among
   Democrats, whereas among Republicans, the relationship is attenuated or
   reversed. The interaction marks reframing of environmental questions as
   political wedge issues, through nominally scientific counterarguments
   aimed at educated, ideologically receptive audiences.

AB A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental
   health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a
   number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women
   have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively
   experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from
   the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and
   persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and
   (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are
   involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data
   from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two
   hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent
   anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss
   the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of
   social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between
   them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future
   theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.

   religious giving as social action whereby individuals direct their

   data from the American Congregational Giving Survey and the Social
   Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a
   rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from
   the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce
   mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of
   religiosity have a strong impact on giving.

AB Most sociological research assumes that social network composition
   shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not
   adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect
   network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of
   culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this
   article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in
   network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the
   influence of other structural factors, including prior network
   composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little
   evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping
   worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play
   an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the
   dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be
   reconsidered.

AB In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some
   members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to
   save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely
   together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors-killing
   on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such
   cases-where the same individuals kill and rescue-and discusses their
   relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and
   individualistic theories of killing and rescuing-which explain these
   behaviors with the properties of groups or persons-are inadequate in
   accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995,
   2000)strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell,
   2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals
   during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different
   structures-killing where there is social distance and rescuing where
   there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory
   behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close.
   One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory
   power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme
   variations in individual behavior.

AB There is rarely an introductory text in sociology that does not begin
   with C. Wright Mills's (1967)distinction between personal troubles and
   structural or public issues. To lack sociological imagination is to
   confuse between these two levels of analysis in trying to explain public
   issues in terms of personal troubles, or history in terms of the
   individual's biography. "Troubles occur within the character of the
   individual and within the range of his immediate relations with others;
   Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments
   of the individual and the range of his inner life" (Mills, 1967:8).
   Issues are generated in response to the dynamics of the social system
   and unfold within the larger structural and historical contexts where
   the character of the individual takes shape. Yet, the most popular
   explanation of the contemporary financial crisis with its disastrous
   social and economic consequences is personal greed. It is the greedy
   investment bankers, corrupt politicians, and unscrupulous lobbyists who
   are to take the brunt of the current economic meltdown in the United
   States. A few bad apples on Wall Street have created havoc on Main
   Street. Here, one may argue that greed that-if not kept in check-which
   seems to afflict almost everyone, transcending social class and status
   boundaries, may be a public issue-a structural problem-rather than a
   problem within the character of the individual. Not to be greedy within
   the contemporary social and economic system may be considered
   pathological, an instance of personal trouble.

AB Despite increasing interest in gendered sexuality over the life course,
   a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual
   life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology,
   feminist theory, and sexuality studies, has yet to be elaborated. The
   model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result
   from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and
   disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts,
   within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive
   sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences
   and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine.
   Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de)
   coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps
   explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among
   individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying
   lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests
   improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models,
   and the sexual scripting approach.

AB This article treats the public display of emotion as social performance.
   The concept of "emotive performance" is developed to highlight the
   overlooked quality of performativity in the social use of emotion. We
   argue that emotive performance is reflexive, cultural, and
   communicative. As an active social act, emotive performance draws from
   the cultural repertoire of interpretative frameworks and dominant
   narratives. We illustrate the utility of the concept by analyzing two
   episodes of unrehearsed emotive performances by two well-known
   politicians, Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin. The two cases demonstrate how
   emotion can be analyzed as a domain in which culturally specific
   narratives and rhetorics are used to advance the situational agenda of
   actors. The concept opens up a more expansive research agenda for
   sociology. It pushes sociologists to pay greater attention to people's

   recognizes the relevance of religious ideas and intuitions in informing
   civic discourse and contributing to remedying the social pathologies of
   modernity. This paper welcomes Habermas's recent religious turn, but it
   also underscores some of the challenges and limits religion poses to its
   civic accommodation. The active tolerance of, and reflexive engagement
   with religion required of post-secular society unearths several tensions
   in how religion itself is understood and practiced, and in how western
   societies deal with religious and cultural Otherness. Moreover, while
   the state may appear as a neutral actor mediating religious-based civic
   disputes, it too is encrusted with culturally particular understandings

AB Background Patient reporting of the severity and impact of symptoms is
   an essential component of cancer symptom management and cancer treatment
   clinical trials. In multinational clinical trials, cultural and
   linguistic variations in patient-reported outcomes instruments could
   confound the interpretation of study results.
   Methods The severity and interference of multiple symptoms in 1433
   cancer patients with mixed diagnoses and treatment status from the
   United States, China, Japan, Russia, and Korea were measured with
   psychometrically validated language versions of the M. D. Anderson
   Symptom Inventory (MDASI). Mixed-effect ordinal probit regression models
   were fitted to the pooled data to compare the magnitude of the effect of
   "country" (nation and linguistic factors) with between-subjects effects
   on symptom reporting, adjusted for patient and clinical factors (age,
   sex, performance status, and chemotherapy status).
   Results For the pooled sample, fatigue, disturbed sleep, distress, pain,
   and lack of appetite were the most severe patient-reported MDASI
   symptoms. The magnitude of the variance of the country random effects
   was only one-fourth to one-half of the interpatient variation (sigma(2)
   = 0.23-0.46) for all symptoms, except nausea and vomiting.
   Conclusions Cultural and linguistic variations in symptom reporting
   among the five language versions of the validated MDASI were limited.
   Ordinal probit modeling provided a simple mechanism for accounting for
   cultural and linguistic differences in patient populations. The
   equivalence among MDASI translations in this study suggests that symptom
   ratings collected from various cultural and language groups using the
   MDASI can be interpreted in a similar way in oncology practice, clinical
   trials, and clinical research.

AB Blank-slate theories of human intelligence propose that reasoning is
   carried out by general-purpose operations applied uniformly across
   contents. An evolutionary approach implies a radically different model
   of human intelligence. The task demands of different adaptive problems
   select for functionally specialized problem-solving strategies,
   unleashing massive increases in problem-solving power for ancestrally
   recurrent adaptive problems. Because exchange can evolve only if
   cooperators can detect cheaters, we hypothesized that the human mind
   would be equipped with a neurocognitive system specialized for reasoning
   about social exchange. Whereas humans perform poorly when asked to
   detect violations of most conditional rules, we predicted and found a
   dramatic spike in performance when the rule specifies an exchange and
   violations correspond to cheating. According to critics, people's
   uncanny accuracy at detecting violations of social exchange rules does
   not reflect a cheater detection mechanism, but extends instead to all
   rules regulating when actions are permitted (deontic conditionals). Here
   we report experimental tests that falsify these theories by
   demonstrating that deontic rules as a class do not elicit the search for
   violations. We show that the cheater detection system functions with
   pinpoint accuracy, searching for violations of social exchange rules
   only when these are likely to reveal the presence of some one who
   intends to cheat. It does not search for violations of social exchange
   rules when these are accidental, when they do not benefit the violator,
   or when the situation would make cheating difficult.

AB In Africa, research concerning the social determinants of poor
   nutritional status has typically focused on children under 5 years of
   age and has used defined categorical boundaries based on international
   reference standards. In this article, stunting and wasting of 1,157
   Malian adolescent girls is measured through both categorical and
   continuous data. The focus on adolescent girls is significant because
   there is relatively little literature examining this group, and because
   adolescence marks the time when girls gain greater workload
   responsibilities, autonomy of food choices, and, as a result of the
   adolescent growth spurt, require the greatest amount of caloric intake
   respective to their weight since infancy. To differentiate stunting and
   wasting causes, a number of socioeconomic, geographic, and demographic
   factors are explored. The findings suggest that continuous data provides
   a basis for modeling stunting and wasting superior to utilizing
   international reference categories. Estimations show that decreasing
   age, the presence of servants, a greater number of wives in a compound,
   and residence in a large urban area correlate with improved nutritional
   status while wealthier families appear to correlate with greater
   stunting and wasting, and no correlation exists with estimated energy
   expenditure. Future studies should incorporate continuous data, and the
   need exists for greater analysis of social determinants of growth
   indicators among adolescent females. Further, these findings have
   significant implications in the development of nutrition intervention
   programs aimed at the vulnerable population in Mali, leading us to
   conclude that factors beyond socioeconomic indicators such as household
   structure and location should be more fully examined. Am. J. Hum. Biol.

AB BACKGROUND
   Social support is an important determinant of health, yet understanding
   of its contribution to racial disparities in hypertension is limited.
   Many studies have focused on the relationship between hypertension and
   social support, or race/ethnicity and social support, but few have
   examined the inter-relationship between race/ethnicity, social support,
   and hypertension. The objective of this study was to determine whether
   the relationship between race/ethnicity and hypertension varied by level
   of social support.
   METHODS
   Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
   2001-2006 were used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) for the
   association between hypertension and race/ethnicity by levels of social
   support. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP)>= 140
   mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >= 90 mm Hg or having been prescribed
   antihypertensive medication. Social support was defined by emotional and
   financial support, and marital status.
   RESULTS
   Black/white ORs of hypertension increased as social support decreased;
   that is, the race difference among those without social support was
   larger compared to those with social support. Contrarily, Mexican
   American/white ethnic differences were only observed among those with
   social support; Mexican Americans with social support had lower odds of
   hypertension than their white counterparts.
   CONCLUSIONS
   This study observed that the relationship between race (but not
   ethnicity) and hypertension varies by social support level. Results
   suggest there may be beneficial effects of social support on
   hypertension among blacks, however, the possible impact of social
   support on ethnic differences in hypertension remains unclear.

AB Background: Low SES has been shown to be linked to poorer-quality diets,
   decreased consumption of fresh produce, and an increased reliance on
   small retail stores.
   Purpose: The objective of this research was to determine if there is a
   difference in the microbial quality and potential safety of food
   available to low-SES versus high-SES populations at the retail level.
   Methods: Aerobic plate count (APC); yeast and mold counts (Y & M); and
   total coliforms were determined in ready-to-eat (RTE) greens, precut
   watermelon, broccoli, strawberries, cucumbers, milk, and orange juice
   and compared among products purchased in stores in low- versus those
   purchased in high-SES neighborhoods between June 2005 and September
   2006. APC, fecal coliforms, and E. coli in ground beef and the presence
   of Salmonella and Campylobacter in chicken were also compared.
   Results: Results showed higher microbial loads on produce from markets
   in low-SES areas. Significant differences observed included (1) APC and
   Y&M in RTE greens, (2) APC and Y&M in strawberries, and (3) YMCs in
   cucumbers. No difference was detected in the level of pathogens in raw
   meat and poultry; however, the APC in ground beef available in high-SES
   markets was significantly higher compared with that found in low-SES
   markets.
   Conclusions: The results presented here indicate that populations of low
   SES may be more likely to experience produce of poorer microbial
   quality, which may have an impact on both the appeal and potential
   safety of the produce. (Am J Prey Med 2010;38(5):478-481) (C) 2010

AB Background: A human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine was approved by the
   Food and Drug Administration for use among women/girls in 2006. Since
   that time, limited research has examined HPV vaccine uptake among
   adolescent girls and no studies have examined the role of geographic
   disparities in HPV vaccination.
   Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine geographic disparity in
   the prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and to examine
   individual-, county-, and state-level correlates of vaccination.
   Methods: Three-level random intercept multilevel logistic regression
   models were fitted to data from girls aged 13-17 years living in six
   U.S. states using data from the 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System (BRFSS) and the 2000 U.S. census.
   Results: Data from 1709 girls nested within 274 counties and six states
   were included. Girls were predominantly white (70.6%) and insured
   (74.5%). Overall, 34.4% of girls were vaccinated. Significant geographic
   disparity across states (variance =0.134, SE=0.065) and counties
   (variance=0.146, SE=0.063) was present, which was partially explained by
   state and county poverty levels. Independent of individual-level
   factors, poverty had differing effects at the state and county level:
   girls in states with higher levels of poverty were less likely whereas
   girls in counties with higher poverty levels were more likely to be
   vaccinated. Household income demonstrated a similar pattern to that of
   county-level poverty: Compared to girls in the highest-income families,
   girls in the lowest-income families were more likely to be vaccinated.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest geographic disparity in
   HPV vaccination. Although higher state-level poverty is associated with
   a lower likelihood of vaccination, higher county-level poverty and lower
   income at the family level is associated with a higher likelihood of
   vaccination. Research is needed to better understand these disparities
   and to inform interventions to increase vaccination among all eligible
   girls. (Am J Prey Med 2010;38(5):525-533) (C) 2010 American Journal of

AB Scholars frequently argue whether the sharp rise in chief executive
   officer (CEO) pay in recent years is "efficient" or is a consequence of
   "rent extraction" because of the failure of corporate governance in
   individual firms. This article argues that governance failure must be
   conceptualized at the market rather than the firm level because
   excessive pay increases for even relatively few CEOs a year spread to
   other firms through the cognitively and rhetorically constructed
   compensation networks of "peer groups," which are used in the
   benchmarking process to negotiate the compensation of CEOs.
   Counterfactual simulation based on Standard and Poor's ExecuComp data
   demonstrates that the effects of CEO "leapfrogging" potentially explain
   a considerable fraction of the overall upward movement of executive
   compensation since the early 1990s.

AB Health researchers have explored how different aspects of neighborhood
   characteristics contribute to health and well-being, but current
   understanding of built environment factors is limited.
   This study explores whether the association between stress and health
   varies by residential neighborhood, and if yes, whether built and social
   neighborhood environment characteristics act as moderators.
   This study uses multilevel modeling and variables derived from
   geospatial data to explore the role of neighborhood environment in
   moderating the association of stress with health. Individual-level data
   (N = 4,093) were drawn from residents of 45 neighborhoods within
   Philadelphia County, PA, collected as part of the 2006 Philadelphia
   Health Management Corporation's Household Health Survey.
   We find that the negative influence of high stress varied by
   neighborhood, that residential stability and affluence (social
   characteristics) attenuated the association of high stress with health,
   and that the presence of hazardous waste facilities (built environment
   characteristics) moderated health by enhancing the association with
   stress.
   Our findings suggest that neighborhood environment has both direct and
   moderating associations with health, after adjusting for individual
   characteristics. The use of geospatial data could broaden the scope of
   stress-health research and advance knowledge by untangling the
   intertwined relationship between built and social environments, stress,
   and health. In particular, future studies should integrate built
   environment characteristics in health-related research; these
   characteristics are modifiable and can facilitate health promotion
   policies.

AB Objective: To determine whether socioeconomic (SE) position is
   associated with first-minute (1-minute) heart rate (HR) recovery in
   healthy children and adolescents (hereafter referred to as children).
   Design: In a cross-sectional study, we compared 1-minute HR recovery in
   3 groups of children (low, medium, and high SE) using multivariable
   analysis. The groups were based on neighborhood SE data extracted from
   the US 2000 census database.
   Setting: Children's Hospital Boston.
   Participants: Four hundred eighty children referred for exercise testing
   to exclude cardiac disease and discharged as showing normal results.
   Main Exposures: Socioeconomic position and body mass index (BMI).
   Main Outcome Measure: Heart rate recovery after a maximal treadmill
   exercise test (Bruce protocol) following a consistent 1-minute cool-down
   period.
   Results: The low SE group had a higher proportion of children with a
   high BMI (>= 85th percentile) (P = .07) and exercised for a shorter
   duration, controlling for age, sex, and BMI (P < .001). After adjusting
   for age (P < .001) and sex (P < .001), a significant interaction of SE
   group with BMI was found (P = .04). There was no difference in HR
   recovery in the 3 SE groups in children with a normal BMI (<85th
   percentile). Among children with a high BMI, only those from low and
   middle SE neighborhoods had impaired 1-minute HR recovery.
   Conclusion: Children with a high BMI in low and middle SE positions
   appear to have worse cardiovascular health compared with children with a
   high BMI in a high SE position.

AB Anthropologists have provided rich field descriptions of the norms and
   conventions governing behavior and interactions in small-scale
   societies. Here, we add a further dimension to this work by presenting
   hypothetical moral dilemmas involving harm, to a small-scale, agrarian
   Mayan population, with the specific goal of exploring the hypothesis
   that certain moral principles apply universally. We presented Mayan
   participants with moral dilemmas translated into their native language,
   Tseltal. Paralleling several studies carried out with educated subjects
   living in large-scale, developed nations, the Mayan participants judged
   harms caused as the means to a greater good as more forbidden than harms
   caused as a side-effect (i.e., side-effect bias). However, unlike these
   other populations living in large-scale societies, as well as a more
   educated and less rural Mayan comparison group, the target rural Mayan
   participants did not judge actions causing harm as worse than omissions
   (i.e., omission bias). A series of probes targeting the action-omission
   distinction suggest that the absence of an omission bias among the rural
   Mayan participants was not due to difficulties comprehending the
   dilemmas, using the judgment scale, or in attributing a greater causal
   role for actions over omissions. Thus, while the moral distinction
   between means and side-effect may be more universal, the moral
   distinction between actions and omission appears to be open to greater
   cross-cultural variation. We discuss these results in light of issues
   concerning the role of biological constraints and cultural variation in
   moral decision-making, as well as the limitations of such experimental,
   cross-cultural research. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   present data which purports to show that East Asian Cantonese-speakers

   intuitions about proper names. Machery et al. take this finding to
   support the view that some intuitions, the universality of which they
   claim is central to philosophical theories, vary according to cultural
   background. Machery et al. conclude from their findings that the
   philosophical methodology of consulting intuitions about hypothetical
   cases is flawed vis a vis the goal of determining truths about some
   philosophical domains like philosophical semantics.
   In the following study, three new vignettes in English were given to
   Western native English-speakers, and Cantonese translations were given
   to native Cantonese-speaking immigrants from a Cantonese community in
   Southern California. For all three vignettes, questions were given to
   elicit intuitions about the referent of a proper name and the
   truth-value of an uttered sentence containing a proper name. The results
   from this study reveal that East Asian Cantonese-speakers do not differ
   from Western English-speakers in ways that support Machery et al.'s
   conclusions. This new data concerning the intuitions of
   Cantonese-speakers raises questions about whether cross-cultural
   variation in answers to questions on certain vignettes reveal genuine
   differences in intuitions, or whether such differences stem from
   non-intuitional differences, such as differences in linguistic

AB We report computer simulation experiments based on our agent-based
   simulation tool to model the multi person Chicken dilemma game for the
   case when the agents are greedy simpletons who imitate the action of
   that of their neighbors who received the highest payoff for its previous
   action. The individual agents may cooperate with each other for the
   collective interest or may defect, i.e., pursue their selfish interests
   only. After a certain number of iterations the proportion of cooperators
   stabilizes to either a constant value or oscillates around such a value.
   The payoff (reward/penalty) functions are given as two straight lines:
   one for the cooperators and another for the defectors. The payoff curves
   are functions of the ratio of cooperators to the total number of agents.
   Even for linear payoff functions, we have four free parameters that
   determine the payoff functions that have the following properties: (1)
   Both payoff functions increase with the increasing number of
   cooperators. (2) In the region of low cooperation the cooperators have a
   higher reward than the defectors. (3) When the cooperation rate is high,
   there is a higher payoff for defecting behavior than for cooperating
   behavior (4) As a consequence, the slope of the D function is greater
   than that of the C function and the two payoff functions intersect. (5)
   All agents receive a lower payoff if all defect than if all cooperate.
   We have investigated the behavior of the agents systematically. The
   results show that the solutions have predictable tendencies but they are
   nontrivial and quite irregular. The solutions show drastic changes in

AB Little sociological attention is directed to dreams and dreaming, and
   none at all is directed to how people tell one another about dreams.
   Ordinary settings in which dreams are told mimic the conditions of
   "breaching" experiments and should produce anomie, but dream telling
   proceeds without trouble. Foundational orientations of ordinary dream
   talk assimilate into professional dream studies, where dream narratives
   are "data" and the analysis of narratives is "dream analysis." That such
   practices proceed without trouble poses some interesting problems for
   sociology in terms of how anyone experiences "constraint" in the telling
   and hearing of dreams.

AB The current paper explores the salience and impact of ethnic and
   national identities for immigrants that are negotiating more than two
   cultures. Specifically, we were interested in the ways in which Jewish
   immigrant adolescents from the former Soviet Union integrate their
   Russian, Jewish, and American identities, and to what extent
   identification with these three cultures predicts adaptation to varied
   life domains. In order to examine whether being Jewish has an impact on
   salience and predictive value of Russian and American identities, a
   sample of Jewish adolescents (n = 100) was compared with a sample of
   non-Jewish (n = 113) adolescent immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
   The study suggests that Jewish and non-Jewish adolescent immigrants
   differ in levels of Russian and American identity. Further, using
   structural equation modeling a bicultural model for Jewish and
   non-Jewish adolescents was tested. The results suggest that these two
   groups do not differ with respect to how Russian and American identities
   impact on adjustment. However, adding Jewish identity to the model for
   the Jewish sample significantly improved model fit, and rendered some of
   the impact of Russian identity non-significant. Thus a multicultural
   model that included all three identities had better explanatory power
   for this sample than a bicultural one. Implications for the study of
   ethnic identity of immigrants, particularly those whose lives involve
   multiple cultural affiliations, are drawn.

AB Most analyses of the contraceptive decision-making in which couples
   engage are based on the reports of only one partner, usually the female
   partner. This study uses information from the 2006 National Couples
   Survey conducted in the US, which was obtained from both partners in
   intimate heterosexual relationships to investigate the relative impact
   of the male and female partner's method preferences on the type of
   method they use together. It also investigates the extent to which
   differences in power between the partners, measured on multiple
   dimensions, may weigh the decision-making process toward one partner or
   the other. The results suggest that men's and women's method preferences
   are both significantly related to the couples' method choice. Further,
   there is no evidence of a significant gender difference in the magnitude
   of these relationships, although women in married and cohabiting
   relationships appear to have greater power over method choice than women
   in dating relationships. The analysis also finds that structural power
   as measured by relative education and income affects partner differences
   in the relationship between preferences and method choice, but is more
   important for married and cohabiting couples than for dating couples. In
   contrast, relationship-based power sources, including relative
   commitment and relative relationship alternatives, have significant
   effects only for dating couples.

AB Background National data do not account for race differences in health
   risks resulting from racial segregation or the correlation between race
   and socioeconomic status. Therefore, these data may inaccurately
   attribute differences in obesity to race rather than differing social
   context. The goal of this study was to investigate whether race
   disparities in obesity among women persist in a community of black
   people and white people living in the same social context with similar
   income.
   Methods Race disparities in obesity were examined among black women and
   white women living in the same social context with similar income, using
   the data from the Exploring Health Disparities in Integrated
   Communities-SWB (EHDIC-SWB) study, and these estimates were compared to
   national data (National Health Interview Survey) to determine if race
   disparities in obesity were attenuated among women in EHDIC-SWB. Obesity
   was based on participants' self-reported height and weight. Logistic
   regression was used to examine the association between race and obesity.
   Results In the national sample, black women exhibited greater odds of
   being obese (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.71 to 2.32) than white women after
   controlling for covariates. In the EHDIC-SWB sample, black women had
   similar odds of being obese (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.75) as compared
   to white women, after adjusting for covariates.
   Conclusions There are no race disparities in obesity among poor, urban
   women sharing the same social context. Developing policies that focus on
   modifying social aspects of the environment may reduce disparities in
   obesity among low-income women living in urban communities.

AB In the first of two experiments, we demonstrate the spread of a novel
   form of tool use across 20 "cultural generations" of child-to-child
   transmission. An experimentally seeded technique spread with 100%
   fidelity along twice as many "generations" as has been investigated in
   recent exploratory "diffusion" experiments of this type. This contrasted
   with only a single child discovering the technique spontaneously in a
   comparable group tested individually without any model. This study
   accordingly documents children's social learning of tool use on a new,
   population-level scale that characterizes real-world cultural phenomena.
   In a second experiment, underlying social learning processes were
   investigated with a focus on the contrast between imitation (defined as
   copying actions) and emulation (defined as learning from the results of
   actions only). In two different "ghost" conditions, children were
   presented with the task used in the first experiment but now operated
   without sight of an agent performing the task, thereby presenting only
   the information used in emulation. Children in ghost conditions were
   less successful than those who had watched a model in action and showed
   variable matching to what they had seen. These findings suggest the
   importance of observational learning of complex tool use through
   imitation rather than only through emulation. Results of the two
   experiments are compared with those of similar experiments conducted
   previously with chimpanzees and are discussed in relation to the wider
   perspective of human culture and the influence of task complexity on
   social learning. Crown Copyright (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc. All

AB Agrifood nanotechnology is at critical stage in which analysis and
   deliberation can help shape funding priorities for research and
   development, risk assessment, and oversight activities. Significant
   benefits to society could arise from nanotechnology applied to animal
   production; however, there is a need to prepare for oversight, health
   and environmental safety, and other societal issues that are likely to
   arise from these applications. In this paper, I examine case studies of
   nanotechnology applied to animal production that are in research and
   development in order to demonstrate potential future challenges and
   opportunities associated with their market entry and diffusion. The case
   studies are analyzed from multiple viewpoints including potential
   societal benefits and risks, public perception, and other science and
   technology policy challenges. Broader conclusions about technical and
   policy preparation are derived from the case studies in order to help
   inform the development of the field of nanotechnology applied to animal
   production as it matures. The diversity of nanotechnology applications
   makes it difficult to discuss nanotechnology as a whole, yet it is
   suggested that dialogue and deliberation about specific cases and their
   associated issues prior to market entry can help to ensure the safe,
   responsible, and equitable deployment of nanotechnology to livestock
   production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
