AB Ever since Berger and Luckmann published their treatment of the
   sociology of knowledge in 1966, older versions of the subfield have
   languished, been forgotten, or misrepresented, as if The Social
   Construction of Reality (SCR) eliminated the need to study its
   predecessors in Wissenssoziologie. By considering Berger's subsequent
   statements about the book, along with remarks recently made by Luckmann,
   and then returning to the text itself, this article shows that some of
   the main suppositions on which SCR rests are foreign to the sociology of
   knowledge in its original forms, and that a number of these premises do
   not seem as plausible in today's social world as they may have in the
   early 1960s when their authors formulated them. The unintended scholarly
   results of SCR's surprising publishing success are evaluated.

AB In this paper, I bring Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of
   Reality into conversation with the relatively new subfield of the
   sociology of the senses to argue that greater attentiveness to sensory
   perception can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of the social
   construction of reality. When read with this sensitization, one finds
   implicit references to the senses throughout their discussion, but
   nowhere is sensory perception explicitly theorized as a part of the
   social construction process. Drawing specifically on their analysis of
   primary socialization, face-to-face interaction, language and relevance
   structures, and the fundamental dialectic of externalization,
   objectivation, and internalization, I demonstrate that processes of
   perceptual construction - specifically sensory attention and
   disattention - are key mechanism of social construction underlying many
   of Berger and Luckmann's arguments. A more explicit focus on sensory
   perception not only clarifies and strengthens many of their
   observations, but also constitutes a renewal of their important call to
   examine the processes of social construction.

AB The sociology of knowledge that followed The Social Construction of
   Reality shifted from the study of rarified ideas to practical activity,
   focusing on the stabilization of a sense of shared reality. The opposite
   side of this shift in emphasis has received much less attention -
   activities that place reality into a state of play and, in so doing,
   call attention to its ephemerality. I discuss three empirical areas
   where the practical use of other realities is central to the sociology
   of knowledge. First, I document cases in which skilled practitioners,
   such as airline pilots, safety engineers, and athletes, use simulation
   to prepare for events that are understood as highly uncertain and risky.
   Next, I describe how other realities are mobilized epistemologically,
   such as through experimentation in technoscience and experimentalism in
   unrealized or unbuilt' art and architecture. Finally, I consider
   autotelic and transcendent social experiences through fantasy and
   technological mediations like augmented realities.

AB Unlike recent tendencies to specify the variety of postsocialist
   trajectories, this article attempts to characterize the common features
   of postsocialist capitalism, as it has developed since the 1990s in
   Eastern Europe. Using conceptual tools of economic sociology, the
   postsocialist socio-economic organization is analyzed as embedded
   economy, the institutionalization of capitalism as a moral project, and
   the pervasiveness of informality from the networks and culture
   perspectives. Economic development is viewed as dependent,
   simultaneously, on the system's structural, political and cultural
   features. For postsocialist capitalism, these features include lack of
   state autonomy due to close coupling of political and economic roles;
   the embrace of greed and self-interest as legitimate motives for action;
   and persistence and bolstering of informality as modus operandi.
   Stipulations about developmental consequences are provided in the
   conclusion.

AB This article addresses the question of whether and how internal wars can
   lead to state building. I offer a new conceptual framework for
   understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity,
   as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly
   consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like
   external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they
   enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the
   state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration.
   Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites
   perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests
   with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due
   to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive
   effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this
   framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and
   Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive
   effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.

AB How do people maintain deeply held moral identities in a seemingly
   immoral social environment? Cultural sociologists and social
   psychologists have focused on how individuals cope with contexts that
   make acting on moral motivations difficult by building supportive
   networks and embedding themselves in communities of like-minded people.
   In this article, however, the author argues that actors can achieve a
   moral "sense of one's place" through a habitus that leverages the
   material dimensions of place itself. In particular, he shows how one
   community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral
   identities centered on living "naturally" seem like "second nature,"
   even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by
   reconfiguring their physical world. The author shows how nonhuman
   objects serve as proofs of moral labor, markers of moral boundaries, and
   reminders of moral values, playing both a facilitating and constraining
   role in moral life.

AB This article conceptualizes economies of spectatorship through a case
   study of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (SMR). Economies of spectatorship
   produce spectacular diegeses as commodities sold to spectators and
   sponsors. They develop through a dialectical process of progressive
   decontextualization as their diegeses are cross-marketed with discrepant
   products and services to reach new markets. Progressive
   decontextualization leads to diegetic incoherence that threatens the
   realization of profit. As an economy of spectatorship, the SMR produced
   an outlaw biker themed diegesis replete with vicarious action and
   consumable character gambles. The SMR progressively decontextualized as
   it cross-marketed its outlaw diegesis with establishment corporate,
   religious and political themes. The resulting diegetic incoherence
   threatened profits and required the SMR's producers to make significant
   investments in order to stabilize its flow of spectators and sponsors.
   Conceptualizing such inherently negating processes is critical to
   understanding the commodification of spectacle in mature capitalism.

   revealed patterns of "pivot points" where students' understanding is

AB Blended learning, in the form of screencasts to be viewed online outside
   of class, was incorporated into three sections of an introductory
   sociology course in a liberal arts college setting. The screencasts were
   used to introduce concepts and theories to provide more time for
   discussion in class and more opportunity for students to review concepts
   and theories outside of class. Students' use and their perceptions of
   the impact of the screencasts were assessed with an in-class survey
   instrument in addition to a web-based college-administered survey.
   Although it was not possible to measure the impact of blended learning
   on students' academic performance and learning outcomes in this
   exploratory study, student responses indicated high use of the
   screencasts as well as the perception that the screencasts were helpful,
   contributed positively to performance on exams, and also led to more
   positive feelings about the course more generally. Overall, this
   provides an optimistic initial appraisal of the prospects for blended

   shape sociology's relation to public debate and its abilities to tackle
   the emergent challenges of our time. Sociology was geared since its
   inception toward the collective reflection of not only present or past
   conditions of social existence but also of possibilities for change.
   While deterministic and expertocratic closures limited its potential,
   shifting epistemological, institutional, and social constellations allow
   the expansion, evasion, and re-emergence of open and contestable future
   orientations. Case studies related to climate change, globalization,
   social movements, values, and media are used to explore actual and
   potential contributions to public discourse.

   societies. Specifically, individuals holding post-materialist attitudes
   and living in countries with greater human and economic development
   (measured by higher internet access and tertiary enrollment, and lower
   infant mortality) have lower confidence in future-oriented science. The

AB Sociologists have undertheorized the role of aesthetic judgment in group
   identification. The author argues that the communication of aesthetic
   judgments in face-to-face interaction powerfully works to confirm or
   deny feelings of group belonging. The author introduces the concept of
   community sense, the public face of shared aesthetic judgments that is
   communicated and upheld within a group. The author illustrates this
   concept through an ethnographic case study of an erotic arts club, a
   group predicated on achieving a shared sense of good and bad taste. The
   author shows how the community sense is formed, challenged, and
   sustained in interaction, examining three characteristics of aesthetic
   judgmentsderivation in form, visceral force, and intersubjective
   validitythat together constitute a strong basis for feelings of
   belonging and distinction. This setting acts as a wedge to access larger
   theoretical concerns, as the author explore the relationship between
   aesthetic judgment and feelings of group belonging in diverse contexts.

AB Sociological theorists have long understood the central role of status
   distinctions in producing social inequality. Although empirical studies
   have demonstrated how status hierarchies are reproduced in a broad range
   of cultural domains, there remains little research into where
   legitimating cultural practices take place, where they do not, and the
   role of space itself in producing status differences. As a result,
   sociologists lack a clear understanding of how status hierarchies give
   shape to cities and how the structure of cities might be practiced
   hierarchically. On the basis of interviews at a high-end shopping center
   in Istanbul, Turkey, I examine how consumers enact social rank in
   physical space with specific reference to the social contours of their
   city. Through privileging particular forms of consumption practices
   within socially and spatially exclusive venues, elites map legitimating
   values upon the physical shape of the city itself, providing a
   spatialized understanding of how status inequalities are distributed.

   literatures in environmental sociology and social movements, we examine

   environmental threats in provoking activism in highly repressive
   settings. Using a range of data sources, we illustrate how the
   externalities of extreme production coupled with developing weaknesses
   in the state ultimately incited public protest against the regime. Our
   analysis of protest in North Bohemia provides insight into broader
   patterns of elite legitimacy and resistance. Our findings show that the
   environmental externalities stemming from state-mandated production in
   the North Bohemian region posed an imminent threat that spurred
   residents to protest despite harsh state repression. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for future research on
   environmental and political threats, elite legitimation, and citizen
   activism.

   theoretical questions motivate this study. First, what is the political

   specifically, how can we best understand the association between
   political ideology and public perceptions of science in the current
   polarized environment? Using data from the National Science Foundation's

   culturally and politically divided in its support for the intersection
   of science and the state. Various models of political and cultural
   polarization are tested. Overall, ideological challenges to the cultural
   authority of science cannot be reduced to left-right political
   polarization or to conservative religious beliefs. Instead, skepticism
   on the political right is multifold, involving distinct modes of thought
   and concerns about the institutional ties between science and the state.

AB While there is a wealth of information about the extent to which people
   across the world disapprove of homosexuality, we know a lot less about
   the lenses through which they view same-sex relations. The aim of this
   study is to understand better how homosexuality is framed in the public
   press, and how religion and economic development may combine to shape
   this discourse. Through an analysis of almost 400 newspaper articles,
   this study compares how homosexuality is framed in Uganda, South Africa,
   and the United States. Because these nations have high levels of
   religious belief, but differ in their level of economic development and
   democracy, we can assess how these factors interact to shape portrayals.
   Drawing on work from cultural sociology and the sociology of religion,
   this study shows that the United States is much more likely than Uganda
   to frame homosexuality as a civil rights issue and use entertainers as
   claimsmakers. Conversely, articles from Uganda are more likely than
   those from the United States or South Africa to frame homosexuality as a
   religious issue and draw on religious claimsmakers. Likewise, Uganda is
   much more likely than South Africa to discuss homosexuality in the
   context of Western influences.

   relationship within the stress process framework, we develop a theory
   that traces the influence of income on chronic financial strain which in
   turn affects subjective well-being, which functions as a psychological
   resource for volunteers. Data taken from two waves of the National
   Survey of Midlife in the United States confirm this theory: household
   income has no direct effect on volunteering once chronic financial

AB Sociologists generally agree that history affects or conditions moral
   belief, but the relationship is still only vaguely understood. Using a
   case study of the appearance of social justice beliefs in Victorian-era
   Britain, this article develops an explanation of the link between
   history and morality by applying field theory to capture the historical
   genesis of a field. A moral way of evaluating poverty and inequality
   developed slowly over the course of the nineteenth century in Britain,
   with a trajectory extending back to Malthus's Essay on the Principle of
   Population and moving forward to the Fabians, the Settlement Movement,
   and other social reformers at the end of the nineteenth century. Drawing
   from field theory, I argue that social justice beliefs emerged during
   this time through the genesis of moral universalism as a distinct mode
   of experience. Several recognizable moral beliefs appeared in the
   process, including "equality of opportunity," "equality of reward,"
   "character," and "effort," "ability," and "duty" as forms of merit

   relational entities that are situated and dated by the conditions

   sociology of morality to a critical moral reflexivity instead of moral
   relativism or moral realism.

AB Why do workers participate in their own exploitation? This article moves
   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.

AB This study examines whether working with a broker increases or reduces
   the payment received for the last client among female sex workers.
   Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate
   a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association,
   and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We
   analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female
   sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish
   between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the
   client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with
   significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are
   associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does
   not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week.
   Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with
   earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over
   the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to
   show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the
   results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging
   the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling
   for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing
   countries.

AB The belief that natural sciences are more scientific than the social
   sciences has been well documented in the perceptions of both lay and
   scientific populations. Influenced by the Kuhnian concept of paradigm
   development and empirical studies on the closure of scientific
   controversies, scholars from divergent traditions associate scientific
   development with increased consensus and stability. However, both the
   macro/quantitative and micro/qualitative approaches are limited in key
   ways. This article is the first comparative ethnography of a natural
   science (molecular biology) and a social science (psychology) and it
   highlights important differences between the fields. Molecular
   biologists engage in a process of bench-building, in which they create
   and integrate new manipulation techniques and technologies into their
   practice, whereas psychologists have far less opportunity for this type
   of development. This suggests an alternative conception of the
   natural/social divide, in which the natural sciences are defined by
   dynamic material evolution while the social sciences remain relatively
   stable.

AB Biomedical and geriatric technologies are having major impacts on the
   development and management of human longevity. Our contention in this
   special issue is that longevity should be considered as a point of
   departure for new forms of politics in which social sciences, in
   particular sociology and politics, can play an important role. In this
   introduction, we argue that emerging consumer markets in biomedicine are
   incrementally redefining the relationship between old age and society.
   Techno-economic transformations are creating new sites of vulnerability
   that are masked by medical utopias of good health and living forever. In
   this context, it is unlikely that such technologies will be able to
   overcome inequalities in distribution and may well exacerbate various
   forms of injustice. By drawing on notions of institutional
   precariousness and scarcity, we conclude that to maintain any degree of
   social solidarity, increasing longevity will force the emergence of a
   sociology of limits.

AB W.E.B. Du Bois' early work as a sociologist from 1896 to 1914 represents
   a milestone in the development of modern sociology. His empirical
   studies often employed a triangular methodological approach, and by
   grounding The Philadelphia Negro in what is the earliest extensive
   social survey by an American sociologist, Du Bois set the stage for the
   growth of sociology as a legitimate science. In fact, his approach
   became the model that the discipline eventually followed. Had Du Bois
   been white, he would have been recognized as a leading founder of the
   field. Since Du Bois' early sociological scholarship was completed
   during the height of the Jim Crow era, his brilliant landmark work was
   largely negated by the profession. His scholarly accomplishments clearly
   focused on establishing a scientific sociology. Based on his exemplary
   work, can sociology finally negate the sociological negation of W.E.B.

AB The WHO's International Studies of Schizophrenia conclude that
   schizophrenia may have a more benign course in developing societies than
   in the West. The authors focus on this finding's most common corollary:
   cultural schemata are shaped by the transition from agrarian to
   industrial society. Developing societies are viewed as traditional,
   gemeinschaft cultures lacking the stigmatizing beliefs about persons
   with mental illness held in modern, gesellschaft cultures of developed
   societies. The Stigma in Global ContextMental Health Study formalized
   the cultural myth of public stigma (CMPS) with propositions linking
   level of development to intolerant, exclusionary, and individualistic
   attitudes. In 17 countries, the authors find no support for the
   corollary; where support is found, the findings are opposite
   expectations, with developed societies reporting lower stigma levels.
   Reconceptualizing of the cultural landscape on more specific dimensions
   also produces null or contrary findings. This correction to nostalgic
   myths of cultural context in developing societies thwarts misguided
   treatment, policy, and stigma-reduction efforts.

AB Community-based participatory research (CBPR) poses ethical challenges
   that are distinct from biomedical research. These arise from the
   epistemological differences between traditional biomedical research
   paradigms and CBPR, as the latter entails ongoing engagement of
   communities in research from development to dissemination. Biomedical
   research typically poses research questions and obtains ethics review
   before engaging with the population or community of interest. While
   institutional review board (IRB) practices seek to minimize harm in
   research conducted with human subjects, traditional IRB review can
   introduce new or exacerbate existing ethical challenges when reviewing
   non-traditional research protocols. In what follows, we seek to: define
   CBPR; identify unique ethical obligations in CBPR; pose potential
   solutions for amending the IRB process to support CBPR; and facilitate a
   research ethics framework that aims to reduce the exploitive and
   appropriational tendencies in research by inviting researchers, IRBs,
   and communities into a collaborative effort aimed at best practices.

AB The practice of community based participatory research (CBPR) has
   evolved over the past 20 years with the recognition that health equity
   is best achieved when academic researchers form collaborative
   partnerships with communities. This article theorizes the possibility
   that core principles of CBPR cannot be realistically applied unless
   unequal power relations are identified and addressed. It provides
   theoretical and empirical perspectives for understanding power,
   privilege, researcher identity and academic research team composition,
   and their effects on partnering processes and health disparity outcomes.
   The team's processes of conducting seven case studies of diverse
   partnerships in a national cross-site CBPR study are analyzed; the
   multi-disciplinary research team's self-reflections on identity and
   positionality are analyzed, privileging its combined racial, ethnic, and
   gendered life experiences, and integrating feminist and post-colonial
   theory into these reflections. Findings from the inquiry are shared, and
   incorporating academic researcher team identity is recommended as a core
   component of equalizing power distribution within CBPR.

   courses, and then we present and analyze a case study based on a
   collaborative community-based research model developed by the
   co-authors. By shifting the theoretical foundations for community-based
   research, and more specifically, grounding our work in feminist ethics
   and critical pedagogy theories, we created linked courses that weave
   both collaborative theory and practice into the fabric of the courses.
   Upon teaching these courses, we found that students responded in an
   overwhelmingly positive way to collaborative theoretical models and to
   collaborative dialogical practice in the classroom, but when it came to
   team-based work conducted with community members, student responses were
   mixed. Reactions to collaborative grading practice conducted by faculty
   members and the community partner were more unanimous: a majority of
   students expressed confusion and discomfort with this practice.
   Collaborative theory and dialogical practice, then, were uniformly
   embraced in the classroom, while team-based work and evaluation in the
   community provided more discomfort and displeasure. This finding
   reiterates the pervasiveness of individualist thinking, even when
   students have chosen courses that are expressly collaborative in both
   theory and practice.

   less likely than Whites to trust the fiduciary ethic, technical

AB Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the
   mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how
   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.

AB It is well known that family socioeconomic background influences
   childhood access to opportunities. Educational reforms that introduce
   new information about school quality may lead to increased inequality if
   families with more resources are better able to respond. However, these
   policies can also level the playing field for choice by equalizing
   disadvantaged families' access to information. This study assesses how a
   novel accountability system affected family enrollment decisions in the
   Chicago Public Schools by introducing new test performance information
   and consequences. We show that a substantial proportion of families
   responded by transferring out when their child's school was assigned
   probation. Poor families transferred children to other schools in the
   district, but at a lower rate than non-poor families, who were also more
   likely to leave for another district or enroll in private school. Most
   striking, we show that despite family response to the probation label,
   access to higher-performing schools changed very little under the new
   policy; students who left probation schools were the most likely of all
   transfer students to enroll in other low-performing schools in the
   district. Although new information changed families' behavior, it did
   not address contextual and resource-dependent factors that constrain the
   educational decisions of poor families.

   violence. I systematically evaluate whether students' levels of global
   empathy, empathetic responses toward victims, definitions of abuse, and
   propensity to agree with victim-blaming attitudes change after
   completing this experiential learning activity. Posttest results suggest
   a statistically significant but small increase in global empathy scores,
   a growth in empathetic responses toward victims, an expansion in
   students' definitions of abuse, and greater disagreement with
   victim-blaming attitudes. I discuss ways sociology instructors can use
   this simulation as a tool to help students comprehend a difficult
   subject matter while simultaneously engendering empathy toward victims

AB The relationship between police violence and race is one fraught with
   both specific historical and contemporary tensions (i.e., white police
   profiling, beating, and murder of people of color) and with ambiguity
   (e.g., what is meant by "race" and how do we operationalize and measure
   "violence" at the hands of law enforcement?). Defining the concept of
   "race" as a multidimensional process of oppression and justification for
   social inequality can shed light on why and how police violence often
   descends upon black and Latino populations as well as why such brutality
   and state surveillance is supported by many whites yesterday and today.
   In this article I analyze the relationships between police violence and
   race as an ongoing feedback loop: "race" produces violence and
   inequality while violence and inequality (re) forms "race." Their
   intertwined formation reproduces the dominant meanings and structural
   location of racial groups in five key domains: ideologies, institutions,
   interests, identities, and interactions - what I call "The Five I's."

   and participation. Over the last 15 years, the idea of multiculturalism
   has come under withering criticism, especially in Europe, in part
   because it is claimed that multiculturalism undermines common
   citizenship. Yet countries with more multicultural policies and a
   stronger discourse of pluralism and recognition are places where
   immigrants are more likely to become citizens, more trusting of
   political institutions, and more attached to the national identity.
   There is also little evidence that multicultural policies fuel majority
   backlash, and some modest evidence that such policies enlarge
   conceptions of inclusive membership. By studying claims-making and the
   equality of immigrant-origin groups, we see that the participatory
   aspect of citizenship needs to take center stage in future work in
   political sociology, social theory, social movements, immigration, and
   race/ethnicity.

AB A central hypothesis about discrimination is that prejudice forces the
   stigmatized into low-paying, undesirable jobs. Prejudice clearly leads
   to exclusion. But surprisingly, evidence linking exclusion to
   disadvantage is mixed. We address this issue theoretically, providing a
   formal rational choice model combining arguments from sociology ( on
   prejudice) and economics ( on competition). Our theory suggests that
   economic organization is crucial. In economies dominated by monopoly,
   oligarchy, tradition, or government, prejudice may reduce some workers'
   pay, and a disadvantageous secondary labor market may emerge. By
   contrast, in competitive free markets, exclusionary discrimination often
   occurs but does not reduce workers' pay, nor does it induce a
   disadvantageous secondary labor market. Our theory suggests the
   conventional analytic approach to discrimination is misguided: Exclusion
   does not necessarily imply disadvantage; a shortfall in pay does not
   necessarily imply that the lower paid worker is disadvantaged; and
   analysis should focus on the overall subjective well-being or utility
   derived from a job, not on pay alone.

   Often overlooked, however, is how the materiality of nature also

   scholars, and economic sociologists more generally, should better engage
   in a historical sociology of concept formation to problematize the human
   exemptionalist paradigm their work upholds and recognize the role of
   nature in shaping markets and society. Unearthing nature in the work of
   Karl Polanyi, I develop a theory of embeddedness that more closely
   accounts for the economic, the social, and the ecological. In doing so,
   I provide a way for scholars to conceptualize both how market societies
   shape nature and how nature shapes market societies.

   and actions within romantic contexts. Using National Longitudinal Study

   experience greater romantic relationship inauthenticity when the
   ordering of events within ideal romantic relationship scripts (e.g.,
   holding hands, saying I love you, having sexual intercourse) diverges
   from ideal romantic relationship scripts of fellow peer-group members.
   Results indicate romantic relationship inauthenticity increases as one's
   ideal script diverges from fellow peer-group members' scripts.
   Importantly, heterogeneity in relationship scripts at the peer-group
   level was not associated with relationship inauthenticity. This study
   highlights the roles cultural reinforcement and social network processes

AB This article explores the subtle yet far-reaching ways that cultural
   environments shape the uses of the evening hours among business
   professionals in three countries. Drawing on interviews with
   professional men and women living and working in Paris, Oslo, and San
   Francisco from a spectrum of professional fields and employers, the
   article explores their evening routines. Three contrasting patterns are
   identified. Where the early evening hours between 17:00 and 21:00 are
   concerned, French, Norwegian, and American professionals traverse
   different cultural terrains. The French professionals and their
   employers treat this temporal zone as a status-conferring period.
   Adhering to a transorganizational cultural convention defining the early
   evening as work time, they use these hours to distinguish themselves as
   committed practioners of their m,tier equipped with status and
   authority. In Norway, comparable professionals approach this period as
   nonwork time off limits to their employer. Early departures from the
   office are encouraged and facilitated in the Norwegian workplace. Among
   the American professionals far less uniformity prevails among the
   evening routines of respondents working in different organizations and
   occupations. This variability is explained by the absence of the
   higher-level temporal conventions present in the two European contexts.
   In the American setting two deciding factors come into play: the
   temporal expectations of the professional's employer and the bargaining
   power wielded by the individual professional vis-A -vis this employer.
   These differences between the evening routines of the three groups
   reflect important cultural differences across countries with broadly
   similar postindustrial landscapes.

   that decision was whether scientific research had achieved consensus
   regarding how children of same-sex couples fare. Determining the extent
   of consensus has become a key aspect of how social science evidence and
   testimony is accepted by the courts. Here, we show how a method of
   analyzing temporal patterns in citation networks can be used to assess
   the state of social scientific literature as a means to inform just such
   a question. Patterns of clustering within these citation networks reveal
   whether and when consensus arises within a scientific field. We find
   that the literature on outcomes for children of same-sex parents is
   marked by scientific consensus that they experience "no differences"
   compared to children from other parental configurations. (C) 2015

AB This essay brings together 'commodity chain' analysis with some of the
   central concerns motivating studies of consumption and consumer culture.
   It argues that we can, from the perspective of capitalist agents and
   agencies, discern important historical shifts in the economic
   significance of the various activities that generate modern consumer
   culture, or 'consumer cultural production'. Shifts in both the nature
   and intensity of competitive pressures imply different roles for
   consumer cultural production within the portfolios and strategies of
   leading capitalist organizations over time. Thus, the essay provides a
   framework for periodizing and linking historical shifts in the
   organization of commodity chains in relation to transformations in the
   structure and nature of consumer cultural production over roughly the
   past century. More concretely, it connects the broad shift from
   commodity chains organized along a 'producer-driven' form to the
   'buyer-driven' arrangement to different kinds of 'market making' through
   consumer cultural production.

AB For decades sociologists have been interested in the labor movement's
   attempts to rebound. Most research, however, focuses on revitalization
   within the service industry, ignoring important efforts in other
   sectors, like construction. As recent scholars argue, revitalization
   within the building trades is unique because organizing workers is not
   the same as organizing work. Locals must simultaneously increase
   membership and market capacity. Unfortunately, existing theories ignore
   many obstacles that building trade unions face in market expansion
   efforts. These obstacles include macro-economic conditions, like the
   Great Recession, which limit work opportunities; inter-union competition
   which allows one Local to expand market share by poaching work from
   another; and cost differentials which continue to prevent unions from
   breaking into new markets. Relying on the case of International
   Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 58, these obstacles are
   explored and used to reformulate current theories on revitalization and
   market recovery within the building trades.

AB Can we identify and theorize contingency as a property of processes and
   situations? Applied to social and historical events, contingency denotes
   a mode of causality characterized by its indeterminate character.
   Conjunctural causation and period effects lack the specificity required
   to identify a distinctive class of processes. References to chance
   happenings offer no clue to analyze endogenous disruptions. Focusing on
   breaks in patterns of social relations and the role played by individual
   agency, the author distinguishes four types of impact-pyramidal,
   pivotal, sequential, and epistemic-and investigates how these relate to
   the possibility of indeterminacy through an Event Structure Analysis of
   the night of August 4, 1789, in Versailles. This empirical foray
   underscores the significance of junctures that are indeterminate with
   respect to their collective outcomes. The article grounds analytically
   this class of conjunctures with the concept of mutual uncertainty,
   gauges the phenomenal scope of this contingency in terms of action
   domains and group types, contrasts it with the notion of chance events,
   and draws its implications for the study of social and historical
   change.

AB This article explores the role of space in social movements, through an
   examination of the case of Tahrir Square in the Egyptian revolution of
   2011. The author argues that the pre-existing, historically specific
   understanding of Tahrir Square as a politicized space of protest drew
   people there in January 2011 and shaped their participation in the
   revolution. Specifically, the author suggests that earlier mobilizations
   that took place in Tahrir Square contributed to the events of the
   revolution in three ways: (1) provided protesters with an idea about
   Tahrir as a target of protests, (2) provided protesters with the idea of
   occupation of Tahrir, and (3) provided protesters with an inspiration in
   the revolution. The article contributes to the literature in sociology
   of space and social movements by proposing that the history of space in
   social movements and previous mobilization matters, but also these may
   shape the new movement and the role of space in protest. This article is
   part of the author's research about the Egyptian revolution of 2011. It
   is based on two phases of historical and ethnographic research in Egypt
   conducted in 2011 and 2012.

AB On 28 January 2011 - as police abandoned the streets and reports of
   theft spread - Egyptians went down to the streets to protect their
   families and property, closing down intersections and setting up
   checkpoints. These neighborhood groups - known as popular committees
   (PCs) - filled the security vacuum and were one of the deciding factors
   of Mubarak's downfall. This article explores how ordinary Egyptians
   collectively acted in order to restore stability during the regime's
   moment of crisis. The author briefly introduces Egyptian PCs by
   discussing other instances of community organizing that occurred under
   extraordinary circumstances. Next, the author focuses on the
   microdynamics of PCs during the 2011 revolution by describing their
   mobilization, social networks, practices, communication methods, and
   dissolution. The PC narrative reminds us that, even during a revolution,
   the actions of ordinary individuals are often ignored by scholars and

   we begin to understand the full complexity of such exceptional moments.

   an assessment of peer review in a quantitative research methods course,
   which is a traditionally difficult and technical course. Data were
   collected from 170 students enrolled in four sections of a quantitative
   research methods course, two in-class peer review sections, and two
   sections that did not incorporate in-class peer review over two
   semesters. For the two sections with peer review, content scheduled for
   the days during which peer review was used in class was delivered
   through the online course management system. We find that in-class peer
   review did not improve final grades or final performance on student
   learning outcomes, nor did it affect performance differences between
   drafts and final assignments that measured student learning objectives.
   Further, it took time away from in-class delivery of course content in
   course sections that used in-class peer review. If peer review is
   utilized, we recommend it be assigned as an out-of-class assignment so
   it does not interfere with in-class teaching.

   creating an enjoyable learning environment in a sociology course.
   Results showed few differences in these outcomes between groups taught
   with the two different methods, although TBL students thought they
   improved their oral communication and creative thinking skills more than
   the lecture students, and they reported getting to know their professor

AB While secrecy enables policy makers to escape public scrutiny, leaks of
   classified information reveal the social construction of reality by the
   state. I develop a theory that explains how leaks shape the discursive
   frames states create to communicate the causes of social problems to the
   public and corresponding solutions to redress them. Synthesizing
   cultural sociology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, I
   argue that leaks enable non-state actors to amplify contradictions
   between the public and secret behavior of the state. States respond by
   ad hoc-ing new frames that normalize their secret transgressions as
   logical extensions of other policy agendas. While these syncretic
   responses resolve contradictions exposed by leaks, they gradually detach
   discursive frames from reality and therefore increase states' need for
   secrecyas well as the probability of future leaksin turn. I illustrate
   this downward spiral of deception and disclosure via a case study of the
   British government's discourse about terrorism between 2000 and 2008.

AB Sociologists have long been interested in collective representations of
   the past, as well as the processes through which individuals, groups, or
   events have been excluded from those representations. Despite this rich
   body of literature, few studies have examined the processes through
   which long-silenced countermemory becomes integrated within official
   public memory. This study examines two instances of silence breaking in
   Philadelphia, Mississippithe town notorious for the silence, denial, and
   collective obstruction of justice surrounding the 1964 Mississippi
   Burning murders. By reconstructing and comparing the event structure of
   the twenty-fifth and fortieth anniversary commemorationsboth interracial
   community-wide events unique for having punctuated Philadelphia's
   prevailing silence on the murdersthis article finds that commemorability

AB Motivated by theoretical and empirical research in life course
   sociology, we examine relationships between trajectories of work and
   family roles across the life course and four measures of economic
   well-being in later adulthood. Using data from the Wisconsin
   Longitudinal Study (WLS) and multiple trajectory-generating methods, we
   first identify latent trajectories of work and family roles between late
   adolescence and age 65. We then model economic well-being at age 65 as a
   function of these trajectories and contemporaneously measured indicators
   of older adults' work, family, and health statuses. Our central finding
   is that trajectories of work and family experiences across the life
   course have direct effects on later-life economic well-being, as well as
   indirect effects that operate through more proximate measures of work,
   family, and other characteristics. We argue that these findings have
   important implications for how social scientists conceptualize and model
   the relationship between later-life economic outcomes and people's work
   and family experiences across the life course.

   examination of collaborations and knowledge flows among researchers. We
   examine the relevant case of Stanford University during a period of
   intense investment in multidisciplinary research, using a novel measure
   of knowledge flows in the short-cycled movement of published references
   from one researcher to another. We describe intellectual cohesion and
   its trajectory among 1,007 faculty members between 1997 and 2006, and
   then examine the social-structural antecedents of dyadic knowledge flows
   that help explain macro-level patterns. Results show that university
   collaborations have grown denser and more integrated across faculty
   members and their institutional divisions. However, this integration is
   led by "star" researchers and is accompanied by a greater centralization
   of knowledge flows around these individuals. Results illustrate
   important shifts in the nature of academic research, and contribute to a
   dynamic view of intellectual cohesion.

AB Durkheim posited that social relationships protect individuals against
   suicide; however, substantial research demonstrates that suicide can
   spread through the very ties Durkheim theorized as protective. With this
   study, we use Waves I, III, and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health to investigate whether young adults' suicide attempts
   and ideations are in part products of exposure to suicidal behaviors via
   their social relationships. We find that young adults who have had
   family members or friends attempt suicide are more likely to report
   suicide ideation or even suicide attempts over both the short and long
   run. This finding is robust to many important controls for risk and
   protective factors for suicide. Our findings have implications for the
   sociology of suicide, not the least of which is that social ties have
   the power to harm in addition to the power to protect.

AB The emergence of market society in Europe prompted a major change in the
   social measurement of individual worth. The formal system of
   aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois
   concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual
   merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution
   commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in
   domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this
   cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and
   comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a
   social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted
   representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited
   ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented
   values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the
   novels point to major differences in the social psychologies
   underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence
   of honor culture well before this occurred historically.

   cultural sociology. The address that he gave before the Second Congress
   of German Sociologists in 1912 was his first formal presentation of the
   discipline. He wrote that the task of cultural sociology was to examine
   the relationship of the unilinear, rational, utilitarian process of
   civilization and organic, vital configurations of culture. The latter
   attempted to establish meaning for the changes generated by the former.

AB Contemporary theory on community suggests that disagreement or conflict
   over foundational beliefs and values greatly decreases the chance that a
   successful, sustainable community experience will develop. My findings
   suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite
   incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and
   values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit
   organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate
   jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental
   mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms
   associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive
   mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of
   objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful
   experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect,
   based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications
   for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social
   psychology are discussed.

AB Organizing collective action to secure support from local communities
   provides a source of power for elites to protect their interests, but
   community structures constrain the ability of elites to use this power.
   Elites' power is not static or self-perpetuating but changing and
   dynamic. There are situations in which elites are forced into
   movement-like struggles to mobilize support from their community. The
   success of elites' mobilization is affected by cultural and structural
   factors that shape the collective meaning of supporting elites' actions
   and the identities that are formed in doing so. I find broad support for
   these propositions in a study of the issuances of small-denomination
   currency substitutes in 145 U.S. cities during the Panic of 1907. I
   discuss the contributions of this article to elite studies, the social

AB This study rehabilitates concepts from classical human ecology and

   advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The
   theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact
   endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns
   recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we
   conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site
   accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was
   assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past
   half centurymost of which remain unacknowledged in government reports.
   Results show how three iterative processeshazardous industrial churning,

AB Weber's typology of religious orientations is incomplete. Much more
   attention has been paid to the other-worldly mysticism of monastic or
   contemplative withdrawal from society than the neglected category of
   inner-worldly mysticism. In Weber's brief treatment, he concludes that
   inner-worldly mysticism results in passive acquiescence to social
   conditions. Alternately, we draw on examples from Mother Teresa and
   Dorothy Day to demonstrate not only how mysticism can be tightly linked
   to the social world, but how mystical practices can create meaningful
   social change. We argue that this change is possible because
   inner-worldly mysticism holds the potential to generate solidarity
   across traditional power and status divides. We illustrate how this
   potential for interaction-level change can spread horizontally; the
   number of small groups committed to carrying out inner-worldly mystical
   practices can grow until such groups spread across communities and
   beyond. In this way, the work of inner-worldly mystics can create
   meaningful change without ever vying for power on the macro political
   stage.

AB Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a broad theoretical framework created by
   synthesizing the main themes of scholars who have challenged dominant
   contemporary understandings of race and the law. Although a theory of
   state tacitly undergirds much critical race scholarship, no one has yet
   aggregated the literature's disparate assertions into a unified theory
   of state. This article represents an initial contribution toward that
   effort. Through comparison with Omi and Winant's (1994) Racial State
   Theory (RST), I identify six central tenets - racialization of the
   state; state as white institutional space; instrumentalism;
   interest-convergence; fluid boundaries; and permanent racist orientation
   - that characterize the CRT of State for the United States. I close by
   entertaining three questions Omi and Winant (2012) argue demonstrate the
   utility of RST and use them to illustrate where the CRT of State I
   outline achieves greater analytical purchase than RST.

AB Noise is widely regarded as a residual categorythe unexplained variance
   in a linear model or the random disturbance of a predictable pattern.
   Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that
   the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where
   noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source
   of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent
   sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the
   theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a
   complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies
   identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and
   predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological
   warning that deterministic assumptions are not an innocent
   simplification.

AB Money has meaning that shapes its uses and social significance,

   welfare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This study, based on
   in-depth interviews with 115 low-wage EITC recipients, reveals the EITC
   is an unusual type of government transfer. Recipients of the EITC say
   they value the debt relief this government benefit brings. However, they
   also perceive it as a just reward for work, which legitimizes a
   temporary increase in consumption. Furthermore, unlike other
   means-tested government transfers, the credit is seen as a springboard
   for upward mobility. Thus, by conferring dignity and spurring dreams,
   the EITC enhances feelings of citizenship and social inclusion.

AB Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative,
   highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making
   established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as
   critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture
   and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency.
   Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather
   than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits,
   revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a
   strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity
   theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for
   the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid
   advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that
   macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights,
   generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But
   event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices
   leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to
   compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in
   turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even
   while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different
   forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different
   institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all
   insurgency by a social group.

   that these differences can be understood in terms of the risks that
   students take in their writing. Journals, which do not incorporate peer
   readership, appear to compel students to take more personal risks and
   engage in emotional labor to process assigned materials. Blogs, which do
   incorporate peer readership, enable students to take more intellectual

   consciousness by framing the study of health in terms of social justice
   issues that were demonstrable across three community partner
   organization sites. Analyses of writing assignments and qualitative
   interviews at the end of the semester reveal that student development of
   critical consciousness was demonstrated through analytic engagement with
   structural and systemic forces framing health inequities as well as
   reflexive consideration of the limited extent to which well-meaning
   efforts and intentions of individuals can significantly impact lasting
   social change. The combination of these two processes simultaneously
   cultivated students' ideological commitments to ongoing social justice
   work and subverted student self-efficacy with regard to the

   to applicants in job interviews affect hiring evaluations. She finds
   that employers use subjective feelings of excitement and enthusiasm
   toward candidates-akin to Collins's concept of emotional energy-to
   evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions. With these data, she
   constructs an original theoretical framework of emotional energy
   development, which highlights the qualities that tend to produce or
   inhibit the subjective experience of emotional energy in job interviews.
   Additionally, she outlines the particular phases of an encounter where
   energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring
   outcomes and inequalities. She discusses the implications of these
   findings for research on hiring, labor market stratification, and
   interaction rituals.

AB In this article, we outline the analytic limitations of action theories
   and interpretive schemes that conceive of beliefs as explicit mental
   representations linked to a desire-opportunity folk psychology. Drawing
   on pragmatism and practice theory, we recast the notion of belief as a
   species of habit, with pre-reflexive anticipation the primary mechanism
   accounting for both the formation of beliefs and their causal influence
   on action. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in three ways:
   first, by linking it with recent research on the cognitive and motor
   development of infants; second, by drawing out a typology of belief
   states that accounts for a range of different experiential traits; and
   third, by applying the new model to reinterpret two belief-based
   phenomena of broad sociological interest: irrational decision making and
   religious conversion.

AB Peer review guides the intensive reworking of research reports, a key
   mechanism in the construction of social scientific knowledge and one
   that gives substantial creative agency to journal editors and reviewers.
   We conceptualize this process in terms of two types of challenges:
   evidentiary challenges that question a study's methodology and
   interpretive challenges that question a study's theoretical framing. A
   survey of authors recently published in Administrative Science Quarterly
   finds that their peer review experience was dominated by interpretive
   challenges: extensive criticisms, suggestions, and subsequent revision
   concerning conceptual and theoretical issues but limited attention to
   methodological and empirical aspects of the work. Salient differences
   between original submissions and published papers include intensive
   reworking of theory and discussion sections as well as growth and
   turnover in citations and hypotheses. We consider implications of the
   dominance of interpretive challenges in successful revision and possible
   sources of variation across scholarly fields.

   symposium on race and transnationalism. It proposes a particular angle
   from which to consider the following seven articles and the study of
   race and racism in general. In response to sociology and neighboring
   disciplines' mounting predictions of Black exceptionalism' and imminent
   assimilation of Asians and Latina/os into whiteness/non-Blackness, a
   two-part alternative approach is briefly suggested: (1) critically
   engage the most theoretically and politically challenging scholarship in
   Black studies (notably outside sociology) that asserts the singularity
   of anti-Black racism; and (2) think through the social positions of
   non-Black peoples of color in light of and not losing sight of the first
   part. An overview of the special issue follows.

AB This paper examines the precolonial and colonial history of race in
   Korea, which has been overlooked in the study of race, empire, and
   Korean history. While the study of race claims to be global, it
   implicitly assumes that racism becomes possible through physical contact
   with different races'. Rather than examining the emergent racial
   politics after the recent global migration, I suggest that racism could
   emerge regardless of collective racial migration and contact. Further,
   recent colonial studies have overlooked the colonized, the Japanese
   Empire and its colonized. Accordingly, I question the absence of race in
   Korean historiography and the assumption of Korean racial naivete based
   on the supposed racial homogeneity. Further, I demonstrate how the
   notions of race and blackness are fundamentally embedded in Koreans'
   understanding of the Age of Empire. Thus, this paper calls for a new
   global' approach to the study of race and empire that questions these
   overlooked assumptions.

AB After the Spanish-American War of 1898, anti-imperialists and
   imperialists hotly debated whether to keep the Philippines as a colony.
   The generation' schema, which communicated racialized views of
   Filipinos/as and their ability to self-govern once they had been
   educated by white Americans, developed in these debates. For both
   imperialists and anti-imperialists, the generation' schema was rooted in
   racialized neo-Lamarckian notions of how the environment (i.e. US
   tutelage and training) could change the character of a non-white group.
   Therefore, this article analyzes debates between anti-imperialists,
   imperialists, and Filipinos/as as they each deployed generations' in the
   field of the colonial state. Using archival sources authored by
   imperialists, anti-imperialists, and Filipinos I find imperialists
   argued that future generations of Filipinas/os held more hope for
   independence in order to dismiss Filipina/o and anti-imperialist demands
   for immediate independence, while anti-imperialists and Filipinos/as
   used the schema to garner policies that incrementally led to
   independence in 1946.

   challenges the claim that the workings of capitalism in the West accord

   Composed as much in the style of history as economics, what explains the
   appeal of this very long, carefully drafted and technically dense text?
   This review is woven of three threads: the method of research behind it;
   its fit with theory and practice in the critical social sciences; and
   what it exemplifies about the ambiguity of leaping from a science
   laboratory into the world of revolutionary praxis. To close, the
   European project of economic management will be briefly discussed,
   suggesting in reference to both French regulation theory and German
   Ordoliberalism why the recent Nobel Prize in Economics, which many
   consider Piketty's work to merit, was lost in favor of another French

AB This article elaborates the social ontology and methodology of carnal
   sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the
   spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-the-making, in the wake of
   debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a
   plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent,
   (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the
   contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the
   social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate,
   suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and
   blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising
   out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what
   modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate
   conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of
   immersive fieldwork based on "performing the phenomenon," is a fruitful
   path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata
   (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under
   investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the
   rewards of "observant participation" and achieve social competency (as
   distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu's
   dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of
   capturing the "spirit of acuteness" that animates such competency but
   vanishes from normal sociological accounts.

   Besides the phenomenology of the researcher's own bodily experience, a
   combination of methods are useful, including emotional expressions and
   rhythms seen through observation, photos, and videos, and informed
   interviewing. Combined methods give a larger picture of all the
   participants on the scene. Viewed more broadly, one of things we find is
   that embodied actors are not equally skilled, but are situationally
   stratified by confrontations among persons with differing degrees of

AB Wacquant's vision of carnal sociology and enactive ethnography draws
   heavily from embodied mind theories in neurocognitive science and
   philosophy of mind. However, it also resonates with feminist
   epistemologies, such as sociologist Dorothy Smith's view that sociology
   should begin with and from the body. While both carnal sociology and the
   neurocognitive traditions it draws from ignore decades of feminist
   contributions to embodied epistemologies, I argue that feminist thought
   has much to contribute to materially grounded accounts of corporeal
   knowledge. Attention to feminist thought should also help enactive
   ethnographers consider the limits to the method, and the ethical and
   political complexities of embodied, situated knowledge.

AB The authority to diagnose is a distinguishing prerogative of modern
   medicine. While a growing body of research addresses various aspects of
   diagnosis, few studies analyze just how it is achieved through
   talk-in-interaction. This paper examines how clinicians assembled a
   diagnosis of a child who was evaluated for autism. Drawing on audio and
   video recordings at a clinic for developmental disabilities, I use a
   combination of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to show how a
   critical fact about the child's mental functioning was formulated,
   challenged, and transformed across three consecutive stages of his
   evaluation: (1) testing, (2) a case conference among clinicians, and (3)
   an informing interview where the diagnosis was delivered to the parents.
   I analyze how this fact emerged as an outcome of clinician-child
   interactions, and how clinicians used storytelling to render its
   diagnostic implications. In addition to examining how these stories are
   methodically produced, I argue that they frame the child's behavior in
   ways that suggest a lack of competence while eliding the skills and
   competencies he may have been displaying.

AB While strong arguments can be made that prosumption today can be seen as
   a primal phenomenon and an evolutionary process, the strongest argument
   is that it involves a revolutionary set of developments producing a
   dramatically new world of prosumption. While those developments can be
   seen in both the material and digital worlds (although they augment one
   another), they are clearest in the digital world, especially the
   Internet. Among the forces that are creating this new world of
   consumption are new means of prosumption (e.g., IKEA, massive online
   open courses, automated teller machines) which are made possible by a
   variety of new technologies (the computer, the Internet). However,
   overarching these and other changes is the emergence of a new form of
   capitalism, prosumer capitalism. In addition to exploiting often
   low-paid commodified workers, prosumer capitalism increasingly
   prioritizes the exploitation of largely uncommodified prosumers who are
   generally unpaid. Prosumers offer the capitalist many other advantages
   (e.g., no long-term obligations such as high-cost benefit programs).
   There are few, if any, obligations to prosumers with the result that
   they fit well with today's reigning neoliberal philosophy. The new world
   of prosumption could have been a more positive development had it not
   been usurped by capitalist interests.

AB This article considers the question of whether, as a number of scholars
   have suggested, we can (or should) develop a theory of institutions from
   the perspective of evolutionary psychology (EP), construed broadly. To
   do so, the article reviews EP's core explanatory strategy and the main
   claims that have been made by proponents of an EP institutional theory,
   focusing on arguments about (1) welfare states and (2) honor cultures
   and the institutions associated with them. On the one hand, the article
   argues, there are both logical and empirical problems with current
   efforts to develop EP theories of these institutional domains. On the
   other hand, sociology's relative absence from the development of such
   theories contributes to these problems, and sociologists can learn from
   EP. Above all, insights drawn from EP may help us to construct better
   accounts of various institutions' micro-foundations. To this end,
   collaboration and exchange between EP scholars and sociologists is
   called for, and some suggestions are made about how this might be done
   most fruitfully.

   systems and their relevance to sociology. I begin by comparing and
   contrasting various definitions of complexity and then describe the
   attributes of systems capable of producing complexity: diversity,
   networked interactions, interdependent behavior, and adaptation. Next, I
   survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance
   with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories:
   dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of
   structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that
   incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the
   introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive
   approach to empirical research, and that the benefits of a deeper
   engagement with complexity will be substantial.

   achievement is concerned (i.e., some positive, some negative, some

AB The existing evidence linking recessions to individual and population
   health presents a puzzle. Some studies show that people who experience
   the kinds of labor market, housing, and asset shocks that proliferate in
   recessions suffer negative health consequences, whereas other studies
   show that mortality rates fall when the economy worsens. This review
   synthesizes evidence from these distinct research traditions in light of
   emerging findings from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. It traces
   pathways by which macroeconomic changes "get under the skin" and
   generate contradictory aggregate-and individual-level consequences.
   Research on the longer-term health effects of recessions could be
   strengthened by integrating theoretical and analytical approaches from
   sociology. These include a multilevel perspective that considers how
   individuals cope with recessions as members of families and communities
   embedded in different policy environments, and attention to cascades of
   recessionary shocks, individuals' strategies for coping with them, and
   the way these intersect with health trajectories.

AB At the close of World War II, "development" began to evolve along two
   paths. On the first path, scholars aimed to generate theoretical
   understandings of social change, especially at the national level
   (development studies). On the second path, policy makers in governments
   and other development-focused organizations initiated actions to promote
   positive social change, especially in poor or war-torn nations
   (development practice). In this article, we review the recent trajectory
   of "development" in sociology, paying close attention to the
   intersections between development studies and development practice.
   Through explicit comparisons to economics and political science, we
   demonstrate how the prominence of development sociology has varied
   historically in relation to its proposed policy prescriptions. We
   conclude by highlighting five uniquely sociological contributions that
   could powerfully improve contemporary interdisciplinary development
   conversations, and by calling for greater sociological attention to the
   complex ways in which a growing transnational field of development
   practitioners is shaping a multiplicity of development outcomes.

AB Improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   education, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups, is widely
   recognized as pivotal to the United States's long-term economic growth
   and security. In this article, we review and discuss current research on
   STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in
   sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that
   different social factors affect the two major components of STEM
   education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b)
   attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional
   on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological
   characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences
   at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels.
   However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES)
   predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological
   factors are more important influences on participation and achievement
   in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family
   SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally,
   American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic
   resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States
   and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require
   more research, a task that is best accomplished through
   interdisciplinary approaches.

AB Sociological research on moral panics, long understood as "struggles for
   cultural power," has focused on the social groups and media conditions
   that enable moral panics to emerge, and on the consequences of moral
   panics for the social control systems of societies. In this article I
   turn instead to modeling the specific cultural process of how the
   conditions for a moral panic are turned into an actual moral panic,
   moving the understanding of moral panic away from its Durkheimian
   origins and towards a process-relational cultural sociology. Drawing on
   Roland Barthes' theory of myth and Kenneth Burke's dramatism, the paper
   posits the cultural process of resignification via synecdoche and
   metanarrative as the driver of the disproportion, concern, hostility,
   consensus, and volatility of moral panics. This process can be carefully
   traced in the case of the Salem Witch Trials; a retrospective reading
   reveals the same process at work in the "Mods and Rockers" panic
   analyzed by Stanley Cohen. Beyond moral panics, theorizing
   resignification as a non-exclusive counterpoint to framing and
   ideational embeddedness enriches the theoretical repertoire of cultural
   sociology. "Deep culture" and mythological signification can, using the
   schema proposed here, be understood as practical
   accomplishments-rhetorical responses to particular situations that, when
   performed successfully, legitimate violence and other forms of
   domination.

AB The racialization of Muslim Americans is examined in this article.
   Qualitative in-depth interviews with 48 Muslim Americans reveal they
   experience more intense forms of questioning and contestation about
   their status as an American once they are identified as a Muslim.
   Because Islam has become synonymous with terrorism, patriarchy,
   misogyny, and anti-American sentiments, when participants were
   identified as Muslims they were treated as if they were a threat to
   American cultural values and national security. Their racialization
   occurred when they experienced de-Americanization, having privileges
   associated with citizenship such as being viewed as a valued member of
   society denied to them. This article highlights the importance of gender
   in the process of racialization. It also demonstrates the need for race
   scholarship to move beyond a black and white paradigm in order to
   include the racialized experiences of second and third generations of
   newer immigrants living in the USA.

AB This article argues that neoliberalism is a critical public issue
   influencing the apparently private troubles of college students and
   teachers. For example, earning a college degree has become ever more
   important for success; yet, because of declining state support for
   public education, students are taking on extraordinary levels of debt.
   As a result, learning is being pushed aside by vocational and other
   considerations that result from neoliberal policy imperatives. For
   teachers, the decline of the tenure system means fewer full-time faculty
   members to do more work and fewer people who have the protection to
   speak out against neoliberal excess. Unless sociology teachers (along
   with teachers in other disciplines) do something to change the current
   system, higher education will continue to decline.

AB In this study we explore how absence from sociology classes is
   understood by undergraduate students at University College Dublin. The
   authors use Scott and Lyman's (1968) concept of accounts to explore
   absence sociologically. Drawing on data generated via focus groups, an
   open-ended questionnaire, and an online survey with students, we outline
   the different excuses and justifications for missing classes used by
   students and present their understanding of attendance at classes as an
   optional feature of student life. Individual students' attendance
   differed across courses, throwing doubt on the usefulness of
   individual-level frameworks for understanding attendance. We argue that
   decisions to attend are influenced by a variety of contextual issues,
   including knowledge of legitimate accounts for the setting, pedagogic
   approaches in use, and students' perceptions of the usefulness of
   classes. We conclude that to counter the trend of declining attendance
   and enhance student learning, it is important to better understand how
   both local norms, values, curriculum design, and assessment practices
   combine to facilitate students' absences. Focusing on accounts allows us
   to better understand student absence rather than accepting this as an
   inevitable feature of contemporary student behavior about which nothing
   much can be done.

AB Instructors at non-research institutions are less able to expose their
   students to research firsthand. Utilizing human subject pools (HSPs) in
   class may be a solution. Given that HSPs tend to be used in introduction
   to psychology classes at research institutions, we examine a community
   college HSP to answer three questions: (1) Do community college students
   positively assess the educational value of HSP experience? (2) Can
   sociology students perceive HSP experience to be as educationally
   effective as psychology students? (3) Can online students perceive HSP
   experience to be as educationally effective as in-person students?
   Results indicate that not only did community college students hold
   positive evaluations of their HSP experience, but sociology and online
   students also felt they benefited as much as psychology or in-person
   students. HSPs were also considered particularly effective by students
   taking research methods. HSP participation may be a viable teaching tool
   for sociology instructors at non-research schools.

AB Sociology of gender has developed beyond a personality-centered idea of
   "sex-roles" to an approach that stresses interaction and social
   structure. At the same time, there has been a concurrent development in
   the psychological sex-differences and medical literatures toward
   including the biological bases of sex-typed behavior and gender
   identities. In this paper, while we conceptualize gender as a social
   structure, we focus only on the individual level of analysis: testing
   the relative strength of (maternal circulating) prenatal hormones,
   childhood socialization, and the power of expectations attached to adult
   social roles (cultural interactionist) as explanations for women's
   self-reported feminine and masculine selves. Our findings are complex,
   and support some importance of each theory. Prenatal hormones, childhood
   socialization, and cultural interactionism were all influential factors
   for gendered selves. While cultural expectations predicted only feminine
   selves, prenatal hormones were more robust predictors of masculine sense
   of self. While personality may be a relatively stable characteristic
   influenced by the body and childhood socialization, our results
   reinforce the importance of studying how the social world responds to
   and reinforces gendered personality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB A recurring theme in the sociology of human rights is the vast

   in principle and their implementation in practice, fueling much debate
   about the effectiveness of international law. Yet, despite this
   disjuncture, a deeper question remains: given all the barriers that have
   impeded the realization of human rights, why have they become so widely
   institutionalized? Revisiting previous work in this journal, I argue
   that one important component of the expansion of human rights is the
   rise of the universal, egalitarian individual as the primary entity of
   social organization in world society. Additionally, I explore how the
   nature of human rights law itself promotes widespread decoupling that,
   in turn, fuels ongoing efforts to close the gap between principle and
   practice. Indeed, while human rights law envisions an ideal world that
   is practically unrealizable, it inspires a never-ending, global crusade
   to bring about that vision.

AB Blood sport-the practice of pitting animals against each other (or

   entertainment that has been resilient since antiquity. While animal
   blood sport is a form of human driven sport related violence that
   involves the abuse and suffering of other animals (Young 2012), it also
   provides an "identity prop" (Dunning 1999): all male competitive sports
   and games provide men with a way to demonstrate masculinity by
   feminizing opponents (Dundes 1997). This theoretical argument has not
   been systematically analyzed in the sociology of sport, and my essay is
   an attempt to fill that gap. I examine animal blood sport with a focus
   on its connection to the validation of masculinity and heterosexuality.

AB Sociologists theorize that people comply with the dictates of states and
   other organizations out of self-interest or because of the perceived
   legitimacy of those in authority. Some organizations, however, are based
   on lies, or secrets, and it would seem that these should be very
   short-lived, given how easy it is for the truth to escape. This article
   lays the foundations of a sociology of deception, focusing on lies and
   secrets successfully maintained for years or even decades. The ideas of
   Goffman and Simmel provide a theoretical starting point. Then Bernard
   Madoff's Ponzi scheme is considered as a case study. Drawing on that and
   other examples, the article culminates in a theory that distinguishes
   between barriers to knowing, barriers to asking, barriers to telling,
   barriers to perceiving, barriers to believing, and barriers to acting.
   Together, these may counter the natural entropic tendency for
   information to leak and diffuse, in part because the effectiveness of
   one sort of barrier may offset imperfections in others.

AB Does the experience of cultural consumption have its own sui generis

   experience, creating an intense internal interaction ritual; (2)
   collective effervescence among the audience; (3) Goffmanian front-stage
   self-presentation in settings of cultural consumption; and (4) verbal
   discourse during and around the cultural experience. Data from highly
   committed opera fanatics in Buenos Aires are used to document the
   extreme pole of cultural consumption that rejects external social
   hierarchies in favor of pure musical experience. This individualized and
   internal style of music consumption resembles religious mysticism, and
   what Weber in his typology of orientations to religious experience
   called virtuoso religiosity, as distinct from typical social class
   orientations to religion and to music.

AB Emile Durkheim's ideas on religion have long served as foundational
   blocks for sociological theories. Yet, a mystery remains over where
   Durkheim's insights into religion came from and especially the event
   that opened his eyes to religion's importance in social life. Durkheim
   never supplied details on this conversion, but he did credit Robertson
   Smith for his new understanding. Did Smith really play the key role in
   Durkheim's turn to religion? This essay examines Durkheim's revelation
   in 1895 by starting from a novel anglethe first edition of The Division
   of Labor and his original stage model with the cult of nature as the
   starting point for religion. Tracing the implications of his initial
   choice of naturism as the elementary religion, a choice he would later
   soundly reject as the product of [a] delirious interpretation, offers
   new insights into why Durkheim found Smith's ideas so inspirational. It
   also sheds light on why Durkheim overhauled his theory of solidarity,
   discarding his famous distinction between mechanical and organic
   solidarity. In Robertson Smith's work, Durkheim discovered a more
   inclusive and enduring basis of solidarity in the social universe.

AB The social model of disability, which defines disability as the product
   of social discrimination rather than the physical, cognitive, or sensory
   differences of individuals, became the dominant logic of the
   international disability field with the 2006 passage of the UN
   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As such,
   grassroots disability associations around the world are advocating for
   new rights. These campaigns promote a new identity frame of disabled
   persons as a universally oppressed group. This identity, however, does
   not benefit all groups equally and actually threatens some. Using
   qualitative methods, I compare the usage of the disability identity by
   two grassroots associations in Nicaragua. Ex-Contra soldiers with
   disabilities use the identity to obfuscate their discredited history as
   "traitors" and, instead, represent themselves as unjustly discriminated
   against disabled persons deserving special benefits and human rights
   protections. Ex-Sandinista soldiers with disabilities also make claims,
   but only reluctantly as disabled, preferring to self-identify as war
   wounded. Because of changes in law, however, Ex-Sandinista soldiers are
   increasingly unable to make claims as war heroes, but must instead
   access benefits as persons with disabilities "in general." This case
   demonstrates how actors strategically use the social model of disability
   in relation to local political culture and group identity.

AB This article examines how collective memory narratives about the
   Holocaust and corresponding performances of classroom emotional labor
   and emotion management are used to teach immigrants in Germany the
   normative civic emotion associated with citizenship. In 2005, following
   legal changes which increased naturalization opportunities, Germany
   created a series of nation-wide orientation classes and integration
   projects aimed at preparing foreign residents for membership. This
   research, based on participant observation in orientation classes and
   interviews with integration workers in Frankfurt am Main, shows that
   civic emotion and associated practices of feeling management play a key
   role in citizen-making projects. Although the emotional content of
   citizenship in most countries is largely positive, consisting of
   feelings like national pride and loyalty, German civic emotion is both
   unique and contested. Most integration workers taught migrants a
   distinctly negative form of civic emotion, which combined sadness and
   shame for the Nazi-era with a rejection of national pride. Some
   attempted to negotiate alternative forms of "safe," specifically
   non-national pride, and a minority of subjects argued that it was time
   for Germans to "stop carrying shame" for the Holocaust altogether and
   re-embrace patriotism. Thus, the emphasis that subjects put on teaching
   the "correct" kinds of civic emotion, along with their disputes over
   what those were, show that even the most intimate and invisible aspect
   of belonging, what individuals feel toward their country, can become
   fertile ground for struggles over citizenship and national identity.

AB A much-theorized but seldom-tested theory is that elites achieve
   cohesion via the social network they form through their affiliations
   with local clubs, religious institutions, civic groups, and other
   voluntary associations. But few scholars have considered how increasing
   diversity with respect to elites' gender, race, and social class may
   undermine such cohesion. We use primary data from interviews with 312
   elites in a large Midwestern city to construct the network of
   affiliations local elites formed with one another. Results from
   bootstrapping analyses suggest that the most influential elites in the
   sample achieved a disproportionately high level of cohesion by virtue of
   the particular voluntary associations with which they affiliated. Not
   only were the most influential elites more connected to one another
   through multiple redundant associational pathways, but their affiliation
   networks were less segregated by gender, race, and social class than
   were the networks formed by less elite members of the sample.
   Instrumental variables regression analyses further show that the most
   influential elites were especially crucial to increasing cohesion and
   reducing segregation in the overall network. We discuss some of the
   mechanisms through which such integration enhances elites' cohesion and
   power.

AB Scholars typically suggest that deliberation, defined as communication
   guided by reason-giving and inclusion, works best behind a veil of
   ignorance or when personal differences are bracketed. In this article we
   explore deliberation within ethnically diverse groups. We operationalize
   ethnicity in three ways: as an aspect of individual identity, as an
   identity that is made salient through priming, and as an enactment
   relative to interactions in particular situations. In this way, we can
   explore the applicability of our previous experimental results to
   ethnically diverse groups. We find similar results: within ethnically
   diverse groups, deliberation matters; participants are more likely to
   reconsider their positions when deliberating than when simply talking
   about politics. Ethnicity has no adverse effects on the quality of
   deliberation, indicating that bracketing has no significant impact. On
   the contrary, when conceptualized as a relational enactment, ethnicity
   is correlated with increased levels of reason-giving and inclusion, and
   hence higher quality deliberation. This suggests deliberation works in
   multiethnic groups in much the same way asif not better thanit does in
   homogeneous groups. Deliberation is a robust form of political
   communication that not only helps manage, but also embraces diverse
   subjective experiences as a part of the political process.

AB Contemporary scholarship understates the resilience of everyday life in

   in a blinkbut in the Buduburam Refugee Camp, a predominately Liberian
   refugee camp in Ghana, people experienced calamitous tragedy accumulated
   over years of daily activities. Though they remained politically and
   economically out of place, residents constructed buildings and other
   ordinary material objects to forge a new lived environment. As residents
   engaged with this new lived environmentfrom building homes to managing
   rainwaterthey regularly participated in moral boundary work that helped
   establish how good people ought to act in inhumane circumstances. Moral
   boundary work did not obviate inequality or conflict, but it did help
   mediate between immediate bodily needs and the wider social order. More
   broadly, the study documents the crucial role that seemingly mundane
   material objects play in moral boundary work. Material objects like
   signs, garbage cans, and homes can operate like sociospatial props in
   the stories that people tell about their daily lives. These stories
   reinforce the moral boundaries that divide good and bad people and
   ultimately help make a shared moral order possible.

AB In this essay, I argue that the very form of the grammatical
   construction a sociology of culture and cognition (which is a
   specification of the more general schema a sociology of [X]) is
   symptomatic of a deeply entrenched form of Primitive Classification
   (which I will refer to as the Comtean schema) that governs the way in
   which sociologists conceive of their place in, and engage with other
   denizens of, the social science landscape. I will also argue that while
   this style of disciplinary engagement might have worked in the past when
   it came to dealing with the standard (nineteenth-century) social science
   disciplines and even some late-twentieth-century upstarts, it will not
   work as a way to engage the now-sprawling postdisciplinary field that I
   will refer to as Cognitive Social Science (CSS). The takeaway point is
   that if sociologists want to be part of CSS (and it is in their interest
   to be part of it because this constitutes the future of the behavioral
   sciences), then they will have to give up the Comtean-schematic thought
   style.

AB This article contributes to sociological studies of identity by shedding
   light on concrete social identification practices and placing these
   practices in cultural context. Gay men's autobiographical accounts,
   gathered in 28 in-depth interviews, show consistent use of a long-held
   feature of American culture: a voluntaristic trope of personal striving
   through social attachments. Citing examples from stories about
   friendship, love, role models, city life, identity politics, and
   religion, the analysis shows how gay men frame their life stories using
   a voluntaristic model of identity. The study also provides evidence of
   change over time in the practices through which gay men construct social
   identities. Younger men report greater ease in finding gay role models,
   especially in professional settings, than do older men. Their accounts
   also support the notion that a therapeutic ethos is becoming ever more
   pervasive in American life.

AB The past 70 years has seen the rise of a new type of actor that falls
   outside traditional conceptions of regulation and value. Fair trade
   organizations regulate production and distribution processes globally
   and provide the infrastructure for a market in which value lies in a
   product's utility and conditions of production and terms of exchange.
   Fair trade emerged to address persistent economic, social, and
   environmental inequalities between global North and South. But what
   explains the rise of the fair trade market over this time period? Using
   time series regression analysis, I evaluate the claims of several
   theoretical traditions and use world society theory to inform economic
   sociology on understanding how social forces shape global markets. I
   find that only after a shift in world cultural norms do processes of
   unequal exchange become problematized so that moves toward
   liberalization in international trade are countered by movements toward
   regulation.

AB A classic question of social science is how knowledge informs practice.
   Research on physicians' decisions about medical knowledge has focused on
   doctors' personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus,
   producing divergent findings. This study asks, instead, How is decision
   making about the use of knowledge influenced by features of work? From
   observations of one team's decisions in multiple clinical and
   administrative contexts, the author argues that making decisions is
   contingent upon temporal features of physicians' tasks. Physicians
   receive feedback at different speeds, and they must account for these
   speeds when judging what they can prioritize. This finding explains
   doctors' perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long
   feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product
   of shorter feedback loops. In these latter scenarios, physicians
   consider and deploy scientific knowledge after-and not before, as is
   usually assumed-determining a fruitful plan of action.

   of two organizations - Food Not Bombs in Orlando, FL and People's

   complicate and oftentimes blunt their transformative potential. In

   government intervention in local markets at the same time that they

   by passing anti-vendor legislation. This story not only offers a case
   study in how teams' monopolistic privilege has extended to concessions
   markets, but also contributes to a broader understanding of how the

AB The recent trend toward health care consumerism is largely the product
   of market practices, which have instilled the notion of health care as a
   product to be purchased by informed, empowered consumers, rather than a
   service bestowed upon a patient by a paternalistic provider. In recent
   years, health care consumerism has been facilitated by
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of pharmaceutical products. In
   this paper, we use the case of DTCA for antidepressant medications to
   examine medicalization techniques used to promote consumerism and
   establish and expand the antidepressant market. We used content analysis
   of DTCA from the 1997-2006 issues of a broad sample of women's, men's,
   and common readership magazines to identify techniques of
   medicalization, and we analyzed in-depth interviews with magazine
   readers and antidepressant users to examine how such messages are
   received. Findings are presented within a framework of economic
   sociology, which allowed us to unveil the links between emotions and
   social action that undergird responses to medicalization techniques and
   consumption of advertised products.

AB The aim of this article is to theorize how materials can play an active,
   constitutive, and causally effective role in the production and
   sustenance of cultural forms and meanings. It does so through an
   empirical exploration of the Museum of Modern Art of New York (MoMA).
   The article describes the museum as an "objectification machine" that
   endeavors to transform and to stabilize artworks as meaningful "objects"
   that can be exhibited, classified, and circulated. The article explains
   how the extent to which the museum succeeds in this process of
   stabilization ultimately depends on the material properties of artworks
   and, more specially, on whether these behave as "docile" or "unruly"
   objects. Drawing on different empirical examples, the article explores
   how docile and unruly objects shape organizational dynamics within the
   museum and, through them, the wider processes of institutional and
   cultural reproduction. The article uses this empirical example to
   highlight the importance of developing a new "material sensibility" that
   restores heuristic dignity to the material within cultural sociology.

AB Social scientists are well-trained to observe and chart social trends,
   but less experienced at presenting scientific findings in formats that
   can inform social change work. In this article, I propose a new
   theoretical concept that provides a mechanism by which social science
   research can be more effectively applied for proactive policy,
   organizational, and program development. The approach is to use the
   metaphor of "desire paths" from landscape architecture to show how
   social scientists can identify and analyze social desire paths that
   appear on the social structural landscape. Social desire paths usually
   emerge because existing formal structures do not meet individual or
   group needs. Such paths are generally started at the individual level,
   followed by others through individual actions, and ultimately leave an
   (usually informal) imprint on the social structure, even though the
   motivations behind those actions are not usually social change. Using
   what we know about the sociology of interests and what we have learned
   from trying to apply social science findings to policy, I propose seven
   criteria for phenomena to be defined as social desire paths. I then
   apply the criteria to two case studies related to housing, and discuss
   social desire paths usefulness to social scientists involved in any
   research that captures interests, deviance, or innovation; and that also
   has the potential to inform formal structures such as policy,
   organizations, program development, and participatory democracy.

AB Although sociologists have long studied public emergency rooms (ERs) and
   their service delivery to the urban poor, little is known about how
   crime control and criminal justice contact affect ER admission
   decisions-a critical oversight given the documented increase in
   incarceration rates, intensification of policing, and proliferation of
   crime control language in public institutions. Using ethnographic
   methods and a count of ER admission decisions (N = 1,114), this article
   describes the continual rushing and delaying of medical resources to
   patients based on their perceived criminality or actual relationship to
   the criminal justice system. These dynamics develop through four
   processes: (1) widespread administration of pain medication, which
   associates waiting patients with criminal narcotics; (2) deployment of
   criminal stigma along race and gender lines to select some qualified
   patients over others; (3) patrolling of waiting rooms by police; and (4)
   rushing of beds to vast numbers of arrestees, inmates, and witnesses.
   Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of
   the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources,
   but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are
   policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.

AB As efforts are made to contain health care spending, the decision to
   stop trying to cure severely ill patients and focus on comfort care has
   become an economic as well as a moral issue. This article examines the
   intricate intersection of economics and morality in U. S. hospice care.
   Using historical, interview, and ethnographic methods, I explain the
   resonance between hospice practitioners' moral motivations and
   policymakers', insurers', and providers' efforts to economize near the
   end of life. Drawing on theoretical literature on morality in markets, I
   analyze the moralization of economic scarcity. I argue that rather than
   posing an external financial constraint on the achievement of moral
   goals, scarcity itself can bear moral meanings. In the case of hospice
   care, the view that "less is better" and the wish to save patients from
   over-treatment converge with financial interests to limit spending on
   end-of-life care and imbue financial constraints with positive moral
   meanings.

   strategies typically used by sociology majors, whether and to what
   extent they engage in metacognitive strategies, and whether teaching
   about learning results in students reporting greater use of
   self-regulatory behaviors. I discuss the importance of self-regulated
   learning and metacognition for student success and describe the ways in
   which I incorporated instruction in these skills into an undergraduate
   theory course. Data collected over the past five semesters illustrate
   the positive effects of these activities on student motivation and use
   of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Students report greater use
   of higher-level cognitive learning strategies such as critical thinking
   and are more intrinsically motivated as a result of taking the course.
   This quantitative investigation of students' use of cognitive and
   metacognitive skills adds to McKinney's (2007) qualitative research on

AB Undergraduate students often have trouble interpreting cultures other
   than that with which they are familiar in a way that takes into account
   the symbols and meanings that explain behaviors, objects, and
   ideologies. Instead, many fall into the trap of making ethnocentric
   assumptions and coming to conclusions that are informed by their own
   cultural perspectives. This in-class active learning exercise makes the
   familiar strange, using Horace Miner's well-known 1956 essay Body Ritual
   among the Nacirema to introduce students to an etic, cultural
   outsider-like description of American culture. Using short excerpts from
   Miner's article, students draw pictures of Miner's descriptions,
   producing a wide variety of interpretations. This activity demonstrates
   that when students overlook or misunderstand cultural meaning, they can
   come to myriad inaccurate depictions and conclusions about social life
   and behavior. It therefore reinforces the importance of developing an
   emic understanding of cultures, rather than accepting social phenomena
   at face value.

AB The authors examine the popularity of boys' given names in Beijing
   before and after the onset of the Cultural Revolution to clarify how
   exogenous and endogenous factors interact to shape fashion. Whereas
   recent work in the sociology of culture emphasizes the importance of
   endogenous processes in explaining fashion, their analysis demonstrates
   two ways in which politics shaped cultural expression during the
   Cultural Revolution: by promoting forms of expression reflecting
   prevailing political ideology and by limiting individuals' willingness
   to act differently. As argued by Lieberson and developed further in this
   article, the second condition is important because endogenous fashion
   cycles require a critical mass of individuals who seek to differentiate
   themselves from common practice. Exogenous factors can influence the
   operation of the endogenous factors. The authors discuss the
   implications of their study for understanding the nature of conformity
   under authoritarian regimes and social conditions supporting individual
   expression.

AB Shiao, Bode, Beyer, and Selvig argue that the theory of race as a social

   they interpret as demonstrating that human biological variation is
   patterned in clinal classes that are homologous to races. In this reply,
   I examine both their claims and the genetics literature they cite,
   concluding that not only does constructivist theory already accommodate
   the contemporary study of human biology, but few geneticists portray
   their work as bearing on race. Equally important, methods for
   statistically identifying DNA-based clusters within the human species
   are shaped by several design features that offer opportunities for the
   incorporation of cultural assumptions about difference. As a result,
   Shiao et al.'s theoretical distinction between social race and

   our best attempts at objectively recording natural human groupings are

AB A basic premise of diffusion theories is that actors vary in their
   susceptibility to social influence and yet little is known about the
   nature and consequences of such heterogeneity in specific market
   domains. The present study examines variation in social influence with
   respect to academic research and citation accumulation. Based on
   theories of uncertainty, signaling, and legitimacy, the main hypothesis
   is that disciplinary outsiders are more likely than insiders to cite
   papers that are already highly cited. The empirical analysis, which
   spans six disciplines and 13 flagship journals, is based on over 800
   articles and the 55,000+ citations they accumulate over a 20-year
   period. Each citation received is classified with respect to both its
   timing and the discipline from which it was sent. The results show that
   the effect of prior citation attention is greater for external citation
   accumulation even after controlling for the fact that externals adopt
   later on average than internals. Contrary to intuition, however,
   outsiders do not appear to uniformly exacerbate citation inequality. The
   broader implications of this study for diffusion and the sociology of
   science are discussed in the conclusion.

AB In aesthetic terms, the category of 'sound' is often split in two:
   'noise', which is chaotic, unfamiliar, and offensive; and 'music', which
   is harmonious, resonant, and divine. These opposing concepts are brought
   together in the phenomenon of Noise Music, but how do practitioners make
   sense of this apparent discordance? Analyses that treat recorded media
   as primary texts declare Noise Music to be a failure, as a genre without
   progress. These paint Noise as a polluted form in an antagonistic
   relationship with traditional music. But while critiques often point to
   indeterminate structure as indicative of the aesthetic project's
   limitations, we claim that indeterminacy itself becomes central to
   meaningful expression when the social context of Noise is considered.
   Through observational and interview data, we consider the contexts,
   audiences, and producers of contemporary American Noise Music.
   Synthesizing the performance theories of Hennion and Alexander, we
   demonstrate how indeterminacy situated in structured interaction allows
   for meaning-making and sustains a musical form based in claims to
   inclusion, access, and creative freedom. We show how interaction, not
   discourse, characterizes the central performance that constructs the
   meaning of Noise.

   involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than
   bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural
   conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its

AB Emile Durkheim summarily rejected Gabriel Tarde's imitation thesis,
   arguing that sociology need only concern itself with social suicide
   rates. Over a century later, a burgeoning body of suicide research has
   challenged Durkheim's claim to a general theory of suicide as 4 decades
   worth of evidence has firmly established that (1) there is a positive
   association between the publicization of celebrity suicides and a spike
   in the aggregate suicide rate, (2) some social environments are
   conducive to epidemic-like outbreaks of suicides, and (3) suicidal ideas
   or behavior spreads to some individuals exposed to a personal role
   model's suicidal behavior-for example, a friend or family member.
   Revisiting Tarde, the article examines why Tarde's theory deserves
   renewed attention, elucidates what he meant by imitation, and then
   formalizes his "laws" into testable theses, while suggesting future
   research questions that would advance the study of suicide, as well as
   other pathologies. Each "law" is elaborated by considering advances in
   contemporary social psychology as well as in light of its ability to
   supplement Durkheim's theory in explaining the "outlier" cases.

   account for their decisions whether or not to run for public office. I
   illuminate how these "deciding to run" narratives reflect racialized

AB Do historically contingent political accounts help explain the growth in

   regressions based on 60 years to detect such relationships by assessing
   interactive associations between the neoliberal departure coincident
   with Ronald Reagan's election and the acceleration in inequality that
   began soon after Reagan took office. We find evidence for this and for a
   second contingent relationship: stronger unions could successfully
   resist policies that enhanced economic inequality only before Reagan's
   presidency and before the neoliberal anti-union administrations from
   both parties that followed Reagan. Politically inspired reductions in
   union membership, and labor's diminished political opportunities during
   and after Reagan's presidency, meant unions no longer could slow the
   growth in U.S. inequality. Coefficients on these two historically
   contingent interactions remain significant after many additional
   determinants are held constant. These findings indicate that political
   determinants should not be neglected when researchers investigate the
   determinants of U.S. inequality.

AB One of the most important components of Antonio Gramsci's social theory
   is his discussion of political strategy, particularly his distinction
   between 'war of maneuver' and 'war of position'. For Gramsci, the
   classical model of revolution through military insurrection (war of
   maneuver) has been supplanted within advanced capitalism by a cultural
   struggle of much longer duration and complexity (war of position).
   Despite the significance of Gramsci's analysis of war of maneuver/war of
   position for contemporary Marxism, it is striking that so little
   attention has been paid to these terms. These terms have a history, both
   in military theory and in Marxism, which predates Gramsci's prison
   notebooks. An examination of the military writings of Engels, Lenin and
   Trotsky, which are grounded more directly on military theory, leads to
   different conclusions about the nature of political strategy and the
   relationship between war of maneuver and war of position.

AB What is the role of measurement in the sociology of culture and how can
   we sort out the complexities that distinguish qualitative from
   quantitative approaches to this domain? In this article, we compare the
   issues and concerns of contemporary scholars who work on matters of
   culture with the writings of a group of scholars who had prepared papers
   for a special symposium on scientific measurement held at the annual
   meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science
   (AAAS) back in 1956. We focus on three issues-the recurring need to
   reinvent measurement (as illustrated by the career of the psychologist
   S.S. Stevens), the linkage between qualitative and quantitative methods
   of analysis (as articulated in the writings of the sociologist Paul
   Lazarsfeld), and the assertion (by philosophers Ernst Cassirer and Peter
   Caws) that theorizing necessarily precedes measuring. We review a number
   of important advances in the way that measurement is theorized and
   implemented in the sociology of culture and we also point to a number of
   enduring dilemmas and conundrums that continue to occupy researchers in
   the field today.

AB This article develops a theory of humor and uses it to assess the
   attempt to measure meaning-structures in cultural sociology. To
   understand how humor operates, researchers need to attend to two layers
   of cultural competencies: general typifications and situation-specific
   know-how. These cultural competencies are then invoked in ways that
   define humor as a specific form of experiential frame-the bi-sociation
   of meaning, its condensation, and resonance with experienced tensions in
   the social world. I show the usefulness of this theorization through the
   empirical case of AIDS humor in Malawi, a small country in South-East
   Africa. Using conversational diaries, everyday interactions, and
   newspaper cartoons, I argue both that such humor is widespread and that
   it reveals important facets of life in a country ravaged by the
   pandemic-what it means for the shadow of AIDS to be ever-present.
   Through this case, I then turn back to the question of measurement,
   arguing that although measuring tools may be able to identify
   large-scale semantic shifts, they necessarily miss forms of interaction
   such as humor, that are based on allusion, condensation, and what is
   left unsaid.

AB When it comes to making aesthetic decisions, people commonly account for
   their taste with intuition. A cultural good, symbol, or object is simply
   right and respondents "know it when they see it." This article
   investigates the cultural meanings professional tastemakers see as they
   make such deliberations, while also illustrating the problems
   sociologists have in seeing culture. Using the case of fashion model
   casting and scouting, I present four methods to trace how cultural
   producers recognize and value models' looks in the global fashion
   market, demonstrating how each method results in a different emphasis on
   how culture is used to acquire and deploy aesthetic sense. First,
   interviews capture justifications of aesthetic decisions, as well as
   general processes about day-to-day work routines, which are next tested
   with network analysis, the second method, which emphasizes structural
   arrangements in taste decisions. The third method, ethnography,
   discovers taste as a situated form of knowledge production and
   emphasizes culture in interaction. The fourth and related method,
   observant participation, sees taste as phenomenological as culture
   becomes embodied and tacit consciousness. Each of these methods is an
   optical device that renders a particular and complimentary account of
   taste and affords researchers a certain way to see how culture works.

AB Moral culture can mean many things, but two major elements are a concern
   with moral goods and moral prohibitions. Moral psychologists have
   developed instruments for assessing both of these and such measures can
   be directly imported by sociologists. Work by Schwartz and his
   colleagues on values offers a well-established way of measuring moral
   goods, while researchers using Haidt's Moral Foundations Theory have
   developed validated measures of moral prohibitions. Both values and
   moral foundations are distributed across the social landscape in
   systematic, sociologically interesting ways. Although typically measured
   using questionnaires, we show that values and moral foundations also can
   be used to analyze interview, archival, or "big data." Combining
   psychological and sociological tools and frameworks promises to clarify
   relations among existing sociological treatments of moral culture and to
   connect such treatments to a thriving conversation in moral psychology.

AB Building on a long tradition of measuring cultural logics from a
   relational perspective, we analyze a recent survey of American
   university students to assess whether institutional logics operate in
   the lived experience of individuals. An institutional logic is an
   analytic troika of object, practice, and subject linked together through
   dually ordered systems of articulations. Using the formal method of
   correspondence analysis (MCA) we identify two latent dimensions that
   order physical, verbal, emotional, categorical, and moral practices of
   and investments in love. We take these dimensions as evidence of an
   institutional logic. The dominant first dimension is organized through
   talk of love, non-genital physical intimacies, and affective investment.
   It has no sexual specificity. The subsidiary second dimension is
   organized through moral investment and it has a genital sexual
   specificity. There is little difference between women and men, either in
   the way these dimensions are organized or in the location of men and
   women within these dimensionalized spaces. We find that romantic love
   has a situated material effect in terms of increasing the probabilities
   of orgasm.

AB Recent research and theory at the intersection of cultural sociology and
   network analysis have converged around the notion of cultural holes:
   patterns of cultural choice that position the person as a bridge not
   between other persons but between cultural worlds. This is an approach
   that promises to open up new vistas in our conceptualization of the
   relationship between social position and cultural taste, but that so far
   lacks operational grounding. In this article, I draw on Breiger's (1974)
   formalization of the idea of the duality of persons and groups along
   with classical formalizations of brokerage for sociometric networks
   (Burt 1992) to suggest that the "cultural ego network" of a typical
   survey respondent can be reconstructed from patterns of audience overlap
   among the cultural items that are chosen by each respondent. This leads
   to a formalization of the notion of omnivorousness as relatively low
   levels of clustering in the cultural network: namely, omnivorousness as
   cultural network efficiency. I show how this metric overcomes the
   difficulties that have plagued previous attempts to produce ordinal
   indicators of omnivorousness from simple counts of the number of
   cultural choices, while providing novel substantive (and sometime
   counter-intuitive) insights into the relationship between
   socio-demographic status markers and patterns of cultural choice in the
   contemporary United States.

AB The rise of culture in economic studies has resulted in systematic
   investigations of the shared meanings that shape markets, economic
   decisions, and outcomes. A number of social scientists have a)
   privileged the heterogeneity of meanings within organizations and groups
   over monolithic accounts, b) used thick description and single or
   comparative case studies to investigate the incessant contestations over
   meanings and the corresponding actions facilitated, and c) have
   developed empirically testable propositions without insisting on the
   reduction of meanings to simple principles embedded in structures. This
   line of work does not deny that relatively stable cultural meanings
   exist or that parsimony is possible. Instead, it offers a parallel track
   privileging three modes of analysis: 1) the identification of discursive
   inflection points as leading indicators of market takeoffs, privileging
   thick minimalism over parsimony; 2) breached sequence analyses of
   transactions, highlighting experimental methods; and 3) relational
   analyses of networks and contested circuits, tying situated negotiations
   to overarching cultural structures. The article concludes with a plea to
   keep cultural analyses interpretive, historically grounded, and
   intuitively attuned to the meanings of social life.

AB While there is an extensive subfield in sociology studying the sources,
   content, and consequences of collective memory, the study of future
   projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with
   the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not
   happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be
   studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives,
   performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I
   call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened,
   future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot
   project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the
   online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
   Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de
   Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public
   interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green
   economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their
   temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network
   mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level
   of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive,
   imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and
   oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of
   future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes
   of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation,
   institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.

AB The rise of the Internet, social media, and digitized historical
   archives has produced a colossal amount of text-based data in recent
   years. While computer scientists have produced powerful new tools for
   automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical
   direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural
   sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins
   of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond
   micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that
   adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for
   automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First,
   I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the
   contours of cultural environments. Second, I discuss the potential of
   automated text-classification methods to classify different types of
   culture such as frames, schema, or symbolic boundaries. Finally, I
   explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional
   qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements
   over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and
   cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several
   challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of
   information about the social context in which texts are produced, the
   construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated
   algorithmically, and the relatively high entry costs for cultural
   sociologists who wish to develop the technical expertise currently
   necessary to work with big data.

   the opportunity and challenge of defining the core knowledge and skills

   of students (N = 280) enrolled in 12 sections of a thematically-focused
   Introductory Sociology course presents our attempt to both define and
   assess a core set of concepts and skills through a pretest-posttest
   questionnaire to measure student learning gains relative to: (1) a
   sociological perspective, (2) sociological theory, (3) research methods,
   and (4) key concepts in sociology. Results show significant learning
   gains on all four dimensions, with the greatest gains coming in
   sociological theory. There were no significant differences in pretest
   scores by gender or by whether students had taken a sociology course in
   high school. Seniors scored significantly higher on both the pretest and
   the posttest, but after we controlled for pretest scores seniors did
   significantly better only on the subset of questions related to
   sociological theory. Students who took a sociology course in high school
   scored lower on the methods subscale of the posttest and had lower
   overall total posttest scores than their counterparts.

AB Theorized as a Bourdieusian field, this article examines changes inside

   as art and some actors taking 'fine art' positions within it. The
   category of tattoo art is distinct from tattoo because it positions the
   practice away from its traditional historic moorings as a lowbrow craft
   and occupation requiring a rudimentary level of technical skill. In
   contrast, tattoo art is created and evaluated within academic discourses
   and traditional fine art ideologies that stress innovation, creativity,
   and exclusivity. In addition to mastery of the medium, that is, applying
   the tattoo to skin, tattoo artists create original works that qualify as
   artistic by art world conventions. This process of artification has
   changed the symbolic meanings and valuation of a practice, imbuing
   tattoo art with cultural legitimacy from the inside.

   varies by network position in both industries, even when controlling for

   conventional thinking on international specialization. Moreover, these
   networks matter only during the period after which the two types of

   logic of the two industries, and are more important for manufacturing
   specialization in the transport-equipment industry. The article

   techniques to test an integrative perspective based on direct and
   indirect effects, taken from human ecology, ecological economics,

   natural sciences. We find evidence for the conjuncture of many of the
   theories investigated and for contextualizing the footprint in a global
   network of causes. The model raises questions about conclusions reached
   in prior analyses based on direct effects only. The significant roles
   played by natural and economic forces suggest a need to attend to

AB In a new theory of conflict escalation, Randall Collins engages critical
   issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible
   theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He
   also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of
   social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative
   concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no
   mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his
   variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a
   computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of
   Collins's theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an
   agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With
   greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my
   alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory
   development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not
   found in Collins's model.

AB Sociologists have yet to theorize interactions with sonic materiality.
   In this article I introduce an analytical concept for the observation of
   interactions with sound. Sound has material effects in all situations.
   But the audibility of sonic objects is a relation of situated actors to
   material arrangements. Sonic object settings are dynamic material
   arrangements in which sonic qualities emerge for interpretation. The
   concept synthesizes research on sonic materiality, audibility, and
   interaction. After outlining the concept, I present an empirical
   illustration from an audio firm's R&D laboratory arranged to support a
   new technology called object-based audio. I observed engineers
   conducting two concurrent but contrasting experiments; results indicate
   how settings both enable and constrain the interpretation of sound.

   the dominant theories of culture in action from cultural sociology are
   limited by their adoption of the individual as the primordial unit of
   analysis. I instead propose a model of culture in action that takes
   social situations as its primordial unit and that understands culture as
   a system of meanings that actors laminate into the situations they face
   through interactive processes of interpretation and performance. I then
   illustrate and develop the model through an analysis of the Great Stink

   against methodological tribalism. Drawing on our own work and on other
   sources, we discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of
   interviewing. We argue that concern over whether attitudes correspond to
   behavior is an overly narrow and misguided question. Instead we offer
   that we should instead consider what interviewing and other data
   gathering techniques are best suited for. In our own work, we suggest,
   we have used somewhat unusual interviewing techniques to reveal how
   institutional systems and the construction of social categories,
   boundaries, and status hierarchies organize social experience. We also
   point to new methodological challenges, particularly concerning the
   incorporation of historical and institutional dimensions into
   interview-based studies. We finally describe fruitful directions for
   future research, which may result in methodological advances while
   bringing together the strengths of various data collection techniques.

AB Can consumers be socially responsible? Can the interests of consumers,
   corporations, and the overall society be reconciled? Traditionally,
   sociologists have conceptualized consumerism as enhancing individual
   wellbeing at the expense of moral citizenship. Yet throughout US
   history, popular discourse has linked consumption to the social good.
   Business schools currently expound this belief in their 'principles of
   marketing' courses. Popular textbooks promote 'relationship management
   marketing' which teaches students to target their most profitable
   customers, develop life-long relationships with them, and promote the
   societal concerns that they care about. The textbooks maintain that
   corporations are well-equipped to address the societal concerns of
   profitable customers through the use of cause marketing, granted minimal
   government interference. We describe this worldview as 'neoliberal
   consumer citizenship' and discuss its implications for social theory and
   a democratic society.

AB This essay examines the role played by Soviet sociology in the USSR's

   the critique of Soviet socio-economic life during the 1980s, identifying
   the emergence of two divergent viewpoints within Soviet sociology over
   the relationship between inequality, the market, and the goals of a
   socialist society. The essay explores how these viewpoints intersected
   with the implementation of economic reforms by the Gorbachev regime,
   arguing that the dominant forces within Soviet sociology ultimately
   helped the party-state bureaucracy craft the legitimizing ideology of
   perestroika by insisting that growing social inequality and market-based
   mechanisms of distribution were the very embodiment of socialism. After
   enduring a politically fraught and semi-pariah existence for much of its
   history, Soviet sociology enjoyed a belle epoque as it helped the ruling
   elite navigate the transition to capitalism.

AB Scholars have recently called attention to the changing nature of the
   American university in the wake of the current economic downturn.
   Considering the transformative nature of knowledge production in the
   United States, we introduce the concept of intellectual closure in
   illustration of the unintended outcomes of individual decisions and
   career trajectories as they operate under the forces of social closure.
   Intellectual closure is defined as subtle and hidden forms of constraint
   on individual agency. Intellectual closure includes calculative thinking
   about how to publish in flagship journals, avoidance of high-risk
   projects, and preference for short-term projects with more immediate
   rewards. Structural constraints, specifically within sociology, are
   enabling the emergence of narrower perspectives and eroding former
   professional norms as individual decisions aggregate, unintentionally,
   to constitute a more competitive discipline with narrower definitions of
   productivity and quality.

AB Anarchism has not had a noticeable impact upon sociology. The two

   to it. This paper contrasts the practitioners or thinkers of one
   tradition against the other. The analysis shows some strong antagonisms,
   many instances of close analysis and critique of each other's
   perspectives, and a number of friendly and supportive relationships
   between anarchists and sociologists. Anarchists tended to admire the
   intellectual rigor of sociologists, but thought sociologists were
   insiders - mere reformers at best, reactionaries at worst - content to
   study society, but rarely to act for its improvement. Sociologists
   viewed anarchists with an even wider range of opinion, including
   considering them principled and admirable revolutionaries, slightly
   naive utopians, or criminals and chaos-lovers bent on the destruction of
   social order. These factors contributed to the exclusion of anarchist
   ideas and anarchists themselves from the sociological canon.

AB A central theme of economic sociology has been to highlight the
   complexity and diversity of real world markets, but many network models
   of economic social structure ignore this feature and rely instead on
   stylized one-dimensional characterizations. Here, the authors return to
   the basic insight of structural diversity in economic sociology. Using
   the Indian interorganizational ownership network as their case, they
   discover a composite-or "hybrid"-model of economic networks that
   combines elements of prior stylized models. The network contains a
   disconnected periphery conforming closely to a "transactional" model; a
   semiperiphery characterized by small, dense clusters with sporadic
   links, as predicted in "small world" models; and finally a nested core
   composed of clusters connected via multiple independent paths. The
   authors then show how a firm's position within the mesolevel structure
   is associated with demographic features such as age and industry and
   differences in the extent to which firms engage in multiplex and
   high-value exchanges.

AB This article examines the methodological implications of the fact that
   what people say is often a poor predictor of what they do. We argue that
   many interview and survey researchers routinely conflate self-reports
   with behavior and assume a consistency between attitudes and action. We
   call this erroneous inference of situated behavior from verbal accounts
   the attitudinal fallacy. Though interviewing and ethnography are often
   lumped together as "qualitative methods," by juxtaposing studies of
   "culture in action" based on verbal accounts with ethnographic
   investigations, we show that the latter routinely attempts to explain
   the "attitude-behavior problem" while the former regularly ignores it.
   Because meaning and action are collectively negotiated and
   context-dependent, we contend that self-reports of attitudes and
   behaviors are of limited value in explaining what people actually do
   because they are overly individualistic and abstracted from lived
   experience.

AB Negotiations about reparations tend to take the language of interests
   and to deal primarily with monetary compensation for disadvantaged
   groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are likely to make a
   variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience,
   ranging from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the
   entire process altogether. This article draws attention to the
   communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims
   that actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they
   hold sacred, but simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of
   self-worth and to elicit identification by raising moral critiques about
   the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005
   removal of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It
   shows that settlers indeed demanded to be compensated fiscally for their
   lost property. At the same time, it shows that they raised objections to
   the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered
   alternate logics of evaluation. The settlers resisted shame and
   devaluation through such competing logics, demanding that the state
   reaffirm a positive and embracing relationship with them despite its
   decision to evict them.

   sociological content into community service classes. The authors
   supplemented a community service course at a large public university
   with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest
   that this integration increased student understanding of the social
   structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served,
   sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and
   discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation
   of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and
   facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of
   populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We

   beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

   within the social construction of gender norms, the sexualization of
   girls and women negatively impacts individual, interpersonal, and
   societal levels of social interaction. Nevertheless, this important
   issue remains under-explored in the sociology of teaching and learning.
   This article reports on a pedagogical module that utilizes a multimedia
   presentation to define and illustrate the sexualization of girls and
   women. Lesson impacts were assessed through an online survey. Results
   indicate a critical gap between the social importance of this topic and
   educational exposure. Students unanimously recommended this module be
   taught in introductory sociology courses and offered specific examples
   of individual and interpersonal impacts. Our findings suggest an ongoing
   need to address the sexualization of girls and women inside, and
   outside, of the classroom.

   toward HIV/AIDS. We report on how stigma affected the service learning
   and other elements of the course, calling for adjustments to our
   pedagogical approach. We also report how the course was evaluated in a
   pretest/posttest assessment on attitudes toward people living with
   HIV/AIDS [PLWHA] (enacted stigma) and hypothetical reactions to being
   diagnosed with HIV (felt stigma). The results indicated greater
   tolerance for PLWHA following the class but also greater awareness of
   HIV stigma and its outcomes. We offer recommendations to help
   instructors avoid stigma-related materials and events that could
   jeopardize service learning and course objectives for sensitive topics
   such as HIV/AIDS.

   introductory-level sociology course syllabi published in TRAILS, the
   Teaching Resources and Innovations Library of the American Sociological
   Association, from two different time periods (2004 and 2010) to explore
   the syllabus as a tool for socialization. We find that syllabi,
   commended for their attention to pedagogical practice, do more than
   communicate course objectives and the means for achieving them. Syllabi
   (re)socialize students for success in the college setting by
   establishing student-teacher roles and norms and setting the tone for
   classroom interactions. The integration of sociological concepts and
   perspectives into syllabi also immerses students into the discipline and
   practice of sociology.

AB Instructors frequently utilize breaching experiments in an attempt to
   bring sociology to life. However, an uncritical embrace of breaching
   experiments obscures the complexity of their possible effects on
   participants and subjects. These experiments have real potential to
   inflict deleterious consequences on individuals and groups.
   Additionally, the presence of videos of breaching experiments on the
   Internet raises questions about activities students are carrying out and
   publicly touting as sociological practice. By giving greater
   consideration to the embeddedness of the breaching experiment and its
   practitioners in the broader social world, students and instructors can
   create breaching experiments that are enlightening while still
   manifesting an appreciation of their effects on the experiments'
   subjects and perhaps even making a contribution to the amelioration or
   transformation of the structures within which they take place.

AB Building on recent research emphasizing how legitimacy depends on
   consensus among audiences about candidates' characteristics and
   activities, we examine the relationship between cultural producers'
   (candidates) position in the social structure and the consecration of
   their creative work by relevant audiences. We argue that the outcome of
   this process of evaluation in any cultural field, whether in art or
   science, is a function of (1) candidates' embeddedness within the field,
   and (2) the type of audience-that is, peers versus critics-evaluating
   candidates' work. Specifically, we hypothesize that peers are more
   likely to favor candidates who are highly embedded in the field, whereas
   critics will not show such favoritism. We find support for these
   hypotheses in the context of the Hollywood motion picture industry.

AB Whichever nomenclature is used to describe the study of black peoples

   the approach that is taken is critically important to academia in terms
   of its potential to provide a direct response and challenge to the
   intrinsic Eurocentric and Orientalist bias of the US educational system.
   Unlike other area and ethnic studies disciplines, this field was
   established as a link between the community and academia. However, in
   recent history, approaches have become polarized and the field has lost
   momentum as a consequence of arbitrary boundaries and politicized
   knowledge. In this article, the Orientalist perspective and Afro-centric
   knowledge in Black Studies are examined in their historical and
   political context. This analysis culminates in a proposed approach to
   use the Sociology of Africa as a new model for Afro-centric knowledge
   and teaching in this field.

AB 'Africana Sociology' begins with a reappraisal of the 'image of Africa'
   in the form of sociology's theoretical narrative about modernity's
   spatial and temporal order. Early sociologists, like Auguste Comte and
   Lester Ward, conceived sociology as a secular discourse, although it
   transmitted Protestant values that reduced people of African descent to
   fetish objects. In the work of Charles H. Long, the 'image of Africa'
   appears in the African American religious imagination because it - more
   than the land in which Blacks were enslaved - authenticated their
   origins. In my appropriation of the concept, it is a semiotic device
   that, through its dialectical relationship with the 'image of
   involuntary presence', structures sociology's narrative form. Like in
   the work of W. E.B. Du Bois, the image of Africa designates the American
   nation as a site of crisis, while imbuing Black subjectivity with a
   wider consciousness of modernity.

AB African American women are continually engaged in challenging
   invisibility, marginalization, and exclusion. Africana Sociology has the
   potential to support these efforts by incorporating key conceptual
   models and constructs from Black Sociology, Afrocentricity, and
   Transdisciplinary Applied Social Justice (TASJ (c)). Africana Sociology
   should recognize the role of intersectionality and socially-constructed
   and intertwined race, class, and gender identities; it should
   acknowledge the importance of African-centered thought, including the
   role of Ma'at; and it should reflect a commitment to praxis -using
   theory to transform social institutions and thus, social outcomes. With
   this conceptual foundation, Africana Sociology can serve as a
   theoretical, methodological, and practical approach for implementing
   transformative change in the experiences of African Americans, and
   African American women, in particular.

AB This essay seeks to contribute to the development of an African-centered
   sociological approach to examine Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer, and intersexed identities and performances. While
   sociologists using the most progressive approaches outline the Western
   hegemonic nature of Africana peoples' perceptions of gender and
   sexuality, neither approach allows sociologists to view the relationship
   between social formations, human consciousness, and cosmological
   patterns. African-centered social scientists and social theorists
   typically determine that Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
   queer, and intersexed identities and performances are outside of
   Africana humanity. Within this essay, the author relies upon the Kemetic
   Anunian cosmology and personality constructs as sources through which to
   develop an African-centered framework to explain the multiple
   expressions of Africana gender and sexuality. This model considers that
   one's gender and sexuality are contained within and inseparable from
   one's higher-self that animates one's existence. This work, then, opens
   the door for further theory development and praxis in the emerging field
   of African-centered sociology and African-centered gender and sexuality
   studies within the discipline of Africana studies.

   conceptual framework in the study of Africana life, history, and
   culture. This conceptual framework has been utilized and expanded on by
   those developing scholarship in the sub-discipline areas of Africana
   Studies, including African-centered psychology, history, and literature.
   However, to date the articulation of an African-centered sociology,
   grounded in an African-centered conceptual framework, has not developed;
   neither has it occurred for African-centered sociology as a
   sub-discipline of Africana Studies, a sub-discipline of traditional
   sociology, or as a stand-alone discipline, itself. After a review of the
   worldview concept and framework and an analysis of the intellectual
   history of Black Sociology, this article then discusses the possibility
   of an African-centered sociology contingent upon the usage of an African
   worldview as the conceptual framework. Finally, the impacts of an
   African-centered epistemology and African-centered social theory are
   considered for the future of African-centered sociology.

   they chose to give birth at home and eschew traditional Western medical
   birthing practices. The women asserted that (1) a desire for control,
   (2) avoiding pharmacological pain relief, and (3) dissatisfaction with
   the medical aspects of intrapartum care were all central in their
   decision-making process. Finally, the participants also alluded to a

AB In the 1860s and 1870s, the feudal monarchy of the Tokugawa shogunate,
   which had ruled Japan for over two centuries, was overthrown, and the
   entire political order it had commanded was dismantled. This immense
   political transformation, comparable in its results to the great social
   revolutions of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in the West,
   was distinctive for lacking a major role for mass political
   mobilization. Since popular political action was decisive elsewhere for
   both providing the force for social revolutions to defeat old regimes
   and for pushing revolutionary leaders to more radical policies, the
   Meiji Restoration's combination of revolutionary outcomes with
   conservative personnel and means is puzzling. This article argues that
   previous accounts fail to explain why a group of relatively low-status
   samurai-administrative functionaries with some hereditary political
   privileges but in fact little secure power within the old regime-was
   able to overcome far more deeply entrenched political actors. To explain
   this, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between two political
   processes: the long-standing political relations of feudal monarchy and
   magnate lords and the unprecedented emergence of independent samurai
   political action and organizations cutting across domain boundaries. It
   was the interaction of these two processes that produced the overthrow
   of the Tokugawa and enabled the revolutionary outcomes that followed it.
   This article's revised explanation of the Meiji Restoration clearly
   places it within the same theoretical parameters as the major
   revolutions of the seventeenth century and later.

AB Extant research in organizational and economic sociology posits that
   organizations derive status from their prior demonstrations of quality,
   as well as their affiliations with high-status alters. Yet there are
   also indications that organizations may acquire status by virtue of
   their membership in salient social categories that are themselves status
   valued. In this article, the author explicitly theorizes and measure the
   concept of categorical status among organizations and test whether it
   influences the evaluation of organizational actions. More concretely,
   she develops a measure of industry status and test whether it affects
   the market reaction to U. S. firms announcing earnings restatements
   between 2000 and 2009. Results of the empirical analyses indicate that
   investors react less negatively to earnings restatements announced by
   firms from higher-status industries, supporting the argument that
   category status acts as a lens that shapes the extent to which an
   organization's actions are viewed favorably.

   to uncover a language of civil purity that people draw on to construct
   their own belonging in civil society. It argues that some people create
   an imagined public-at-large that they infuse with polluting qualities
   associated with the binary cultural codes of civil society. This image
   functions as a mental heuristic, against which people compare themselves
   and see themselves as better than' on a number of moral values
   associated with civil society. This process of constructing civil purity
   is linked to one of the civil sphere's two fundamental social
   institutions, namely communication. As a form of nonfiction media with
   record lows in trust and credibility, the mainstream news serves as a
   social topic through which we can witness the construction of civil

AB This essay reviews works in (political) sociology that offer
   alternatives to sociology-as-usual. Sociologists with even fleeting
   awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely
   familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward
   complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward
   existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience the
   complex contradictions of the social and political world' (Taylor, The
   New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind
   residues or traces,' and contributors in a recently edited volume
   challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces
   and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely,
   popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of
   deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to
   individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised
   by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the
   complexities of contemporary experiments in human being' are just the
   sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center
   of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite
   the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists
   should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential
   multiplicity.

AB Over the last few decades, a steady stream of books decry the decline of
   the public intellectual in modern life, while academics continue to
   express the desire to "make a difference" by producing research that
   contributes to the amelioration of social problems. In this context,
   this article draws on basic and applied research on transgender
   prisoners in California as a case study to address larger questions
   about the pursuit of knowledge, the creation of policy, the prompting of
   praxis, and the promise of justice. The empirical research on
   transgender prisoners in prisons for men presented in this article
   begins with a decidedly specific policy question (how to keep
   transgender prisoners safe from sexual assault in prison) and ends with
   basic research that interrogates the social organization and workings of
   gender (how is gender accomplished among transgender prisoners in
   prisons for men). Reviewing this research and presenting a few
   instructive digressions referred to as "sidebars" leads to two
   conclusions: (1) The line between basic and policy work cannot be
   effectively erased (nor should it be), and (2) basic and applied
   research can be treated as productively interdependent (i.e., take us to
   new research paths and generate new insights). By operating
   side-by-side, basic and policy research can provide us with general and
   particularistic understandings of social processes and structures that
   ultimately help us make a difference in the lives of those who suffer
   the most from systems of inequality, in this case transgender women
   subject to state authority.

AB Huge numbers of children participate in sports. However, kids and sports
   are rarely seen, much less systematically studied by sport sociologists.
   Our survey of the past decade of three major sport sociology journals
   illustrates a dearth of scholarly research on children and sport. While
   noting the few exceptions, we observe that sport studies scholars have
   placed a disproportionate amount of emphasis on studying sport media,
   and elite amateur, college, and professional athletes and sport
   organizations, while largely conceding the terrain of children's sports
   to journalists and to a handful of scholars whose work is not grounded
   in sport sociology. We probe this paradox, speculating why sport
   scholars focus so little on such a large and important object of study
   in sport studies. We end by outlining a handful of important scholarly
   questions for sport scholars, focusing especially on key questions in
   the burgeoning sociological and interdisciplinary fields of children and
   youth, bodies and health, and intersectional analyses of social
   inequality.

AB Scholars largely assume that hog production is following the same
   industrialization process as the integrated poultry industry. Since the
   collapse of hog farming in the 1990s, academics have anticipated that
   producers will eventually become trapped in contracts that leave the
   integrator with full control over the production process. Embedded in
   this prediction is an assumption that hog farmers respond to these
   productive pressures individually. Our analysis of the Carthage
   Management System suggests a different path for the hog commodity chain.
   The Carthage Management System is a conglomeration of business
   management firms that bring finishing hog farmers together to form
   limited liability corporations (LLCs) in the breed-to-wean stage of hog
   production. We use a sociology of agrifood framework to suggest that the
   nuances of hog production encourage the use of what we call folding
   corporations to limit liability in ways that profoundly transform the
   family farm. Corporations and individual hog farmers alike employ this
   creative LLC structure to deflect responsibility for the risks of hog
   production. We identify how folding corporations externalize the costs
   of production onto rural communities. Additional research is needed to
   better understand unfolding farmer identities, legal protections for
   farmers, how widespread organizational structures like Carthage
   Management System are, and their consequences for rural communities and
   the industrialization process.

   narratives wherever farmland, rangeland, and forestland appear
   "underutilized," particularly in the Global South. Though the means and
   motives of these acquisitions are diverse, the lens of "new enclosures"
   lends itself to focusing on their similarities. New enclosures surpass
   the enclosures of bygone centuries in scale and speed and in the
   plethora of resources they reach. Sociological interventions, both
   theoretical and applied, are needed to contextualize and concretize this
   burgeoning alienation of land rights and power contingencies across
   communities and continents.

AB Sociologists of (e)valuation have devoted considerable attention to
   understanding differences in evaluative practices across a number of
   fields. Yet, little is understood about how individuals learn about and
   navigate multivalent valid group styles within a single setting. As a
   social phenomenon, many accept how central processes of evaluation are
   to everyday life. Accordingly, scholars have attempted to link research
   on evaluation to processes of inequality. Nevertheless, the sociology of
   evaluation only has tenuous, often implicit connections to literature on
   inequality and disadvantage. This article addresses these two gaps.
   Drawing on over two-hundred hours of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban
   high school debate league, twenty-seven semi-structured interviews with
   league judges, and archival data, we illustrate how high school policy
   debate judges employ evaluative frames and link them to the
   implementation of evaluative practices in a disadvantaged setting. We
   show that the cultural meanings that emerge within the evaluation
   process-in this case, urban uplift and competition-stem from the
   conflicted context in which evaluation is occurring. We also make a
   first step toward applying the conceptual tools within the sociology of
   evaluation to a disadvantaged setting, and more broadly, suggest that
   micro-processes of evaluation are important to the study of urban
   inequality.

AB This article demonstrates precisely how issues of access-in this case
   differential access to informants and the scenes that they populate in
   three sites-can reveal substantive findings. In the case it features, a
   comparative study of small cities with growing populations of lesbian
   couples, actors' disparate and place-specific sexual identities produced
   disparate and place-specific responses to research. Integrationist
   sexual identities impeded access, whereas identity-politics orientations
   facilitated it. The paper identifies three mechanisms via which sexual
   identities influenced access: directly, by shaping informants'
   orientations to the research topic, and, indirectly, by influencing
   local networks and institutions that emerge from and reinforce local
   identities. By explicating one ethnographer's path from methodological
   trouble to substantive insight, the article traces the utility of an
   expansive and flexible reflexivity that begins with but extends beyond
   the researcher's identity and role. This reflexivity, the article
   proposes, encourages identification of substantive findings and the
   development of social theory, and can advance a comparative sociology of
   ethnographic access.

AB Using the 2009 Korean General Social Survey (N = 1,422), we examine (1)
   if religious variables affect suicide acceptability-attitudes and norms
   regarding the acceptability of suicide; and (2) whether religious
   variables dampen the otherwise strong effects of stress on suicide
   acceptability. We find that Protestantism, religious attendance, and
   religious salience are associated with lower levels of suicide
   acceptability. Yet, the negative impact of Protestantism is entirely
   mediated by religious attendance and salience. Moreover, the effects of
   stress on suicide acceptability are attenuated for those who have higher
   levels of religious attendance and salience. These results have
   important implications for understanding suicide acceptability and
   suicide, especially the Protestant-Catholic differences first recognized
   by Emile Durkheim.

AB The social stratification that takes place during the transition out of
   high school is traditionally explained with theoretical frameworks such
   as status attainment and social reproduction. In our paper, we suggest
   the cumulative dis/advantage hypothesis as an alternative theoretical
   and empirical approach that explains this divergence in institutional
   pathways as the result of the dynamic interplay between social
   institutions (in our case, schools) and individuals' resources.
   We use data from the NLSY79 in order to compute institutional pathways
   (defined by educational and occupational status) of 9200 high school
   graduates. Optimal Matching Analysis and Cluster Analysis generated a
   typology of life course pathways. Our results show that both ascribed
   characteristics and students' high school characteristics and resources
   are predictors of post-high school pathways. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

AB School boards have received little attention in sociology of education.
   Drawing on organizational sociology, a model of school board social
   capital is proposed that treats brokerage (external ties) and closure
   (internal ties) as the key dimensions of board functioning. The model
   brings together insights from limited research on school boards
   concerning members' internal and external ties and recasts them as the
   building blocks of a unifying theoretical framework. It also proposes
   specific performance outcomes at the district level. The model is tested
   using the data from a representative sample of Pennsylvania districts.
   The analysis not only explores brokerage and closure patterns among
   school boards, but also examines their implications for academic
   outcomes. Findings suggest that eighth grade reading and mathematics
   performance are highest in districts, where boards exhibit high levels
   of both brokerage and closure, and lowest in districts, where brokerage
   and closure are both low.

AB Endogenous selection bias is a central problem for causal inference.
   Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in practice. This
   article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous
   selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernan et al.
   2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to
   highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g.,
   controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider
   variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
   one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is
   (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can
   result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome
   variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable.
   We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias,
   common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous
   examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network
   analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of
   education.

AB Sociologists are adding specific disciplinary accents to the burgeoning
   literature in colonial, imperial, and postcolonial studies. They have
   been especially keen to add explanatory accounts to the historical
   literature on empires. Starting in the 1950s, sociologists pioneered the
   study of colonies as historical formations. Against traditional
   anthropological approaches, sociologists insisted on studying colonizer
   and colonized in their dynamic interactions, asking how both groups were
   being transformed. Like contemporary postcolonial scholars, sociologists
   began asking in the 1950s how metropoles were being remade by overseas
   colonialism and colonial immigration. Echoing discussions in the 1950s
   among sociologists working in the colonies, current discussions of
   postcolonial sociology question the applicability of Western social
   scientific concepts and theories to the global South and ask how
   sociology itself has been shaped by empire. Current sociological
   research on empires focuses on six sets of causal mechanisms: (1)
   capitalism; (2) geopolitics, war, and violence; (3) cultural
   representations and subjectivity; (4) resistance and collaboration by
   the colonized; (5) institutional dimensions of empires and colonies; and
   (6) conflict and compromise among colonizers at the heart of colonial
   states.

   designed to help explore data sets and those designed to help present

   of a broader shift toward easier sharing of code and data both between

AB Interorganizational relationships connect people affiliated with
   organizations rather than corporate actors themselves. The managers and
   owners of organizations therefore do not always control these
   connections and consequently often cannot profit from them. We discuss
   the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own
   these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by
   them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the
   extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual
   (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel
   greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c)
   the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We
   discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these
   distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on
   the surface, and call for future research to pay closer attention to
   these issues.

AB The classical sociology of parties was born alongside parties
   themselves. It explored their dynamic interrelationships with states and
   society, as well as the tensions inherent in the fact that parties are
   simultaneously representatives and power seekers. Despite these rich
   foundations, from the 1960s the sociological approach came to be
   narrowly identified with a one-dimensional conception of parties, and
   political sociologists focused their attention elsewhere. This review
   contributes to efforts that began in the 1990s to reclaim the political
   party as a full-fledged sociological object. To this end, we track the
   hourglass-shaped trajectory of the sociology of parties: from broad
   Marxian and Weberian roots, to narrowing and near-eclipse after the
   1960s, to a reemergence that reclaims the breadth of the classical
   traditions. We conclude by suggesting six lines of inquiry that we
   believe would be fruitful, emphasizing both classical concerns that
   deserve more attention and innovative approaches that point in novel
   directions.

AB This article reviews recent research in fiscal sociology. We
   specifically examine contributions to the study of taxation that
   illuminate core issues in the sociology of contemporary capitalism,
   including the causes of poverty and inequality in rich countries and of
   inequality between rich and poor countries. Research on developed
   countries suggests that tax policy changes are important for explaining
   rising income inequality, tax policies may structure durable
   inequalities of race and gender, and earnings-conditional tax subsidies
   may alleviate poverty more effectively and with less stigma than
   means-tested social spending. Scholars also find the most generous
   welfare states rely the most heavily on regressive taxes, although there
   is disagreement over how this association arises. Comparative research
   on developing countries shows consumption taxes are more conducive to
   growth than taxes on income, tax-financed spending benefits growth if it
   is spent on productive investments, and taxation strengthened democracy
   and state building in medieval and early modern Europe. However, there
   is disagreement as to whether taxation contributes to state building in
   contemporary developing countries and whether foreign aid undermines
   democracy by undermining taxation. These questions are the focus of
   considerable current research.

   and (c) the collective response to HIV/AIDS through community-based

   Sociologists have pursued inquiry in all of these areas and have often
   advanced the implicit and explicit use of approaches that reveal the
   epidemic's embedded power relations. Previous research and the dynamics
   of the epidemic suggest a fundamental argument: HIV/AIDS is an epidemic
   of intersectional inequality that is fueled by racial, gender, class,
   and sexual inequities at the macro-structural, meso-institutional, and
   micro-interpersonal levels. These inequalities significantly shape the
   likelihood of exposure to the virus; the realities of living with the
   infection; and medical, programmatic, political, and social-scientific
   responses.

   discuss ways in which women in industrial cities challenged the ideology

   modernism of the same era, and in the third section, I explore how that
   urban structure limited women's opportunities outside the home. In the

   beyond masculine and feminine categories to include lesbians, gays, and
   transgender individuals. The article ends with a review of how women's
   and gay rights movements, gentrification, and planning practices have
   shaped a more gender-neutral contemporary metropolis.

AB Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite
   immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist
   discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a
   race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum
   participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use
   color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads
   (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind
   discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric
   of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees
   forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This
   neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance,
   which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby
   participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While
   color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white
   and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to
   include nonwhite immigrants.

AB Glaeser and Vigdor (2012) recently declared 'the end of a segregated

   has allegedly achieved transcendence over racism. After all, the authors
   note, government no longer endorses housing discrimination, all-white
   neighborhoods are extinct, and white racial attitudes have liberalized.
   Despite the proclamation, many questions regarding segregation remain
   unanswered by Glaeser and Vigdor. Namely, how can segregation be
   conceptualized and its measurement improved, what might alternative
   methods for analyzing it yield, and why does it matter in the first
   place? To prompt an overdue substantive and methodological discussion,
   we undertake a case study analysis of Cook County, Illinois to address
   these questions. Our analytic goal is to illuminate how segregation is a
   much more complex matter than many analyses reflect, and when this is
   taken into account, it becomes readily apparent that any assertions of
   racial transcendence are quite premature.

   Institutional Transformation program with the primary objective of
   increasing the participation and advancement of women at American
   Universities in all science, technology, engineering, and mathematics
   disciplines. Although ADVANCE has been received very well, its effects
   have been uneven among institutions receiving the ADVANCE grant. In this
   paper, we reflect on the NSF's goals for ADVANCE and initiatives ADVANCE
   schools undertake to increase gender equity in the context of gender
   organizations theory. Specifically, we comment on tensions that emerged
   through our own research concerning the relationship between feminist
   objectives of equity and justice and the nature of the ADVANCE program
   and transformational initiatives. We conclude by raising the perennial
   feminist question: 'Can the master's tools dismantle the master's

AB This article utilizes an auto-ethnographic approach to consider some of
   the tensions inherent in the requirements of sociology as an industry.
   Short production timelines, high expected output, and classical notions
   of objectivity continue to organize sociological inquiry, even as
   critical sociologists continue to question these very relations of
   ruling. This essay contributes to ongoing critical analyses of
   sociology's disciplinary paradigm and offers a consideration of the
   interstitial spaces potentially produced by 'slow sociology' as one
   possible antidote to these limitations. Productive of a borderlands
   epistemology, slow sociology resists the ruling relations of sociology
   and encourages nuanced translation work between cultures of study,
   cultures of habitation, and cultures of disciplined inquiry, fostering
   links between public society and academic endeavors.

   social shocks including the Civil War and emancipation of enslaved
   blacks. The person singularly cited as the architect of this area of
   study is Howard W. Odum. Although Odumis identified as the person most
   responsible for the development of this field, archival data indicate
   that W. E. B. Du Bois and the men and women of the Atlanta Sociological
   Laboratory were its first practitioners. In this paper evidence is
   offered to show that Du Bois's Atlanta University efforts predated
   Odum's North Carolina research program. Additionally, an explanation for
   Du Bois's marginalization in the existing sociology of the South

AB Sacrificing individual material interests for collective benefits
   involves trust that others will act in good faith. Inherent to
   situations concerning collective goods is the problem of the free rider
   that plagues collective action: the individual who maximizes their
   short-term interests at the cost of the greater good. Prior research in
   environmental sociology has identified various social structural factors
   predicting pro-environmental behavior and concern, while research on
   social dilemmas has explored the role of trust in determining
   cooperation in situations regarding collective goods. This research
   draws upon these areas of scholarship to examine the interaction between
   free rider fears with education, income, and ideology in determining the
   willingness of Americans to sacrifice individual interest for
   environmental protection through an analysis of 2010 General Social
   Survey data. Findings help differentiate the engagement of
   pro-environmental behavior from general environmental concern, with the
   fear of free riders particularly impacting the highly educated and
   ideological liberals.

   of graduate instructors, drawing on interview and focus group data from
   35 sociology students in a doctoral program at a large university in the

   felt a great deal of anxiety due to challenges they faced when teaching
   their own course for the first time: challenges such as feelings of
   unpreparedness, constant and unremitting time demands, problems with
   students, a lack of confidence, and insufficient support. Instructors
   employed a number of informal strategies in attempts to mediate the
   personal and professional impact of these challenges. Strategies
   included adjusting expectations, making sacrifices, becoming savvy, and
   creating informal peer networks that provided social support and
   increased access to resources. Findings indicate the need for
   institutional-level changes, including how graduate student teaching is
   viewed within the discipline and the ways graduate instructors are
   supported and prepared to teach. This article concludes with specific

   of teaching anxiety and teacher efficacy, may be of use for sociology

   a newly established teaching seminar using the Teaching Anxiety Scale
   and a Teaching Confidence Scale. Findings from pre- and posttest data
   show that the seminar lowered graduate students' feelings of anxiety
   about teaching for the first time and increased their levels of
   confidence regarding mastery of common pedagogical skills. Qualitative
   feedback from evaluations further illustrates the positive effects of
   the seminar on students' senses of themselves as teachers and their

   critical component of doctoral programs in sociology. Many universities
   and departments have instituted a single course, course sequence, or
   certification program dedicated to the preparation of future academic
   faculty. This article evaluates the efficacy of one such program, and
   asks two questions: (1) What are the most useful aspects of the
   Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program? (2) Is participation in the PFF
   program associated with greater job satisfaction, confidence, or
   competence? Qualitative data from Indiana University alumni suggest that
   the program is beneficial for exposing students to pedagogical
   knowledge, encouraging professionalization, and providing
   institutionalized support in the form of peer and faculty mentorship.
   Quantitative data indicate that although PFF participants were not
   significantly more satisfied or confident than their nonparticipating
   peers, the PFF program did appear to help to make participants feel more
   competent in their first jobs.

   incorporating teaching and learning into the curriculum: integrating
   pedagogy into substantive seminars. Teaching-infused graduate seminars
   are a great way to transmit norms, values, and common practices of the
   department to graduate students, and they allow for discussions of
   particular substantive challenges that graduate student instructors may
   face when teaching undergraduates about privilege, inequality,
   discrimination, and social structure. I describe my approach and present
   qualitative evaluations of this approach from two semesters of graduate
   students who have taken one of these seminars.

   templates of how to best mentor graduate students, especially in the
   vital area of teaching, are lacking. This article outlines the mentoring
   model called From Conception to Co-instructor to Completion (FCCIC).
   This five-step method provides a plan of action for faculty and graduate
   students who wish to co-develop a course in such a way that graduate
   student mentees are exposed to the entire teaching process with the
   supervision and assistance of a faculty mentor. This relationship moves
   beyond the traditional professor/teaching assistant hierarchy (the TA
   model) to create equally operational co-instructors. In this note, the
   FCCIC method is summarized and then illustrated through the development
   of a sociology course on happiness as an exemplar of how to better
   mentor graduate students in teaching.

   on (1) supply-side,' (2) neo-orthodox secularization, and (3)
   historicist schools, the authors develop a synthetic explanatory
   framework which emphasizes changed conditions of religious belonging
   amid the transition to modernity. Modernization, they suggest, disrupted
   older, parochialized forms of religious community which emerged in the
   Middle Ages. The authors describe the rise and diffusion of newer,
   de-parochialized forms of religious belonging and organization in the
   18th and 19th centuries and stress their comparative compatibility with
   modernity; here the authors draw special attention to the impact of
   missionary organizational schemas derived in colonial environments and
   re-purposed for domestic evangelism. They argue that mass unchurching
   was positively related to the persistence of parochialism and negatively
   related to the spread of post-parochialism. The salient comparison is
   therefore not merely between Western Europe and the US, but rather
   between national cases in which de-parochialization accompanied
   political and economic modernization and those in which it did not.

AB Childhood scholars have found that age inequality can be as profound an
   axis of meaningful difference as race, gender, or class, and yet the
   impact of this understanding has not permeated the discipline of
   sociology as a whole. This is one particularly stark example of the
   central argument of this article: despite decades of empirical and
   theoretical work by scholars in "the social studies of childhood,"
   sociologists in general have not incorporated the central contributions
   of this subfield: that children are active social agents (not passive),
   knowing actors strategizing within their constraints (not innocent),
   with their capacities and challenges shaped by their contexts (not
   universally the same). I contend that mainstream sociology's relative
   imperviousness has led to theoretical costs for both childhood
   scholars-who must re-assert and re-prove the core insights of the
   field-and sociologists in general. Using three core theoretical debates
   in the larger discipline-about independence, insecurity, and
   inequality-I argue that children's perspectives can help scholars ask
   new questions, render the invisible visible, and break through
   theoretical logjams. Thus would further research utilizing children's
   perspectives and the dynamics of age extend the explanatory power of
   social theory.

   compatible with Marx's over time. Third, I point out ambiguities in
   Bourdieu's concept of capital that, despite gestures toward a Marxist
   understanding of capital, further distance him from Marx. Fourth, I
   argue that Bourdieu tends to take the economic field and economic
   capital for granted, unlike Marx. I conclude that if different forms of

   which tracks permutations of specific land-use transitions over time. In
   a fixed-effects analysis, the area of cropland lost to the built
   environment is regressed on different measures of population and
   economic growth. Results indicate that natural increase and net
   migration differentially affect the loss of cropland at the local level
   across the continental United States, challenging the traditional focus
   in environmental sociology on overall population growth. This study also
   advances the concept of aristocratic conservation as a process by which
   increasing residential affluence slows down the intensification of land.
   The results of the analysis are discussed in terms of what land-use

   illustrate my argument, this paper is organized into four sections.
   First, the applicability and extension of Bourdieu's theory of cultural
   production is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating
   how the concept of location adopts an intersubjective understanding of
   reflexivity in order to address some of the limitations of Bourdieu's
   concepts of position, disposition and strategy. Second, two different
   strategies of legitimation (crowd pleasing and crowd commanding) adopted
   by DJs within the field are outlined. Third, the importance of location
   in the use of these strategies in the field of black popular
   music-making is illustrated. Finally, this paper concludes by
   summarizing the key dimensions of the concept of location and suggesting
   how the concept has broader applicability in other cultural fields.

AB Social studies of agriculture tend to overlook the micro and symbolic
   interactions that structure relationships among agriculturalists, the
   environment, and animals raised as commodities. In this study, I use
   ethnographic methods and in-depth interviews with conventional beef
   producers to understand their perceptions of the environment and the
   nonhuman animals they raise. Central themes in this setting are the
   ethics of stewardship and husbandry. I seek to understand how these
   values are constructed and used interactionally. I argue that
   stewardship and husbandry help describe a process of co-constitution
   that binds together ranchers, cattle, and the natural environment. The
   analysis engages actor-network theory by emphasizing nonhuman activeness
   and draws from symbolic interaction and cultural sociology to show how
   people interpret the actions of nonhumans. The findings show that
   ranchers frame their relationships with cattle and the environment as
   symbiotic and work to understand the interests of the nonhuman as
   complementary to production. I introduce the term symbiotic ideology to
   show the way this approach mystifies power dynamics embedded in the
   ethic of dominion.

AB While most work on causation in ethnography addresses the normative
   question of what ethnographers should do, this article addresses the
   empirical question of what ethnographers actually do. Specifically, it
   investigates whether ethnographic articles make causal arguments and how
   these arguments are made. The authors draw on a content analysis of 48
   ethnographic articles sampled from four groups of sociological journals:
   contemporary generalist journals, contemporary specialist journals,
   mid-20th-century generalist journalsall in the United Statesand
   contemporary generalist journals in Mexico. They find that ethnographies
   in U.S. contemporary generalist journals are most likely to advance
   strong and central causal claims and to use logical and rhetorical
   devices comparable to those used in quantitative articles. They also
   find that most Mexican ethnographic articles undertake a different kind
   of project, which they call "shedding light" on social phenomena. In
   addition to offering one methodological and one substantive suggestion
   to account for these findings, the authors highlight their implications
   for the sociology of social science.

AB This study advances recent theorizing on causality and emergence by
   analyzing how new activist groups create a collective sense of plausible
   tactics. A comparative ethnographic approach is used to observe shifts
   in the discussions of four fledgling activist groups. In each group,
   implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events,
   authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge
   without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group's
   sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new
   understanding of the role of contingency in collective activism and a
   method for using ethnographic observation to locate subtle causal
   mechanisms in social life.

AB This article reports the results of a study of the impact of two kinds
   of mentoring, as in individual, instrumental mentoring by white male
   advisors versus supportive/communal, homophilous (same race/ethnicity)
   mentoring on the likelihood of minority scholars having an ideal or
   archetypal career trajectory when compared to two other control groups.
   Using unobtrusive data, we test a series of hypotheses concerning the
   likelihood of attaining selected aspects of an ideal career including
   employment at a research-extensive institution, scholarly publications,
   tenure, grants, and disciplinary recognition. We find that having a
   white male instrumental advisor increases the likelihood of having an
   ideal career for participants in the American Sociological Association's
   (ASA) national pre-doctoral Minority Fellowship Program (MFP) who have
   the advantage of having access to both types of mentoring when compared
   to a random group of largely white PhDs.

AB In transitions from state socialism, property rights are re-allocated to
   organizations and groups, creating new markets and new forms of economic
   enterprise that reshape the stratification order. A generation of
   research has estimated individual-level outcomes with income equations
   and mobility models, relying on broad assumptions about economic change.
   We redirect attention to the process of economic change that structures
   emerging markets. The process varies across market sectors, depending on
   the entity that is granted rights formerly exercised by state organs,
   and on the combination of rights they are granted. The transformation of
   three sectors in China-agriculture, steel manufacturing, and real
   estate-shows how different allocations of property rights alter the
   stratification order in strikingly different ways. Historical analysis
   of the evolution of markets and enterprises integrates insights from
   economic sociology into research on social stratification, providing a
   structural perspective on transitions from state socialism.

   Africa: the Axial religions (Christianity and Islam); indigenous
   chieftaincy systems based around chief, lineage, and clan; and
   globalized modernity, represented primarily by NGOs and the global human
   rights agenda. The article argues that in many respects it is the Axial
   religions that are the most modernizing, as they directly counter the
   power of traditional kin obligations (and the overwhelming dangers of
   witchcraft), while the purportedly modern and secular NGOs practice a
   ritualized version of modernity, even as they are penetrated by the
   norms and practices of the kin-based chieftaincy system and its related
   system of patron-client ties.

   la figure du chef, de la lignee et du clan ; et la modernite a l'ere
   globale, essentiellement representee par les ONG et l'action mondiale en
   faveur des droits de l'homme. Nous avancons qu'a bien des egards, ce
   sont les religions << axiales >> qui sont les plus porteuses de
   modernite, dans la mesure oU elles s'opposent directement a l'influence
   des obligations familiales traditionnelles (et aux immenses dangers que
   recele la sorcellerie), tandis que les ONG, pretendument modernes et

   el linaje y el clan; y la modernidad globalizada, representada
   principalmente por las ONGs y la agenda mundial de los derechos humanos.
   El articulo sostiene que, en muchos aspectos son las religiones axiales
   las mas modernizadoras, ya que contrapesan directamente el poder de las
   obligaciones de parentesco tradicionales (y los abrumadores peligros de
   la brujeria), mientras que las ONGs supuestamente modernas y seculares

AB Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of
   difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest
   these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the
   commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively
   shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and
   transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent
   State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and
   participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I
   theorize the existence of a third commemorative formthe integrated
   commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent
   narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while
   simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared
   meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or
   scientific inquiry.

AB Simulation games can help overcome student resistance to thinking
   structurally about social class inequality, meritocracy, and mobility.
   Most inequality simulations focus solely on economic inequality and omit
   social and cultural capital, both of which contribute to social class
   reproduction. Using a pretest/posttest design, the current study
   evaluates a simulation game that incorporates economic, social, and
   cultural capital and is meant for introductory sociology classes
   containing between 15 and 70 students. Data come from a state research
   university and a liberal arts college. Results show that the simulation
   increased students' conceptual understanding of structural explanations
   for restricted mobility; cultural and social capital; and conceptual
   connections between stratification concepts. The simulation did not lead
   to changes in students' feelings about poor people. Results support the
   idea of using simulation games to overcome student resistance to the
   sociological perspective on stratification and suggest that some
   simulation games may be effective across institutional contexts.

AB A common source of frustration for college instructors is getting their
   students to read. Since the 1970s, studies have shown that no more than
   30 percent of students complete a reading assignment on any given day.
   But what can be done? What strategies can instructors use to make
   certain that their students read? Do pop or announced quizzes work
   better? Does it help to call on students randomly in class? To date,
   little systematic evidence exists concerning the relative utility of the
   many methods instructors use to encourage reading compliance. This study
   begins to address that lacuna. Specifically, using survey data collected
   in introductory sociology classes (N = 423), we examine how students
   evaluate seven commonly used methods ranging from announced quizzes to
   short writing assignments to being called on randomly in class. We find
   that students perceive mandatory and/or announced methods to be more
   effective in motivating them to complete reading assignments than
   unannounced or optional methods.

   students' attention; fosters a nonthreatening learning environment;
   raises students' awareness of personal perspectives and biases; and
   encourages integration of ideas and critical thinking. ARC can also be
   used for meaningful assessment between formal evaluations as well as to
   reward each student's preparation and reading of the class material. The
   principles, practice, benefits, and measures of success of ARC as an

   develop an account of the relational, discursive, and performative
   dimensions of power. Each proposed dimension of power is grounded in a
   different understanding of social causes: relational-realist,
   discursive-hermeneutic, and performative-pragmatic. For the purposes of
   empirical analysis, this dimensional schema crosscuts the classic
   sources of power typology developed by Michael Mann and others, thus
   rendering the conceptual apparatus for pursuing sociological research on
   power more complex and explanatorily effective. The schema is
   illustrated by an example from comparative-historical sociology:
   explaining the storming of the Bastille and its effects. A series of
   research questions for investigating the relative autonomy of
   performative power is proposed. Finally, the current schema is situated
   vis-a-vis classic sociological theories of power, including the

AB Social network research is widely considered atheoretical. In contrast,
   in this article I argue that network analysis often mixes two distinct
   theoretical frameworks, creating a logically inconsistent foundation.
   Relationalism rejects essentialism and a priori categories and insists
   upon the intersubjectivity of experience and meaning as well as the
   importance of the content of interactions and their historical setting.
   Formalism is based on a structuralist interpretation of the theoretical
   works of Georg Simmel. Simmel laid out a neo-Kantian program of
   identifying a priori categories of relational types and patterns that
   operate independently of cultural content or historical setting.
   Formalism and relationalism are internally consistent theoretical
   perspectives, but there are tensions between them. To pave the way for
   stronger middle-range theoretical development, I disaggregate the two
   approaches and highlight the contradictions that must be addressed or
   resolved for the construction of any general and inclusive theory.

   key problems dogging the consumption literature. The budgetary unit
   concept ((1)) offers a new framework for theorizing and better
   accounting for observed consumption patterns, ((2)) reveals how
   consumption units have organizational logics, preferences, strengths,
   and vulnerabilities that are consequentially distinct from market logic
   of production and profit, and ((3)) focuses attention on social
   processes and features enabling theorization of general social patterns
   of consumption across diverse contexts. This article highlights the

   approach using the conventionally dissimilar cases of Russian organized

AB Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together
   increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation
   faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to
   be established disproportionately between those sharing significant
   social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author
   explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup
   relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar
   others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on
   interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S.
   dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on
   educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on
   marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for
   the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a
   two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its
   empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the
   homophily hurdle.

AB How does an object in the ground become a discovery on the ground? This
   paper analyzes how archaeologists produce the content and status of a
   discovery before it is unearthed, a phenomenon I call "prospective
   loading." It includes intense social knowledge of the soil, a form of
   embodied knowledge that I call "dirt sense". These forces and mechanisms
   do not always work together harmoniously. Qualitative data from three
   excavations demonstrate how deep sensory perception thrives alongside
   sophisticated technology, and is construed as vital to the discovery
   process. The case has implications for how we think about cultural
   knowledge in scientific work and theorize the role of nationalism and
   politics in archaeology.

AB Using the 1957-2011 data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study, I
   integrate the gender relations theory, a life course perspective, and a
   biosocial stress perspective to explore the effect of women's job
   authority in 1975 (at age 36) and 1993 (at age 54) on breast cancer
   incidence up to 2011. Findings indicate that women with the authority to
   hire, fire, and influence others' pay had a significantly higher risk of
   a breast cancer diagnosis over the next thirty years compared to
   housewives and employed women with no job authority. Because job
   authority conferred the highest risk of breast cancer for women who also
   spent more hours dealing with people at work in 1975,1 suggest that the
   assertion of job authority by women in the 1970 s involved stressful
   interpersonal experiences, such as social isolation and negative social
   interactions, that may have increased the risk of breast cancer via
   prolonged dysregulation of the glucocorticoid system and exposure of
   breast tissue to the adverse effects of chronically elevated cortisol.
   This study contributes to sociology by emphasizing gendered biosocial
   pathways through which women's occupational experiences become embodied
   and drive forward physiological repercussions.

AB Building on a recent theoretical development in the field of
   sociological social psychology, we develop a formal mathematical model
   of social influence processes. The extant theoretical literature implies
   that factions and status should have non-linear effects on social
   influence, and yet these theories have been evaluated using standard
   linear statistical models. Our formal model of influence includes these
   non-linearities, as specified by the theories. We evaluate the fit of
   the formal model using experimental data. Our results indicate that a
   one-parameter mathematical model fits the experimental data. We conclude
   with the implications of our research and a discussion of how it may be

AB American sociology as a field tends to marginalize psychoanalytic
   perspectives despite scholars Cavalletto and Silver showing that this
   was not the case during Talcott Parson's intellectual heyday in the
   1940s. From the 1970s on, though, constructionists emphasized the
   conservative rather than liberatory side of the Freudian tradition and
   symbolic interactionism took the place of psychoanalysis as the
   legitimized framework for understanding individuals. Marginalization has
   occurred for at least three reasons: (1) the legacies of positivism
   created a bias toward empirically observable rather than relatively
   unmeasurable concepts like the Freudian unconscious; (2) psychoanalysis
   uses internal data whereas sociologists look externally rather than
   inward; (3) because psychoanalysis focuses on individuals and sociology
   on groups, it is argued that the two are incommensurate. Nevertheless,
   even in the face of marginalization, some scholars have combined
   psychoanalytic and sociological perspectives in myriad ways conceiving
   of multi dimensional rather than rationalistic individuals within social
   and cultural settings; exploring interactional dynamics that are at once
   psychic-and-social; and, as in the work of Wilfred Bion, studying the
   psychoanalytic mechanisms of groups themselves. I posit that the ongoing
   marginalization of psychoanalysis deprives the discipline of an
   innovative tool of analysis, an especially salient one at times when the
   emotional and psychological dimensions of social life are glaringly
   evident.

AB Science on emerging environmental health threats involves numerous
   ethical concerns related to scientific uncertainty about conducting,
   interpreting, communicating, and acting upon research findings, but the
   connections between ethical decision making and scientific uncertainty
   are under-studied in sociology. Under conditions of scientific
   uncertainty, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed by formal
   ethical codes of conduct, increasing the importance of ethical
   reflection by researchers, conflicts over research conduct, and reliance
   on informal ethical standards. This article draws on in-depth interviews
   with scientists, regulators, activists, industry representatives, and
   fire safety experts to explore ethical considerations of moments of
   uncertainty using a case study of flame retardants, chemicals widely
   used in consumer products with potential negative health and
   environmental impacts. We focus on the uncertainty that arises in
   measuring people's exposure to these chemicals through testing of their
   personal environments or bodies. We identify four sources of ethical
   concerns relevant to scientific uncertainty: 1) choosing research
   questions or methods, 2) interpreting scientific results, 3)
   communicating results to multiple publics, and 4) applying results for
   policy making. This research offers lessons about professional conduct
   under conditions of uncertainty, ethical research practice,
   democratization of scientific knowledge, and science's impact on policy.

AB This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting
   for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners'
   narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on
   narrative identity and drawing on 15months of fieldwork and 25 in-depth
   interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities
   in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative
   conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative:
   what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the
   process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally
   continuous and essentialized Pagan self. I suggest that while all
   conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different
   faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress
   self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the
   rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1)
   perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to
   legitimacy and social acceptance; and (3) understanding of the nature of
   religious truth.

AB Security as a phenomenon has come to occupy increasing social energy and
   thus merits sociological attention. But the question of how to go about
   studying security is somewhat vexing, because the concept of security is
   both highly polysemous (Ranasinghe 2013) and one that can potentially be
   located within a wide spectrum of social sites, ranging from the
   feelings of individuals to the practices of states. I suggest that we
   must first clarify what we are talking about when we talk about
   security. Here, I present several ideas for fully articulating the
   concept.

AB Gender performativity has had significant influences in cultural studies
   and sociology, yet empirical cases of the theory remain scarce. While
   some analysis examines performativity in work, the focus is on
   organizations and how gender gets done and undone' within them with
   little attention paid to bodies outside organizations. Based on two
   empirical studies of freelancing fashion models, we extend Butler's
   gender performativity to analyse the routine bodily practices and gender
   performances of men and women in fashion, investigating what happens
   when men and women perform the same work but under different gendered
   expectations. Fashion modelling presents a case that reproduces
   heteronormative definitions of femininity while potentially challenging
   traditional notions of masculinity and work. Observing everyday
   transgressions', we evidence how gender performativity, while largely
   reiterative of normative heterosexuality, may subtly confound the
   conventions. Observing how models do and undo' gender extends the
   analysis of gender at work to non-organizational bodies that tend to be
   under-represented within the literature.

AB Theorizing the social influence of racism and race has long been a
   concern of sociologists. Theories have addressed how racism, race and
   race inequality are organized and changed. Yet they have not addressed
   why racism and race are persistent despite social change. A social
   process theory of racism and race is proposed that analyzes their
   flexibility and persistence. It posits that racism is a social process
   where the meanings of race identities are traded across macro, meso, and
   micro levels of society. These trades legitimate social policies, are
   used to define a society as moral, and inform experiences. Black and
   white identities in light of the civil rights movement and its
   retrenchment, and the post-9/11 identity of Muslim Americans provide
   examples for applying the theory. I discuss the implications of the
   social process theory of racism and race for the future of race
   inequality in American society and sociological research.

   difficult for students at historically white colleges and universities

   enter HWCUs surrounded by these walls - protecting them from attacks on
   white supremacy - that have multiple layers and therefore are even more
   difficult to penetrate; yet they must be penetrated. With a few
   exceptions, the institution of American higher education does not
   threaten those walls. Instead, college education often bolsters them
   through curricular and extracurricular experiences, residential and
   disciplinary isolation, institutional symbols, cultural reproduction,
   and everyday practices such as grading and classroom interactions. We

AB National human rights institutions, defined as domestic but globally
   legitimated agencies charged with promoting and protecting human rights,
   have emerged worldwide. This article examines the effect of these
   organizations on two kinds of human rights outcomes: physical integrity
   rights and civil and political rights. We analyze cross-national
   longitudinal data using regression models that account for the
   endogeneity of organizational formation. Our first main finding is that
   all types of human rights institutions improve long-term physical
   integrity outcomes but not civil and political rights practices. This
   finding may reflect a greater worldwide focus on physical integrity
   violations such as torture, and also many countries' propensity to
   resist Western civil and political rights standards. A second main
   finding is that time matters: in the cases we observe, initial increases
   in rated abuse levels were followed by improvements. These initial
   increases may be due to closer scrutiny or the expanded scope of what
   constitutes human rights abuses. Our results call for rethinking the
   concept of decoupling in the sociology of human rights and other focal
   areas.

AB The traditional jurisprudential model of law views the application of
   legal sanctions primarily as a function of the facts of the case and the
   rules that govern the proceedings. Sociology of law scholars have
   challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that
   law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader
   considerations of community social organization and collective
   sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and
   severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social
   capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more
   prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find
   that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which
   the public expresses higher levels of fear. Overall, the findings
   provide provocative evidence that legal outcomes in murder cases are
   influenced by several features of the social environments in which they
   are processed.

   relations form and are structured by social institutions. Using data

   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors show that
   the odds of a new friendship nomination were 1.77 times greater within
   clusters of high school students taking courses together than between
   them. The estimated effect cannot be attributed to exposure to peers in
   similar grade levels, indirect friendship links, or pair-level course
   overlap, and the finding is robust to alternative model specifications.
   The authors also show how tendencies associated with status hierarchy
   inhering in triadic friendship nominations are neutralized within the

   distribution of social capital within social systems such as schools,
   giving the clusters social salience as local positions.

AB Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of democratic politics that is at
   least as indebted to civic republicanism as to Marxism. He was familiar
   with the civic republican tradition, and it increasingly influenced both
   his political interventions and sociological work, especially late in
   his career. Bourdieu drew above all on Niccol Machiavelli's version of
   republicanism, though the French republican tradition also influenced
   him via Durkheimian social theory. Three elements of Bourdieu's work in
   particular-his concept of field autonomy, his view of interests and
   universalism, and his understanding of how solidarity is generated and
   sustained-may be understood, at least in part, as sociological
   reformulations of republican ideas. By drawing attention to these
   republican influences, the article aims to show that the conceptual
   resources which some critics, including Jeffrey C. Alexander, consider
   indispensable to an adequate theory of democracy are not entirely absent
   in Bourdieu's work. On the basis of this reassessment, the article
   concludes that Bourdieu and Alexander are not as opposed in their
   thinking about democratic politics as it might first appear.

   introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students,
   and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our
   students are, how the course fits with university mission and program
   goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can
   build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is
   alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in
   sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and
   curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in
   recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the
   major. Posing such questions will promote further discussion and

AB Focus group interviewing is widely used by academic and applied
   researchers. Given the popularity and strengths of this method, it is
   surprising how rarely focus group interviewing is taught in the
   undergraduate classroom and how few resources exist to support
   instructors who wish to train students to use this technique. This
   article fills the gap in the teaching and learning literature in
   sociology by addressing focus group research. I describe how to
   integrate a complete research project with student-led focus groups into
   a single semester course. I outline the various stages involved in the
   research process and then consider how this approach enhances three
   specific areas: learning, teaching, and scholarship. The effectiveness
   of the focus group project was assessed through a one-group
   pretest-posttest survey of the student-researchers' experiences. I
   conclude with a reflection on the practical limitations as well as the
   considerable advantages of training students to conduct focus group
   research.

AB Although there is widespread agreement among academics that critical
   thinking is an important component to the college classroom, there is
   little empirical evidence to verify that it is being taught in courses.
   Using four sections of introductory sociology, we developed an
   experimental design using pretests and posttests to assess students'
   critical thinking skills. Controlling for grade point average,
   cumulative credit hours completed, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic
   status, instructor, and initial levels of critical thinking, being in
   the experimental group had a statistically significant impact on
   critical thinking at the end of the semester. Thus, inclusion of writing
   assignments and classroom discussion designed to enhance creative
   thought processes for the experimental group helped students improve
   from one-dimensional thinking toward more multistructural analysis.

AB This article describes and evaluates the Gender Attitude and Belief
   Inventory (GABI), a teaching tool designed to aid students in (a)
   realizing how sociological theory links to their personal beliefs and
   (b) exploring any combination of 11 frequently used theoretical
   perspectives on gender, including both conservative theories
   (physiological, sociobiological, and structural functionalist) and
   feminist ones (liberal, socialist, Marxist, radical, separatist,
   cultural, multicultural/black, and postmodern feminism). In this
   article, I discuss the inventory, how I use it in my sociology of gender
   class, and how it could be adapted for use in other classes. I also
   analyze qualitative and quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness
   based on responses from students at two universities (N = 603) and
   pretest and posttest results of its impact on student learning
   immediately following the activity (N = 161) and at the end of the
   semester (N = 33). These data suggest that the GABI increases students'
   understanding of theoretical perspectives on gender, encourages them to
   reflect on their own views and (mis)perceptions of theories, and is an
   engaging exercise for students. Most importantly, this is a valuable
   exercise to aid students in realizing how sociological theory links to
   their everyday lives.

AB Increasingly, colleges and universities are relying on fully online
   classes to teach students. This article investigates how students
   evaluate online courses in comparison to more traditional face-to-face
   courses. Data come from undergraduate student evaluations of 118
   sociology courses, and results of a series of hierarchical linear models
   indicate that students feel they have learned less in online courses,
   believe they are treated with more respect in in-class courses, and rate
   online courses less highly than in-class courses. Findings also suggest
   that the negative effects of teaching online are not universal for
   instructors, as the switch to online classes actually results in better
   evaluations for teachers who typically perform poorly in the classroom.
   These findings caution against the broad use of online sociology classes
   as a strategy for coping with increasing enrollments and shrinking
   budgets and suggest educators should select the course format that best
   complements their teaching strengths and skills.

   assessment of the efficacy of course portfolios by using a controlled,
   pretest-posttest analysis conducted in seven sections of three separate
   sociology courses. Third, we illustrate the conceptual connections
   between active learning pedagogy and identity theory and provide

AB Why do advocacy organizations focus on some issues rather than others?
   Issue selection is an important area of study given that advocacy
   organizations have limited time and resources and thus many potentially
   important issues go ignored. Yet issue selection remains an understudied
   question in the scholarly study of advocacy organizations. In this
   article, the author draws on historical data, interviews, and a database
   of statements by major human rights advocacy organizations to examine
   one particular historical puzzle regarding issue selection: why advocacy
   organizations have focused on the recent conflict in the Darfur region
   of Sudan rather than the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
   even though more people have died in the Congo. The author finds that
   advocacy organizations select issues not based on their severity but
   based on framing, political opportunities, and organizational resources.

   way partnership between middle schools in a poor largely Latino school
   district, the local University, and local after-school care providers.
   This paper assesses the project and situates it theoretically using
   Foucault's microphysics of power and Bourdieu's concepts of capital to
   analyze the refusal of most students and teachers to engage in the
   program and the standardized testing required by the state. We further
   articulate a new form of Bourdieu's concept of symbolic violence based
   on position in the consumer hierarchy. We conclude with a critique of
   grant mechanisms as a means of addressing health issues, and situate the
   obesity epidemic as a social construction that perpetuates inequality
   and discourses of power.

AB Classic sociological theory emphasizing human ecology and the
   convergence of persons in time and space motivated the routine
   activities approach in criminological research. Empirical work in this
   tradition focuses on predatory offending, and it has rarely been
   considered as a theoretical basis for the study of more common,
   low-level (mostly nonviolent) deviance. Using commonplace automotive
   incivility as a test case, the present work draws on the routine
   activities approach in precisely this manner to answer recent
   theoretical calls for an empirical sociology of familiar encounters and
   situations. Using data from a nationally representative sample of
   Australians, this article looks at the time/space distribution,
   situational commonalities, and emotional consequences of vehicular
   incivilities. Risk factors consistent with the routine activities
   paradigm include everyday driving activity and microsituations involving
   mixed speeds, crowded conditions, and blocked flows. Results also
   suggest that automotive incivility is more likely than other types of
   incivility to incite feelings of fear and anger.

AB The biophysical environment is not tangential to the social; it is only
   tangential to conventional sociological thought. Environmental sociology
   arose in the 1970s based on this presupposition, but over time theory
   and empirical research have generally adopted a social constructionist
   or natural realist approach. Despite rejection of the Durkheimian dictum
   of explaining social facts through the invocation of other social facts,
   and thus refusal to presuppose human exemptionalism from ecological
   constraints, scholarship continues to reflect this nature/culture
   divide. When environmental sociologists focus on one side or the other
   of the nature/culture divide, the intertwining and conjoint constitution
   of the social and the biophysical-material is obscured. The intent of
   the present essay is to articulate a co-constructionist ontological
   position sensitive to the temporal emergence of hybridity between the
   social and the natural and amenable to recognition of salient dynamics
   not readily envisioned from either side of the nature/culture divide. In
   doing so, the argument builds upon prior metatheoretical scholarship in
   environmental sociology and science and technology studies and
   highlights ontological conundrums that must be confronted in order to
   further the move toward a viable co-constructionist posture.

AB The concept of the axial age, initially proposed by the philosopher Karl

   rise of major religious and philosophical figures and ideas throughout
   Eurasia, has gained an established position in a number of fields,
   including historical sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of
   religion. We explore whether the notion of an "axial age" has historical
   and intellectual cogency, or whether the authors who use the label of a
   more free-floating "axiality" to connote varied "breakthroughs" in human
   experience may have a more compelling case. Throughout, we draw
   attention to ways in which uses of the axial age concept in contemporary
   social science vary in these and other respects. In the conclusion, we
   reflect on the value of the concept and its current uses and their
   utility in making sense of human experience.

   sociology textbooks to determine the relationship between categories of
   gender, race, and class and levels of analysis. Previous research found
   that textbooks primarily discuss gender at the micro level, race at the
   meso level, and class at the macro level. Replicating previous
   approaches by using index citations, we find evidence that gender is
   linked to socialization much more than race and class, and there is
   evidence that class is still more likely to be discussed at a macro
   level. Our content analysis findings show a similar pattern, but also
   some evidence for the increased inclusion of theories and examples that
   examine gender, race, and class at multiple levels of analysis.
   Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for
   race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in
   colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a
   pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian
   world than exists in reality and includes claims that U.S. society is
   now "post-racial." Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an
   era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social
   distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider
   "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white
   supremacy and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume
   exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must
   employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify
   their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain
   racial inequality at the systemic level. I introduce one successful
   approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial
   inequality by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital
   acquisition and transfer.

   created an image-based learning model to address this disconnect. I used
   discussion board image selection, posting and critique exercises
   (image-posts), and personal meaning maps (PMMs) as core assignments.
   This combination increased student comprehension, challenged and altered
   perceptions of key topics, and gave them a greater sense of agency
   through reflexive learning. Additionally, students' reception of this
   model was favorable, with 97 percent reporting that the course met or

AB Scholarship on teaching undergraduates increasingly emphasizes the
   benefits of providing students with an active role in their education
   whereby instructors are more aptly described as facilitators of

   recommendations from the American Sociological Association aimed
   specifically at the undergraduate sociology curriculum argue that
   students must engage as practitioners of sociology at each level of
   their program development. In short, undergraduates should do
   sociology-not just read or write sociology. Applying this recommendation
   to teaching statistics, I suggest organizing a course around a
   student-led research project in which students generate the topics,
   questions, and data that are then used to complete a substantive
   research paper. Students are given the opportunity to be actively
   engaged in all stages of the research and data-gathering process.
   Students also present their work in student roundtables, further

AB Social epidemiologists Marmot and Wilkinson argue that relative
   deprivation is the dominant mechanism through which socioeconomic status
   (SES) affects mortality. If such an argument is valid, we would expect
   to consistently see the influence of relative deprivation in situations
   where two or more highly qualified and very similar individuals are
   nominated in a status competition, but only one receives the status
   boost conferred by winning. We studied mortality experiences of Emmy
   Award winners, Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, and presidents and vice
   presidents-comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition.
   Our findings and results of similar studies fail to show consistent
   advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is
   sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent. We
   conclude that the critical processes determining the strength and
   direction of any status effect on longevity are changes in life
   circumstances that result from winning or losing, rather than the
   processes that inexorably flow from one's relative position in a status
   hierarchy.

AB Contemporary scholarship has conceptualized modern fame as an open
   system in which people continually move in and out of celebrity status.
   This model stands in stark contrast to the traditional notion in the
   sociology of stratification that depicts stable hierarchies sustained
   through classic forces such as social structure and cumulative
   advantage. We investigate the mobility of fame using a unique data
   source containing daily records of references to person names in a large
   corpus of English-language media sources. These data reveal that only at
   the bottom of the public attention hierarchy do names exhibit fast
   turnover; at upper tiers, stable coverage persists around a fixed level
   and rank for decades. Fame exhibits strong continuity even in
   entertainment, on television, and on blogs, where it has been thought to
   be most ephemeral. We conclude that once a person's name is decoupled
   from the initial event that lent it momentary attention,
   self-reinforcing processes, career structures, and commemorative
   practices perpetuate fame.

   United States. New organizations and websites are cropping up, a
   wellspring of books are being published, and long-standing progressive
   writers and theologians are garnering more attention and support than
   ever before. Despite significant advances, however, the impact of the
   'religious left' in the American public sphere is still limited. In this
   paper, I ask why. Based on participant observation, discourse analysis,
   and in-depth interviews, and using a multidimensional culturalist
   perspective rooted in Durkheimian and Weberian ideas, I explore the
   symbolic dynamics of the Christian 'left'. I argue that in addition to
   their structural disadvantages, progressive Christians face thorny
   dilemmas regarding authority/legitimacy, rationalization,
   demystification, disenchantment, charisma (or the lack thereof), and
   profanation that, though not insurmountable, are not easily resolved.

   response to a 1999 book against irony, the declared 'death of irony'
   after the events of September 11, 2001, and concerns about the ironic
   nature of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. After reviewing the
   literature on irony from various academic disciplines, the author shows
   how 'knockers' worried that irony was a counter-narrative that would
   distract from romantic progress, while 'boosters' claimed irony was a
   trope that could only strengthen the romantic story of the nation.
   Rather than answering the title question, the author uses the evidence
   of these 'ironic crises' to show how such questions reveal the cultural
   forms and reflexivity that structure the American public sphere.

AB In the latter half of the 20th century, countries abolished the death
   penalty en masse. What factors help to explain this global trend?
   Conventional analyses explain abolition by focusing primarily on state
   level political processes. This article contributes to these studies by
   analyzing world cultural factors that lend to the abolition trend. The
   main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto
   cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of
   the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights
   regime, represents a significant driver of states' abolition. Countries'
   predominant religion is also found to significantly affect the
   probability of abolition: predominantly Catholic nation-states are most
   likely to abolish the death penalty, and predominantly Muslim
   nation-states are least likely to abolish. These findings provide
   evidence for world cultural factors that structure the abolition trend
   globally.

AB Comparative historical methods are used to explain the transformation of
   the U. S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The
   analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level
   narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but
   interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex
   interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps
   explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically,
   over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy,
   and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political
   innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to
   increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to
   respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In
   turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime
   control politics and policies at the national level that reflected
   historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.

AB A perennial concern among scholars of globalization is the relationship
   between global social formations and national and subnational political
   and economic developments. While sociological understanding of "the
   global" has become increasingly rich, stressing the complex relationship
   between material and cultural pressures, an undertheorized nation state
   often sits on the receiving end of the sociologist's model of
   globalization. The goal of this article is to help move the sociology of
   globalization out of the analytical trap of global-national dualism by
   developing an account of the transnationalization of political
   authority. Building on neo-Marxist and Weberian theories of the
   transnational, or global state, which explicate the macro-structural
   dynamics that have led to the transnationalization of the state as such,
   I look at the process of the transnationalization of political authority
   from an institutional perspective, one that focuses on processes of
   transnationalization within, and across, specific state agencies. These
   theoretical points are empirically motivated through an historical
   investigation of the transnationalization of monetary authority and its
   relationship to the international diffusion of policies of austerity
   from the era of the classical gold standard through the economic crisis
   of 2008.

AB While new scholarship on Pierre Bourdieu has recovered his early work on
   Algeria, this essay excavates his early thoughts on colonialism.
   Contrary to received wisdom, Bourdieu did in fact offer a theory of
   colonialism and a systematic understanding of its effects and logics.
   Bourdieu portrayed colonialism as a racialized system of domination,
   backed by force, which restructures social relations and creates hybrid
   cultures. His theory entailed insights on the limits and promises of
   colonial reform, anticolonial revolution, and postcolonial liberation.
   Bourdieu's early thinking on colonialism drew upon but extended French
   colonial studies of the time. It also contains the seeds of later
   concepts like habitus, field, and reflexive sociology while prefiguring
   more recent disciplinary postcolonial studies. Bourdieusian sociology in
   this sense originates not just as a study of Algeria but more
   specifically a critique of colonialism. It can be seen as contributing
   to the larger project of postcolonial sociology.

AB Historical scholarship suggests that a robust cult of the saints may
   have helped some European regions to resist inroads by Protestantism.
   Based on a neo-Durkheimian theory of rituals and social order, I propose
   that locally based cults of the saints that included public veneration
   lowered the odds that Protestantism would displace Catholicism in
   sixteenth-century German cities. To evaluate this proposition, I first
   turn to historical and theoretical reflection on the role of the cult of
   the saints in late medieval history. I then test the hypothesis with a
   data set of sixteenth-century German cities. Statistical analysis
   provides additional support for the ritual and social order thesis
   because even when several important variables identified by materialist
   accounts of the Reformation in the social scientific literature the
   presence of shrines as an indicator for the cult of the saints remains
   large and significant. Although large-scale social change is usually
   assumed to have politico-economic sources, this analysis suggests that
   cultural factors may be of equal or greater importance.

AB Dominant approaches to the study of gentrification tend to attribute
   this process either to the production of urban space by elites or to the
   consumption of urban space by individual consumers. In this article, we
   take a preliminary step toward bridging this gap by illustrating how
   these groups may, in some cases, be the same actors. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with middle-class parents in Boston, we explore the
   transitions that gentrifiers undergo as they age and have children. As
   young singles and childless couples, our respondents interacted with the
   city mainly as passive consumers. Years later, however, facing pressures
   to relocate in search of high-quality educational options, these parents
   emerged as active producers of the urban landscape through their
   substantial involvement in their children's public elementary schools.
   This school-based engagement reinforced their loyalties to their
   neighborhoods, dissuading them from moving to the suburbs. Since it is
   based on intense interactions with small local institutions, though,
   this strategy will likely be more difficult for parents to sustain in
   larger, less personal high schools. Thus, these parents may reconsider
   their dedication to city living as their children age. We discuss the
   implications of this research for urban theory and policy.

AB Apology is an increasingly prominent form of conflict management in many
   areas of social life. Yet there are few systematic studies of apology as
   a dependent variable. Analyzing the last statements of Texas death row
   prisoners, we find that the best predictor of apology is affiliation
   with God. Under traditional Western conceptions, God is an actor endowed
   with extraordinarily high status. Drawing on the theoretical paradigm
   known as pure sociology, we argue that death row prisoners who invoke
   God as a third party in their conflict thereby elevate their own status.
   Greater vertical closeness to the victim's side generates more social
   assertiveness and a greater willingness to apologize publicly. In
   addition, affiliation increases prisoners' relational closeness to God,
   enhancing their probability of adopting God's modern message of
   reconciliation. God's status has, however, declined somewhat over the
   past several centuriesa trend that helps to explain the modern religious
   emphasis on reconciliation over punishment, apology over defiance.

AB While W. E. B. Du Bois is widely recognized for his contributions to the
   sociology of race, his contributions to the foundations of sociology are
   largely ignored. His sociology is based on African American reformism, a
   version of pragmatism, and a contingent historicism. The basic view of
   sociology is one that emphasizes the role of chance and will as opposed
   to law and certainty. He called sociology "the science of free will."
   His view of society is one that focuses on the historical contingency of
   the structure of society, the malleability of society, and the
   fundamental feature of American society: a society built around the
   "color line" or "veil." This view of society is not merely an
   interesting historical anomaly, but has significant implications for the
   understanding of and development of contemporary sociology.

AB College-educated adults are healthier than other people in the United

   education influences health. This article focuses on the possibility
   that the health benefits of college may vary according to childhood
   (mis)fortune and people's propensity to attain a college degree in the
   first place. Several perspectives from life course sociology offer
   competing hypotheses as to whether the most or the least advantaged see
   the greatest return of a college education. The authors use a national
   survey of middle-age American adults to assess risk of two
   cardiovascular health problems and mortality. Results from propensity
   score and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that the protective
   effect of college attainment is indeed heterogeneous. Further, the
   greatest returns are among those least likely to experience this life
   course transition (i.e., compensatory leveling). Explanations for this
   selection effect are offered, along with several directions for future
   research on the health benefits of completing college.

AB This paper builds on the general connection between culture consumption
   and sociability which has been the focus of recent research in the
   sociology of culture. I propose that cultural variety, as given by the
   number of cultural activities that the person engages in, is tied not
   only to static properties of social networks (such as range), but also
   to the likelihood of having benefited from this connectivity (social
   capital). Taking the classic example of finding a job via a network
   contact as the main outcome, I show that persons who have a propensity
   to engage in a wide variety of cultural activities have a higher
   likelihood of having found out about their current job via a weak tie
   and that different types of weak tie activation are selectively
   correlated with distinct cultural taste profiles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB The authors assess the extent to which national-level integration in the
   world polity influences individual-level concern for the environment.
   While theoretically-derived propositions about such relationships have a
   deep history in comparative sociology, they-with few exceptions-remain
   untested. Consistent with past research, employed national-level
   measures of world polity integration include the relative presence of
   environmental international nongovernmental organizations (EINGOs) and
   the existence of environmental ministries. Results of multilevel
   analyses of individual-level environmental concern in 37 nations
   indicate that both forms of world polity integration increase the
   likelihood of individual-level environmental concern, net of other
   national-level factors and individual-level characteristics; although we
   find stronger support for the influence of EINGOs as a key variable
   indicating world polity connection. The findings provide unique support
   for world polity theory, suggesting that future research should consider
   how elements of world polity integration influence other forms of
   individual attitudes and behaviors. The results also highlight the
   importance in considering global and transnational factors when
   assessing the determinants of individual attitudes about the

AB This analysis tests overlooked sociological hypotheses about women's

   Stereotypes about women suggest that shifts in social conditions affect
   these political outcomes by making such stereotypes more or less
   salient. Findings indicate that beliefs about female competencies-such
   as women's purported unwillingness to endorse violent solutions-should
   reduce support for female candidates when increases in violent crime
   create demands for increasingly severe punishments. Since women also are
   typecast as being more protective of vulnerable populations than males,
   states with larger minority populations should have additional women in
   both legislatures. Pooled time-series models based on 1127 state-years
   show that fewer women were present in the state legislatures or in state
   delegations to the House after increases in the murder rates. States
   with larger minority populations, however, had more women in these two

AB Evidence shows that parental financial investments increase college
   attendance, but we know little about how these investments shape
   postsecondary achievement. Two theoretical frameworks suggest diametric
   conclusions. Some studies operate from a more-is-more perspective in
   which children use calculated parental allocations to make academic
   progress. In contrast, a more-is-less perspective, rooted in a different
   model of rational behavior, suggests that parental investments create a
   disincentive for student achievement. I adjudicate between these
   frameworks, using data from nationally representative postsecondary
   datasets to determine what effect financial parental investments have on
   student GPA and degree completion. The findings suggest seemingly
   contradictory processes. Parental aid decreases student GPA, but it
   increases the odds of graduating-net of explanatory variables and
   accounting for alternative funding. Rather than strategically using
   resources in accordance with parental goals, or maximizing on their
   ability to avoid academic work, students are satisficing: they meet the
   criteria for adequacy on multiple fronts, rather than optimizing their
   chances for a particular outcome. As a result, students with parental
   funding often perform well enough to stay in school but dial down their
   academic efforts. I conclude by highlighting the importance of life
   stage and institutional context for parental investment.

   mechanisms and regimes to show how Tilly's understanding of actors,

AB Sociology frequently presumes interest-oriented action but deconstructs
   interests. Here, we argue for more inquiry into the social conditions
   under which interest-oriented action is generated. We analyze how
   interest-oriented action is understood in classical sociology, rational
   choice theory, social exchange theory, and cultural sociology. These
   perspectives vary in the extent to which interests are an explanatory
   principle, how interests are considered, and how emergent social
   formations are explained. However, they share an implicit recognition
   that the question of when interest-oriented action emerges needs more
   attention. Rather than naturalizing interest-oriented action, or
   investigating how interests are constructed, the most productive
   direction for future sociological research on interests is to specify
   better when action oriented to interests becomes normative.

AB This article reviews and evaluates recent comparative social science
   scholarship on healthcare systems. We focus on four of the strongest
   themes in current research: (a) the development of typologies of
   healthcare systems, (b) assessment of convergence among healthcare
   systems, (c) problematization of the shifting boundaries of healthcare
   systems, and (d) the relationship between healthcare systems and social
   inequalities. Our discussion seeks to highlight the central debates that
   animate current scholarship and identify unresolved questions and new
   opportunities for research. We also identify five currents in
   contemporary sociology that have not been incorporated as deeply as they
   might into research on healthcare systems. These five missed turns
   include emphases on social relations, culture, postnational theory,
   institutions, and causal mechanisms. We conclude by highlighting some
   key challenges for comparative research on healthcare systems.

AB Scholarly work on the nexus of religion, nationalism, and violence is
   currently fragmented along disciplinary and theoretical lines. In
   sociology, history, and anthropology, a macro-culturalist approach
   reigns; in political science, economics, and international relations, a
   micro-rationalist approach is dominant. Recent attempts at a synthesis
   ignore religion or fold it into ethnicity. A coherent synthesis capable
   of adequately accounting for religious-nationalist violence must not
   only integrate micro and macro, cultural and strategic approaches; it
   must also include a meso level of elite conflict and boundary
   maintenance and treat the religious field as potentially autonomous from
   the cultural field.

   integration in congregations since the 1940s, only recently has there
   been a concerted focus on this topic. This article-having reviewed the

   three vital labors: explore more theory building or theory extension,
   interact with the broader field of sociology, and explicate how
   religious racial diversity contributes to or dismantles systems of

AB Environmental sociology has become a mature field within the discipline
   of sociology. We consider several of the key theories that define the
   core and boundaries of the field, calling attention to debates and
   unresolved questions. We contend that two of the defining features of
   this field are (a) attention to the inseparability of human and nonhuman
   natures and (b) attention to the role that power and social inequality
   play in shaping human/nonhuman interactions. These two characteristics
   of environmental sociology also reveal strong links between this field
   and the broader discipline, in light of recent reexaminations of
   classical sociological writings. We conclude with a consideration of new
   directions environmental sociologists might take toward building an even
   more robust, interdisciplinary, and critical area of study.

AB Epigenetics is a burgeoning area of biomedical research into the
   mechanisms by which genes are regulated-how the activity of producing
   proteins is controlled. Although molecular epigenetic research is highly
   biochemical, it is of interest to sociologists because some epigenetic
   changes are environmentally mediated and can persist across the life
   span or into further generations. Environmental epigenetic research
   tracks mechanisms by which social forces-from pollution to nutrition to
   mothering to traumatic experience-become molecularly embodied, affect
   gene expression, and induce durable changes in behavior and health. We
   begin with an introduction to the science of environmental epigenetics
   focused on articulating the logic of experimentation and explanation in
   this field. Turning to sociologists' key interests, we review the
   growing literature on epigenetics of socioeconomic status. Finally, we
   consider how epigenetics offers opportunities and challenges for
   sociological research on both empirical and theoretical grounds.

AB This review surveys the sociological work on race and sport over the
   past 50 years. It begins by outlining the importance of C.L.R. James's
   book Beyond a Boundary as a foundational text for the critical sociology
   of race and sport. Two paradigms of research on race and sport are
   sketched: the critical and the functionalist-evolutionary. The article
   then reviews the major contributions to the study of race and sport from
   three areas, namely mainstream American sociology, the sociology of
   race, and the sociology of sport, focusing primarily on the research
   published since 2000. The article concludes by looking at future
   directions of work in the field, suggesting that although sport remains
   marginal to mainstream American sociology and the insights of scholars
   such as James remain overlooked, the best work on race and sport will
   continue to emerge from the subfield of sport studies.

AB The study of housing has a long history in sociology, but since the
   1960s, it has been relatively hidden in a number of sociological
   subfields and scattered across a range of disciplines. The financial
   crisis of 2008 elevated housing issues to the level of national and
   international debate and protest, and it offers a framework for
   organizing the scholarship on housing into that which studies housing as
   a commodity, on one hand, and as a right, on the other. In the former
   category, I review the literature on mortgage financing; property values
   and wealth; and affordable rental housing, foreclosures, and evictions.
   In the latter category, I discuss the theoretical arguments for a right
   to housing and review the research on activist demands for that right.
   The tension between these two aspects of housing is discussed
   throughout. I conclude by proposing the actual home or apartment as a
   productive area for new sociological analysis.

AB This article endeavors to replace the sociology of professions with the
   more comprehensive and timely sociology of expertise. It suggests that
   we need to distinguish between experts and expertise as requiring two
   distinct modes of analysis that are not reducible to one another. It
   analyzes expertise as a network linking together agents, devices,
   concepts, and institutional and spatial arrangements. It also suggests
   rethinking how abstraction and power were analyzed in the sociology of
   professions. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to
   explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses. This article
   shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the
   deinstitutionalization of mental retardation created a new institutional
   matrix within which a new set of actors-the parents of children with
   autism in alliance with psychologists and therapists-were able to forge
   an alternative network of expertise.

AB This article presents a theoretical approach for studying the
   coordination of futures. Building off theories of temporality and
   action, the authors map three different modes of future
   making-protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes-that actors
   need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a
   wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of
   future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although
   they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in
   interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those
   three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a
   methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms
   through which other theoretical or empirical constructs-such as racism
   or late modernity-operate; and open a window into the ways in which
   people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its
   own right.

AB Postcolonial theory has enjoyed wide influence in the humanities but it
   has left sociology comparatively unscathed. Does this mean that
   postcolonial theory is not relevant to sociology? Focusing upon social
   theory and historical sociology in particular, this article considers if
   and how postcolonial theory in the humanities might be imported into
   North American sociology. It argues that postcolonial theory offers a
   substantial critique of sociology because it alerts us to sociology's
   tendency to analytically bifurcate social relations. The article also
   suggests that a postcolonial sociology can overcome these problems by
   incorporating relational social theories to give new accounts of
   modernity. Rather than simply studying non-Western postcolonial
   societies or only examining colonialism, this approach insists upon the
   interactional constitution of social units, processes, and practices
   across space. To illustrate, the article draws upon relational theories
   (actor-network theory and field theory) to offer postcolonial accounts
   of two conventional research areas in historical sociology: the
   industrial revolution in England and the French Revolution.

AB The scholarly literature on teaching sociology contains relatively
   little about improving courses from one semester to the next. In this
   article, I describe a method for continual teaching improvement that is
   based on writing, the well-established practice of teacher reflection,
   and classical sociological principles. This method was developed through
   the analysis of nine semesters of autoethnographic data that I collected
   in the form of daily reflective notes. The benefits of this
   sociologically informed reflective practice include grounding
   evaluations of individual class periods and entire courses in empirical
   data, becoming more efficient with course preparation, providing one
   with a stronger sense of mastery as a teacher, and developing as a
   sociologist by using the classroom as a key site for engaging in praxis.
   This practice can help teachers refine individual courses, improve as an
   instructor in an overall sense and more deeply connect sociology to the
   scholarship of teaching and learning.

AB Sociologists and scholars of composition have long argued that in order
   to get students to improve the quality of what they write, they need to
   change how they write. Here, the authors assess whether students'
   participation in writing-intensive first-year seminars leads to changes
   in their writing process. Data collected via pretest and posttest
   interviews of 34 students show that writing-intensive seminars help
   first-year students become better planners and revisers yet have little
   effect on the ways that they prewrite and draft. Additionally, students
   in their first semester of college demonstrate higher order writing
   processes at the beginning of their seminar than their second-semester
   counterparts and show more improvement over the course of the semester
   as well. We analyze the conditions that foster these patterns and
   suggest that increasing quantitative course requirements (i.e., page
   counts) may hamper students' ability to adopt qualitatively better
   writing strategies.

AB In this article, we examine common practices and attitudes surrounding
   writing pedagogy in the sociology classroom based on an analysis of
   interviews with 19 sociologists at seven institutions in the Northeast.
   Our discussion is centered on two distinct approaches to writing that
   faculty identified: writing as cognitive development and writing as
   skill development. We observe that when they teach writing, sociologists
   shift their attention back and forth between these two essential
   features of good writing. Our analysis contextualizes writing as a form
   of distributed cognition (Salomon 1993), because it is taught and
   learned across multiple experiences in the academy. In conclusion, we
   suggest that a greater attentiveness to the underlying cognitive
   features of writing will broaden opportunities for campus-wide dialogue
   about writing across the disciplines and enhance our students' ability
   to transfer and build upon their writing experiences across courses.

   transactional writing is used in courses stating critical thinking and

AB Both "theory" and "writing" engender a great deal of anxiety for the
   typical undergraduate sociology major. Writing-intensive theory courses
   increase this feeling exponentially. Active learning approaches to
   teaching theory are often advocated as a way to combat these fears, but
   few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce
   student anxiety. This article describes and evaluates the Film Analysis
   Papers writing assignment designed to reduce student anxiety in an
   undergraduate theory course. I present data from a questionnaire that
   asked students to assess the effect of writing about film on theory
   anxiety. Findings show that the film assignment reduced anxiety about
   writing theoretically and improved student confidence in their ability
   to theorize. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of
   active learning approaches on theory anxiety in order to understand
   whether anxiety mediates the relationship between active learning and
   learning outcomes in theory classes.

AB This article contributes to an ongoing theoretical effort to extend the
   insights of relational and network sociology into adjacent domains. We
   integrate Simmel's late theory of the relational self into the formal
   analysis of social relations, generating a framework for theorizing
   forms of association among self-relating individuals. On this model,
   every "node" in an interaction has relations not only to others but also
   to itself, specifically between its ideality and its actuality. We go on
   to integrate this self-relation into a formal model of social relations.
   This model provides a way to describe configurations of social
   interactions defined by the forms according to which social relations
   realize participants' ideal selves. We examine four formal dimensions
   along which these self-relational relationships can vary: distance,
   symmetry, scope, and actualization.

AB Sociologists have argued that markets are politically constituted, yet

   this article I show how the concept of cultural framing-already widely
   used by economic sociologists-can be further developed to explain how
   mobilization reproduces markets in some moments while reorganizing them
   in others. Specifically, I link the concept of cultural framing to
   rent-seeking mobilization within markets to better explain when
   political contestation will lead to new market institutions and when it
   will fail to do so. I illustrate the value of this approach through an
   analysis of deregulation in the U. S. airline industry and conclude by
   discussing the consequences of the model and empirical case for the
   politics of markets, the rise of neoliberalism, and economic
   policymaking.

AB Weber argued that human suffering creates the demand for theodicies:
   cultural vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain perceived
   injustices. This article combines an interpretive analysis of rhetoric
   commemorating the events of September 11, 2001 with an effort to
   construct generalizable cultural theory, demonstrating how the Weberian
   concept of theodicy adds to our understanding of commemorative rhetoric.
   In the case of September 11 commemorations, the theodicies deployed
   exhibit a clear fracture. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville,
   Pennsylvania, have taken a dualistic approach to the problem of
   theodicy, while speakers in Manhattan have taken a tragic approach. This
   variation can be explained through a four-part model that argues
   theodicies are structured by (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3)
   audiences, and (4) genre memory. More broadly, I argue for explicit
   attention to theodicy in cultural sociology, demonstrating that the
   quest for theodicy is a crucial driving force behind the impulse to
   commemorate in the first place.

AB Urban sociology has tended to study interactions between passersby and
   street persons with an emphasis on the ways street persons become
   bothersome, harassing, or dangerous. This article moves away from the
   focus on the ways interactions in public go awry and focuses on how
   individuals account for the mundane, everyday exchanges they have with
   strangers who seek their help. Based on interview data (N = 31) and
   qualitative analysis of data from an Internet survey (N = 110), this
   article suggests that the presence of beggars does not inherently
   symbolize urban decay to passersby and does not necessarily elicit
   anxiety, but instead provides a valuable texture of urban life. Further,
   the article argues that individuals, when justifying their responses to
   requests for help from needy persons (beggars) in urban spaces, use a
   variety of cultural strategies to maintain their perception of
   themselves as moral persons, both when they choose to help and when they
   refuse. Drawing from these findings, the article suggests that urban
   sociology and the sociology of risk would benefit from sensitizing their
   studies of public interactions to the diverse meanings individuals

AB Democratic theorists and social scientists suggest that a deliberative
   public sphere would be good for democracy by maximizing emancipatory
   possibilities and providing broad legitimacy to political decision
   making. But do ordinary Americans actually want a deliberative public
   sphere? I examine this question in the context of four contentious
   religion and science debates. Through a multidimensional evaluation
   exercise with 62 ordinary respondents, I find that evaluation of public
   representatives in these debates tends to favor open-mindedness and
   ongoing debate. Further, respondents explicitly discount elected
   representatives who participate in public debate precisely because they
   are seen as violating deliberative norms through their affiliation with
   electoral politics. Respondents want a deliberative public sphere.
   However, this desire reflects an understanding of the public sphere and
   institutional politics as disconnected arenas with incompatible rules
   and objectives, raising multiple questions for democratic theory and for
   political sociology.

AB Much research has concluded that human rights treaties have a null or
   negative effect on governments human rights practices. This article
   reexamines the influence of human rights treaties, with a focus on two
   kinds of treaty effects: directthe effect of treaties on the countries
   that ratified them; and diffusethe effect of treaties on countries
   regardless of ratification. My analysis of two prominent human rights
   treaties finds that they often reduce levels of repression and abuse
   over time and independently of ratification. Some of these effects are
   nonlinear, reversing direction as time elapses or as more countries
   become party to the treaties. These findings are interpreted with
   reference to world polity institutionalism in sociology, and especially
   the Durkheimian strains of this approach. Human rights norms as embodied
   in treaties operate as a kind of civil religion for world society. These
   norms not only have long-term direct effects among countries that
   ritualistically ratify human rights treaties, but they also diffusely
   impact countries irrespective of formal endorsement.

AB This article sets out to explain why after the 1978 assassination of San
   Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk, it is
   the latter who has achieved world recognition. At the time of their
   assassination Moscone was the more well-known figure, an American
   politician with a national reputation. The theories of social drama and
   cultural trauma are applied in this explanatory process. These theories
   provide a framework for analyzing how this incident became a significant
   event locally and nationally. The fact that Milk was one of the first
   openly gay people to hold public office in the United States meant that
   his life and death would have significance for a wide group of people.
   Individuals and organizations associated with gay liberation became
   carrier groups which created the Harvey Milk story and how it was told.
   Such carrier groups saw to it that Milk was remembered, and remembered
   in a particular way.

   analyst combines preexisting generalizations with specific observations
   from within a single case to make causal inferences about that case.
   Process tracing tests can be used to help establish that (1) an initial
   event or process took place, (2) a subsequent outcome also occurred, and
   (3) the former was a cause of the latter. The article focuses on the
   logic of different process tracing tests, including hoop tests, smoking
   gun tests, and straw in the wind tests. New criteria for judging the
   strength of these tests are developed using ideas concerning the
   relative importance of necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarities
   and differences between process tracing and the deductive-nomological

AB This article approaches work talk, a neglected but vital object of
   sociological inquiry, as a possible key to unlocking the mystery of the
   contemporary work ethic as it appears among male professionals living
   and working in the United States and Western Europe. This analytical
   task is carried out through a close examination of the contrasting
   rhetorics, scripts, and vocabularies anchoring French, Norwegian, and
   American forms of hard work talk. This comparative exercise capitalizes
   on material from over one hundred in-depth interviews with comparable
   French, Norwegian, and American male business professionals working in
   finance, law, consulting, engineering and other professional fields.
   Scrutinizing the scripts that members of these three groups use to
   address their motives for working hard in demanding jobs, this article
   maps a legitimation divide between the American respondents and their
   French and Norwegian counterparts. The hard work commentaries of the
   French and Norwegian respondents feature script repertoires that focus
   exclusively on the stimulating and enriching character of their work
   activities. By contrast, the commentaries of the American respondents
   incorporate overachievement scripts addressing both the extrinsic
   rewards of work and the personality traits that make hard work a natural
   expression of personality. These hard work commentaries invoke career
   success and moneymaking as inducements to hard work. But they also
   invoke personality traits such as drive and the innate aversion to
   leisure. This transatlantic divide reflects the greater cultural
   resonance of self-realization in the two European contexts and the fact
   that the French and Norwegians have embraced a more Maslowian approach
   to working life. As I argue in the article's conclusion, these
   transatlantic differences in script repertoires can be viewed as the
   product of the societally specific cultural configurations at work in
   the three countries. Such cultural configurations define what it
   means-in terms of status and authenticity-to work hard in a remunerative
   and rewarding job.

   typically think that it is developed for our students, there appears to
   be a considerable gap between how our curriculum, especially
   Introductory Sociology is organized, and what we know about current
   college students. Drawing on data on enrollment in sociology and overall
   in colleges and universities along with recent scholarly portraits of
   college students by Nathan (2005), Clydesdale (2007), and Arum and Roska
   (2011), I offer the following argument: (1) Our "students" are primarily
   those who take Introductory Sociology, and this class, indeed, is our
   public face for most nonacademics; (2) given where U.S. college students
   matriculate, all too often, Introductory Sociology is likely being
   taught by someone not as well connected as we might like to our main
   professional organization; (3) comprehensive textbooks dominate the
   Introductory Sociology market and contain more information that can
   reasonably be covered in one semester; (4) college students are
   "practical credentialists" who spend relatively little time outside of
   the classroom on their studies; and (5) whether or not we as
   sociologists agree on what needs to be covered in Introductory Sociology
   and other courses, we have derived these understandings among ourselves,
   paying little attention to what skills and knowledge our students want
   and/or need. If Introductory Sociology really is our public face, we
   clearly need to spend a considerable amount of time in making sure that
   this is how we want to be seen.

   is used to evaluate the effect of the different course settings,

   indicate that differences in student performance between the two

   that student satisfaction does not significantly differ across the two

   how their own consumption habits are shaped by larger social forces and
   how they, along with most Americans, tend toward overconsumption. To a
   more limited extent, it may help enhance cognitive understanding of

   Drawn from a national sample of adoptive households (n = 63,681), the

   Although white adoptive parents, in general, are more likely to
   transracially adopt Hispanic and Asian children, white single and

   interpret three ecologiessuccessive periods of urban metabolism research
   spanning three disciplines within the social sciences. The first is the
   human ecology of the Chicago School, which treated the city as an
   ecosystem in analogy to external, natural ecosystems. The second is
   industrial ecology: materials-flow analyses of cities that conceptualize
   external nature as the source of urban metabolism's raw materials and
   the destination for its social wastes. The third is urban political
   ecology, a reconceptualization of the city as a product of diverse
   socio-natural flows. By analyzing these three traditions in succession,
   I demonstrate both the efficacy and the limits to Catton and Dunlap's
   distinction between a human exemptionalist paradigm and a new ecological
   paradigm in sociology.

AB U.S. immigration has changed dramatically in the last 20 years:
   immigrants have increasingly gravitated toward new destinations and a
   growing portion are undocumented. In the absence of federal
   comprehensive immigration reform, states are proposing a patchwork of
   laws. While some laws encourage immigrant integration, most seek
   restriction. To understand this trend, this article analyzes Utah as a
   new immigration destination, exploring its transformation from an
   inclusive to a restrictive state. It focuses on a major debate: whether
   to allow unauthorized residents legal driving privileges. Because Utah
   initiated this law earlier than most, it leads this debate. To explain
   its evolution, this article analyzes 10 years of legislative debates and
   articles published on this law. Building on the narrative studies
   literature, I find that both sides of the immigration debate utilized a
   public safety and well-being narrative. However, supporters of the
   driver license law relied on a lower mimetic narrative, characterized by
   logic and factual arguments. In contrast, their opponents wove a
   compelling, apocalyptic narrative to criticize the law. This narrative
   indelibly linked immigration to the dangers of crime and terrorism and
   thus paved the way for the passage of one of the most restrictive
   immigration laws in the United States.

AB Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are
   analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and
   interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine
   together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues
   relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1)
   social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend
   socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins
   interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of
   religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively
   substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms
   play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization
   plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious
   outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications
   for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious
   homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as
   limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed. (c)

AB This article explores the phenomenological and socially constructed
   experience of time during the finite period of the vacation. Temporal
   routine is considered as a form of social control from which vacations
   and similar breaks for time off offer opportunities for agency and
   release. In-depth interviews, participant observation, and a narrative
   analysis of vacation blogs are used to analyze norms in orientation to
   time while one is away from select constraints of everyday life.
   Approaches to time while on vacation are found to fall into two ideal
   types: those who may "ignore" time and find release from schedules and
   routine, and those who must closely attend to its passage. Influences of
   duration, frequency and pace are also central in moderating experience.

AB This is a qualitative study detailing the links between racial discourse
   and social action. Specifically, this article provides evidence for the
   ways in which a white habitus is reproduced in a racially diverse
   community, despite the best intentions of its community members. This is
   chiefly due to the influence of national color-blind ideologies and the
   diversity discourse that follows. Because this ideology and discourse
   are individual in nature and centered on a white norm, it chiefly
   produces consumption-driven actions for individuals and collective
   action that protects those with racial privilege. While prior studies
   have detailed the influence of this ideology on racial attitudes and
   examined the contours of diversity discourse generally, this study
   utilizes the racial formations approach to make concrete links to social
   outcomes in a diverse community. These findings are particularly
   significant given the hope vested in racially diverse communities as the
   nation itself becomes more diverse.

AB We explore how white activists' racial identity struggles might disrupt
   effective antiracist action in multiracial organizations. Drawing on
   data collected through participant observation and interviews, we
   examine the struggles of a small, multiracial antiracist organization
   that protests the Cleveland baseball franchise's 'Indians' name and
   Chief Wahoo mascot. White activists' racial consciousness, or awareness
   of white racism and white privilege, compels them to participate in the
   group; their ways of participating, however, ultimately may hamper the
   organizational effectiveness of the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity
   and Resistance. Specifically, white activists' racial consciousness
   makes them reluctant to adopt necessary leadership roles. Borrowing from
   literature on white racism, white racial consciousness, and multiracial
   organizing, we illustrate the complex nature and potential pitfalls of
   multiracial alliances formed to protest racism in the United States.

AB In the heated debate regarding 'illegal immigration' in the US,
   arguments and accusations have abounded regarding economics,
   citizenship, criminality, and culture, but race has remained
   conspicuously sidelined in public discussion. I argue that race is in
   fact central to the debate on immigration, both by those opposed to any
   legalization of undocumented workers in the US and those who favor a
   temporary worker ('work visa') program. In this article, I examine how
   both anti-immigration and pro-work-visa groups framed the immigration
   debate as reported in newspaper articles in the particularly contentious
   period from December 2005 to November 2006. I performed a content
   analysis of three newspapers representing three different regions and
   three differing histories of immigration: the Chicago Tribune, the
   Houston Chronicle, and the Raleigh News & Observer. Using Blumer's group
   position theory, I examine the patterns within the discussion for
   evidence of preservation of racial group position on the part of both
   anti-immigration and pro-work visa advocates.

   this condition, this article has two interrelated goals: first, to raise
   the importance of Bourdieu's 'cultural intermediary' and the practice of
   spatial narratives as concerns for the study of culture, and, second, to
   refit Wendy Griswold's (1987a) 1987 framework for a sociology of culture

AB Social scientists have intensely debated the use of deception in
   experimental research, and conflicting norms governing the use of
   deception are now firmly entrenched along disciplinary lines. Deception
   is typically allowed in sociology and social psychology but proscribed
   in economics. Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are
   generally not based on ethical considerations but on pragmatic grounds:
   the anti-deception camp argues that deceiving participants leads to
   invalid results, while the other side argues that deception has little
   negative impact and, under certain conditions, can even enhance
   validity. These divergent norms governing the use of deception are
   important because they stifle interdisciplinary research and discovery,
   create hostilities between disciplines and researchers, and can
   negatively impact the careers of scientists who may be sanctioned for
   following the norms of their home discipline. We present two
   experimental studies aimed at addressing the issue empirically. Study 1
   addresses the effects of direct exposure to deception, while Study 2
   addresses the effects of indirect exposure to deception. Results from
   both studies suggest that deception does not significantly affect the
   validity of experimental results.

AB Past research in both the transitions to adulthood literature and
   cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies
   on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the
   contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways
   are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93
   interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s
   to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional
   markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models
   do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities?
   In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that
   respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an
   inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I
   demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and
   women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful
   family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their
   performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left
   many lost in transition.

   states, human rights language is, first, especially common in countries
   most susceptible to global influences. Second, human rights language is
   driven by the extent of the international human rights regime at the
   time of a constitution's writing. Third, human rights language tends to
   appear in newer constitutions and in the constitutions of emergent and
   reorganized states. National constitutions are imprinted with global

AB Despite the prominence of teaching in academia, we know little about how
   graduate students learn to teach. We propose the concept of a teaching
   community network (TCN), an informal social network that facilitates the
   exchange of teaching-specific resources. We explore the role of TCNs
   through a case study of a sociology doctoral program at a large state
   university. Results reveal that students rely heavily on informal ties
   within the graduate student community and existing formal programs to
   share teaching-related resources (e.g., information and social support)
   and develop their identities as instructors. We suggest that graduate
   programs facilitate TCNs through formal teacher-training programs and
   structural conditions that encourage informal, one-on-one interactions
   (e.g., shared offices). By cultivating TCNs, graduate programs can
   assist students in developing their teaching skills and identities as
   instructors, thus training students to balance the demands of research
   and teaching within an academic culture.

   program to institutionalize the practice of method triangulation, and

   community partners when engaging in community-based learning. Often when
   faculty incorporate service- or community-based learning into their
   classes, we measure the "learning" part but not the "service" or
   "community." Focusing more on the latter involves working "with"
   community partners instead of working "for" community partners, and this
   focus creates a more effective experience for all stakeholders involved.
   Achieving this goal of working "with" partners not only requires
   collaboration but also requires an effort to create and develop a sense
   of agency among the community partners. In the current teaching note,
   collaborative projects between undergraduate sociology classes and a
   local senior center are discussed. These projects show enhanced learning
   for the college students as well as an enhanced experience for community
   partners due to the emphasis on establishing and nurturing agency among

AB This article develops the concept of experiential careers, drawing
   theoretical attention to the routinization and de-routinization of
   specific experiences as they unfold over social career trajectories.
   Based on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in two religious
   communities, we compare the social-temporal patterning of religious
   experience among newly religious Orthodox Jews and converted Muslims in
   two cities in the United States. In both cases, we find that as newly
   religious people work to transform their previous bodily habits and take
   on newly prescribed religious acts, the beginning of their religious
   careers becomes marked by what practitioners describe as potent
   religious experiences in situations of religious practice. However, over
   time, these once novel practices become routinized and religious
   experiences in these situations diminish, thus provoking actors and
   institutions in both fields to work to re-enchant religious life.
   Through this ethnographic comparison, we demonstrate the utility of
   focusing on experiential careers as a sociological unit of analysis.
   Doing so allows sociologists to use a non-reductive phenomenological
   approach to chart the shifting manifestations of experiences people
   deeply care about, along with the patterned enchantments,
   disenchantments, and possible re-enchantments these social careers
   entail. As such, this approach contributes to the analysis of social
   careers and experiences of "becoming" across both religious and
   non-religious domains.

   conscious action has often been viewed at the level of the individual
   actor and, moreover, in overly "cognitive" and "rational" terms. As a
   result, the very reading of classic texts has been historically biased
   against the seeing of emotion, even when it is addressed. What

   of the genomic research that has identified the clusters, without
   diminishing the social character of their context, meaning, production,

   constructionist account of race as lacking biological reality, its main
   shortcomings, and our proposed solution: the concept of clinal classes.
   The second part discusses the character of the group differences that
   would be consistent with clinal classes and introduces the concept of
   genomic individualism, which extends an emerging model for understanding
   biosocial causation to include the genetic effects of ancestry. The

AB In contemporary sociology the once prominent study of public opinion has
   virtually disappeared. None of the leading theoretical models in the
   closest disciplinary subfield (political sociology) currently provide
   ample or sufficiently clear space for consideration of public opinion as
   a possible factor in shaping or interacting with key policy or political
   outcomes in democratic polities. In this article, we unearth and
   document the sources of this curious development and raise questions
   about its implications for how political sociologists have come to
   understand policy making, state formation, and political conflict. We
   begin by reconstructing the dismissal of public opinion in the
   intellectual reorientation of political sociology from the late 1970s
   onward. We argue that the most influential scholarly works of this
   period (including those of Tilly, Skocpol, Mann, Esping-Andersen, and
   Domhoff) face an underlying paradox: While often rejecting public
   opinion, their theoretical logics ultimately presuppose its operation.
   These now classical writings did not move toward research programs
   seeking engagement with the operation and formation of public opinion,
   even though our immanent critique suggests they in fact require
   precisely this turn. We address the challenge of reconceptualizing how
   public opinion might be productively integrated into the sociological
   study of politics by demonstrating that the major arguments in the
   subfield can be fruitfully extended by grappling with public opinion. We
   conclude by considering several recent, interdisciplinary examples of
   scholarship that, we argue, point the way toward a fruitful
   revitalization.

   A scene creates an emotive context that demands consistent and timely

AB The debate on civic decline inspired by Putnam's "bowling alone" thesis
   exposed an important limitation in three dominant conceptions of the
   civic. Whether conceptualized as a locus, type, or motivation for
   action, the boundaries distinguishing the civic from other categories of
   political action are permeable and indistinct. This article develops a
   theory of civic production to better account for the inherent
   normativity and "porousness" of this analytic category. I conceptualize
   the civic as a variable, contingent outcome or product of a contentious
   performance undertaken in some venue for some reason. The phenomenon of
   "civic recreation," a form of fund-raising that combines a leisure
   activity with a public cause, underscores the necessity of a theory of
   civic production. I draw from social movement theory and from
   ethnographic data from one fitness fund-raiser to illustrate some of the
   key processes and outcomes for which a theory of civic production must
   account.

   Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income

   the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings
   inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error
   causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion
   is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial
   downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks
   at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial
   group inequality for Black men. Together, our results call attention to
   the potential distortions generated by systematic measurement error on
   economic inequality estimates.

AB The study of sport spectatorship has an increasing focus on the

   fan behavior are the meaningful rituals and emotions experienced by
   fans. In this paper, I use the theoretical work of Randall Collins to
   examine the ritualistic outcomes of collective effervescence, emotional
   energy, and group symbols and solidarity among sport fans. I illustrate
   these concepts using case study data from participant observation of
   fans of a U.S. football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and content
   analysis of news articles. I extend Collins' interaction ritual (IR)
   theory by taking the group as the unit of analysis and analyzing group
   solidarity beyond situational interactions and typical sport settings,
   including the significant life events of weddings and funerals. While
   critiquing Collins' (2004) a priori portrayal of sports fans, the
   analysis advances IR theory, improving its utility for understanding
   sports fan behavior.

AB Although few disagree that advancements in technology and the
   establishment of trade-conducive transnational institutions play an
   important role in augmenting the potential for trade globalization,
   there is more disagreement surrounding alternative causal explanations
   of trade during the postwar period. While world-system scholars argue
   that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is
   powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive
   policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the
   emanation of cultural scripts that create compatible national
   institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these
   theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945
   to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results
   provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in
   the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade
   globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the
   world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively
   associated with international trade, there is little evidence to
   validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental
   organizations enhances trade globalization.

   less if the coercer is a computer. These hypotheses are extended from

   experiment of coercion in social exchange, adding a human versus

   that replicates Molm et al.s study and supports the hypotheses on

   sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and
   present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism
   appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and
   archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling,
   the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce
   educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort,
   unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be
   interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a
   virtuous identity, claims to be "one who aspires."

   approach to the environment, including its significance for his
   interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For
   Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical
   realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy
   scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways
   within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to

   elaborate upon the ways that neoliberalism and the politics of sex and

   movements previously organized around struggles for economic justice and

   further demonstrate how human rights discourse has become a key vehicle
   both for the transnationalization of carceral politics and for the
   reincorporation of these policies into the domestic terrain in a
   benevolent, feminist guise. I conclude by urging greater and more
   nuanced attention to the operations of gender and sexual politics within
   mainstream analyses of contemporary modes of punishment, as well as a
   careful consideration of the neoliberal carceral state within feminist
   discussions of gender, sexuality, and the law.

AB Military expenditures have escalated over the last three decades in both
   developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding
   expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed
   towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the "new" military. We
   hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no
   longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many
   uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant
   consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such
   consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this
   hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed
   and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that
   military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per
   soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither
   total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a
   significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's "new"
   military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an
   equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. (C)

AB This article describes and evaluates an activity designed to demonstrate
   how biological factors (e.g., genetics), individual-level behaviors
   (e.g., smoking), and social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) shape
   health status and access to health care. Active learning techniques were
   utilized to introduce the sociological imagination as it pertains to
   health, as well as to physically demonstrate stratification processes. A
   pretest-posttest design was implemented to evaluate the activity's
   impact on student learning outcomes (N = 305). Analysis suggests that
   after the activity students regarded society as important for
   influencing health, including a shift in responsibility for one's health
   away from the individual, and that students gained a greater
   understanding of the importance of social class in shaping health. In
   open-ended responses, students indicated that the physicality of the
   approach provided further clarity of abstract concepts. Implications of
   these findings and broader directions for advancing students'
   understanding of disparities related to health are discussed.

   a one-semester, required sociology research capstone course. The data
   come from 106 students in eight sections of the course taught at three
   institutions. We used multiple methods for data collection:
   questionnaires, focus groups, and learning reflection essays. Our
   results include students' having a good sense of what to expect from the
   course, reporting learning many research-related skills, and having more
   positive attitudes about the course in the postmeasures than in the
   premeasures. Students also stated that the highly structured nature of
   the course was important for their success but somewhat frustrating.
   Other important student perceptions were that the course was demanding
   and time consuming; past courses helped prepare for the capstone
   experience but that there are gaps in this preparation; they learn best
   via active learning, feedback, and application; they are proud of their
   course achievements; and they are engaged in the discipline but are
   ambiguous about future work in sociology.

AB Sociology majors learn that sociological theory is foundational to our
   field; it frames the way we look at the world and provides guiding
   questions for our social inquiry. But sociology instructors know that
   teaching theory is a challenge. A number of activities have been created
   to engage students in sociological theory courses. This note discusses
   an exercise that adds to these activities and is tied to the learning
   outcomes of a theory course. The author's students are given a
   challenge: For 72 hours back-to-back, avoid checking or communicating
   via Facebook or MySpace; making calls from cell phones, unless it is an
   emergency; and texting or e-mailing from cell phones and handheld
   devices. The author found that this Technology Fast Challenge helped
   students foster a sociological perspective and allowed them to engage
   the ideas and questions of major social theorists. The author discusses
   the format of the challenge, the outcomes, and applications to other
   courses.

AB Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course
   trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel
   data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents'
   attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured
   or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from
   cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other
   fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a
   rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel
   conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in
   prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among
   adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey
   questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were
   considerably less likely than members of a control group to report
   substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has
   important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to
   be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological
   issue.

   Makers: Turning Theory Into Action," the presidential address reported
   research findings (scientific sociology) that were accompanied by a
   documentary that represented the research results (applied sociology).
   Guided by a social constructionist perspective, findings from five
   studies were organized into seven themes to demonstrate the problems
   domestic violence victims, or protective parents, encounter when their
   abusers entangle them in contested custody battles. The documentary
   shown in the presidential address can be viewed in this article by
   connecting to a link provided. It is noted that the focus of the
   research and documentary remain at the social issue level-a phenomenon
   that exists in society, but has not yet been defined as a social
   problem. It is argued that the problems identified in the research are
   affecting many thousands of domestic violence victims and their
   children, yet the issue has received minimal attention in the discipline
   of sociology.

AB What is the relationship between state-level politics and the resources
   devoted to children's health insurance programs (CHIP)? The authors
   asses this question by drawing on theories from the power resources,
   institutionalist, logic of industrialism, and racial threat schools of
   thought. The authors find that each approach offers some explanatory
   power for per capita CHIP spending. In particular, Republican strength
   in state legislatures and governorships are associated with diminished
   CHIP spending. Professionalized state legislatures, strong state
   financial capacities, and states with a legacy of social policy
   innovation were linked to greater CHIP spending. States with more
   uninsured children tended to spend more per capita. And states with
   greater numbers of blacks spent less per capita. But there was no
   similar effect for Hispanics. The authors conclude that an array of
   forces at the state level figure prominently in cross-state inequality
   and the prospects for social citizenship.

AB Theorized links between science and secularism are prevalent in classic
   sociological thought. More recently, scholars have critiqued these
   frameworks as oversimplified and empirically untenable. In response to
   such criticisms, contemporary researchers typically overlook or actively
   argue against links between science and secularism. This study analyzes
   data from a random, national survey of adults to examine the empirical
   connections between perceptions of science and secular identities in the
   United States. Analyses demonstrate that perceptions of science
   correlate strongly with American secularism, particularly among atheists
   and agnostics. Additionally, politicized views of science help account
   for the previously documented relationship between political and secular
   identities in the United States. A perspective drawing on the sociology
   of culture and perceived knowledge provides a more useful framework for
   understanding these patterns than theories of secularization.

AB Contemporary social research often has located religion's public
   influence by focusing on individual or collective religious actors. In
   this unitary actor model, religion is a stable, uniform feature of an
   individual or collectivity. However, recent research shows that people's
   religious expression outside religious congregations varies by context.
   Building on this new work, along with insights from Erving Goffman and
   cultural sociology, an alternative, "cultural-interactionist model" of
   religious expression focuses on how group styles enable and constrain
   religious expression in public settings. Illustrating the model are two
   ethnographic cases, a religiously sponsored homeless advocacy
   organization and a secondary comparison setting from an activist
   campaign for housing, both from a U.S. metropolitan area. Shifting from
   actors to settings and group styles clarifies the interplay between
   religious and nonreligious culture over time. The shift refines our
   understanding of how religion's civic or political effects work, as in
   the case of building social capital for collective action. The
   cultural-interactionist model enables us to track historical change in
   everyday group settings. It promotes further research on historically
   changing ways of managing religious diversity, and diverse ways of
   constructing a religious self.

   positively associated with the vertical flow of exports, and the
   relationship is much more pronounced for lower-income countries than for
   high-income countries. Additional findings suggest that the observed
   relationship for lower-income nations has grown in magnitude through

   examining specific analogies, narratives, and metanarratives, I show how
   the comparison of 9/11 to the attacks on Pearl Harbor has led to varying

   across all groups. Green practices are not isolated decisions or
   actions, but components in an ongoing project. As a result, green
   lifestyles are often experienced as both a work in progress and a
   provisionally coherent life narrative. Furthermore, I explore bricolage,
   the cobbling together of resources at hand by nonexperts, as a mechanism
   for lifestyle change and expand the concept to include environmental
   practices and themes. I adopt a pragmatist perspective to understand
   lifestyle change as a deliberate process undertaken in response to a

   Also, these women are constrained by household responsibilities. These

AB In recent work in the sociology of education, the primary effects of
   stratification are defined as the effects of social class origins on
   preparation for future educational attainment. The secondary effects are
   then the net direct effects of social class on the transition to the
   next higher level of education, which are interpreted as average effects
   of class conditions on students' choices. In this article, the standard
   model of primary and secondary effects is laid out in explicit form, and
   primary and secondary effects are then estimated for college entry among
   recent high school graduates in the United States. The challenges of
   estimating these effects for educational transitions in the United
   States are then explained, focusing on the weak warrant for causal
   inference that is used to justify the calculation of counterfactual net
   differences across classes. Alternative estimates of associational
   primary and secondary effects are then offered, after which the
   prospects for the identification of causal secondary effects by
   conditioning on additional confounders are assessed. In conclusion, an
   appeal is made for attention to the policy-relevant patterns of
   heterogeneity that research on primary and secondary effects may be able
   to reveal, and a case is made for elaboration and direct identification
   of the presupposed choice mechanism that has been assumed to generate
   secondary effects in past research.

   empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in
   which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be
   evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of
   individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which
   the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and
   interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations
   of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which
   we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations
   of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were
   formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a
   multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to
   address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural
   reception in a single analytic framework.

AB This article examines why global corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   frameworks have gained popularity in the past decade, despite their
   uncertain costs and benefits, and how they affect adherents' behavior.
   We focus on the two largest global frameworks-the United Nations Global
   Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative-to examine patterns of CSR
   adoption by governments and corporations. Drawing on institutional and
   political-economy theories, we develop a new analytic framework that
   focuses on four key environmental factors-global institutional pressure,
   local receptivity, foreign economic penetration, and national economic
   system. We propose two arguments about the relationship between stated
   commitment and subsequent action: decoupling due to lack of capacity and
   organized hypocrisy due to lack of will. Our cross-national time-series
   analyses show that global institutional pressure through nongovernmental
   linkages encourages CSR adoption, but this pressure leads to ceremonial
   commitment in developed countries and to substantive commitment in
   developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries, liberal economic
   policies increase ceremonial commitment, suggesting a pattern of
   organized hypocrisy whereby corporations in developed countries make
   discursive commitments without subsequent action. We also find that in
   developing countries, short-term trade relations exert greater influence
   on corporate CSR behavior than do long-term investment transactions.

AB Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However,
   a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral
   behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use
   identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity
   theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify
   their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on
   the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience
   negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue.
   Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations
   that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling
   rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural
   expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally.
   We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university
   students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing
   situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings
   reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are
   significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt
   and shame.

AB Following on an article in Bennett Berger (1990), Authors of Their Own
   Lives, titled "From Socialism to Sociology," in which I and other
   sociologists describe how we came to sociology, I continue with my
   academic and public career as a sociologist at the University of
   California-Berkeley (1963-1969) and at Harvard subsequently, in the
   Graduate School of Education and the Sociology Department. I describe my
   involvement in the formulation of urban policy in the Kennedy and
   Johnson administrations and beyond, and my attempt to understand the
   student revolt at Berkeley, which spread throughout the United States
   and indeed much of the world. I further discuss my long involvement in
   the issue of affirmative action, on which I in time changed my views,
   originally based on a distinctive conception of the course of ethnicity
   and ethnic and racial groups in the United States, from critical
   opposition to acceptance, and my similar involvement in the debates over
   social policy in the United States, in which a complex point of view has
   too often been summarized under the term neoconservatism.

AB Instrumental variable (IV) methods provide a powerful but underutilized
   tool to address many common problems with observational sociological
   data. Key to their successful use is having IVs that are uncorrelated
   with an equation's disturbance and that are sufficiently strongly
   related to the problematic endogenous covariates. This review briefly
   defines IVs, summarizes their origins, and describes their use in
   multiple regression, simultaneous equation models, factor analysis,
   latent variable structural equation models, and limited dependent
   variable models. It defines and contrasts three methods of selecting
   IVs: auxiliary instrumental variable, model implied instrumental
   variable, and randomized instrumental variable. It provides
   overidentification tests and weak IV diagnostics as methods to evaluate
   the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume
   heterogeneous causal effects. Another section summarizes the use of IVs
   in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways
   to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in
   which IVs could be profitably used in sociological research.

AB What is the relationship between social movements and electoral
   politics? Although the empirical reality of American politics has
   increasingly blurred the lines between activism and electoral politics,
   sociology has yet to explore these changes and provide theoretical and
   methodological tools to understand them. Focusing on the experience of
   young Americans, this review explores this relationship and outlines
   opportunities for future research. It is broken down into three
   sections. First, I review the main themes in the study of youth
   political participation in America. Second, using examples from the 2008
   election, the article examines recent increases in youth participation.
   Third and finally, this article discusses the case of the Obama
   campaign, its transition into the Democratic National Committee's
   Organizing for America, and aspects of the 2012 election to highlight
   the complex relationship between movements and electoral politics in
   America today. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities for
   sociologists to bridge the connections between activism and electoral
   politics in new and meaningful ways.

AB Although explicit attention to the role of small groups has waned in
   sociology, an empirical understanding of the interaction order is
   increasing. A focus on the group-the meso-level of analysis-enriches
   both structural and interactional approaches, stressing shared and
   ongoing meaning. Groups constitute social order, just as groups are
   themselves constituted by that order. The examination of local action
   reveals how interaction orders emerge and create meanings that spread
   throughout a wider network. Despite the limits of a meso-level analysis
   in examining both external webs of constraint and immediate
   negotiations, this approach addresses identity, social capital,
   collective action, group culture, networks, and civil society. By
   building on collective identity, shared history, common spaces, and
   ongoing social relations, groups provide mechanisms through which
   individuals fit into larger structures and through which social
   structures shape individuals.

   attracted considerable attention in recent years. The goal is to bring
   various bodies of work into conversation with one another in order to
   stimulate more cumulative theory building. This is accomplished by
   focusing on (a) subprocesses such as categorization and legitimation,
   (b) the conditions that sustain heterarchies, and (c) valuation and

AB I review and integrate recent sociological research that makes progress
   on three interrelated questions pertaining to social valuation: (a) the
   degree of social construction relative to objective constraints; (b) the
   degree of concentration in social valuations at a single point in time;
   and (c) the conditions that govern two broad forms of temporal
   discontinuity-(i) fashion cycles, especially in cultural expression and
   in managerial practices, and (ii) bubble/crash dynamics, as witnessed in
   such domains as authoritarian regimes and financial markets. In the
   course of the review, I argue for the importance of identifying how
   objective conditions constrain social construction and suggest two
   contrarian mechanisms by which this is accomplished-valuation
   opportunism and valuation entrepreneurship-and the conditions under
   which they are more or less effective.

AB In this article, I review three contemporary streams of scholarship that
   are revitalizing the cultural analysis of religion, an approach that
   dates to the discipline's founding. Research from an institutional field
   perspective focuses on the institutions that shape religious belief,
   practice, and mobilization. Work on lived religion, including
   neo-Durkheimian approaches, focuses on religious experience and
   contested practices of sacralization. Scholarship on religious cultural
   tools and symbolic boundaries analyzes religion as symbolic
   legitimation. These three approaches avoid serious problems associated
   with both market and secularization accounts, in part because of the way
   they conceptualize religious authority and religious identity, and in
   part because of their broader scope of inquiry. In the conclusion, I
   combine the insights from these approaches to articulate a promising
   agenda for future research, offering a set of focus questions that are
   relevant to both classical and contemporary concerns about religion's
   role in modern societies.

AB Status has become an increasingly influential concept in the fields of
   organizational and economic sociology during the past two decades.
   Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and
   between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of
   status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the
   contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the
   effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are
   produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has
   contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status
   hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value
   of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than
   focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential
   directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed
   efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and
   substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status
   processes.

AB Elites are those with vastly disproportionate control over or access to
   a resource. We can understand this as a position that a social actor
   occupies, or we can imagine such resources as a possession of an actor.
   The study of elites is the study of power and inequality, from above. It
   involves looking at the distribution of social resources, which can
   include economic, social, cultural, political, or knowledge capital. It
   also means exploring the role of institutions such as schools, families,
   and clubs in how such resources are organized and distributed. Over the
   past decade, particularly as social power and economic rewards have
   become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, elite
   sociology has experienced a revival. Empirical observations of these
   phenomena point to the changing character of American inequality.

AB We review the relationship between female labor supply and marital
   instability. Traditionally, the sociological literature has focused on
   the impact of female labor supply on the likelihood of divorce with
   specific reference to the independence hypothesis. However, recent
   studies in sociology and economics provide more consistent evidence that
   the direction of causality may be the other way around. Women might
   increase their labor supply in the anticipation of divorce. We review
   the methodological developments in measuring economic independence and
   the recent evidence on its impact on divorce. Then we turn our attention
   to the alternative literature on the impact of divorce on female labor
   supply. We outline the theoretical arguments put forward by this
   literature, discuss the methodological issues in establishing causality,
   summarize the findings, and suggest avenues of further research.

AB Cities in the Southern United States have experienced dynamic economic
   and population growth over the past half-century, challenging existing
   paradigms of urban form, race relations, social movements, and
   immigration. This review shows how the timing of Southern
   urbanization-much later than in the Northeast and Midwest-has
   contributed to Southern cities' distinctive spatial patterns and
   political and economic structures. Southern cities were crucial to
   regional transformation, including the Civil Rights Movement and the end
   of one-party rule in the South. Moreover, Southern cities exemplify key
   trends of the contemporary political economy: a new relationship to
   regional industrialization, new forms of entrepreneurial governance,
   flexible labor markets, the importance of finance and producer services,
   and "new destination" immigration. I conclude by examining two Southern
   cities for their relevance to central themes in contemporary social
   research: Atlanta for the study of the African American experience and
   New Orleans for the sociology of catastrophe.

AB Durkheim's emphasis on the role of emotion in social life has been
   influential in the development of the sociology of emotions. Others have
   analyzed Durkheim's distinctly social conception of reason and
   rationality. However, the interconnections between "emotion" and
   "reason" in his thinking have seldom been directly and systematically
   addressed. These interconnections deserve further explication and
   development, particularly as they apply to the level of language and
   action-i.e., "practical reason"-in everyday life. Seeing the collective
   emotional basis of "social facts," in general, and "logic," "reason,"
   and the basic "categories of the understanding," in particular, opens up
   new applications for Durkheim's broader theoretical framework.

AB Since World War II methods have advanced very quickly in sociology and
   social science, while this has not been the case with theory. In this
   article I suggest that one way of beginning to close the gap between the
   two is to focus on theorizing rather than on theory. The place where
   theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the
   context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for
   how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be
   successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing
   and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is
   made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only
   be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is
   called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is
   iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the
   basic rules for theorizing.

AB Recent studies show that firms and workers benefit from the geographic
   concentration or spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor
   market. While economic geographers have devoted considerable attention
   to the benefits firms receive from spatial agglomeration, the reasons
   workers may benefit in the form of higher wages are less clear. I draw
   from several theoretical perspectives in order to explain the
   relationship between spatial agglomeration and wages for U.S. biotech
   workers, including the new economic geography, new structuralism,
   organizational ecology, and the new economic sociology. Using the 1990
   PUMS-L, I employ a hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses
   from these perspectives. The results indicate that biotech workers
   benefit more from industrial than urban agglomeration, and these
   benefits are primarily due to the greater degree of organizational
   diversity in large industry clusters and urban labor markets.

AB The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple
   boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the
   community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and
   homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers
   on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on
   instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class
   sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three
   "moments": the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students'
   final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students'
   learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims,
   the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of
   drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data.
   The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond
   providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a
   laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the
   similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other
   disciplines.

AB This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be
   through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a
   three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination
   despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department.
   In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into
   racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into
   institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and
   their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the
   phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not
   to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the
   authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to
   learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the
   classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting
   students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for
   related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public
   sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the
   traditional classroom environment.

AB In recent years, academic programs have increasingly documented student
   learning. For many, this practice of measuring and analyzing student
   learning outcomes continues as an elusive endeavor fraught with
   resentment and misgiving. This article describes the development of a
   student learning assessment plan for the University of Wyoming's Chicano
   Studies Program. An initial program assessment facilitated the
   development of a faculty agreed-upon mission, goals, and learning
   outcomes. A summative course embedded assessment strategy provides
   direct evidence for determining student learning achievement. Student
   exit interviews provide additional evidence suggesting that Chicana/o
   Studies curricula help in cultivating a critical cultural thinking
   framework oriented toward social justice and activism. Current
   anti-immigrant and anti-Latina/o sentiments provide the context for a
   discussion of the study's implications.

AB Quantitative literacy is increasingly essential for both informed
   citizenship and a variety of careers. Though regression is one of the
   most common methods in quantitative sociology, it is rarely taught until
   late in students' college careers. In this article, the author describes
   a classroom-based activity introducing students to regression analysis
   in an introductory sociology course. Using a data set that draws on the
   students' quiz and exam scores, students learn the basics of
   interpreting regression analyses in a manner that is relevant to their
   own lives. The activity also encourages students to think critically
   about potential predictors of exam performance and how they could be
   measured.

AB A striking feature of modern societies is the extent to which individual
   persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The
   expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence
   in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception
   of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes
   promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the
   status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are
   substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries
   around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly
   asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms
   of socialization that promote active participation as well as the
   capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of
   533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries
   published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed
   become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the
   rising status of individuals and children in global human rights
   treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in
   countries with greater individualism embodied in political and
   socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world
   society. The study contributes to both political and educational
   sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on
   empowered individual agency in intended curricula.

AB Sociologists widely acknowledge that uncertainty matters for decision
   making, but they rarely measure it directly. In this article, we
   demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing
   uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel
   probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty
   about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using
   data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that
   uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young
   adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing
   HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight
   into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives.
   Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to
   accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are
   certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that
   personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can
   illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors.

AB The relationship between European sociology and European anti-Semitism
   in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is investigated through
   a case study of one sociologist, Emile Durkheim, in a single country,
   France. Reactionary and radical forms of anti-Semitism are distinguished
   and contrasted to Durkheim's sociological perspective. Durkheim's
   remarks about the Jews directly addressed anti-Semitic claims about
   them, their role in French society, and their relationship to modernity.
   At the same time, Durkheim was engaged in a reinterpretation of the
   French Revolution and its legacies that indirectly challenged other
   tenets of French anti-Semitism. In sum, Durkheim's work contains direct
   and indirect responses to reactionary and radical forms of
   anti-Semitism, and together these responses form a coherent alternative
   vision of the relationship between modernity and the Jews.

AB This article develops a research position that allows cultural
   sociologists to compare morality across sociohistorical cases. In order
   to do so, the article suggests focusing analytic attention on actions
   that fulfill the following criteria: (a) actions that define the actor
   as a certain kind of socially recognized person, both within and across
   fields; (b) actions that actors experienceor that they expect others to
   perceiveas defining the actor both intersituationally and to a greater
   extent than other available definitions of self; and (c) actions to
   which actors either have themselves, or expect others to have, a
   predictable emotional reaction. Such a position avoids both a realist
   moral sociology and descriptive-relativism, and provides sociologists
   with criteria for comparing moral action in different cases while
   staying attuned to social and historical specificity.

   entails problematic theoretical assumptions about stability and change
   and produces a circumscribed field of events, undercutting the goal of
   developing an eventful account of social life. Social continuity is a
   state that is achieved just as much as are structural transformations,

AB Current research on guanxi (Chinese social connections) suffers from
   conceptual confusion. This article presents a new theoretical framework
   for understanding guanxi in the face of China's economic and social
   transformations. Guanxi is viewed as a purposive network behavior that
   can take different strategic forms, such as accessing, bridging, and
   embedding. Pairing this conceptualization with a social-evolutionary
   framework, I argue that the emergence and increasing or decreasing
   prevalence of each form over time result from (1) a combination of
   factors at three analytical levelsmicroagency, mesonetwork, and
   macroinstitutionaland (2) endogenous processes of selection. By focusing
   on behavioral forms and their evolution, this framework is able to
   bridge divides in the guanxi literature, provide a foundation for
   comparative studies of network behavior across societies, and connect
   the study of guanxi with economic sociology more broadly.

   the "epistemic accident," grounded in a constructivist understanding of

AB By the turn of the 21st century the concept of globalization had earned
   its place in the social sciences and debate turned more squarely to the
   theoretical significance of globalization. Yet not all scholars were
   happy with the notion of globalization. Some claim that is merely a new
   name for earlier theories and concepts. Among those who reject new
   paradigmatic thinking on the current age is Immanuel Wallerstein, the
   world-renowned sociologist and 'father' of the world-system paradigm.
   This article is intended as an appraisal of Wallerstein's aeuvre in the
   context of the debate on global transformations in the late 20th and
   early 21st centuries and from the vantage point of the present author's
   own critical globalization perspective. The first three parts summarize
   and assess Wallerstein's theoretical system and his many contributions
   to macro, historical and comparative sociology, to development studies
   and international political economy. The fourth discusses Wallerstein's
   assessment of the evolution of the world capitalist system in recent
   decades, including his views on the concept of globalization, and the
   fifth focuses on earlier and more recent critical appraisals of his
   work, including the present author's own, in light of the recent
   transformations in world capitalism identified with globalization.

AB The goal of this article is to highlight the major trends in the

   conditions of globalization. Based on a review of research from library
   history and the sociology of culture, the author develops hypotheses
   about the conditions under which public libraries are likely to be
   established in relatively large numbers in developing countries.
   Analysis of historical trends in library establishments and crisp-set
   qualitative comparative analysis of UNESCO data on public libraries in
   six developing nations reveal that globalization is associated with
   decreasing or flat numbers of public libraries on a per capita basis.
   The only observed exceptions are Malaysia and Chile, where public
   libraries have been established in large numbers partly for purposes of
   national integration as a counter to sectarian and ethnic heterogeneity.
   Implications of these findings for research in the information society
   paradigm, and for development theory, are discussed.

   distinct contributions: first in terms of considering children's health
   disparities as an area of concern within sociology, and second by
   considering children's health as a factor that shapes other areas of
   children's well-being. In addition, these papers offer novel empirical
   research on children's health and varied methodological and theoretical
   orientations. Each paper also makes contributions to social policy,
   first in the area of infant health affecting later educational outcomes,
   second in the area of family structure and children's health, and
   additionally in understanding type 2 diabetes for children at the
   individual and structural levels. Finally, these studies highlight the

   Students compile questions and reflections throughout the course and, at
   the end of the term, use their writings for a comprehensive analytic
   self-reflection that examines their intellectual and sociological
   growth. Following Schwalbe's (2008) urging to emphasize sociological
   thinking over disciplinary nuances in introductory courses, we describe
   several complementary methods for teaching students how to think like
   sociologists. We detail five inquiry exercises and three reflection
   exercises that build up to the final analytic reflection essay. The
   unique value of these exercises is that students not only engage the
   course material throughout the course but also learn to examine their
   own writing as data. In doing so, students learn to value the process of
   learning, inquiry, and critical self-reflection while acquiring and

   employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked
   non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical
   professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment
   contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets,
   firms use non-competes to "strike back" against technical professionals'
   increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets.
   In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single
   industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of
   industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more
   likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their
   technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms
   strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such
   contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These
   findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in

   this impasse by creating a hegemony index to assess the power structure
   of the capitalist world-system. Though results support the world-economy
   view of three hegemons since the 16th century, findings also contradict
   this perspective and show that England is the most powerful nation
   during two successive hegemonic sequences. Conclusions highlight the
   possibility of hegemonic resuccession, while supplementary analysis

   rather as a situation in which transactional conditions for network
   desirability obtain but network governance is impeded either by
   ignorance or opportunism, or by a combination of the two. It depicts
   network failures as continuous rather than discrete outcomes, shows that
   they have more than one cause, and pays particular attention to two
   undertheorized-if not undiscovered-types of network failure (i.e.,
   involution and contested collaboration). It thereby contributes to the

AB The great German theorist Niklas Luhmann argued long ago that meaning is
   the central construct of sociology. We agree, but our scheme of
   stochastic processes-evolved over many years as identity and
   control-argues for switchings of intercalated bits of social network and
   interpretive domain (i.e., netdom switchings) as the core of meaning
   processes. We thus challenge Luhmann's central claim that modern
   society's subsystems are based on communicative self-closure. We assert
   that there is refuting evidence from sociolinguistics, from how
   languages are put together and how languages' indexical and reflexive
   devices (e.g., metapragmatics, heteroglossia, genres) are used in social
   action. Communication is about managing indexicalities, which entail
   great ambiguity and openness as they are anchored in myriad netdom
   switchings across social times and spreads. In contrast, Luhmann's
   concept of communication revolves around binary codes governed
   recursively and algorithmically within systems in efforts to reduce
   complexity from the environment. We conclude that systems closure does
   not solve the problem of uncertainty in social life. In fact, lack of
   uncertainty is itself a problem. Order is necessary, but order at the
   edge of chaos.

AB The political ideology of neoliberalism is widely recognized as having
   influenced the organization of national and global economies and public
   policies since the 1970s. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between the neoliberal variant of globalization and science. To do so,
   we develop a framework for sociology of science that emphasizes closer
   ties among political sociology, the sociology of social movements, and
   economic and organizational sociology and that draws attention to
   patterns of increasing and uneven industrial influence amid several
   countervailing processes. Specifically, we explore three fundamental
   changes since the 1970s: the advent of the knowledge economy and the
   increasing interchange between academic and industrial research and
   development signified by academic capitalism and asymmetric convergence;
   the increasing prominence of science-based regulation of technology in
   global trade liberalization, marked by the heightened role of
   international organizations and the convergence of scientism and
   neoliberalism; and the epistemic modernization of the relationship
   between scientists and publics, represented by the proliferation of new
   institutions of deliberation, participation, activism, enterprise, and
   social movement mobilization.

AB A satisfactory sociology of markets requires that both order and
   disorder in markets be addressed, yet sociologists have seemed more
   concerned with theorizing market stability and order. Change, however,
   is too fundamental a part of markets to receive so little sociological
   attention. One perspective that provides a fertile ground for moving
   ahead with developing an agenda for studying both stability and change
   in markets is American pragmatist social theory. This article therefore
   examines the influence of a pragmatist viewpoint on two broad modern
   theoretical approaches that have implications for the sociology of
   markets, one focused on stabilization processes, the other on
   institutional designs for promoting change. Most particularly, it draws
   on work carried out from a pragmatist viewpoint and illustrates a
   pragmatic approach to change in markets using the case of the EU's
   Forest, Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan and
   initiative.

AB Sociologists, philosophers, and historians of science tend to focus
   their attention on the production of knowledge. More recently, scholars
   have begun to investigate more fully the structures and processes that
   impede the production of knowledge. This article draws on interviews
   conducted with 41 academic researchers to present a phenomenological
   examination of "forbidden knowledge''-a phrase that refers to knowledge
   considered too sensitive, dangerous, or taboo to produce. Forbidden
   knowledge has traditionally been understood as a set of formal controls
   on what ought not be known. We argue that the social processes that
   create forbidden knowledge are embedded in the everyday practices of
   working scientists. The narrative legacies of past controversies in
   science are of particular importance, as they serve as a tool that
   working scientists use to justify, construct, and hide their acceptance
   of forbidden knowledge. As a result, the precise contents of forbidden
   knowledge are fluid, fuzzy, essentially contested, specialty specific,
   locally created, and enforced.

AB High performance work organizations (HPWOs) and their consequences in
   the workplace have gained a notable status in sociology and psychology
   of the workplace during the last three decades in the US and in the
   other industrialized nations. One area in which the ongoing debates and
   evidence are inconclusive is the job rewards associated with HPWOs in
   the manufacturing and service economies. Analysing functional and
   numerical flexibilities (the 'internalization' and 'externalization'
   strategies) adopted in the manufacturing and service sectors, this study
   intends to extend our understanding of associations between workplace
   restructuring (HPWOs) and job rewards. The findings reveal that
   'internalized' or standard employees have gained from internalization
   strategy with no significant differences between the two economic
   sectors. However, significant differences are disclosed when the
   consequences of externalization are contrasted between the sectors. The
   externalization strategy has significantly undermined job rewards for
   non-standard workers, except for independent contractors, especially in
   the manufacturing sector. The article ends with a short discussion on
   the theoretical significance of the findings and their policy
   implications in human sources management.

AB Budget exercises are frequently used in introductory and social problems
   courses to facilitate student understanding of income inequality. But do
   these exercises actually lead to greater sociological understanding? To
   explore this issue, the authors studied undergraduate students enrolled
   in introductory sociology courses during the 2008-2009 academic year.
   Using a unique pretest-pretest-posttest design, the authors captured
   student perceptions of issues of socioeconomic inequality at the
   beginning of the course, after completion of a traditional unit on
   stratification, and after participation in a budget exercise. The unique
   study design allows the authors to examine if and how students make
   gains in understanding inequality sociologically. They also consider
   other learning objectives, including fostering an appreciation of
   obstacles to social mobility and increasing general knowledge about
   inequality. The results suggest that both budget exercises and a
   traditional pedagogical unit of lecture, reading, and discussion play
   limited roles in fostering at least short-term sociological
   understanding as related to these goals.

   designed to simulate common, everyday experiences among people living in
   poverty as participants take on the roles of family members working to
   make ends meet. The creators of CAPS emphasize that "CAPS is not a game"
   but "a unique tool that community action agencies are able to use to
   educate everyone, from policy makers to community leaders, about the day
   to day realities of life with a shortage of money and an abundance of
   stress." The authors facilitated the CAPS program with two large groups
   of undergraduate students enrolled in sociology, gerontology, and
   psychology courses at a medium-sized private college in south-central
   Pennsylvania. The analysis examines the experiential learning outcomes
   of the students as they reflect on their participation in the
   simulation. Following participation in CAPS, the students demonstrated
   an increased awareness of the material conditions of everyday life among
   families living in poverty.

   roles. The findings show stereotypical depictions beyond glasses, bow
   ties, and tweed jackets. Specifically, the authors find stereotypical
   images of race and gender as well as an emphasis on the importance of
   research, sometimes at the expense of teaching or ethical behavior. This
   research provides instructors with knowledge of the stereotypes that
   students may have upon entering the college classroom, which may impact
   classroom interactions, and provides insight into how race and gender

AB Rightwing theorists argue that we owe the current financial crisis to
   the democratization of credit, or financial inclusion: politics
   interfered with the market to benefit marginalized actors, only to cause
   instability and risk. Leftwing theorists focus instead on
   financialization: namely, the shift of profit-making activities from
   industry to finance. These views implicitly draw on Schumpeter and Marx.
   Much like their intellectual progenitors, they emphasize exogenous
   processes to explain financial change. Here I claim that the connection
   between financial innovation and financial inclusion is endogenous. I
   suggest two main typologies of financial innovators: Market Utopians
   (MUs) and Populist Innovators (PIs). Financial inclusion, I submit, is
   the byproduct of the quest for power of the latter.

AB Many theories of social construction make some reference to sight, yet
   few offer sustained examinations of perception. In light of this, I
   highlight the visual dimension of the social construction of reality by
   analyzing visual perception as a process of 'socio-mental filtration'.
   Building on theories of social construction - most notably those using
   the concepts 'frame', 'paradigm' and 'schema' in which expectations are
   the organizing force of experience, I focus on how social construction
   happens. One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention,
   which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on
   the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to
   identify the specific dynamics of 'socio-optical construction' - adding
   a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social
   construction - may help scholars to more effectively account for some of
   the 'hard problems' of constructionist theory, such as the body.

AB This paper links the work of Sebastiao Salgado, recipient of the 2010

   Reporting of Social Issues, with the discipline of sociology. I reflect
   on Salgado's biography, method, and concerns in order to demonstrate how
   his work contributes to the awareness and understanding of social
   issues. Toward this end, I summarize sociology's record of involvement
   with visual documentation. Prior to 1915, the American Journal of
   Sociology regularly included photographs that provided visual
   documentation of environments under study. However, as sociology moved
   away from social reform activities and toward scientific investigation,
   the regular publication of photographs ceased. During the 1930s and
   1940s, photographic projects in disciplines and social movements beyond
   sociology developed a variety of methods that would prove useful to
   sociology. During the 1970s, sociologists once again began to use visual
   methods in their teaching, research, and publication, putting sociology
   in the position to both contribute to and benefit from insights and
   social commitments that have distinguished Sebastiao Salgado as a
   globally significant photographer and social activist during the late
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.

   particular, this analysis examines how women came to be included in the

   attitudes and samples drawn from a statewide and a national population
   in 2007, we find support for the religious and political bases of
   farm-animal-welfare attitudes. Frequent church attendance is related to
   less concern with animal welfare. However, we also find that religious
   beliefs can be a source of support for animal welfare. Political
   orientation as reflected by desire for more economic equality and
   greater tolerance of outgroups is also related to concern for
   farm-animal welfare. Formal political partisanship and denomination have
   weaker effects. Concern with farm-animal welfare is consistently related
   to greater concern with human welfare in the food sector.

AB Sociology has long shied away from the problem of populism. This may be
   due to suspicion about the concept or uncertainty about how to fit
   populist cases into broader comparative matrices. Such caution is
   warranted: the existing interdisciplinary literature has been plagued by
   conceptual confusion and disagreement. But given the recent resurgence
   of populist politics in Latin America and elsewhere, sociology can no
   longer afford to sidestep such analytical challenges. This article moves
   toward a political sociology of populism by identifying past theoretical
   deficiencies and proposing a new, practice-based approach that is not
   beholden to pejorative common sense understandings. This approach
   conceptualizes populism as a mode of political practice-as populist
   mobilization. Its utility is demonstrated through an application to
   mid-twentieth-century Latin American politics. The article concludes by
   sketching an agenda for future research on populist mobilization in
   Latin America and beyond.

AB A major problem with the emerging sociological literature on
   cosmopolitanism is that it has not adequately theorized mechanisms that
   mediate the presumed causal relationship between globalization and the
   development of cosmopolitan orientations. To solve this problem, I draw
   on Bruno Latour's actor-network theory (ANT) to theorize the development
   of three key elements of cosmopolitanism: cultural omnivorousness,
   ethnic tolerance, and cosmopolitics. ANT illuminates how humans and
   nonhumans of multiple nationalities develop attachments with one another
   to create network structures that sustain cosmopolitanism. ANT also
   helps the sociology of cosmopolitanism become more reflexive and
   critical of its implicit normative claims.

AB Past research recognizes that firms exploit regulatory variations to
   their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic
   process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by
   including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view
   regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity
   structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their
   rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws
   that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22
   U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze
   how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and
   exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and
   non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new
   stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the
   borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW
   states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of
   regulation, social movements, and organizations.

AB This article moves beyond current controversies on the nature of money
   by suggesting that a general social process allows different kinds of
   organizations and networks-from states to banks to local communities-to
   produce currencies: that is, the articulation of criteria of
   creditworthiness, or what I call the exercise of moral authority.
   Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is
   contested, challenging groups must articulate alternative criteria of
   creditworthiness for their currencies to become stable and acceptable. I
   illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum
   United States, which I use to discuss why the federal government failed
   to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a
   process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I
   conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral
   authority, which have made the local level a springboard for
   destabilizing financial innovations.

AB The sociology of aging draws on a broad array of theoretical

   own. We build on past work to advance and empirically test a model of
   mental health framed in terms of structural theorizing and situated
   within the life course perspective. Whereas most prior research has been
   based on cross-sectional data, we utilize four waves of data from a
   nationally representative sample of American adults (Americans' Changing
   Lives Study) collected prospectively over a 15-year period and find that
   education, employment and marital status, as well as their consequences
   for income and health, effectively explain the increase in depressive
   symptoms after age 65. We also found significant cohort differences in
   age trajectories of mental health that were partly explained by
   historical increases in education. We demonstrate that a purely
   structural theory can take us far in explaining later life mental
   health.

AB Religious leaders in Sub-Saharan Africa do not just deal with the
   spiritual needs of members but are also heavily engaged in dealing with
   social problems and material needs. Although true elsewhere, the
   realities of limited state infrastructure and an increasingly diverse
   religious landscape make it crucial for religious entrepreneurs to deal
   with material problems if they hope to gain adherents. This article
   applies the concepts of problem solving and brokerage (Burt, 2005;
   Knoke, 1990) to a case study of religious leaders in Balaka, a small
   town of rural Malawi. I argue that religious leaders solve problems in
   three major areas-material infrastructure, activities and organization,
   and healthcare-and that they are able to do so at least partly because
   of their connections to various overlapping secular and religious
   networks. I focus both on the provision of material resources and the
   facilitation of effervescent experiences in order to advance a fuller
   understanding of the experience of poverty and the ways leaders in poor
   communities work to solve problems.

AB This study revisits and extends a classic question in sociology and
   tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational
   social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at
   midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of
   intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during
   adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress
   and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological
   problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of
   prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This
   study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that
   breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and
   intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current
   class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological
   distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to
   resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the
   outcomes of study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Recent research has conceptualized sustainability as the environmental

   footprint per capita (a measure of environmental consumption) and
   average life satisfaction (a measure of subjective well-being). We draw
   hypotheses from political economy, modernization, and sustainable
   consumption theories in the environmental social sciences. Using full

   climate, political, economic, and social factors on EWEB with a sample
   of 105 countries. Key findings include a negative quadratic effect of
   economic development on EWEB, a negative effect of income inequality,
   and a positive effect of social capital. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

AB When something serves a function, it is easy to overlook its origins.
   The tendency is to proceed directly to function and retroactively
   construct a story about origin based on the function it fills. In this
   article, I address this problem of origins as it appears in the
   sociology of knowledge, using a case study of the publication of the 3rd
   edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (DSM-III) in 1980. The manual revolutionized American psychiatry and the
   treatment of mental illness, because it served the function of
   classification that had become critical to the field of mental health by
   this time. But this function must be bracketed in order to reveal the
   "extra-functional" origins of the DSM-III. Using field theory, I argue
   that the manual was necessary for reasons other than the function it
   filled as a classification. Specifically, its origin lies in a series of
   conflicts among psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and clinical
   psychologists within the field of mental health, which followed in the
   wake of the collapse of psychoanalysis as the dominant treatment type
   for mental illness. I reveal the generative formula behind the
   production of the DSM-III, capturing a variety of social processes that
   influenced the format of the manual and made it a useful classification,
   but which are not reducible to function. In this way, I reproduce its
   raison d'etre in a manner similar to how the DSM-III appeared for the
   people who produced it. This focus on generative formulas offers the
   sociology of knowledge a way to capture the epistemic importance of a
   range of different social processes. Most importantly, it avoids the
   functional fallacy of reducing origin to function, and ignoring the idea
   that innovations might appear necessary even without clear recognition
   of their functional consequences.

   sociology departments are in fact conducting some form of assessment,
   although faculty members often are critical of these activities. The

   in carrying out assessment plans by virtue of their disciplinary
   training and skills in analyzing data. Further, the authors appeal to
   readers of Teaching Sociology that assessment and the scholarship of
   teaching and learning are inextricably linked and that it requires only
   a small step from conducting research on the scholarship of teaching and

AB The use of informal writing is common in sociology. This article
   presents one model for integrating informal written work with learning
   goals through a theoretical framework known as concentric thinking. More
   commonly referred to as 'the PTA model' because of the series of
   cognitive tasks it promotes-prioritization,translation, and analogy
   (PTA)-concentric thinking practiced through PTA provides a basis for
   structuring students' informal writing over the course of a semester.
   The authors present data in which students use PTA to assess their
   journal entries as text at the end of the semester. The students'
   informal responses to their own writing demonstrate the achievement of
   an important course goal-the development of sociological
   mindfulness-while they also reveal a deeper understanding of the
   important features of written work. The authors conclude that when
   informal writing is purposefully linked to a set of thinking goals and
   learning outcomes that are necessary to complete formal course
   requirements, it can serve as a powerful teaching tool to enhance both
   thinking and the ability to convey thoughts in writing. Structured in
   this way, informal written work can enable us to observe and assess
   changes in students' learning that would otherwise remain invisible, and
   it can alter our pedagogy in fundamental ways.

AB This article examines Bourdieu's contributions to history and historical
   sociology. Bourdieu has often been misread as an ahistorical
   'reproduction theorist' whose work does not allow for diachronic change
   or human agency. The article argues both that reproduction and social
   change, constraint and freedom, are at the heart of Bourdieu's project.
   Bourdieu's key concepts - habitus, field, cultural and symbolic capital
   - are all inherently historical. Bourdieu deploys his basic categories
   using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the
   ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical
   discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu's historicism are traced to his
   teachers at the Ecole Normale Superieure and to the long-standing
   aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two
   disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu's work is also signalled
   by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his
   former students and colleagues. Bourdieu allowed sociology to
   historicize itself to a greater extent than other French sociologists.

   are justified in speaking of Bourdieu's economic sociologies in the
   plural. While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction
   (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the
   fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he
   had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work
   in Algeria on 'the economy of honour and "good faith" (1950s and 1960s);
   his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the
   economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three
   studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's
   attempt to formulate a general program for 'economic anthropology' in
   his article 'The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as
   field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at
   Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.

AB In contrast to recent US studies showing a decrease in core network
   size, our Kenyan data reveals substantial network growth. We attribute
   this to the diffusion of mobile telephones. Results from pooled survey
   data from Nairobi professionals and entrepreneurs in 2002 and 2007 as
   well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation
   in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of
   technology use. What explains this puzzle is a network effect of mobile
   telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a
   context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and
   the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data
   before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this
   interpretation, showing that mobile phones are a crucial resource in
   managing interpersonal networks for instrumental purposes. (C) 2010
