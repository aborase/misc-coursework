   languished, been forgotten, or misrepresented, as if The Social
   Construction of Reality (SCR) eliminated the need to study its
   predecessors in Wissenssoziologie. By considering Berger's subsequent
   statements about the book, along with remarks recently made by Luckmann,
   and then returning to the text itself, this article shows that some of
   the main suppositions on which SCR rests are foreign to the sociology of
   knowledge in its original forms, and that a number of these premises do
   not seem as plausible in today's social world as they may have in the
   early 1960s when their authors formulated them. The unintended scholarly
   results of SCR's surprising publishing success are evaluated.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this paper, I bring Berger and Luckmann's The Social Construction of
   Reality into conversation with the relatively new subfield of the
   sociology of the senses to argue that greater attentiveness to sensory
   perception can enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of the social
   construction of reality. When read with this sensitization, one finds
   implicit references to the senses throughout their discussion, but
   nowhere is sensory perception explicitly theorized as a part of the
   social construction process. Drawing specifically on their analysis of
   primary socialization, face-to-face interaction, language and relevance
   structures, and the fundamental dialectic of externalization,
   objectivation, and internalization, I demonstrate that processes of
   perceptual construction - specifically sensory attention and
   disattention - are key mechanism of social construction underlying many
   of Berger and Luckmann's arguments. A more explicit focus on sensory
   perception not only clarifies and strengthens many of their
   observations, but also constitutes a renewal of their important call to
   examine the processes of social construction.</td>

   Reality shifted from the study of rarified ideas to practical activity,
   focusing on the stabilization of a sense of shared reality. The opposite
   side of this shift in emphasis has received much less attention -
   activities that place reality into a state of play and, in so doing,
   call attention to its ephemerality. I discuss three empirical areas
   where the practical use of other realities is central to the sociology
   of knowledge. First, I document cases in which skilled practitioners,
   such as airline pilots, safety engineers, and athletes, use simulation
   to prepare for events that are understood as highly uncertain and risky.
   Next, I describe how other realities are mobilized epistemologically,
   such as through experimentation in technoscience and experimentalism in
   unrealized or unbuilt' art and architecture. Finally, I consider
   autotelic and transcendent social experiences through fantasy and
   technological mediations like augmented realities.</td>

   trajectories, this article attempts to characterize the common features
   of postsocialist capitalism, as it has developed since the 1990s in
   Eastern Europe. Using conceptual tools of economic sociology, the
   postsocialist socio-economic organization is analyzed as embedded
   economy, the institutionalization of capitalism as a moral project, and
   the pervasiveness of informality from the networks and culture
   perspectives. Economic development is viewed as dependent,
   simultaneously, on the system's structural, political and cultural
   features. For postsocialist capitalism, these features include lack of
   state autonomy due to close coupling of political and economic roles;
   the embrace of greed and self-interest as legitimate motives for action;
   and persistence and bolstering of informality as modus operandi.
   Stipulations about developmental consequences are provided in the
   conclusion.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article addresses the question of whether and how internal wars can
   lead to state building. I offer a new conceptual framework for
   understanding the varied effects of internal conflict on state capacity,
   as measured through taxation. Contrary to the general scholarly
   consensus that internal wars make states fail, I hypothesize that like
   external wars, internal wars can lead to increased taxation when they
   enhance solidarity toward the state among the elite and motivate the
   state to strengthen and territorially expand the tax administration.
   Elite solidarity, in turn, depends on the degree to which elites
   perceive the risks of war as real, decide to protect their interests
   with the help of the state, and feel a sense of patriotism. However, due
   to the existence of insurgent actors with taxing capacity, the positive
   effect of internal wars on state building may be hampered. I use this
   framework to make sense of the cases of Colombia, Malaysia, and
   Singapore, where internal wars, despite their otherwise destructive
   effects, resulted in state building instead of state failure.</td>

   psychologists have focused on how individuals cope with contexts that
   make acting on moral motivations difficult by building supportive
   networks and embedding themselves in communities of like-minded people.
   In this article, however, the author argues that actors can achieve a
   moral "sense of one's place" through a habitus that leverages the
   material dimensions of place itself. In particular, he shows how one
   community of radical environmental activists make affirming moral
   identities centered on living "naturally" seem like "second nature,"
   even in a seemingly unnatural and immoral urban environment, by
   reconfiguring their physical world. The author shows how nonhuman
   objects serve as proofs of moral labor, markers of moral boundaries, and
   reminders of moral values, playing both a facilitating and constraining
   role in moral life.</td>

   study of the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally (SMR). Economies of spectatorship
   produce spectacular diegeses as commodities sold to spectators and
   sponsors. They develop through a dialectical process of progressive
   decontextualization as their diegeses are cross-marketed with discrepant
   products and services to reach new markets. Progressive
   decontextualization leads to diegetic incoherence that threatens the
   realization of profit. As an economy of spectatorship, the SMR produced
   an outlaw biker themed diegesis replete with vicarious action and
   consumable character gambles. The SMR progressively decontextualized as
   it cross-marketed its outlaw diegesis with establishment corporate,
   religious and political themes. The resulting diegetic incoherence
   threatened profits and required the SMR's producers to make significant
   investments in order to stabilize its flow of spectators and sponsors.
   Conceptualizing such inherently negating processes is critical to
   understanding the commodification of spectacle in mature capitalism.</td>

   used to introduce concepts and theories to provide more time for
   discussion in class and more opportunity for students to review concepts
   and theories outside of class. Students' use and their perceptions of
   the impact of the screencasts were assessed with an in-class survey

   Although it was not possible to measure the impact of blended learning

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article discusses the uneasy relationship between forward-oriented
   sociological research and public debate. It explores how implicit
   assumptions and explicit conceptualizations influence sociology's
   ability to address the future. It argues that the stakes are not merely
   theoretical but also practical because methodological pre-decisions
   shape sociology's relation to public debate and its abilities to tackle
   the emergent challenges of our time. Sociology was geared since its
   inception toward the collective reflection of not only present or past
   conditions of social existence but also of possibilities for change.
   While deterministic and expertocratic closures limited its potential,
   shifting epistemological, institutional, and social constellations allow
   the expansion, evasion, and re-emergence of open and contestable future
   orientations. Case studies related to climate change, globalization,
   social movements, values, and media are used to explore actual and
   potential contributions to public discourse.</td>

   community sense, the public face of shared aesthetic judgments that is
   communicated and upheld within a group. The author illustrates this
   concept through an ethnographic case study of an erotic arts club, a
   group predicated on achieving a shared sense of good and bad taste. The
   author shows how the community sense is formed, challenged, and
   sustained in interaction, examining three characteristics of aesthetic
   judgmentsderivation in form, visceral force, and intersubjective
   validitythat together constitute a strong basis for feelings of
   belonging and distinction. This setting acts as a wedge to access larger
   theoretical concerns, as the author explore the relationship between
   aesthetic judgment and feelings of group belonging in diverse contexts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociological theorists have long understood the central role of status
   distinctions in producing social inequality. Although empirical studies
   have demonstrated how status hierarchies are reproduced in a broad range
   of cultural domains, there remains little research into where
   legitimating cultural practices take place, where they do not, and the
   role of space itself in producing status differences. As a result,
   sociologists lack a clear understanding of how status hierarchies give
   shape to cities and how the structure of cities might be practiced
   hierarchically. On the basis of interviews at a high-end shopping center
   in Istanbul, Turkey, I examine how consumers enact social rank in
   physical space with specific reference to the social contours of their
   city. Through privileging particular forms of consumption practices
   within socially and spatially exclusive venues, elites map legitimating
   values upon the physical shape of the city itself, providing a
   spatialized understanding of how status inequalities are distributed.</td>

   relationship between environmental threats and activism. Drawing from
   literatures in environmental sociology and social movements, we examine
   the coal industry and its resultant environmental devastation in
   Czechoslovakia to investigate the intersection of political and
   environmental threats in provoking activism in highly repressive
   settings. Using a range of data sources, we illustrate how the
   externalities of extreme production coupled with developing weaknesses
   in the state ultimately incited public protest against the regime. Our
   analysis of protest in North Bohemia provides insight into broader
   patterns of elite legitimacy and resistance. Our findings show that the
   environmental externalities stemming from state-mandated production in
   the North Bohemian region posed an imminent threat that spurred
   residents to protest despite harsh state repression. We conclude by
   discussing the implications of our findings for future research on
   environmental and political threats, elite legitimation, and citizen
   activism.</td>

   States, including the National Research Council, National Institutes of
   Health, and National Science Foundation, have expressed concern about
   waning policy influence, declining government funding, and the growing
   politicization of science. Given this background, a number of
   theoretical questions motivate this study. First, what is the political
   context of scientific authority in the contemporary United States? More
   specifically, how can we best understand the association between
   political ideology and public perceptions of science in the current
   polarized environment? Using data from the National Science Foundation's
   Survey of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and
   Technology (2006-2012), this study finds that the American public is
   culturally and politically divided in its support for the intersection
   of science and the state. Various models of political and cultural
   polarization are tested. Overall, ideological challenges to the cultural
   authority of science cannot be reduced to left-right political
   polarization or to conservative religious beliefs. Instead, skepticism
   on the political right is multifold, involving distinct modes of thought
   and concerns about the institutional ties between science and the state.</td>

   across the world disapprove of homosexuality, we know a lot less about
   the lenses through which they view same-sex relations. The aim of this
   study is to understand better how homosexuality is framed in the public
   press, and how religion and economic development may combine to shape
   this discourse. Through an analysis of almost 400 newspaper articles,
   this study compares how homosexuality is framed in Uganda, South Africa,
   and the United States. Because these nations have high levels of
   religious belief, but differ in their level of economic development and
   democracy, we can assess how these factors interact to shape portrayals.
   Drawing on work from cultural sociology and the sociology of religion,
   this study shows that the United States is much more likely than Uganda
   to frame homosexuality as a civil rights issue and use entertainers as
   claimsmakers. Conversely, articles from Uganda are more likely than
   those from the United States or South Africa to frame homosexuality as a
   religious issue and draw on religious claimsmakers. Likewise, Uganda is
   much more likely than South Africa to discuss homosexuality in the
   context of Western influences.</td>

   belief, but the relationship is still only vaguely understood. Using a
   case study of the appearance of social justice beliefs in Victorian-era
   Britain, this article develops an explanation of the link between
   history and morality by applying field theory to capture the historical
   genesis of a field. A moral way of evaluating poverty and inequality
   developed slowly over the course of the nineteenth century in Britain,
   with a trajectory extending back to Malthus's Essay on the Principle of
   Population and moving forward to the Fabians, the Settlement Movement,
   and other social reformers at the end of the nineteenth century. Drawing
   from field theory, I argue that social justice beliefs emerged during
   this time through the genesis of moral universalism as a distinct mode
   of experience. Several recognizable moral beliefs appeared in the
   process, including "equality of opportunity," "equality of reward,"
   "character," and "effort," "ability," and "duty" as forms of merit
   (among others). I argue for treating moral beliefs as historical and
   relational entities that are situated and dated by the conditions
   marking their appearance in a field. As I conclude, this lends the
   sociology of morality to a critical moral reflexivity instead of moral
   relativism or moral realism.</td>

   beyond the situational production of consent that has dominated studies
   of the labor process and outlines the relational production of labor's
   surplus value. Using a case of unpaid women who perform valuable work
   for VIP nightclubs, I present ethnographic data on the VIP party circuit
   from New York, the Hamptons, Miami, and Cannes, as well as 84 interviews
   with party organizers and guests. Party promoters, mostly male brokers,
   appropriate surplus value from women in four stages: recruitment,
   mobilization, performance, and control. Relational work between
   promoters and women, cemented by gifts and strategic intimacies, frames
   women's labor as leisure and friendship, and boundary work legitimizes
   women's work as distinct from sexual labor. When boundaries, media, and
   meanings of relationships do not appropriately align, as in relational
   mismatches, women experience the VIP party less as leisure and more as
   work, and they are less likely to participate. My findings embed the
   labor process in a relational infrastructure and hold insights for
   explaining why people work for free in culture and technology sectors of
   the post-Fordist economy.</td>

   the payment received for the last client among female sex workers.
   Building on research on the informal economy and sex work, we formulate
   a positive embeddedness hypothesis, expecting a positive association,
   and an exploitation hypothesis, expecting a negative association. We
   analyze a large survey combined with intensive interview data on female
   sex workers in Andhra Pradesh, India. These data uniquely distinguish
   between the amount the sex worker actually received and the amount the
   client paid. The analyses show that brokers are associated with
   significantly lower last payment received. Although brokers are
   associated with a greater number of clients in the past week, this does
   not result in significantly higher total earnings in the past week.
   Further analyses suggest that much of the negative relationship with
   earnings is due to the fact that brokers lead to a lack of control over
   the amount clients are charged. At the same time, the results fail to
   show that brokers actually provide services of value. Ultimately, the
   results support the exploitation hypothesis. We conclude by encouraging
   the refinement of theories of embeddedness and exploitation and calling
   for greater research on workers in the informal economy of developing
   countries.</td>

   sciences has been well documented in the perceptions of both lay and
   scientific populations. Influenced by the Kuhnian concept of paradigm
   development and empirical studies on the closure of scientific
   controversies, scholars from divergent traditions associate scientific
   development with increased consensus and stability. However, both the
   macro/quantitative and micro/qualitative approaches are limited in key
   ways. This article is the first comparative ethnography of a natural
   science (molecular biology) and a social science (psychology) and it
   highlights important differences between the fields. Molecular
   biologists engage in a process of bench-building, in which they create
   and integrate new manipulation techniques and technologies into their
   practice, whereas psychologists have far less opportunity for this type
   of development. This suggests an alternative conception of the
   natural/social divide, in which the natural sciences are defined by
   dynamic material evolution while the social sciences remain relatively
   stable.</td>

   special issue is that longevity should be considered as a point of
   departure for new forms of politics in which social sciences, in
   particular sociology and politics, can play an important role. In this
   introduction, we argue that emerging consumer markets in biomedicine are
   incrementally redefining the relationship between old age and society.
   Techno-economic transformations are creating new sites of vulnerability
   that are masked by medical utopias of good health and living forever. In
   this context, it is unlikely that such technologies will be able to
   overcome inequalities in distribution and may well exacerbate various
   forms of injustice. By drawing on notions of institutional
   precariousness and scarcity, we conclude that to maintain any degree of
   social solidarity, increasing longevity will force the emergence of a
   sociology of limits.</td>

   a milestone in the development of modern sociology. His empirical
   studies often employed a triangular methodological approach, and by
   grounding The Philadelphia Negro in what is the earliest extensive
   social survey by an American sociologist, Du Bois set the stage for the
   growth of sociology as a legitimate science. In fact, his approach
   became the model that the discipline eventually followed. Had Du Bois
   been white, he would have been recognized as a leading founder of the
   field. Since Du Bois' early sociological scholarship was completed
   during the height of the Jim Crow era, his brilliant landmark work was
   largely negated by the profession. His scholarly accomplishments clearly
   focused on establishing a scientific sociology. Based on his exemplary
   work, can sociology finally negate the sociological negation of W.E.B.
   Du Bois?</td>

   cultural schemata are shaped by the transition from agrarian to
   industrial society. Developing societies are viewed as traditional,
   gemeinschaft cultures lacking the stigmatizing beliefs about persons
   with mental illness held in modern, gesellschaft cultures of developed
   societies. The Stigma in Global ContextMental Health Study formalized
   the cultural myth of public stigma (CMPS) with propositions linking
   level of development to intolerant, exclusionary, and individualistic
   attitudes. In 17 countries, the authors find no support for the
   corollary; where support is found, the findings are opposite
   expectations, with developed societies reporting lower stigma levels.
   Reconceptualizing of the cultural landscape on more specific dimensions
   also produces null or contrary findings. This correction to nostalgic

   treatment, policy, and stigma-reduction efforts.</td>

   that are distinct from biomedical research. These arise from the
   epistemological differences between traditional biomedical research
   paradigms and CBPR, as the latter entails ongoing engagement of
   communities in research from development to dissemination. Biomedical
   research typically poses research questions and obtains ethics review
   before engaging with the population or community of interest. While
   institutional review board (IRB) practices seek to minimize harm in
   research conducted with human subjects, traditional IRB review can
   introduce new or exacerbate existing ethical challenges when reviewing
   non-traditional research protocols. In what follows, we seek to: define
   CBPR; identify unique ethical obligations in CBPR; pose potential
   solutions for amending the IRB process to support CBPR; and facilitate a
   research ethics framework that aims to reduce the exploitive and
   appropriational tendencies in research by inviting researchers, IRBs,
   and communities into a collaborative effort aimed at best practices.</td>

   The team's processes of conducting seven case studies of diverse

   multi-disciplinary research team's self-reflections on identity and
   positionality are analyzed, privileging its combined racial, ethnic, and

   theory into these reflections. Findings from the inquiry are shared, and

   research, and more specifically, grounding our work in feminist ethics
   and critical pedagogy theories, we created linked courses that weave
   both collaborative theory and practice into the fabric of the courses.
   Upon teaching these courses, we found that students responded in an
   overwhelmingly positive way to collaborative theoretical models and to
   collaborative dialogical practice in the classroom, but when it came to
   team-based work conducted with community members, student responses were
   mixed. Reactions to collaborative grading practice conducted by faculty
   members and the community partner were more unanimous: a majority of
   students expressed confusion and discomfort with this practice.
   Collaborative theory and dialogical practice, then, were uniformly
   embraced in the classroom, while team-based work and evaluation in the
   community provided more discomfort and displeasure. This finding
   reiterates the pervasiveness of individualist thinking, even when
   students have chosen courses that are expressly collaborative in both

   physicians are identified by disaggregating a multidimensional physician
   trust scale. Compared to Whites, Blacks are less likely to trust the
   technical judgment and interpersonal competence of doctors. Latinos are
   less likely than Whites to trust the fiduciary ethic, technical
   judgment, and interpersonal competence of doctors. Black-Latino
   differences in physician trust are a function of ethnoracial differences
   in parental nativity. The ways ethnoracial hierarchies are inscribed
   into power-imbalanced clinical exchanges are discussed. (C) 2015

   mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how
   cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization
   and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against
   hydraulic fracturing (fracking) utilized cultural artifacts to influence
   public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet
   search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to
   identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find
   that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about
   fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass
   media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking
   mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking
   moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications
   not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and
   research on media, the environment, and energy.</td>

   childhood access to opportunities. Educational reforms that introduce
   new information about school quality may lead to increased inequality if
   families with more resources are better able to respond. However, these
   policies can also level the playing field for choice by equalizing
   disadvantaged families' access to information. This study assesses how a
   novel accountability system affected family enrollment decisions in the
   Chicago Public Schools by introducing new test performance information
   and consequences. We show that a substantial proportion of families
   responded by transferring out when their child's school was assigned
   probation. Poor families transferred children to other schools in the
   district, but at a lower rate than non-poor families, who were also more
   likely to leave for another district or enroll in private school. Most
   striking, we show that despite family response to the probation label,
   access to higher-performing schools changed very little under the new
   policy; students who left probation schools were the most likely of all
   transfer students to enroll in other low-performing schools in the
   district. Although new information changed families' behavior, it did
   not address contextual and resource-dependent factors that constrain the
   educational decisions of poor families.</td>

   empathy, empathetic responses toward victims, definitions of abuse, and
   propensity to agree with victim-blaming attitudes change after

   a statistically significant but small increase in global empathy scores,
   a growth in empathetic responses toward victims, an expansion in
   students' definitions of abuse, and greater disagreement with
   victim-blaming attitudes. I discuss ways sociology instructors can use

   both specific historical and contemporary tensions (i.e., white police
   profiling, beating, and murder of people of color) and with ambiguity
   (e.g., what is meant by "race" and how do we operationalize and measure
   "violence" at the hands of law enforcement?). Defining the concept of
   "race" as a multidimensional process of oppression and justification for
   social inequality can shed light on why and how police violence often
   descends upon black and Latino populations as well as why such brutality
   and state surveillance is supported by many whites yesterday and today.
   In this article I analyze the relationships between police violence and
   race as an ongoing feedback loop: "race" produces violence and
   inequality while violence and inequality (re) forms "race." Their
   intertwined formation reproduces the dominant meanings and structural
   location of racial groups in five key domains: ideologies, institutions,

   study of citizenship. When citizenship is studied, sociologists tend to
   concentrate on just one facet: rights. I elaborate four conceptual
   facets of citizenship. I link two-citizenship as rights and belonging-to
   theoretical elaborations of multiculturalism. Considering
   multiculturalism as a state discourse and set of policies, rather than a
   political or normative theory, I outline linkages between
   multiculturalism and two additional facets of citizenship: legal status
   and participation. Over the last 15 years, the idea of multiculturalism
   has come under withering criticism, especially in Europe, in part
   because it is claimed that multiculturalism undermines common
   citizenship. Yet countries with more multicultural policies and a
   stronger discourse of pluralism and recognition are places where
   immigrants are more likely to become citizens, more trusting of
   political institutions, and more attached to the national identity.
   There is also little evidence that multicultural policies fuel majority
   backlash, and some modest evidence that such policies enlarge
   conceptions of inclusive membership. By studying claims-making and the
   equality of immigrant-origin groups, we see that the participatory
   aspect of citizenship needs to take center stage in future work in
   political sociology, social theory, social movements, immigration, and
   race/ethnicity.</td>

   stigmatized into low-paying, undesirable jobs. Prejudice clearly leads
   to exclusion. But surprisingly, evidence linking exclusion to
   disadvantage is mixed. We address this issue theoretically, providing a
   formal rational choice model combining arguments from sociology ( on
   prejudice) and economics ( on competition). Our theory suggests that
   economic organization is crucial. In economies dominated by monopoly,
   oligarchy, tradition, or government, prejudice may reduce some workers'
   pay, and a disadvantageous secondary labor market may emerge. By
   contrast, in competitive free markets, exclusionary discrimination often
   occurs but does not reduce workers' pay, nor does it induce a
   disadvantageous secondary labor market. Our theory suggests the
   conventional analytic approach to discrimination is misguided: Exclusion
   does not necessarily imply disadvantage; a shortfall in pay does not
   necessarily imply that the lower paid worker is disadvantaged; and
   analysis should focus on the overall subjective well-being or utility
   derived from a job, not on pay alone.</td>

   sociology and network perspectives to explain how cultural features of
   adolescent peer groups influence adolescent romantic relationship
   inauthenticitythe extent of incongruence between one's thoughts/feelings
   and actions within romantic contexts. Using National Longitudinal Study
   of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) data, I apply sequence
   analysis and linear regression models to test whether adolescents
   experience greater romantic relationship inauthenticity when the
   ordering of events within ideal romantic relationship scripts (e.g.,
   holding hands, saying I love you, having sexual intercourse) diverges
   from ideal romantic relationship scripts of fellow peer-group members.
   Results indicate romantic relationship inauthenticity increases as one's
   ideal script diverges from fellow peer-group members' scripts.
   Importantly, heterogeneity in relationship scripts at the peer-group
   level was not associated with relationship inauthenticity. This study
   highlights the roles cultural reinforcement and social network processes
   play in the link between culture and action.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article explores the subtle yet far-reaching ways that cultural
   environments shape the uses of the evening hours among business
   professionals in three countries. Drawing on interviews with
   professional men and women living and working in Paris, Oslo, and San
   Francisco from a spectrum of professional fields and employers, the
   article explores their evening routines. Three contrasting patterns are
   identified. Where the early evening hours between 17:00 and 21:00 are
   concerned, French, Norwegian, and American professionals traverse
   different cultural terrains. The French professionals and their
   employers treat this temporal zone as a status-conferring period.
   Adhering to a transorganizational cultural convention defining the early
   evening as work time, they use these hours to distinguish themselves as
   committed practioners of their m,tier equipped with status and
   authority. In Norway, comparable professionals approach this period as
   nonwork time off limits to their employer. Early departures from the
   office are encouraged and facilitated in the Norwegian workplace. Among
   the American professionals far less uniformity prevails among the
   evening routines of respondents working in different organizations and
   occupations. This variability is explained by the absence of the
   higher-level temporal conventions present in the two European contexts.
   In the American setting two deciding factors come into play: the
   temporal expectations of the professional's employer and the bargaining
   power wielded by the individual professional vis-A -vis this employer.
   These differences between the evening routines of the three groups
   reflect important cultural differences across countries with broadly
   similar postindustrial landscapes.</td>

   that decision was whether scientific research had achieved consensus
   regarding how children of same-sex couples fare. Determining the extent
   of consensus has become a key aspect of how social science evidence and
   testimony is accepted by the courts. Here, we show how a method of
   analyzing temporal patterns in citation networks can be used to assess
   the state of social scientific literature as a means to inform just such
   a question. Patterns of clustering within these citation networks reveal
   whether and when consensus arises within a scientific field. We find
   that the literature on outcomes for children of same-sex parents is
   marked by scientific consensus that they experience "no differences"

   We analyze a unique representative data set of 402 teachers and 200

   understand the rights to due process articulated in the Supreme Court
   case of Goss v. Lopez (1975). We then examine whether individual
   characteristics and participation in organizational processes are
   associated with educators' understandings of students' due process
   rights. Findings suggest that educators' understandings of students'
   entitlements to due process vary with educators' level of education,
   experience of school-related legal threats, and participation in
   district or diocese in-service training programs on students' rights.
   Results point to organizational climate as a key factor in shaping
   educators' rights conceptions and the role of law in American schools.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This essay brings together 'commodity chain' analysis with some of the
   central concerns motivating studies of consumption and consumer culture.
   It argues that we can, from the perspective of capitalist agents and
   agencies, discern important historical shifts in the economic
   significance of the various activities that generate modern consumer
   culture, or 'consumer cultural production'. Shifts in both the nature
   and intensity of competitive pressures imply different roles for
   consumer cultural production within the portfolios and strategies of
   leading capitalist organizations over time. Thus, the essay provides a
   framework for periodizing and linking historical shifts in the
   organization of commodity chains in relation to transformations in the
   structure and nature of consumer cultural production over roughly the
   past century. More concretely, it connects the broad shift from
   commodity chains organized along a 'producer-driven' form to the
   'buyer-driven' arrangement to different kinds of 'market making' through
   consumer cultural production.</td>

   attempts to rebound. Most research, however, focuses on revitalization
   within the service industry, ignoring important efforts in other
   sectors, like construction. As recent scholars argue, revitalization
   within the building trades is unique because organizing workers is not
   the same as organizing work. Locals must simultaneously increase
   membership and market capacity. Unfortunately, existing theories ignore
   many obstacles that building trade unions face in market expansion
   efforts. These obstacles include macro-economic conditions, like the
   Great Recession, which limit work opportunities; inter-union competition
   which allows one Local to expand market share by poaching work from
   another; and cost differentials which continue to prevent unions from
   breaking into new markets. Relying on the case of International
   Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 58, these obstacles are
   explored and used to reformulate current theories on revitalization and
   market recovery within the building trades.</td>

   situations? Applied to social and historical events, contingency denotes
   a mode of causality characterized by its indeterminate character.
   Conjunctural causation and period effects lack the specificity required
   to identify a distinctive class of processes. References to chance
   happenings offer no clue to analyze endogenous disruptions. Focusing on
   breaks in patterns of social relations and the role played by individual
   agency, the author distinguishes four types of impact-pyramidal,
   pivotal, sequential, and epistemic-and investigates how these relate to
   the possibility of indeterminacy through an Event Structure Analysis of
   the night of August 4, 1789, in Versailles. This empirical foray
   underscores the significance of junctures that are indeterminate with
   respect to their collective outcomes. The article grounds analytically
   this class of conjunctures with the concept of mutual uncertainty,
   gauges the phenomenal scope of this contingency in terms of action
   domains and group types, contrasts it with the notion of chance events,
   and draws its implications for the study of social and historical
   change.</td>

   examination of the case of Tahrir Square in the Egyptian revolution of
   2011. The author argues that the pre-existing, historically specific
   understanding of Tahrir Square as a politicized space of protest drew
   people there in January 2011 and shaped their participation in the
   revolution. Specifically, the author suggests that earlier mobilizations
   that took place in Tahrir Square contributed to the events of the
   revolution in three ways: (1) provided protesters with an idea about
   Tahrir as a target of protests, (2) provided protesters with the idea of
   occupation of Tahrir, and (3) provided protesters with an inspiration in
   the revolution. The article contributes to the literature in sociology
   of space and social movements by proposing that the history of space in
   social movements and previous mobilization matters, but also these may
   shape the new movement and the role of space in protest. This article is
   part of the author's research about the Egyptian revolution of 2011. It
   is based on two phases of historical and ethnographic research in Egypt
   conducted in 2011 and 2012.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>On 28 January 2011 - as police abandoned the streets and reports of
   theft spread - Egyptians went down to the streets to protect their
   families and property, closing down intersections and setting up
   checkpoints. These neighborhood groups - known as popular committees
   (PCs) - filled the security vacuum and were one of the deciding factors
   of Mubarak's downfall. This article explores how ordinary Egyptians
   collectively acted in order to restore stability during the regime's
   moment of crisis. The author briefly introduces Egyptian PCs by
   discussing other instances of community organizing that occurred under
   extraordinary circumstances. Next, the author focuses on the
   microdynamics of PCs during the 2011 revolution by describing their
   mobilization, social networks, practices, communication methods, and
   dissolution. The PC narrative reminds us that, even during a revolution,
   the actions of ordinary individuals are often ignored by scholars and
   observers. Only after moving our attention away from the main squares do
   we begin to understand the full complexity of such exceptional moments.</td>

   student learning outcomes using a quasiexperimental design. We provide
   an assessment of peer review in a quantitative research methods course,
   which is a traditionally difficult and technical course. Data were
   collected from 170 students enrolled in four sections of a quantitative
   research methods course, two in-class peer review sections, and two
   sections that did not incorporate in-class peer review over two
   semesters. For the two sections with peer review, content scheduled for
   the days during which peer review was used in class was delivered
   through the online course management system. We find that in-class peer
   review did not improve final grades or final performance on student
   learning outcomes, nor did it affect performance differences between
   drafts and final assignments that measured student learning objectives.
   Further, it took time away from in-class delivery of course content in
   course sections that used in-class peer review. If peer review is
   utilized, we recommend it be assigned as an out-of-class assignment so
   it does not interfere with in-class teaching.</td>

   Results showed few differences in these outcomes between groups taught

   classified information reveal the social construction of reality by the
   state. I develop a theory that explains how leaks shape the discursive
   frames states create to communicate the causes of social problems to the
   public and corresponding solutions to redress them. Synthesizing
   cultural sociology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, I
   argue that leaks enable non-state actors to amplify contradictions
   between the public and secret behavior of the state. States respond by
   ad hoc-ing new frames that normalize their secret transgressions as
   logical extensions of other policy agendas. While these syncretic
   responses resolve contradictions exposed by leaks, they gradually detach
   discursive frames from reality and therefore increase states' need for
   secrecyas well as the probability of future leaksin turn. I illustrate
   this downward spiral of deception and disclosure via a case study of the
   British government's discourse about terrorism between 2000 and 2008.</td>

   and mnemonic capacity are necessary but insufficient factors for silence
   breaking commemorations to emerge. This study identifies two additional
   criteria necessary for commemorations that publicly acknowledged
   long-silenced pasts: pressure from external forces, and the convergence

   first identify latent trajectories of work and family roles between late

   course have direct effects on later-life economic well-being, as well as
   indirect effects that operate through more proximate measures of work,
   family, and other characteristics. We argue that these findings have

   of knowledge flows in the short-cycled movement of published references

   then examine the social-structural antecedents of dyadic knowledge flows
   that help explain macro-level patterns. Results show that university
   collaborations have grown denser and more integrated across faculty
   members and their institutional divisions. However, this integration is
   led by "star" researchers and is accompanied by a greater centralization
   of knowledge flows around these individuals. Results illustrate
   important shifts in the nature of academic research, and contribute to a

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The emergence of market society in Europe prompted a major change in the
   social measurement of individual worth. The formal system of
   aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois
   concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual
   merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution
   commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in
   domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this
   cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and
   comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a
   social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted
   representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited
   ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented
   values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the
   novels point to major differences in the social psychologies
   underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence
   of honor culture well before this occurred historically.</td>

   over foundational beliefs and values greatly decreases the chance that a
   successful, sustainable community experience will develop. My findings
   suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite
   incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and
   values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit
   organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate
   jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental
   mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms
   associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive
   mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of
   objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful
   experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect,
   based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications
   for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social
   psychology are discussed.</td>

   synthesizes them with contemporary urban and environmental sociology to
   advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The
   theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact
   endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns
   recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we
   conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site
   accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was
   assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past
   half centurymost of which remain unacknowledged in government reports.
   Results show how three iterative processeshazardous industrial churning,
   residential churning, and risk containmentintersect to produce
   successive socioenvironmental changes that are highly relevant to but
   often missed by research on urban growth machines, environmental
   inequality, and systemic risk.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Weber's typology of religious orientations is incomplete. Much more
   attention has been paid to the other-worldly mysticism of monastic or
   contemplative withdrawal from society than the neglected category of
   inner-worldly mysticism. In Weber's brief treatment, he concludes that
   inner-worldly mysticism results in passive acquiescence to social
   conditions. Alternately, we draw on examples from Mother Teresa and
   Dorothy Day to demonstrate not only how mysticism can be tightly linked
   to the social world, but how mystical practices can create meaningful
   social change. We argue that this change is possible because
   inner-worldly mysticism holds the potential to generate solidarity
   across traditional power and status divides. We illustrate how this
   potential for interaction-level change can spread horizontally; the
   number of small groups committed to carrying out inner-worldly mystical
   practices can grow until such groups spread across communities and
   beyond. In this way, the work of inner-worldly mystics can create
   meaningful change without ever vying for power on the macro political
   stage.</td>

   synthesizing the main themes of scholars who have challenged dominant
   contemporary understandings of race and the law. Although a theory of
   state tacitly undergirds much critical race scholarship, no one has yet
   aggregated the literature's disparate assertions into a unified theory
   of state. This article represents an initial contribution toward that
   effort. Through comparison with Omi and Winant's (1994) Racial State
   Theory (RST), I identify six central tenets - racialization of the
   state; state as white institutional space; instrumentalism;
   interest-convergence; fluid boundaries; and permanent racist orientation
   - that characterize the CRT of State for the United States. I close by
   entertaining three questions Omi and Winant (2012) argue demonstrate the
   utility of RST and use them to illustrate where the CRT of State I
   outline achieves greater analytical purchase than RST.</td>

   Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that
   the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where
   noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source
   of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent
   sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the
   theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a
   complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies
   identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and
   predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological

   is an unusual type of government transfer. Recipients of the EITC say
   they value the debt relief this government benefit brings. However, they

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative,
   highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making
   established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as
   critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture
   and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency.
   Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather
   than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits,
   revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a
   strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity
   theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for
   the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid
   advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that
   macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights,
   generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But
   event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices
   leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to
   compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in
   turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even
   while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different
   forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different
   institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all
   insurgency by a social group.</td>

   private reflective journal entries and semipublic reflective blog posts,
   I find that both practices produce distinct forms of reflection. I argue
   that these differences can be understood in terms of the risks that
   students take in their writing. Journals, which do not incorporate peer
   readership, appear to compel students to take more personal risks and
   engage in emotional labor to process assigned materials. Blogs, which do
   incorporate peer readership, enable students to take more intellectual
   risks and engage in logical mental endeavors. The results suggest that
   instructors should be cognizant of the variety of risks their

   sociology courses, particularly, courses in which issues of inequality
   are central. In this paper, we describe using hunger banquetsan active
   learning exercise where participants are randomly stratified into three
   global classes and receive food based upon their class positionto
   enhance students' knowledge of global hunger and inequality. The
   nonprofit Oxfam America has made hunger banquets popular, but they are
   usually large public events. We provide ways of simplifying these
   exercises so that they can be conducted in sociology classrooms and
   incorporate sociological concepts. Quantitative and qualitative analysis
   of students' learning and engagement in three hunger banquets found that
   students had increases in perceived knowledge of the amount, severity,
   and causes of global hunger.</td>

   of U.S. and Canadian sociology graduate programs offered formal teacher
   training. Despite pronouncements that offerings have increased
   substantially, no similarly thorough and direct investigation has been
   published since. In this time of dramatic change and increasing scrutiny
   of higher education, graduate teacher training is arguably more
   important than ever before. Thus, we seek to provide a new baseline of
   teacher training in the discipline. Using a 2013 survey of U.S. and
   Canadian sociology graduate programs (N = 173), we find that 94 percent
   involve graduate students in teaching, almost 68 percent provide formal
   training for graduate student instructors, and 54 percent provide formal
   training for teaching assistants. We discuss the kinds and frequency of
   teacher training, as well as the type of graduate programs most likely
   to offer teacher training, and we provide suggestions for future
   research.</td>

   issues that were demonstrable across three community partner
   organization sites. Analyses of writing assignments and qualitative
   interviews at the end of the semester reveal that student development of
   critical consciousness was demonstrated through analytic engagement with
   structural and systemic forces framing health inequities as well as
   reflexive consideration of the limited extent to which well-meaning
   efforts and intentions of individuals can significantly impact lasting
   social change. The combination of these two processes simultaneously
   cultivated students' ideological commitments to ongoing social justice
   work and subverted student self-efficacy with regard to the
   operationalization of those commitments.</td>

   interpersonal evaluation. Drawing from Randall Collins's theory of
   interaction ritual, the author offers a qualitative case study of elite
   professional service firms to unpack how employers' emotional reactions
   to applicants in job interviews affect hiring evaluations. She finds
   that employers use subjective feelings of excitement and enthusiasm
   toward candidates-akin to Collins's concept of emotional energy-to
   evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions. With these data, she
   constructs an original theoretical framework of emotional energy
   development, which highlights the qualities that tend to produce or
   inhibit the subjective experience of emotional energy in job interviews.
   Additionally, she outlines the particular phases of an encounter where
   energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring
   outcomes and inequalities. She discusses the implications of these
   findings for research on hiring, labor market stratification, and
   interaction rituals.</td>

   assimilate religiously informed political conflicts to other forms of
   political conflict. The paper specifies the distinctively religious
   stakes of certain political conflicts, informed by distinctively
   religious understandings of right order, as well as the distinctiveness
   of religion as a rich matrix of interlocking modalities and mechanisms
   thatin certain contextscan contribute to political conflict and violence
   even when the stakes are not distinctively religious. At the same time,
   the paper shows that many putatively religious conflicts are
   fundamentally similar to other conflicts over political power, economic
   resources, symbolic recognition, or cultural reproduction.</td>

   on pragmatism and practice theory, we recast the notion of belief as a
   species of habit, with pre-reflexive anticipation the primary mechanism
   accounting for both the formation of beliefs and their causal influence
   on action. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in three ways:
   first, by linking it with recent research on the cognitive and motor
   development of infants; second, by drawing out a typology of belief
   states that accounts for a range of different experiential traits; and
   third, by applying the new model to reinterpret two belief-based
   phenomena of broad sociological interest: irrational decision making and

   We conceptualize this process in terms of two types of challenges:
   evidentiary challenges that question a study's methodology and
   interpretive challenges that question a study's theoretical framing. A
   survey of authors recently published in Administrative Science Quarterly
   finds that their peer review experience was dominated by interpretive
   challenges: extensive criticisms, suggestions, and subsequent revision
   concerning conceptual and theoretical issues but limited attention to
   methodological and empirical aspects of the work. Salient differences
   between original submissions and published papers include intensive
   reworking of theory and discussion sections as well as growth and

   assimilation of Asians and Latina/os into whiteness/non-Blackness, a
   two-part alternative approach is briefly suggested: (1) critically
   engage the most theoretically and politically challenging scholarship in

   of anti-Black racism; and (2) think through the social positions of
   non-Black peoples of color in light of and not losing sight of the first

   Korea, which has been overlooked in the study of race, empire, and
   Korean history. While the study of race claims to be global, it
   implicitly assumes that racism becomes possible through physical contact
   with different races'. Rather than examining the emergent racial
   politics after the recent global migration, I suggest that racism could
   emerge regardless of collective racial migration and contact. Further,
   recent colonial studies have overlooked the colonized, the Japanese
   Empire and its colonized. Accordingly, I question the absence of race in
   Korean historiography and the assumption of Korean racial naivete based
   on the supposed racial homogeneity. Further, I demonstrate how the
   notions of race and blackness are fundamentally embedded in Koreans'
   understanding of the Age of Empire. Thus, this paper calls for a new
   global' approach to the study of race and empire that questions these
   overlooked assumptions.</td>

   imperialists hotly debated whether to keep the Philippines as a colony.
   The generation' schema, which communicated racialized views of
   Filipinos/as and their ability to self-govern once they had been
   educated by white Americans, developed in these debates. For both
   imperialists and anti-imperialists, the generation' schema was rooted in
   racialized neo-Lamarckian notions of how the environment (i.e. US
   tutelage and training) could change the character of a non-white group.
   Therefore, this article analyzes debates between anti-imperialists,
   imperialists, and Filipinos/as as they each deployed generations' in the
   field of the colonial state. Using archival sources authored by
   imperialists, anti-imperialists, and Filipinos I find imperialists
   argued that future generations of Filipinas/os held more hope for
   independence in order to dismiss Filipina/o and anti-imperialist demands
   for immediate independence, while anti-imperialists and Filipinos/as
   used the schema to garner policies that incrementally led to
   independence in 1946.</td>

   I argue that though affecting a relatively small number of people in

   challenges the claim that the workings of capitalism in the West accord
   with the principles of equality and opportunity in a democratic society.
   Composed as much in the style of history as economics, what explains the
   appeal of this very long, carefully drafted and technically dense text?
   This review is woven of three threads: the method of research behind it;
   its fit with theory and practice in the critical social sciences; and
   what it exemplifies about the ambiguity of leaping from a science
   laboratory into the world of revolutionary praxis. To close, the
   European project of economic management will be briefly discussed,
   suggesting in reference to both French regulation theory and German
   Ordoliberalism why the recent Nobel Prize in Economics, which many
   consider Piketty's work to merit, was lost in favor of another French
   economist, Jean Tirole.</td>

   sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the
   spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-the-making, in the wake of
   debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a
   plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent,
   (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the
   contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the
   social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate,
   suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and
   blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising
   out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what
   modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate
   conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of
   immersive fieldwork based on "performing the phenomenon," is a fruitful
   path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata
   (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under
   investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the
   rewards of "observant participation" and achieve social competency (as
   distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu's
   dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of
   capturing the "spirit of acuteness" that animates such competency but
   vanishes from normal sociological accounts.</td>

   heavily from embodied mind theories in neurocognitive science and
   philosophy of mind. However, it also resonates with feminist
   epistemologies, such as sociologist Dorothy Smith's view that sociology
   should begin with and from the body. While both carnal sociology and the
   neurocognitive traditions it draws from ignore decades of feminist
   contributions to embodied epistemologies, I argue that feminist thought
   has much to contribute to materially grounded accounts of corporeal

   medicine. While a growing body of research addresses various aspects of
   diagnosis, few studies analyze just how it is achieved through
   talk-in-interaction. This paper examines how clinicians assembled a
   diagnosis of a child who was evaluated for autism. Drawing on audio and
   video recordings at a clinic for developmental disabilities, I use a
   combination of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to show how a
   critical fact about the child's mental functioning was formulated,
   challenged, and transformed across three consecutive stages of his
   evaluation: (1) testing, (2) a case conference among clinicians, and (3)
   an informing interview where the diagnosis was delivered to the parents.
   I analyze how this fact emerged as an outcome of clinician-child
   interactions, and how clinicians used storytelling to render its
   diagnostic implications. In addition to examining how these stories are
   methodically produced, I argue that they frame the child's behavior in
   ways that suggest a lack of competence while eliding the skills and
   competencies he may have been displaying.</td>

   a primal phenomenon and an evolutionary process, the strongest argument
   is that it involves a revolutionary set of developments producing a
   dramatically new world of prosumption. While those developments can be
   seen in both the material and digital worlds (although they augment one
   another), they are clearest in the digital world, especially the
   Internet. Among the forces that are creating this new world of
   consumption are new means of prosumption (e.g., IKEA, massive online
   open courses, automated teller machines) which are made possible by a
   variety of new technologies (the computer, the Internet). However,
   overarching these and other changes is the emergence of a new form of
   capitalism, prosumer capitalism. In addition to exploiting often
   low-paid commodified workers, prosumer capitalism increasingly
   prioritizes the exploitation of largely uncommodified prosumers who are
   generally unpaid. Prosumers offer the capitalist many other advantages
   (e.g., no long-term obligations such as high-cost benefit programs).
   There are few, if any, obligations to prosumers with the result that
   they fit well with today's reigning neoliberal philosophy. The new world
   of prosumption could have been a more positive development had it not
   been usurped by capitalist interests.</td>

   the perspective of evolutionary psychology (EP), construed broadly. To
   do so, the article reviews EP's core explanatory strategy and the main
   claims that have been made by proponents of an EP institutional theory,
   focusing on arguments about (1) welfare states and (2) honor cultures
   and the institutions associated with them. On the one hand, the article
   argues, there are both logical and empirical problems with current
   efforts to develop EP theories of these institutional domains. On the
   other hand, sociology's relative absence from the development of such
   theories contributes to these problems, and sociologists can learn from
   EP. Above all, insights drawn from EP may help us to construct better
   accounts of various institutions' micro-foundations. To this end,
   collaboration and exchange between EP scholars and sociologists is
   called for, and some suggestions are made about how this might be done
   most fruitfully.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I discuss the concept of complexity and the burgeoning field of complex
   systems and their relevance to sociology. I begin by comparing and
   contrasting various definitions of complexity and then describe the
   attributes of systems capable of producing complexity: diversity,
   networked interactions, interdependent behavior, and adaptation. Next, I
   survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance
   with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories:
   dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of
   structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that
   incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the
   introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive
   approach to empirical research, and that the benefits of a deeper
   engagement with complexity will be substantial.</td>

   twenty years. In the last ten years, a number of rigorous studies have
   examined the effects of these schools on student achievement and
   educational attainment. Findings reveal mixed results where student
   achievement is concerned (i.e., some positive, some negative, some
   neutral) and positive results in terms of educational attainment (i.e.,
   high school graduation and college attendance). The article places this
   research within a framework that draws on both market and institutional

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The existing evidence linking recessions to individual and population
   health presents a puzzle. Some studies show that people who experience
   the kinds of labor market, housing, and asset shocks that proliferate in
   recessions suffer negative health consequences, whereas other studies
   show that mortality rates fall when the economy worsens. This review
   synthesizes evidence from these distinct research traditions in light of
   emerging findings from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. It traces
   pathways by which macroeconomic changes "get under the skin" and
   generate contradictory aggregate-and individual-level consequences.
   Research on the longer-term health effects of recessions could be
   strengthened by integrating theoretical and analytical approaches from
   sociology. These include a multilevel perspective that considers how
   individuals cope with recessions as members of families and communities
   embedded in different policy environments, and attention to cascades of
   recessionary shocks, individuals' strategies for coping with them, and
   the way these intersect with health trajectories.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>At the close of World War II, "development" began to evolve along two
   paths. On the first path, scholars aimed to generate theoretical
   understandings of social change, especially at the national level
   (development studies). On the second path, policy makers in governments
   and other development-focused organizations initiated actions to promote
   positive social change, especially in poor or war-torn nations
   (development practice). In this article, we review the recent trajectory
   of "development" in sociology, paying close attention to the
   intersections between development studies and development practice.
   Through explicit comparisons to economics and political science, we
   demonstrate how the prominence of development sociology has varied
   historically in relation to its proposed policy prescriptions. We
   conclude by highlighting five uniquely sociological contributions that
   could powerfully improve contemporary interdisciplinary development
   conversations, and by calling for greater sociological attention to the
   complex ways in which a growing transnational field of development
   practitioners is shaping a multiplicity of development outcomes.</td>

   education, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups, is widely
   recognized as pivotal to the United States's long-term economic growth
   and security. In this article, we review and discuss current research on
   STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in
   sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that
   different social factors affect the two major components of STEM
   education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b)
   attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional
   on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological
   characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences
   at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels.
   However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES)
   predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological
   factors are more important influences on participation and achievement
   in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family
   SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally,
   American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic
   resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States
   and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require
   more research, a task that is best accomplished through
   interdisciplinary approaches.</td>

   cultural power," has focused on the social groups and media conditions
   that enable moral panics to emerge, and on the consequences of moral
   panics for the social control systems of societies. In this article I
   turn instead to modeling the specific cultural process of how the
   conditions for a moral panic are turned into an actual moral panic,
   moving the understanding of moral panic away from its Durkheimian
   origins and towards a process-relational cultural sociology. Drawing on
   Roland Barthes' theory of myth and Kenneth Burke's dramatism, the paper
   posits the cultural process of resignification via synecdoche and
   metanarrative as the driver of the disproportion, concern, hostility,
   consensus, and volatility of moral panics. This process can be carefully
   traced in the case of the Salem Witch Trials; a retrospective reading
   reveals the same process at work in the "Mods and Rockers" panic
   analyzed by Stanley Cohen. Beyond moral panics, theorizing
   resignification as a non-exclusive counterpoint to framing and
   ideational embeddedness enriches the theoretical repertoire of cultural
   sociology. "Deep culture" and mythological signification can, using the
   schema proposed here, be understood as practical
   accomplishments-rhetorical responses to particular situations that, when
   performed successfully, legitimate violence and other forms of
   domination.</td>

   Qualitative in-depth interviews with 48 Muslim Americans reveal they

   Because Islam has become synonymous with terrorism, patriarchy,
   misogyny, and anti-American sentiments, when participants were
   identified as Muslims they were treated as if they were a threat to
   American cultural values and national security. Their racialization
   occurred when they experienced de-Americanization, having privileges
   associated with citizenship such as being viewed as a valued member of
   society denied to them. This article highlights the importance of gender
   in the process of racialization. It also demonstrates the need for race
   scholarship to move beyond a black and white paradigm in order to

   important for success; yet, because of declining state support for
   public education, students are taking on extraordinary levels of debt.
   As a result, learning is being pushed aside by vocational and other
   considerations that result from neoliberal policy imperatives. For
   teachers, the decline of the tenure system means fewer full-time faculty
   members to do more work and fewer people who have the protection to

   understood by undergraduate students at University College Dublin. The
   authors use Scott and Lyman's (1968) concept of accounts to explore
   absence sociologically. Drawing on data generated via focus groups, an
   open-ended questionnaire, and an online survey with students, we outline
   the different excuses and justifications for missing classes used by
   students and present their understanding of attendance at classes as an
   optional feature of student life. Individual students' attendance
   differed across courses, throwing doubt on the usefulness of
   individual-level frameworks for understanding attendance. We argue that
   decisions to attend are influenced by a variety of contextual issues,
   including knowledge of legitimate accounts for the setting, pedagogic
   approaches in use, and students' perceptions of the usefulness of
   classes. We conclude that to counter the trend of declining attendance
   and enhance student learning, it is important to better understand how
   both local norms, values, curriculum design, and assessment practices
   combine to facilitate students' absences. Focusing on accounts allows us
   to better understand student absence rather than accepting this as an
   inevitable feature of contemporary student behavior about which nothing
   much can be done.</td>

   students to research firsthand. Utilizing human subject pools (HSPs) in
   class may be a solution. Given that HSPs tend to be used in introduction
   to psychology classes at research institutions, we examine a community
   college HSP to answer three questions: (1) Do community college students
   positively assess the educational value of HSP experience? (2) Can
   sociology students perceive HSP experience to be as educationally
   effective as psychology students? (3) Can online students perceive HSP
   experience to be as educationally effective as in-person students?
   Results indicate that not only did community college students hold
   positive evaluations of their HSP experience, but sociology and online
   students also felt they benefited as much as psychology or in-person
   students. HSPs were also considered particularly effective by students
   taking research methods. HSP participation may be a viable teaching tool
   for sociology instructors at non-research schools.</td>

   "sex-roles" to an approach that stresses interaction and social
   structure. At the same time, there has been a concurrent development in
   the psychological sex-differences and medical literatures toward
   including the biological bases of sex-typed behavior and gender
   identities. In this paper, while we conceptualize gender as a social
   structure, we focus only on the individual level of analysis: testing
   the relative strength of (maternal circulating) prenatal hormones,
   childhood socialization, and the power of expectations attached to adult
   social roles (cultural interactionist) as explanations for women's
   self-reported feminine and masculine selves. Our findings are complex,
   and support some importance of each theory. Prenatal hormones, childhood
   socialization, and cultural interactionism were all influential factors
   for gendered selves. While cultural expectations predicted only feminine
   selves, prenatal hormones were more robust predictors of masculine sense
   of self. While personality may be a relatively stable characteristic
   influenced by the body and childhood socialization, our results
   reinforce the importance of studying how the social world responds to
   and reinforces gendered personality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A recurring theme in the sociology of human rights is the vast
   decoupling that exists between the formal codification of these rights
   in principle and their implementation in practice, fueling much debate
   about the effectiveness of international law. Yet, despite this
   disjuncture, a deeper question remains: given all the barriers that have
   impeded the realization of human rights, why have they become so widely
   institutionalized? Revisiting previous work in this journal, I argue
   that one important component of the expansion of human rights is the
   rise of the universal, egalitarian individual as the primary entity of
   social organization in world society. Additionally, I explore how the
   nature of human rights law itself promotes widespread decoupling that,
   in turn, fuels ongoing efforts to close the gap between principle and
   practice. Indeed, while human rights law envisions an ideal world that
   is practically unrealizable, it inspires a never-ending, global crusade
   to bring about that vision.</td>

   involves the abuse and suffering of other animals (Young 2012), it also
   provides an "identity prop" (Dunning 1999): all male competitive sports

   short-lived, given how easy it is for the truth to escape. This article
   lays the foundations of a sociology of deception, focusing on lies and
   secrets successfully maintained for years or even decades. The ideas of
   Goffman and Simmel provide a theoretical starting point. Then Bernard
   Madoff's Ponzi scheme is considered as a case study. Drawing on that and
   other examples, the article culminates in a theory that distinguishes
   between barriers to knowing, barriers to asking, barriers to telling,
   barriers to perceiving, barriers to believing, and barriers to acting.
   Together, these may counter the natural entropic tendency for
   information to leak and diffuse, in part because the effectiveness of
   one sort of barrier may offset imperfections in others.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Emile Durkheim's ideas on religion have long served as foundational
   blocks for sociological theories. Yet, a mystery remains over where
   Durkheim's insights into religion came from and especially the event
   that opened his eyes to religion's importance in social life. Durkheim
   never supplied details on this conversion, but he did credit Robertson
   Smith for his new understanding. Did Smith really play the key role in
   Durkheim's turn to religion? This essay examines Durkheim's revelation
   in 1895 by starting from a novel anglethe first edition of The Division
   of Labor and his original stage model with the cult of nature as the
   starting point for religion. Tracing the implications of his initial
   choice of naturism as the elementary religion, a choice he would later
   soundly reject as the product of [a] delirious interpretation, offers
   new insights into why Durkheim found Smith's ideas so inspirational. It
   also sheds light on why Durkheim overhauled his theory of solidarity,
   discarding his famous distinction between mechanical and organic
   solidarity. In Robertson Smith's work, Durkheim discovered a more
   inclusive and enduring basis of solidarity in the social universe.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The social model of disability, which defines disability as the product
   of social discrimination rather than the physical, cognitive, or sensory
   differences of individuals, became the dominant logic of the
   international disability field with the 2006 passage of the UN
   Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. As such,
   grassroots disability associations around the world are advocating for
   new rights. These campaigns promote a new identity frame of disabled
   persons as a universally oppressed group. This identity, however, does
   not benefit all groups equally and actually threatens some. Using
   qualitative methods, I compare the usage of the disability identity by
   two grassroots associations in Nicaragua. Ex-Contra soldiers with
   disabilities use the identity to obfuscate their discredited history as
   "traitors" and, instead, represent themselves as unjustly discriminated
   against disabled persons deserving special benefits and human rights
   protections. Ex-Sandinista soldiers with disabilities also make claims,
   but only reluctantly as disabled, preferring to self-identify as war
   wounded. Because of changes in law, however, Ex-Sandinista soldiers are
   increasingly unable to make claims as war heroes, but must instead
   access benefits as persons with disabilities "in general." This case
   demonstrates how actors strategically use the social model of disability
   in relation to local political culture and group identity.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article examines how collective memory narratives about the
   Holocaust and corresponding performances of classroom emotional labor
   and emotion management are used to teach immigrants in Germany the
   normative civic emotion associated with citizenship. In 2005, following
   legal changes which increased naturalization opportunities, Germany
   created a series of nation-wide orientation classes and integration
   projects aimed at preparing foreign residents for membership. This
   research, based on participant observation in orientation classes and
   interviews with integration workers in Frankfurt am Main, shows that
   civic emotion and associated practices of feeling management play a key
   role in citizen-making projects. Although the emotional content of
   citizenship in most countries is largely positive, consisting of
   feelings like national pride and loyalty, German civic emotion is both
   unique and contested. Most integration workers taught migrants a
   distinctly negative form of civic emotion, which combined sadness and
   shame for the Nazi-era with a rejection of national pride. Some
   attempted to negotiate alternative forms of "safe," specifically
   non-national pride, and a minority of subjects argued that it was time
   for Germans to "stop carrying shame" for the Holocaust altogether and
   re-embrace patriotism. Thus, the emphasis that subjects put on teaching
   the "correct" kinds of civic emotion, along with their disputes over
   what those were, show that even the most intimate and invisible aspect
   of belonging, what individuals feel toward their country, can become
   fertile ground for struggles over citizenship and national identity.</td>

   cohesion via the social network they form through their affiliations
   with local clubs, religious institutions, civic groups, and other
   voluntary associations. But few scholars have considered how increasing
   diversity with respect to elites' gender, race, and social class may
   undermine such cohesion. We use primary data from interviews with 312
   elites in a large Midwestern city to construct the network of
   affiliations local elites formed with one another. Results from
   bootstrapping analyses suggest that the most influential elites in the
   sample achieved a disproportionately high level of cohesion by virtue of
   the particular voluntary associations with which they affiliated. Not
   only were the most influential elites more connected to one another
   through multiple redundant associational pathways, but their affiliation
   networks were less segregated by gender, race, and social class than
   were the networks formed by less elite members of the sample.
   Instrumental variables regression analyses further show that the most
   influential elites were especially crucial to increasing cohesion and
   reducing segregation in the overall network. We discuss some of the
   mechanisms through which such integration enhances elites' cohesion and
   power.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Scholars typically suggest that deliberation, defined as communication
   guided by reason-giving and inclusion, works best behind a veil of
   ignorance or when personal differences are bracketed. In this article we
   explore deliberation within ethnically diverse groups. We operationalize
   ethnicity in three ways: as an aspect of individual identity, as an
   identity that is made salient through priming, and as an enactment
   relative to interactions in particular situations. In this way, we can
   explore the applicability of our previous experimental results to
   ethnically diverse groups. We find similar results: within ethnically
   diverse groups, deliberation matters; participants are more likely to
   reconsider their positions when deliberating than when simply talking
   about politics. Ethnicity has no adverse effects on the quality of
   deliberation, indicating that bracketing has no significant impact. On
   the contrary, when conceptualized as a relational enactment, ethnicity
   is correlated with increased levels of reason-giving and inclusion, and
   hence higher quality deliberation. This suggests deliberation works in
   multiethnic groups in much the same way asif not better thanit does in
   homogeneous groups. Deliberation is a robust form of political
   communication that not only helps manage, but also embraces diverse
   subjective experiences as a part of the political process.</td>

   in a blinkbut in the Buduburam Refugee Camp, a predominately Liberian
   refugee camp in Ghana, people experienced calamitous tragedy accumulated
   over years of daily activities. Though they remained politically and
   economically out of place, residents constructed buildings and other
   ordinary material objects to forge a new lived environment. As residents
   engaged with this new lived environmentfrom building homes to managing
   rainwaterthey regularly participated in moral boundary work that helped
   establish how good people ought to act in inhumane circumstances. Moral
   boundary work did not obviate inequality or conflict, but it did help
   mediate between immediate bodily needs and the wider social order. More
   broadly, the study documents the crucial role that seemingly mundane
   material objects play in moral boundary work. Material objects like
   signs, garbage cans, and homes can operate like sociospatial props in
   the stories that people tell about their daily lives. These stories
   reinforce the moral boundaries that divide good and bad people and
   ultimately help make a shared moral order possible.</td>

   construction a sociology of culture and cognition (which is a
   specification of the more general schema a sociology of [X]) is
   symptomatic of a deeply entrenched form of Primitive Classification
   (which I will refer to as the Comtean schema) that governs the way in
   which sociologists conceive of their place in, and engage with other
   denizens of, the social science landscape. I will also argue that while
   this style of disciplinary engagement might have worked in the past when
   it came to dealing with the standard (nineteenth-century) social science
   disciplines and even some late-twentieth-century upstarts, it will not
   work as a way to engage the now-sprawling postdisciplinary field that I
   will refer to as Cognitive Social Science (CSS). The takeaway point is
   that if sociologists want to be part of CSS (and it is in their interest
   to be part of it because this constitutes the future of the behavioral
   sciences), then they will have to give up the Comtean-schematic thought
   style.</td>

   light on concrete social identification practices and placing these
   practices in cultural context. Gay men's autobiographical accounts,
   gathered in 28 in-depth interviews, show consistent use of a long-held
   feature of American culture: a voluntaristic trope of personal striving
   through social attachments. Citing examples from stories about
   friendship, love, role models, city life, identity politics, and
   religion, the analysis shows how gay men frame their life stories using
   a voluntaristic model of identity. The study also provides evidence of
   change over time in the practices through which gay men construct social
   identities. Younger men report greater ease in finding gay role models,
   especially in professional settings, than do older men. Their accounts
   also support the notion that a therapeutic ethos is becoming ever more
   pervasive in American life.</td>

   outside traditional conceptions of regulation and value. Fair trade
   organizations regulate production and distribution processes globally
   and provide the infrastructure for a market in which value lies in a
   product's utility and conditions of production and terms of exchange.
   Fair trade emerged to address persistent economic, social, and
   environmental inequalities between global North and South. But what
   explains the rise of the fair trade market over this time period? Using
   time series regression analysis, I evaluate the claims of several
   theoretical traditions and use world society theory to inform economic
   sociology on understanding how social forces shape global markets. I
   find that only after a shift in world cultural norms do processes of
   unequal exchange become problematized so that moves toward
   liberalization in international trade are countered by movements toward
   regulation.</td>

   Research on physicians' decisions about medical knowledge has focused on
   doctors' personal capabilities and features of the knowledge corpus,
   producing divergent findings. This study asks, instead, How is decision
   making about the use of knowledge influenced by features of work? From
   observations of one team's decisions in multiple clinical and
   administrative contexts, the author argues that making decisions is
   contingent upon temporal features of physicians' tasks. Physicians
   receive feedback at different speeds, and they must account for these
   speeds when judging what they can prioritize. This finding explains
   doctors' perceived uncertainty in other studies as a product of the long
   feedback loop in tasks, and their certainty or pragmatism as a product
   of shorter feedback loops. In these latter scenarios, physicians
   consider and deploy scientific knowledge after-and not before, as is
   usually assumed-determining a fruitful plan of action.</td>

   Blackhawks, to eliminate competition from local peanut vendors. The
   owners benefited from court rulings rejecting the legitimacy of
   government intervention in local markets at the same time that they

   by passing anti-vendor legislation. This story not only offers a case
   study in how teams' monopolistic privilege has extended to concessions
   markets, but also contributes to a broader understanding of how the
   neoliberal state works to minimize risk and maximize profitability for
   large-scale real estate investments like sports arenas. The
   methodological approach is interdisciplinary, drawing on legal and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The recent trend toward health care consumerism is largely the product
   of market practices, which have instilled the notion of health care as a
   product to be purchased by informed, empowered consumers, rather than a
   service bestowed upon a patient by a paternalistic provider. In recent
   years, health care consumerism has been facilitated by
   direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of pharmaceutical products. In
   this paper, we use the case of DTCA for antidepressant medications to
   examine medicalization techniques used to promote consumerism and
   establish and expand the antidepressant market. We used content analysis
   of DTCA from the 1997-2006 issues of a broad sample of women's, men's,
   and common readership magazines to identify techniques of
   medicalization, and we analyzed in-depth interviews with magazine
   readers and antidepressant users to examine how such messages are
   received. Findings are presented within a framework of economic
   sociology, which allowed us to unveil the links between emotions and
   social action that undergird responses to medicalization techniques and
   consumption of advertised products.</td>

   constitutive, and causally effective role in the production and
   sustenance of cultural forms and meanings. It does so through an
   empirical exploration of the Museum of Modern Art of New York (MoMA).
   The article describes the museum as an "objectification machine" that
   endeavors to transform and to stabilize artworks as meaningful "objects"
   that can be exhibited, classified, and circulated. The article explains
   how the extent to which the museum succeeds in this process of
   stabilization ultimately depends on the material properties of artworks
   and, more specially, on whether these behave as "docile" or "unruly"
   objects. Drawing on different empirical examples, the article explores
   how docile and unruly objects shape organizational dynamics within the
   museum and, through them, the wider processes of institutional and
   cultural reproduction. The article uses this empirical example to
   highlight the importance of developing a new "material sensibility" that
   restores heuristic dignity to the material within cultural sociology.</td>

   but less experienced at presenting scientific findings in formats that
   can inform social change work. In this article, I propose a new
   theoretical concept that provides a mechanism by which social science
   research can be more effectively applied for proactive policy,
   organizational, and program development. The approach is to use the
   metaphor of "desire paths" from landscape architecture to show how
   social scientists can identify and analyze social desire paths that
   appear on the social structural landscape. Social desire paths usually
   emerge because existing formal structures do not meet individual or
   group needs. Such paths are generally started at the individual level,
   followed by others through individual actions, and ultimately leave an
   (usually informal) imprint on the social structure, even though the
   motivations behind those actions are not usually social change. Using
   what we know about the sociology of interests and what we have learned
   from trying to apply social science findings to policy, I propose seven
   criteria for phenomena to be defined as social desire paths. I then
   apply the criteria to two case studies related to housing, and discuss
   social desire paths usefulness to social scientists involved in any
   research that captures interests, deviance, or innovation; and that also
   has the potential to inform formal structures such as policy,
   organizations, program development, and participatory democracy.</td>

   methods and a count of ER admission decisions (N = 1,114), this article
   describes the continual rushing and delaying of medical resources to
   patients based on their perceived criminality or actual relationship to
   the criminal justice system. These dynamics develop through four
   processes: (1) widespread administration of pain medication, which
   associates waiting patients with criminal narcotics; (2) deployment of
   criminal stigma along race and gender lines to select some qualified
   patients over others; (3) patrolling of waiting rooms by police; and (4)
   rushing of beds to vast numbers of arrestees, inmates, and witnesses.
   Key to these findings is that if the urban poor happen to be wards of
   the criminal justice system, they receive rushed health care resources,
   but if they enter health care organizations on their own accord they are
   policed, delayed, and deterred from accessing care.</td>

   stop trying to cure severely ill patients and focus on comfort care has
   become an economic as well as a moral issue. This article examines the
   intricate intersection of economics and morality in U. S. hospice care.
   Using historical, interview, and ethnographic methods, I explain the
   resonance between hospice practitioners' moral motivations and
   policymakers', insurers', and providers' efforts to economize near the
   end of life. Drawing on theoretical literature on morality in markets, I
   analyze the moralization of economic scarcity. I argue that rather than
   posing an external financial constraint on the achievement of moral
   goals, scarcity itself can bear moral meanings. In the case of hospice
   care, the view that "less is better" and the wish to save patients from
   over-treatment converge with financial interests to limit spending on
   end-of-life care and imbue financial constraints with positive moral
   meanings.</td>

   the positive effects of these activities on student motivation and use

   cultural perspectives. This in-class active learning exercise makes the
   familiar strange, using Horace Miner's well-known 1956 essay Body Ritual
   among the Nacirema to introduce students to an etic, cultural

   producing a wide variety of interpretations. This activity demonstrates
   that when students overlook or misunderstand cultural meaning, they can
   come to myriad inaccurate depictions and conclusions about social life

   article, the second condition is important because endogenous fashion
   cycles require a critical mass of individuals who seek to differentiate

   I examine both their claims and the genetics literature they cite,

   susceptibility to social influence and yet little is known about the
   nature and consequences of such heterogeneity in specific market
   domains. The present study examines variation in social influence with
   respect to academic research and citation accumulation. Based on
   theories of uncertainty, signaling, and legitimacy, the main hypothesis
   is that disciplinary outsiders are more likely than insiders to cite
   papers that are already highly cited. The empirical analysis, which
   spans six disciplines and 13 flagship journals, is based on over 800
   articles and the 55,000+ citations they accumulate over a 20-year
   period. Each citation received is classified with respect to both its
   timing and the discipline from which it was sent. The results show that
   the effect of prior citation attention is greater for external citation
   accumulation even after controlling for the fact that externals adopt
   later on average than internals. Contrary to intuition, however,
   outsiders do not appear to uniformly exacerbate citation inequality. The
   broader implications of this study for diffusion and the sociology of
   science are discussed in the conclusion.</td>

   'noise', which is chaotic, unfamiliar, and offensive; and 'music', which
   is harmonious, resonant, and divine. These opposing concepts are brought
   together in the phenomenon of Noise Music, but how do practitioners make
   sense of this apparent discordance? Analyses that treat recorded media
   as primary texts declare Noise Music to be a failure, as a genre without
   progress. These paint Noise as a polluted form in an antagonistic
   relationship with traditional music. But while critiques often point to
   indeterminate structure as indicative of the aesthetic project's
   limitations, we claim that indeterminacy itself becomes central to
   meaningful expression when the social context of Noise is considered.
   Through observational and interview data, we consider the contexts,
   audiences, and producers of contemporary American Noise Music.
   Synthesizing the performance theories of Hennion and Alexander, we
   demonstrate how indeterminacy situated in structured interaction allows
   for meaning-making and sustains a musical form based in claims to
   inclusion, access, and creative freedom. We show how interaction, not
   discourse, characterizes the central performance that constructs the
   meaning of Noise.</td>

   at the very beginning of the research process-the selection of the basic
   object of analysis-and yet fieldworkers pay scant attention to this
   crucial task. As a result, most take as their starting point bounded
   entities delimited by location or social classification and in so doing
   restrict the kinds of arguments available to them. This article presents
   the alternative of relational ethnography. Relational ethnography
   involves studying fields rather than places, boundaries rather than
   bounded groups, processes rather than processed people, and cultural
   conflict rather than group culture. While this approach comes with its
   own set of challenges, it offers an ethnographic method that works with
   the relational and processual nature of social reality.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Emile Durkheim summarily rejected Gabriel Tarde's imitation thesis,
   arguing that sociology need only concern itself with social suicide
   rates. Over a century later, a burgeoning body of suicide research has
   challenged Durkheim's claim to a general theory of suicide as 4 decades
   worth of evidence has firmly established that (1) there is a positive
   association between the publicization of celebrity suicides and a spike
   in the aggregate suicide rate, (2) some social environments are
   conducive to epidemic-like outbreaks of suicides, and (3) suicidal ideas
   or behavior spreads to some individuals exposed to a personal role
   model's suicidal behavior-for example, a friend or family member.
   Revisiting Tarde, the article examines why Tarde's theory deserves
   renewed attention, elucidates what he meant by imitation, and then
   formalizes his "laws" into testable theses, while suggesting future
   research questions that would advance the study of suicide, as well as
   other pathologies. Each "law" is elaborated by considering advances in
   contemporary social psychology as well as in light of its ability to
   supplement Durkheim's theory in explaining the "outlier" cases.</td>

   has been written about how dominant gender values shape political
   women's decisions to run for office, how the media portrays women on the

   research on women in politics has too often assumed a monolithic
   standard of femininity, overlooking the ways in which gender values are
   varied and deeply racialized. Drawing from data gathered through 46
   interviews I conducted with women leaders and political activists in
   Texas, I explore the narratives politically active women cultivate to
   account for their decisions whether or not to run for public office. I
   illuminate how these "deciding to run" narratives reflect racialized
   standards of femininity and how these discourses are mediated by the
   political context and by political and activist organizations.</td>

   sustainability initiatives that seek to equalize access to the natural

   Demands on nature that exceed ecological capacities compromise critical
   ecosystem functions that provision the inputs necessary for life. This
   paper draws on concepts and analytical frameworks from the natural,
   physical, and social sciences to assess the drivers of sustainability at
   the global and national level. Integrative theoretical predictions are
   tested in a structural equation model that advances empirical research
   on overshoot and outflows of foreign investments that is relatively
   lacking in the literature. Findings highlight the differential impacts
   of key aspects of economic globalization on both development and
   overshoot across nations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

   interactive associations between the neoliberal departure coincident
   with Ronald Reagan's election and the acceleration in inequality that
   began soon after Reagan took office. We find evidence for this and for a
   second contingent relationship: stronger unions could successfully
   resist policies that enhanced economic inequality only before Reagan's
   presidency and before the neoliberal anti-union administrations from
   both parties that followed Reagan. Politically inspired reductions in
   union membership, and labor's diminished political opportunities during
   and after Reagan's presidency, meant unions no longer could slow the
   growth in U.S. inequality. Coefficients on these two historically
   contingent interactions remain significant after many additional
   determinants are held constant. These findings indicate that political
   determinants should not be neglected when researchers investigate the
   determinants of U.S. inequality.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the most important components of Antonio Gramsci's social theory
   is his discussion of political strategy, particularly his distinction
   between 'war of maneuver' and 'war of position'. For Gramsci, the
   classical model of revolution through military insurrection (war of
   maneuver) has been supplanted within advanced capitalism by a cultural
   struggle of much longer duration and complexity (war of position).
   Despite the significance of Gramsci's analysis of war of maneuver/war of
   position for contemporary Marxism, it is striking that so little
   attention has been paid to these terms. These terms have a history, both
   in military theory and in Marxism, which predates Gramsci's prison
   notebooks. An examination of the military writings of Engels, Lenin and
   Trotsky, which are grounded more directly on military theory, leads to
   different conclusions about the nature of political strategy and the
   relationship between war of maneuver and war of position.</td>

   Against this background, the necessity of critical theory for

   operate along presumably "natural," biological, and essentialized
   binaries of male/female, man/woman,and heterosexual/homosexual. However,
   as the lives and experiences of transgender people and their families

   binaries are called into stark question as they fail to adequately

   queer social actors hold the potential to rattle the very foundations
   upon which normative binaries rest, highlighting the increasingly blurry
   intersections, tensions, and overlaps between sex, gender, and sexual

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article develops a theory of humor and uses it to assess the
   attempt to measure meaning-structures in cultural sociology. To
   understand how humor operates, researchers need to attend to two layers
   of cultural competencies: general typifications and situation-specific
   know-how. These cultural competencies are then invoked in ways that
   define humor as a specific form of experiential frame-the bi-sociation
   of meaning, its condensation, and resonance with experienced tensions in
   the social world. I show the usefulness of this theorization through the
   empirical case of AIDS humor in Malawi, a small country in South-East
   Africa. Using conversational diaries, everyday interactions, and
   newspaper cartoons, I argue both that such humor is widespread and that
   it reveals important facets of life in a country ravaged by the
   pandemic-what it means for the shadow of AIDS to be ever-present.
   Through this case, I then turn back to the question of measurement,
   arguing that although measuring tools may be able to identify
   large-scale semantic shifts, they necessarily miss forms of interaction
   such as humor, that are based on allusion, condensation, and what is
   left unsaid.</td>

   their taste with intuition. A cultural good, symbol, or object is simply
   right and respondents "know it when they see it." This article
   investigates the cultural meanings professional tastemakers see as they
   make such deliberations, while also illustrating the problems
   sociologists have in seeing culture. Using the case of fashion model
   casting and scouting, I present four methods to trace how cultural
   producers recognize and value models' looks in the global fashion
   market, demonstrating how each method results in a different emphasis on
   how culture is used to acquire and deploy aesthetic sense. First,
   interviews capture justifications of aesthetic decisions, as well as
   general processes about day-to-day work routines, which are next tested
   with network analysis, the second method, which emphasizes structural
   arrangements in taste decisions. The third method, ethnography,
   discovers taste as a situated form of knowledge production and
   emphasizes culture in interaction. The fourth and related method,
   observant participation, sees taste as phenomenological as culture
   becomes embodied and tacit consciousness. Each of these methods is an
   optical device that renders a particular and complimentary account of
   taste and affords researchers a certain way to see how culture works.</td>

   the lived experience of individuals. An institutional logic is an
   analytic troika of object, practice, and subject linked together through
   dually ordered systems of articulations. Using the formal method of
   correspondence analysis (MCA) we identify two latent dimensions that
   order physical, verbal, emotional, categorical, and moral practices of
   and investments in love. We take these dimensions as evidence of an
   institutional logic. The dominant first dimension is organized through
   talk of love, non-genital physical intimacies, and affective investment.
   It has no sexual specificity. The subsidiary second dimension is
   organized through moral investment and it has a genital sexual
   specificity. There is little difference between women and men, either in
   the way these dimensions are organized or in the location of men and
   women within these dimensionalized spaces. We find that romantic love
   has a situated material effect in terms of increasing the probabilities

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research and theory at the intersection of cultural sociology and
   network analysis have converged around the notion of cultural holes:
   patterns of cultural choice that position the person as a bridge not
   between other persons but between cultural worlds. This is an approach
   that promises to open up new vistas in our conceptualization of the
   relationship between social position and cultural taste, but that so far
   lacks operational grounding. In this article, I draw on Breiger's (1974)
   formalization of the idea of the duality of persons and groups along
   with classical formalizations of brokerage for sociometric networks
   (Burt 1992) to suggest that the "cultural ego network" of a typical
   survey respondent can be reconstructed from patterns of audience overlap
   among the cultural items that are chosen by each respondent. This leads
   to a formalization of the notion of omnivorousness as relatively low
   levels of clustering in the cultural network: namely, omnivorousness as
   cultural network efficiency. I show how this metric overcomes the
   difficulties that have plagued previous attempts to produce ordinal
   indicators of omnivorousness from simple counts of the number of
   cultural choices, while providing novel substantive (and sometime
   counter-intuitive) insights into the relationship between
   socio-demographic status markers and patterns of cultural choice in the
   contemporary United States.</td>

   investigations of the shared meanings that shape markets, economic
   decisions, and outcomes. A number of social scientists have a)
   privileged the heterogeneity of meanings within organizations and groups
   over monolithic accounts, b) used thick description and single or
   comparative case studies to investigate the incessant contestations over
   meanings and the corresponding actions facilitated, and c) have
   developed empirically testable propositions without insisting on the
   reduction of meanings to simple principles embedded in structures. This
   line of work does not deny that relatively stable cultural meanings
   exist or that parsimony is possible. Instead, it offers a parallel track
   privileging three modes of analysis: 1) the identification of discursive
   inflection points as leading indicators of market takeoffs, privileging
   thick minimalism over parsimony; 2) breached sequence analyses of
   transactions, highlighting experimental methods; and 3) relational
   analyses of networks and contested circuits, tying situated negotiations
   to overarching cultural structures. The article concludes with a plea to
   keep cultural analyses interpretive, historically grounded, and
   intuitively attuned to the meanings of social life.</td>

   projections has been much more fragmentary. In part, this has to do with
   the challenge of measurement; how do you measure something that has not
   happened yet? In this article, I argue that future projections can be
   studied via their externalizations in attitudes, narratives,
   performance, and material forms. They are particularly evident in what I
   call "sites of hyperprojectivity," that is, sites of heightened,
   future-oriented public debate about possible futures. As a pilot
   project, I examine contending narratives about possible futures in the
   online documents of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable
   Development and the accompanying "People's Summit," held in Rio de
   Janeiro in June 2012. I propose a framework for studying how public
   interventions into debates about "sustainable futures" and the "green
   economy" differ on various dimensions of projectivity, including their
   temporal reach, attention to contingency and causality, and network
   mapping of future actors. I present a preliminary analysis at the level
   of narrative and grammar, by analyzing the use of predictive,
   imperative, and subjunctive verb forms in both programmatic and
   oppositional texts. I close with a discussion of how different genres of
   future projection might be put to analytical use in studying processes
   of interest to social scientists, such as coalition formation,
   institution building, political mobilization, and policy change.</td>

   automated analyses of such "big data," they lack the theoretical
   direction necessary to extract meaning from them. Meanwhile, cultural
   sociologists have produced sophisticated theories of the social origins
   of meaning, but lack the methodological capacity to explore them beyond
   micro-levels of analysis. I propose a synthesis of these two fields that
   adjoins conventional qualitative methods and new techniques for
   automated analysis of large amounts of text in iterative fashion. First,
   I explain how automated text extraction methods may be used to map the

   explain how these new tools can be combined with conventional
   qualitative methods to trace the evolution of such cultural elements
   over time. While my assessment of the integration of big data and
   cultural sociology is optimistic, my conclusion highlights several
   challenges in implementing this agenda. These include a lack of
   information about the social context in which texts are produced, the
   construction of reliable coding schemes that can be automated

   sociological imagination. In this article, I describe how the use of
   secrets from a popular website, PostSecret.com, can help teach students
   about the sociological imagination and incorporate biographical examples
   in explanations of broader social trends and sociological concepts. I
   present results from a survey of students in an introductory sociology
   class in order to gauge their response to the use of anonymous secrets.
   Results reveal that over 75 percent of students indicated that
   PostSecret helped them understand the sociological imagination and learn
   sociological concepts, 93 percent of students reported that it helped
   them understand course content through the use of examples, and 69
   percent indicated that it helped them remember important concepts.
   Students also indicated that the discussion of secrets helped them
   recognize their own assumptions about the social world and provided them
   with a perspectives different from their own.</td>

   undergraduate statistics. Data were derived from 185 students enrolled
   in six different sections of a social statistics course taught over a
   seven-year period by the same sociology instructor. The pretest-posttest
   instrument reveals statistically significant gains in knowledge for each
   course section and all sections combined. The results demonstrate that
   pretests can establish students' prior knowledge at the beginning of the
   semester, while posttests measure learning at the end of the course.
   Namely, pretest-posttest knowledge gain was influenced more by the
   content and presentation of the social statistics course than by
   students' statistical ability and/or test-taking skills prior to the
   class. Recommendations on the use of pretest-posttest data to inform
   pedagogy in social statistics are included in the discussion.</td>

   as art and some actors taking 'fine art' positions within it. The
   category of tattoo art is distinct from tattoo because it positions the
   practice away from its traditional historic moorings as a lowbrow craft
   and occupation requiring a rudimentary level of technical skill. In
   contrast, tattoo art is created and evaluated within academic discourses
   and traditional fine art ideologies that stress innovation, creativity,
   and exclusivity. In addition to mastery of the medium, that is, applying
   the tattoo to skin, tattoo artists create original works that qualify as
   artistic by art world conventions. This process of artification has
   changed the symbolic meanings and valuation of a practice, imbuing
   tattoo art with cultural legitimacy from the inside.</td>

   average network position of resident firms in two industries with
   ideal-typical forms of network governance-garments and transportation
   equipment. Analytical results suggest that manufacturing specialization
   varies by network position in both industries, even when controlling for
   time-invariant country-specific organizational unobservables and
   conventional thinking on international specialization. Moreover, these
   networks matter only during the period after which the two types of
   governance are alleged to have become the predominant organizational
   logic of the two industries, and are more important for manufacturing
   specialization in the transport-equipment industry. The article
   concludes by implicating these findings in discussions of the

   pressure on natural resources that stems from production, consumption,
   and the resultant disposal of waste. We use structural equation modeling
   techniques to test an integrative perspective based on direct and
   indirect effects, taken from human ecology, ecological economics,
   modernization, and political economy approaches, as well as from the
   natural sciences. We find evidence for the conjuncture of many of the
   theories investigated and for contextualizing the footprint in a global
   network of causes. The model raises questions about conclusions reached
   in prior analyses based on direct effects only. The significant roles
   played by natural and economic forces suggest a need to attend to
   multidisciplinary dynamics. With the exception of " weak
   sustainability," the indirect and direct impacts suggest ever-escalating
   levels of the footprints of nations.</td>

   to tie them to the politicized boundaries and related spaces of tensions

   issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible
   theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He
   also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of
   social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative
   concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no
   mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his
   variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a
   computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of
   Collins's theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an
   agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With
   greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my
   alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory
   development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not
   found in Collins's model.</td>

   arrangements in which sonic qualities emerge for interpretation. The

   ethnography against interviewing, this paper offers a defense of the
   latter and argues for methodological pluralism and pragmatism and
   against methodological tribalism. Drawing on our own work and on other
   sources, we discuss some of the strengths and weaknesses of
   interviewing. We argue that concern over whether attitudes correspond to
   behavior is an overly narrow and misguided question. Instead we offer
   that we should instead consider what interviewing and other data
   gathering techniques are best suited for. In our own work, we suggest,
   we have used somewhat unusual interviewing techniques to reveal how
   institutional systems and the construction of social categories,
   boundaries, and status hierarchies organize social experience. We also
   point to new methodological challenges, particularly concerning the
   incorporation of historical and institutional dimensions into
   interview-based studies. We finally describe fruitful directions for
   future research, which may result in methodological advances while
   bringing together the strengths of various data collection techniques.</td>

   Business schools currently expound this belief in their 'principles of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This essay examines the role played by Soviet sociology in the USSR's
   transition to capitalism. It analyzes the discipline's contribution to
   the critique of Soviet socio-economic life during the 1980s, identifying
   the emergence of two divergent viewpoints within Soviet sociology over
   the relationship between inequality, the market, and the goals of a
   socialist society. The essay explores how these viewpoints intersected
   with the implementation of economic reforms by the Gorbachev regime,
   arguing that the dominant forces within Soviet sociology ultimately
   helped the party-state bureaucracy craft the legitimizing ideology of
   perestroika by insisting that growing social inequality and market-based
   mechanisms of distribution were the very embodiment of socialism. After
   enduring a politically fraught and semi-pariah existence for much of its
   history, Soviet sociology enjoyed a belle epoque as it helped the ruling
   elite navigate the transition to capitalism.</td>

   American university in the wake of the current economic downturn.
   Considering the transformative nature of knowledge production in the
   United States, we introduce the concept of intellectual closure in
   illustration of the unintended outcomes of individual decisions and
   career trajectories as they operate under the forces of social closure.
   Intellectual closure is defined as subtle and hidden forms of constraint
   on individual agency. Intellectual closure includes calculative thinking
   about how to publish in flagship journals, avoidance of high-risk
   projects, and preference for short-term projects with more immediate
   rewards. Structural constraints, specifically within sociology, are
   enabling the emergence of narrower perspectives and eroding former
   professional norms as individual decisions aggregate, unintentionally,
   to constitute a more competitive discipline with narrower definitions of
   productivity and quality.</td>

   tradition against the other. The analysis shows some strong antagonisms,
   many instances of close analysis and critique of each other's
   perspectives, and a number of friendly and supportive relationships
   between anarchists and sociologists. Anarchists tended to admire the
   intellectual rigor of sociologists, but thought sociologists were
   insiders - mere reformers at best, reactionaries at worst - content to
   study society, but rarely to act for its improvement. Sociologists
   viewed anarchists with an even wider range of opinion, including
   considering them principled and admirable revolutionaries, slightly
   naive utopians, or criminals and chaos-lovers bent on the destruction of
   social order. These factors contributed to the exclusion of anarchist
   ideas and anarchists themselves from the sociological canon.</td>

   complexity and diversity of real world markets, but many network models
   of economic social structure ignore this feature and rely instead on
   stylized one-dimensional characterizations. Here, the authors return to
   the basic insight of structural diversity in economic sociology. Using
   the Indian interorganizational ownership network as their case, they
   discover a composite-or "hybrid"-model of economic networks that
   combines elements of prior stylized models. The network contains a
   disconnected periphery conforming closely to a "transactional" model; a
   semiperiphery characterized by small, dense clusters with sporadic
   links, as predicted in "small world" models; and finally a nested core
   composed of clusters connected via multiple independent paths. The
   authors then show how a firm's position within the mesolevel structure
   is associated with demographic features such as age and industry and
   differences in the extent to which firms engage in multiplex and
   high-value exchanges.</td>

   what people say is often a poor predictor of what they do. We argue that
   many interview and survey researchers routinely conflate self-reports
   with behavior and assume a consistency between attitudes and action. We
   call this erroneous inference of situated behavior from verbal accounts
   the attitudinal fallacy. Though interviewing and ethnography are often
   lumped together as "qualitative methods," by juxtaposing studies of
   "culture in action" based on verbal accounts with ethnographic
   investigations, we show that the latter routinely attempts to explain
   the "attitude-behavior problem" while the former regularly ignores it.
   Because meaning and action are collectively negotiated and
   context-dependent, we contend that self-reports of attitudes and
   behaviors are of limited value in explaining what people actually do
   because they are overly individualistic and abstracted from lived
   experience.</td>

   and to deal primarily with monetary compensation for disadvantaged
   groups. In such proceedings, aggrieved claimants are likely to make a
   variety of claims about the use of money to represent their experience,
   ranging from demands for increased compensation to rejections of the
   entire process altogether. This article draws attention to the
   communicative functions of money in the reparation process. It claims
   that actors may grudgingly agree to attach a monetary value to what they
   hold sacred, but simultaneously strive to preserve their sense of
   self-worth and to elicit identification by raising moral critiques about
   the use of fiscal logic. To exemplify, the article focuses on the 2005
   removal of Jewish-Israeli settlers from Israeli-occupied territories. It
   shows that settlers indeed demanded to be compensated fiscally for their
   lost property. At the same time, it shows that they raised objections to
   the use of fiscal logic in representing their experience and offered
   alternate logics of evaluation. The settlers resisted shame and
   devaluation through such competing logics, demanding that the state
   reaffirm a positive and embracing relationship with them despite its
   decision to evict them.</td>

   affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many
   studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community
   service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating
   sociological content into community service classes. The authors
   supplemented a community service course at a large public university
   with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest
   that this integration increased student understanding of the social
   structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served,
   sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and
   discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation
   of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and
   facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of
   populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We
   argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across
   college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide
   beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.</td>

   within the social construction of gender norms, the sexualization of

   societal levels of social interaction. Nevertheless, this important
   issue remains under-explored in the sociology of teaching and learning.
   This article reports on a pedagogical module that utilizes a multimedia
   presentation to define and illustrate the sexualization of girls and
   women. Lesson impacts were assessed through an online survey. Results
   indicate a critical gap between the social importance of this topic and
   educational exposure. Students unanimously recommended this module be
   taught in introductory sociology courses and offered specific examples
   of individual and interpersonal impacts. Our findings suggest an ongoing
   need to address the sexualization of girls and women inside, and
   outside, of the classroom.</td>

   at the University of Alabama in which stigma reduction was assessed as a
   primary objective. The syllabus involved theory-based instruction, class
   visits, service learning, and student research on community attitudes
   toward HIV/AIDS. We report on how stigma affected the service learning
   and other elements of the course, calling for adjustments to our
   pedagogical approach. We also report how the course was evaluated in a
   pretest/posttest assessment on attitudes toward people living with
   HIV/AIDS [PLWHA] (enacted stigma) and hypothetical reactions to being
   diagnosed with HIV (felt stigma). The results indicated greater
   tolerance for PLWHA following the class but also greater awareness of
   HIV stigma and its outcomes. We offer recommendations to help
   instructors avoid stigma-related materials and events that could
   jeopardize service learning and course objectives for sensitive topics

   the approach that is taken is critically important to academia in terms
   of its potential to provide a direct response and challenge to the
   intrinsic Eurocentric and Orientalist bias of the US educational system.
   Unlike other area and ethnic studies disciplines, this field was
   established as a link between the community and academia. However, in
   recent history, approaches have become polarized and the field has lost
   momentum as a consequence of arbitrary boundaries and politicized
   knowledge. In this article, the Orientalist perspective and Afro-centric
   knowledge in Black Studies are examined in their historical and
   political context. This analysis culminates in a proposed approach to
   use the Sociology of Africa as a new model for Afro-centric knowledge
   and teaching in this field.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>'Africana Sociology' begins with a reappraisal of the 'image of Africa'
   in the form of sociology's theoretical narrative about modernity's
   spatial and temporal order. Early sociologists, like Auguste Comte and
   Lester Ward, conceived sociology as a secular discourse, although it
   transmitted Protestant values that reduced people of African descent to
   fetish objects. In the work of Charles H. Long, the 'image of Africa'
   appears in the African American religious imagination because it - more
   than the land in which Blacks were enslaved - authenticated their
   origins. In my appropriation of the concept, it is a semiotic device
   that, through its dialectical relationship with the 'image of
   involuntary presence', structures sociology's narrative form. Like in
   the work of W. E.B. Du Bois, the image of Africa designates the American
   nation as a site of crisis, while imbuing Black subjectivity with a
   wider consciousness of modernity.</td>

   potential to support these efforts by incorporating key conceptual
   models and constructs from Black Sociology, Afrocentricity, and
   Transdisciplinary Applied Social Justice (TASJ (c)). Africana Sociology
   should recognize the role of intersectionality and socially-constructed
   and intertwined race, class, and gender identities; it should
   acknowledge the importance of African-centered thought, including the
   role of Ma'at; and it should reflect a commitment to praxis -using
   theory to transform social institutions and thus, social outcomes. With
   this conceptual foundation, Africana Sociology can serve as a
   theoretical, methodological, and practical approach for implementing
   transformative change in the experiences of African Americans, and
   African American women, in particular.</td>

   sociological approach to examine Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual,
   transgender, queer, and intersexed identities and performances. While
   sociologists using the most progressive approaches outline the Western
   hegemonic nature of Africana peoples' perceptions of gender and
   sexuality, neither approach allows sociologists to view the relationship
   between social formations, human consciousness, and cosmological
   patterns. African-centered social scientists and social theorists
   typically determine that Africana lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
   queer, and intersexed identities and performances are outside of
   Africana humanity. Within this essay, the author relies upon the Kemetic
   Anunian cosmology and personality constructs as sources through which to
   develop an African-centered framework to explain the multiple
   expressions of Africana gender and sexuality. This model considers that
   one's gender and sexuality are contained within and inseparable from
   one's higher-self that animates one's existence. This work, then, opens
   the door for further theory development and praxis in the emerging field
   of African-centered sociology and African-centered gender and sexuality
   studies within the discipline of Africana studies.</td>

   Studies, including African-centered psychology, history, and literature.
   However, to date the articulation of an African-centered sociology,

   neither has it occurred for African-centered sociology as a
   sub-discipline of Africana Studies, a sub-discipline of traditional
   sociology, or as a stand-alone discipline, itself. After a review of the
   worldview concept and framework and an analysis of the intellectual
   history of Black Sociology, this article then discusses the possibility
   of an African-centered sociology contingent upon the usage of an African
   worldview as the conceptual framework. Finally, the impacts of an
   African-centered epistemology and African-centered social theory are
   considered for the future of African-centered sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the 1860s and 1870s, the feudal monarchy of the Tokugawa shogunate,
   which had ruled Japan for over two centuries, was overthrown, and the
   entire political order it had commanded was dismantled. This immense
   political transformation, comparable in its results to the great social
   revolutions of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries in the West,
   was distinctive for lacking a major role for mass political
   mobilization. Since popular political action was decisive elsewhere for
   both providing the force for social revolutions to defeat old regimes
   and for pushing revolutionary leaders to more radical policies, the
   Meiji Restoration's combination of revolutionary outcomes with
   conservative personnel and means is puzzling. This article argues that
   previous accounts fail to explain why a group of relatively low-status
   samurai-administrative functionaries with some hereditary political
   privileges but in fact little secure power within the old regime-was
   able to overcome far more deeply entrenched political actors. To explain
   this, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between two political
   processes: the long-standing political relations of feudal monarchy and
   magnate lords and the unprecedented emergence of independent samurai
   political action and organizations cutting across domain boundaries. It
   was the interaction of these two processes that produced the overthrow
   of the Tokugawa and enabled the revolutionary outcomes that followed it.
   This article's revised explanation of the Meiji Restoration clearly
   places it within the same theoretical parameters as the major
   revolutions of the seventeenth century and later.</td>

   their membership in salient social categories that are themselves status
   valued. In this article, the author explicitly theorizes and measure the
   concept of categorical status among organizations and test whether it
   influences the evaluation of organizational actions. More concretely,
   she develops a measure of industry status and test whether it affects
   the market reaction to U. S. firms announcing earnings restatements
   between 2000 and 2009. Results of the empirical analyses indicate that
   investors react less negatively to earnings restatements announced by

   and social psychological literatures to demonstrate how people construct
   their own civil purity and become pure. It uses in-depth interview data
   to uncover a language of civil purity that people draw on to construct
   their own belonging in civil society. It argues that some people create
   an imagined public-at-large that they infuse with polluting qualities
   associated with the binary cultural codes of civil society. This image
   functions as a mental heuristic, against which people compare themselves
   and see themselves as better than' on a number of moral values
   associated with civil society. This process of constructing civil purity
   is linked to one of the civil sphere's two fundamental social
   institutions, namely communication. As a form of nonfiction media with
   record lows in trust and credibility, the mainstream news serves as a
   social topic through which we can witness the construction of civil
   purity.</td>

   alternatives to sociology-as-usual. Sociologists with even fleeting
   awareness of the recent history of political sociology are surely
   familiar with the cultural turn, the global turn, and the turn toward
   complexity; however, another turn seems to be afoot, one toward
   existential concerns that direct us to recover how people experience the
   complex contradictions of the social and political world' (Taylor, The
   New Political Sociology, p. 197). Complex experiences often leave behind
   residues or traces,' and contributors in a recently edited volume
   challenge sociologists to unlock the social significance of these traces
   and find new ways to capture what our methods capture so poorly, namely,
   popular forgettings, geographies of exclusion, and the slow erasure of
   deeds, memories, and other subjugated knowledges belonging to
   individuals who find themselves dismissed, dispelled, or disenfranchised
   by nation-states. Traces left behind by individuals navigating the
   complexities of contemporary experiments in human being' are just the
   sort of analysis that must, in principle, place the actor at the center
   of analysis, and, after careful study, we now appreciate that despite
   the analytical ease of assuming that actors are singular, sociologists
   should examine actors as plural and unearth their essential
   multiplicity.</td>

   the public intellectual in modern life, while academics continue to
   express the desire to "make a difference" by producing research that
   contributes to the amelioration of social problems. In this context,
   this article draws on basic and applied research on transgender
   prisoners in California as a case study to address larger questions
   about the pursuit of knowledge, the creation of policy, the prompting of
   praxis, and the promise of justice. The empirical research on
   transgender prisoners in prisons for men presented in this article
   begins with a decidedly specific policy question (how to keep
   transgender prisoners safe from sexual assault in prison) and ends with
   basic research that interrogates the social organization and workings of
   gender (how is gender accomplished among transgender prisoners in
   prisons for men). Reviewing this research and presenting a few
   instructive digressions referred to as "sidebars" leads to two
   conclusions: (1) The line between basic and policy work cannot be
   effectively erased (nor should it be), and (2) basic and applied
   research can be treated as productively interdependent (i.e., take us to
   new research paths and generate new insights). By operating
   side-by-side, basic and policy research can provide us with general and
   particularistic understandings of social processes and structures that
   ultimately help us make a difference in the lives of those who suffer
   the most from systems of inequality, in this case transgender women
   subject to state authority.</td>

   are rarely seen, much less systematically studied by sport sociologists.
   Our survey of the past decade of three major sport sociology journals
   illustrates a dearth of scholarly research on children and sport. While
   noting the few exceptions, we observe that sport studies scholars have
   placed a disproportionate amount of emphasis on studying sport media,
   and elite amateur, college, and professional athletes and sport
   organizations, while largely conceding the terrain of children's sports
   to journalists and to a handful of scholars whose work is not grounded
   in sport sociology. We probe this paradox, speculating why sport
   scholars focus so little on such a large and important object of study
   in sport studies. We end by outlining a handful of important scholarly
   questions for sport scholars, focusing especially on key questions in
   the burgeoning sociological and interdisciplinary fields of children and
   youth, bodies and health, and intersectional analyses of social
   inequality.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Scholars largely assume that hog production is following the same
   industrialization process as the integrated poultry industry. Since the
   collapse of hog farming in the 1990s, academics have anticipated that
   producers will eventually become trapped in contracts that leave the
   integrator with full control over the production process. Embedded in
   this prediction is an assumption that hog farmers respond to these
   productive pressures individually. Our analysis of the Carthage
   Management System suggests a different path for the hog commodity chain.
   The Carthage Management System is a conglomeration of business
   management firms that bring finishing hog farmers together to form
   limited liability corporations (LLCs) in the breed-to-wean stage of hog
   production. We use a sociology of agrifood framework to suggest that the
   nuances of hog production encourage the use of what we call folding
   corporations to limit liability in ways that profoundly transform the
   family farm. Corporations and individual hog farmers alike employ this
   creative LLC structure to deflect responsibility for the risks of hog
   production. We identify how folding corporations externalize the costs
   of production onto rural communities. Additional research is needed to
   better understand unfolding farmer identities, legal protections for
   farmers, how widespread organizational structures like Carthage
   Management System are, and their consequences for rural communities and
   the industrialization process.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists of (e)valuation have devoted considerable attention to
   understanding differences in evaluative practices across a number of
   fields. Yet, little is understood about how individuals learn about and
   navigate multivalent valid group styles within a single setting. As a
   social phenomenon, many accept how central processes of evaluation are
   to everyday life. Accordingly, scholars have attempted to link research
   on evaluation to processes of inequality. Nevertheless, the sociology of
   evaluation only has tenuous, often implicit connections to literature on
   inequality and disadvantage. This article addresses these two gaps.
   Drawing on over two-hundred hours of ethnographic fieldwork in an urban
   high school debate league, twenty-seven semi-structured interviews with
   league judges, and archival data, we illustrate how high school policy
   debate judges employ evaluative frames and link them to the
   implementation of evaluative practices in a disadvantaged setting. We
   show that the cultural meanings that emerge within the evaluation
   process-in this case, urban uplift and competition-stem from the
   conflicted context in which evaluation is occurring. We also make a
   first step toward applying the conceptual tools within the sociology of
   evaluation to a disadvantaged setting, and more broadly, suggest that
   micro-processes of evaluation are important to the study of urban
   inequality.</td>

   differential access to informants and the scenes that they populate in
   three sites-can reveal substantive findings. In the case it features, a
   comparative study of small cities with growing populations of lesbian
   couples, actors' disparate and place-specific sexual identities produced
   disparate and place-specific responses to research. Integrationist
   sexual identities impeded access, whereas identity-politics orientations
   facilitated it. The paper identifies three mechanisms via which sexual
   identities influenced access: directly, by shaping informants'
   orientations to the research topic, and, indirectly, by influencing
   local networks and institutions that emerge from and reinforce local
   identities. By explicating one ethnographer's path from methodological
   trouble to substantive insight, the article traces the utility of an
   expansive and flexible reflexivity that begins with but extends beyond
   the researcher's identity and role. This reflexivity, the article
   proposes, encourages identification of substantive findings and the
   development of social theory, and can advance a comparative sociology of
   ethnographic access.</td>

   Drawing on organizational sociology, a model of school board social
   capital is proposed that treats brokerage (external ties) and closure
   (internal ties) as the key dimensions of board functioning. The model
   brings together insights from limited research on school boards
   concerning members' internal and external ties and recasts them as the
   building blocks of a unifying theoretical framework. It also proposes
   specific performance outcomes at the district level. The model is tested
   using the data from a representative sample of Pennsylvania districts.
   The analysis not only explores brokerage and closure patterns among
   school boards, but also examines their implications for academic
   outcomes. Findings suggest that eighth grade reading and mathematics
   performance are highest in districts, where boards exhibit high levels
   of both brokerage and closure, and lowest in districts, where brokerage
   and closure are both low.</td>

   Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in practice. This
   article introduces a purely graphical way of characterizing endogenous
   selection bias and of understanding its consequences (Hernan et al.
   2004). We use causal graphs (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to
   highlight that endogenous selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g.,
   controlling, stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider
   variable, i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
   one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another that is
   (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection bias can
   result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable, a post-outcome
   variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a pre-treatment variable.
   We highlight the difference between endogenous selection bias,
   common-cause confounding, and overcontrol bias and discuss numerous
   examples from social stratification, cultural sociology, social network
   analysis, political sociology, social demography, and the sociology of
   education.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists are adding specific disciplinary accents to the burgeoning
   literature in colonial, imperial, and postcolonial studies. They have
   been especially keen to add explanatory accounts to the historical
   literature on empires. Starting in the 1950s, sociologists pioneered the
   study of colonies as historical formations. Against traditional
   anthropological approaches, sociologists insisted on studying colonizer
   and colonized in their dynamic interactions, asking how both groups were
   being transformed. Like contemporary postcolonial scholars, sociologists
   began asking in the 1950s how metropoles were being remade by overseas
   colonialism and colonial immigration. Echoing discussions in the 1950s
   among sociologists working in the colonies, current discussions of
   postcolonial sociology question the applicability of Western social
   scientific concepts and theories to the global South and ask how
   sociology itself has been shaped by empire. Current sociological
   research on empires focuses on six sets of causal mechanisms: (1)
   capitalism; (2) geopolitics, war, and violence; (3) cultural
   representations and subjectivity; (4) resistance and collaboration by
   the colonized; (5) institutional dimensions of empires and colonies; and
   (6) conflict and compromise among colonizers at the heart of colonial
   states.</td>

   the circumstances under which individuals (versus organizations) own
   these relationships (and therefore also the social capital generated by
   them). Three factors increase the odds of individual ownership: (a) the
   extent to which the resources valued by alters belong to the individual
   (rather than the organization), (b) the degree to which alters feel
   greater indebtedness to the individual than to the organization, and (c)
   the extent to which relationships involve emotional attachment. We
   discuss the implications of the locus of ownership, argue that these
   distinctions can help explain many results that appear inconsistent on

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The classical sociology of parties was born alongside parties
   themselves. It explored their dynamic interrelationships with states and
   society, as well as the tensions inherent in the fact that parties are
   simultaneously representatives and power seekers. Despite these rich
   foundations, from the 1960s the sociological approach came to be
   narrowly identified with a one-dimensional conception of parties, and
   political sociologists focused their attention elsewhere. This review
   contributes to efforts that began in the 1990s to reclaim the political
   party as a full-fledged sociological object. To this end, we track the
   hourglass-shaped trajectory of the sociology of parties: from broad
   Marxian and Weberian roots, to narrowing and near-eclipse after the
   1960s, to a reemergence that reclaims the breadth of the classical
   traditions. We conclude by suggesting six lines of inquiry that we
   believe would be fruitful, emphasizing both classical concerns that
   deserve more attention and innovative approaches that point in novel
   directions.</td>

   specifically examine contributions to the study of taxation that
   illuminate core issues in the sociology of contemporary capitalism,
   including the causes of poverty and inequality in rich countries and of
   inequality between rich and poor countries. Research on developed
   countries suggests that tax policy changes are important for explaining
   rising income inequality, tax policies may structure durable
   inequalities of race and gender, and earnings-conditional tax subsidies
   may alleviate poverty more effectively and with less stigma than
   means-tested social spending. Scholars also find the most generous
   welfare states rely the most heavily on regressive taxes, although there
   is disagreement over how this association arises. Comparative research
   on developing countries shows consumption taxes are more conducive to
   growth than taxes on income, tax-financed spending benefits growth if it
   is spent on productive investments, and taxation strengthened democracy
   and state building in medieval and early modern Europe. However, there
   is disagreement as to whether taxation contributes to state building in
   contemporary developing countries and whether foreign aid undermines
   democracy by undermining taxation. These questions are the focus of
   considerable current research.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This review focuses on three topics that have dominated the sociological
   literature on HIV/AIDS in the United States: (a) the demographics of the
   epidemic and the dynamics of structural-, neighborhood-, and
   individual-level risk; (b) the lived experiences of HIV-positive people;
   and (c) the collective response to HIV/AIDS through community-based
   services, political activism and social movements, and public policy.
   Sociologists have pursued inquiry in all of these areas and have often
   advanced the implicit and explicit use of approaches that reveal the
   epidemic's embedded power relations. Previous research and the dynamics
   of the epidemic suggest a fundamental argument: HIV/AIDS is an epidemic
   of intersectional inequality that is fueled by racial, gender, class,
   and sexual inequities at the macro-structural, meso-institutional, and
   micro-interpersonal levels. These inequalities significantly shape the
   likelihood of exposure to the virus; the realities of living with the
   infection; and medical, programmatic, political, and social-scientific
   responses.</td>

   and social structure are mutually constitutive. This article reviews the
   ways cities have reflected and reinforced gender relations in the United
   States from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. First, I
   discuss ways in which women in industrial cities challenged the ideology
   of separate spheres. Next, I suggest that the post-World War II city was
   shaped by an era of high patriarchy similar to the architectural high
   modernism of the same era, and in the third section, I explore how that
   urban structure limited women's opportunities outside the home. In the
   fourth part, I examine changes in the concept of gender as it expanded
   beyond masculine and feminine categories to include lesbians, gays, and
   transgender individuals. The article ends with a review of how women's
   and gay rights movements, gentrification, and planning practices have
   shaped a more gender-neutral contemporary metropolis.</td>

   participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use
   color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads
   (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind
   discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric
   of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees
   forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This
   neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance,
   which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby
   participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While
   color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white
   and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to
   include nonwhite immigrants.</td>

   century'. Because America has returned to 1910 segregation levels, it
   has allegedly achieved transcendence over racism. After all, the authors
   note, government no longer endorses housing discrimination, all-white
   neighborhoods are extinct, and white racial attitudes have liberalized.
   Despite the proclamation, many questions regarding segregation remain
   unanswered by Glaeser and Vigdor. Namely, how can segregation be
   conceptualized and its measurement improved, what might alternative
   methods for analyzing it yield, and why does it matter in the first
   place? To prompt an overdue substantive and methodological discussion,
   we undertake a case study analysis of Cook County, Illinois to address
   these questions. Our analytic goal is to illuminate how segregation is a
   much more complex matter than many analyses reflect, and when this is
   taken into account, it becomes readily apparent that any assertions of
   racial transcendence are quite premature.</td>

   the tensions inherent in the requirements of sociology as an industry.
   Short production timelines, high expected output, and classical notions
   of objectivity continue to organize sociological inquiry, even as
   critical sociologists continue to question these very relations of
   ruling. This essay contributes to ongoing critical analyses of
   sociology's disciplinary paradigm and offers a consideration of the
   interstitial spaces potentially produced by 'slow sociology' as one
   possible antidote to these limitations. Productive of a borderlands
   epistemology, slow sociology resists the ruling relations of sociology
   and encourages nuanced translation work between cultures of study,
   cultures of habitation, and cultures of disciplined inquiry, fostering
   links between public society and academic endeavors.</td>

   involves trust that others will act in good faith. Inherent to
   situations concerning collective goods is the problem of the free rider
   that plagues collective action: the individual who maximizes their
   short-term interests at the cost of the greater good. Prior research in
   environmental sociology has identified various social structural factors
   predicting pro-environmental behavior and concern, while research on
   social dilemmas has explored the role of trust in determining
   cooperation in situations regarding collective goods. This research
   draws upon these areas of scholarship to examine the interaction between
   free rider fears with education, income, and ideology in determining the
   willingness of Americans to sacrifice individual interest for
   environmental protection through an analysis of 2010 General Social
   Survey data. Findings help differentiate the engagement of
   pro-environmental behavior from general environmental concern, with the
   fear of free riders particularly impacting the highly educated and

   of graduate instructors, drawing on interview and focus group data from
   35 sociology students in a doctoral program at a large university in the
   United States. Results indicate the majority of graduate instructors
   felt a great deal of anxiety due to challenges they faced when teaching
   their own course for the first time: challenges such as feelings of
   unpreparedness, constant and unremitting time demands, problems with
   students, a lack of confidence, and insufficient support. Instructors
   employed a number of informal strategies in attempts to mediate the
   personal and professional impact of these challenges. Strategies
   included adjusting expectations, making sacrifices, becoming savvy, and
   creating informal peer networks that provided social support and
   increased access to resources. Findings indicate the need for
   institutional-level changes, including how graduate student teaching is
   viewed within the discipline and the ways graduate instructors are
   supported and prepared to teach. This article concludes with specific
   recommendations for graduate programs and sociology departments of

   programs is common, but these evaluations are typically limited to
   measures of student satisfaction. Two forms of assessment commonly used
   in elementary and secondary teacher training programs, measuring levels
   of teaching anxiety and teacher efficacy, may be of use for sociology
   programs interested in formally evaluating the effect of teaching
   seminars. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the effects of
   a newly established teaching seminar using the Teaching Anxiety Scale
   and a Teaching Confidence Scale. Findings from pre- and posttest data
   show that the seminar lowered graduate students' feelings of anxiety
   about teaching for the first time and increased their levels of
   confidence regarding mastery of common pedagogical skills. Qualitative
   feedback from evaluations further illustrates the positive effects of
   the seminar on students' senses of themselves as teachers and their
   knowledge of effective teaching practices.</td>

   Quantitative data indicate that although PFF participants were not

   peers, the PFF program did appear to help to make participants feel more
   competent in their first jobs.</td>

   incorporating teaching and learning into the curriculum: integrating
   pedagogy into substantive seminars. Teaching-infused graduate seminars
   are a great way to transmit norms, values, and common practices of the
   department to graduate students, and they allow for discussions of
   particular substantive challenges that graduate student instructors may
   face when teaching undergraduates about privilege, inequality,
   discrimination, and social structure. I describe my approach and present
   qualitative evaluations of this approach from two semesters of graduate
   students who have taken one of these seminars.</td>

   This five-step method provides a plan of action for faculty and graduate
   students who wish to co-develop a course in such a way that graduate
   student mentees are exposed to the entire teaching process with the
   supervision and assistance of a faculty mentor. This relationship moves
   beyond the traditional professor/teaching assistant hierarchy (the TA

   of a sociology course on happiness as an exemplar of how to better

   of secularization and religious change in Europe and America. Building
   on (1) supply-side,' (2) neo-orthodox secularization, and (3)
   historicist schools, the authors develop a synthetic explanatory
   framework which emphasizes changed conditions of religious belonging
   amid the transition to modernity. Modernization, they suggest, disrupted
   older, parochialized forms of religious community which emerged in the
   Middle Ages. The authors describe the rise and diffusion of newer,
   de-parochialized forms of religious belonging and organization in the
   18th and 19th centuries and stress their comparative compatibility with
   modernity; here the authors draw special attention to the impact of
   missionary organizational schemas derived in colonial environments and
   re-purposed for domestic evangelism. They argue that mass unchurching
   was positively related to the persistence of parochialism and negatively
   related to the spread of post-parochialism. The salient comparison is
   therefore not merely between Western Europe and the US, but rather
   between national cases in which de-parochialization accompanied
   political and economic modernization and those in which it did not.</td>

   axis of meaningful difference as race, gender, or class, and yet the
   impact of this understanding has not permeated the discipline of
   sociology as a whole. This is one particularly stark example of the
   central argument of this article: despite decades of empirical and
   theoretical work by scholars in "the social studies of childhood,"
   sociologists in general have not incorporated the central contributions
   of this subfield: that children are active social agents (not passive),
   knowing actors strategizing within their constraints (not innocent),
   with their capacities and challenges shaped by their contexts (not
   universally the same). I contend that mainstream sociology's relative
   imperviousness has led to theoretical costs for both childhood
   scholars-who must re-assert and re-prove the core insights of the
   field-and sociologists in general. Using three core theoretical debates
   in the larger discipline-about independence, insecurity, and
   inequality-I argue that children's perspectives can help scholars ask
   new questions, render the invisible visible, and break through
   theoretical logjams. Thus would further research utilizing children's
   perspectives and the dynamics of age extend the explanatory power of
   social theory.</td>

   Bourdieu's changing understanding of capital, showing how it became less
   compatible with Marx's over time. Third, I point out ambiguities in
   Bourdieu's concept of capital that, despite gestures toward a Marxist
   understanding of capital, further distance him from Marx. Fourth, I
   argue that Bourdieu tends to take the economic field and economic
   capital for granted, unlike Marx. I conclude that if different forms of
   capital are but extended forms of economic capital, the notion of
   economic capital that they extend is not a Marxist one.</td>

   with the example of cropland lost in the construction of the built

   which tracks permutations of specific land-use transitions over time. In
   a fixed-effects analysis, the area of cropland lost to the built
   environment is regressed on different measures of population and
   economic growth. Results indicate that natural increase and net
   migration differentially affect the loss of cropland at the local level
   across the continental United States, challenging the traditional focus
   in environmental sociology on overall population growth. This study also
   advances the concept of aristocratic conservation as a process by which
   increasing residential affluence slows down the intensification of land.
   The results of the analysis are discussed in terms of what land-use
   intensification means for environmental sustainability and town-country
   relations.</td>

   First, the applicability and extension of Bourdieu's theory of cultural
   production is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on illustrating
   how the concept of location adopts an intersubjective understanding of
   reflexivity in order to address some of the limitations of Bourdieu's
   concepts of position, disposition and strategy. Second, two different
   strategies of legitimation (crowd pleasing and crowd commanding) adopted
   by DJs within the field are outlined. Third, the importance of location
   in the use of these strategies in the field of black popular
   music-making is illustrated. Finally, this paper concludes by
   summarizing the key dimensions of the concept of location and suggesting
   how the concept has broader applicability in other cultural fields.</td>

   How does materiality affect people's experience of art in a museum
   exhibition? Research at two museums suggests that non-human
   agents-object and words-interact with human bodies to choreograph the
   art encounter. This process works through interactions between two
   processes of emplacement: physical position and cognitive location.
   Position guides location in the process of meaning-making, a
   relationship mediated by three mechanisms: distance, legibility, and
   orientation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Social studies of agriculture tend to overlook the micro and symbolic
   interactions that structure relationships among agriculturalists, the
   environment, and animals raised as commodities. In this study, I use
   ethnographic methods and in-depth interviews with conventional beef
   producers to understand their perceptions of the environment and the
   nonhuman animals they raise. Central themes in this setting are the
   ethics of stewardship and husbandry. I seek to understand how these
   values are constructed and used interactionally. I argue that
   stewardship and husbandry help describe a process of co-constitution
   that binds together ranchers, cattle, and the natural environment. The
   analysis engages actor-network theory by emphasizing nonhuman activeness
   and draws from symbolic interaction and cultural sociology to show how
   people interpret the actions of nonhumans. The findings show that
   ranchers frame their relationships with cattle and the environment as
   symbiotic and work to understand the interests of the nonhuman as
   complementary to production. I introduce the term symbiotic ideology to
   show the way this approach mystifies power dynamics embedded in the
   ethic of dominion.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>While most work on causation in ethnography addresses the normative
   question of what ethnographers should do, this article addresses the
   empirical question of what ethnographers actually do. Specifically, it
   investigates whether ethnographic articles make causal arguments and how
   these arguments are made. The authors draw on a content analysis of 48
   ethnographic articles sampled from four groups of sociological journals:
   contemporary generalist journals, contemporary specialist journals,
   mid-20th-century generalist journalsall in the United Statesand
   contemporary generalist journals in Mexico. They find that ethnographies
   in U.S. contemporary generalist journals are most likely to advance
   strong and central causal claims and to use logical and rhetorical
   devices comparable to those used in quantitative articles. They also
   find that most Mexican ethnographic articles undertake a different kind
   of project, which they call "shedding light" on social phenomena. In
   addition to offering one methodological and one substantive suggestion
   to account for these findings, the authors highlight their implications
   for the sociology of social science.</td>

   implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events,
   authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge
   without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group's
   sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new

   Using unobtrusive data, we test a series of hypotheses concerning the

   white male instrumental advisor increases the likelihood of having an
   ideal career for participants in the American Sociological Association's

   the advantage of having access to both types of mentoring when compared

   We redirect attention to the process of economic change that structures

   the entity that is granted rights formerly exercised by state organs,
   and on the combination of rights they are granted. The transformation of
   three sectors in China-agriculture, steel manufacturing, and real

   Africa: the Axial religions (Christianity and Islam); indigenous
   chieftaincy systems based around chief, lineage, and clan; and
   globalized modernity, represented primarily by NGOs and the global human
   rights agenda. The article argues that in many respects it is the Axial
   religions that are the most modernizing, as they directly counter the
   power of traditional kin obligations (and the overwhelming dangers of
   witchcraft), while the purportedly modern and secular NGOs practice a
   ritualized version of modernity, even as they are penetrated by the
   norms and practices of the kin-based chieftaincy system and its related
   system of patron-client ties.Resume Dans cet article, trois grandes

   obligaciones de parentesco tradicionales (y los abrumadores peligros de
   la brujeria), mientras que las ONGs supuestamente modernas y seculares

   Shelter-in-Place (SIP) practices have been sold, deployed, and discussed
   in Southern California to battle wildfire. In particular, this will be a
   critique of the technical literature and application of fire safety in
   housing, as well as the anthropocentric hubris that humans can outsmart
   wildfire. Rather than focus on the success or failure of SIP, I am
   situating the SIP within the context of architecture, the history of
   fire safety, and the push of neoliberalism. The purpose of this approach
   is to make SIP and fire safe home design less about technology and
   know-how, and more about broader social issues such as privatization and
   social inequality.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research on collective memory suggests that commemorations of
   difficult pasts take either a multivocal or a fragmented form. I suggest
   these forms exist as ideal types for the initial commemoration, but the
   commemorative field, as a whole, remains dynamic over time, effectively
   shifting between forms. This study traces the creation, maintenance, and
   transformation of collective memory of the May 4, 1970 shootings at Kent
   State from 1970 to 2013 using archival sources, media accounts, and
   participant observation. In examining the commemorative field at Kent, I
   theorize the existence of a third commemorative formthe integrated
   commemorative field, which allows for the expression of divergent
   narratives and the maintenance of separate commemorative spaces while
   simultaneously enhancing social solidarity through shared
   meta-narratives that stress overarching values, like human rights or
   scientific inquiry.</td>

   structurally about social class inequality, meritocracy, and mobility.
   Most inequality simulations focus solely on economic inequality and omit
   social and cultural capital, both of which contribute to social class
   reproduction. Using a pretest/posttest design, the current study
   evaluates a simulation game that incorporates economic, social, and
   cultural capital and is meant for introductory sociology classes
   containing between 15 and 70 students. Data come from a state research
   university and a liberal arts college. Results show that the simulation
   increased students' conceptual understanding of structural explanations
   for restricted mobility; cultural and social capital; and conceptual
   connections between stratification concepts. The simulation did not lead
   to changes in students' feelings about poor people. Results support the
   idea of using simulation games to overcome student resistance to the
   sociological perspective on stratification and suggest that some
   simulation games may be effective across institutional contexts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A common source of frustration for college instructors is getting their
   students to read. Since the 1970s, studies have shown that no more than
   30 percent of students complete a reading assignment on any given day.
   But what can be done? What strategies can instructors use to make
   certain that their students read? Do pop or announced quizzes work
   better? Does it help to call on students randomly in class? To date,
   little systematic evidence exists concerning the relative utility of the
   many methods instructors use to encourage reading compliance. This study
   begins to address that lacuna. Specifically, using survey data collected
   in introductory sociology classes (N = 423), we examine how students
   evaluate seven commonly used methods ranging from announced quizzes to
   short writing assignments to being called on randomly in class. We find
   that students perceive mandatory and/or announced methods to be more
   effective in motivating them to complete reading assignments than
   unannounced or optional methods.</td>

   students' attention; fosters a nonthreatening learning environment;
   raises students' awareness of personal perspectives and biases; and
   encourages integration of ideas and critical thinking. ARC can also be
   used for meaningful assessment between formal evaluations as well as to
   reward each student's preparation and reading of the class material. The

   dimensions of power. Each proposed dimension of power is grounded in a
   different understanding of social causes: relational-realist,
   discursive-hermeneutic, and performative-pragmatic. For the purposes of
   empirical analysis, this dimensional schema crosscuts the classic
   sources of power typology developed by Michael Mann and others, thus
   rendering the conceptual apparatus for pursuing sociological research on
   power more complex and explanatorily effective. The schema is
   illustrated by an example from comparative-historical sociology:
   explaining the storming of the Bastille and its effects. A series of
   research questions for investigating the relative autonomy of
   performative power is proposed. Finally, the current schema is situated
   vis-a-vis classic sociological theories of power, including the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Social network research is widely considered atheoretical. In contrast,
   in this article I argue that network analysis often mixes two distinct
   theoretical frameworks, creating a logically inconsistent foundation.
   Relationalism rejects essentialism and a priori categories and insists
   upon the intersubjectivity of experience and meaning as well as the
   importance of the content of interactions and their historical setting.
   Formalism is based on a structuralist interpretation of the theoretical
   works of Georg Simmel. Simmel laid out a neo-Kantian program of
   identifying a priori categories of relational types and patterns that
   operate independently of cultural content or historical setting.
   Formalism and relationalism are internally consistent theoretical
   perspectives, but there are tensions between them. To pave the way for
   stronger middle-range theoretical development, I disaggregate the two
   approaches and highlight the contradictions that must be addressed or
   resolved for the construction of any general and inclusive theory.</td>

   processes and features enabling theorization of general social patterns
   of consumption across diverse contexts. This article highlights the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Interethnic and intergroup social ties are critical to knitting together
   increasingly diverse societies into cohesive wholes. Yet their formation
   faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to
   be established disproportionately between those sharing significant
   social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author
   explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup
   relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar
   others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on
   interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S.
   dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on
   educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on
   marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for
   the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a
   two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its
   empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the
   homophily hurdle.</td>

   do not always work together harmoniously. Qualitative data from three

   integrate the gender relations theory, a life course perspective, and a
   biosocial stress perspective to explore the effect of women's job
   authority in 1975 (at age 36) and 1993 (at age 54) on breast cancer
   incidence up to 2011. Findings indicate that women with the authority to
   hire, fire, and influence others' pay had a significantly higher risk of
   a breast cancer diagnosis over the next thirty years compared to
   housewives and employed women with no job authority. Because job
   authority conferred the highest risk of breast cancer for women who also
   spent more hours dealing with people at work in 1975,1 suggest that the
   assertion of job authority by women in the 1970 s involved stressful
   interpersonal experiences, such as social isolation and negative social
   interactions, that may have increased the risk of breast cancer via
   prolonged dysregulation of the glucocorticoid system and exposure of
   breast tissue to the adverse effects of chronically elevated cortisol.
   This study contributes to sociology by emphasizing gendered biosocial
   pathways through which women's occupational experiences become embodied
   and drive forward physiological repercussions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>American sociology as a field tends to marginalize psychoanalytic
   perspectives despite scholars Cavalletto and Silver showing that this
   was not the case during Talcott Parson's intellectual heyday in the
   1940s. From the 1970s on, though, constructionists emphasized the
   conservative rather than liberatory side of the Freudian tradition and
   symbolic interactionism took the place of psychoanalysis as the
   legitimized framework for understanding individuals. Marginalization has
   occurred for at least three reasons: (1) the legacies of positivism
   created a bias toward empirically observable rather than relatively
   unmeasurable concepts like the Freudian unconscious; (2) psychoanalysis
   uses internal data whereas sociologists look externally rather than
   inward; (3) because psychoanalysis focuses on individuals and sociology
   on groups, it is argued that the two are incommensurate. Nevertheless,
   even in the face of marginalization, some scholars have combined
   psychoanalytic and sociological perspectives in myriad ways conceiving
   of multi dimensional rather than rationalistic individuals within social
   and cultural settings; exploring interactional dynamics that are at once
   psychic-and-social; and, as in the work of Wilfred Bion, studying the
   psychoanalytic mechanisms of groups themselves. I posit that the ongoing
   marginalization of psychoanalysis deprives the discipline of an
   innovative tool of analysis, an especially salient one at times when the
   emotional and psychological dimensions of social life are glaringly
   evident.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Science on emerging environmental health threats involves numerous
   ethical concerns related to scientific uncertainty about conducting,
   interpreting, communicating, and acting upon research findings, but the
   connections between ethical decision making and scientific uncertainty
   are under-studied in sociology. Under conditions of scientific
   uncertainty, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed by formal
   ethical codes of conduct, increasing the importance of ethical
   reflection by researchers, conflicts over research conduct, and reliance
   on informal ethical standards. This article draws on in-depth interviews
   with scientists, regulators, activists, industry representatives, and
   fire safety experts to explore ethical considerations of moments of
   uncertainty using a case study of flame retardants, chemicals widely
   used in consumer products with potential negative health and
   environmental impacts. We focus on the uncertainty that arises in
   measuring people's exposure to these chemicals through testing of their
   personal environments or bodies. We identify four sources of ethical
   concerns relevant to scientific uncertainty: 1) choosing research
   questions or methods, 2) interpreting scientific results, 3)
   communicating results to multiple publics, and 4) applying results for
   policy making. This research offers lessons about professional conduct
   under conditions of uncertainty, ethical research practice,
   democratization of scientific knowledge, and science's impact on policy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article is concerned with identifying, comparing, and accounting
   for the principal rhetorical conventions within Pagan practitioners'
   narratives of conversion. Applying key insights from studies on
   narrative identity and drawing on 15months of fieldwork and 25 in-depth
   interviews with Pagan practitioners, I first outline formal similarities
   in the content of participants' narratives, arguing that these narrative
   conventions together constitute an ideal typical conversion narrative:
   what I call the rhetoric of continuity. This narrative form depicts the
   process of conversion as a rediscovery or uncovering of a temporally
   continuous and essentialized Pagan self. I suggest that while all
   conversions involve both change and continuity, adherents of different
   faith traditions vary in the degree to which they stress
   self-transformation and/or self-continuity. I then argue that the
   rhetoric of continuity reflects and reinforces practitioners': (1)
   perspective on the locus and nature of the authentic self; (2) claims to
   legitimacy and social acceptance; and (3) understanding of the nature of
   religious truth.</td>

   located within a wide spectrum of social sites, ranging from the

   and sociology, yet empirical cases of the theory remain scarce. While
   some analysis examines performativity in work, the focus is on
   organizations and how gender gets done and undone' within them with
   little attention paid to bodies outside organizations. Based on two
   empirical studies of freelancing fashion models, we extend Butler's
   gender performativity to analyse the routine bodily practices and gender
   performances of men and women in fashion, investigating what happens
   when men and women perform the same work but under different gendered
   expectations. Fashion modelling presents a case that reproduces
   heteronormative definitions of femininity while potentially challenging
   traditional notions of masculinity and work. Observing everyday
   transgressions', we evidence how gender performativity, while largely
   reiterative of normative heterosexuality, may subtly confound the
   conventions. Observing how models do and undo' gender extends the
   analysis of gender at work to non-organizational bodies that tend to be
   under-represented within the literature.</td>

   used to define a society as moral, and inform experiences. Black and

   difficult for students at historically white colleges and universities

   enter HWCUs surrounded by these walls - protecting them from attacks on
   white supremacy - that have multiple layers and therefore are even more
   difficult to penetrate; yet they must be penetrated. With a few
   exceptions, the institution of American higher education does not

   legitimated agencies charged with promoting and protecting human rights,
   have emerged worldwide. This article examines the effect of these
   organizations on two kinds of human rights outcomes: physical integrity
   rights and civil and political rights. We analyze cross-national
   longitudinal data using regression models that account for the
   endogeneity of organizational formation. Our first main finding is that
   all types of human rights institutions improve long-term physical
   integrity outcomes but not civil and political rights practices. This
   finding may reflect a greater worldwide focus on physical integrity
   violations such as torture, and also many countries' propensity to
   resist Western civil and political rights standards. A second main
   finding is that time matters: in the cases we observe, initial increases
   in rated abuse levels were followed by improvements. These initial
   increases may be due to closer scrutiny or the expanded scope of what
   constitutes human rights abuses. Our results call for rethinking the
   concept of decoupling in the sociology of human rights and other focal
   areas.</td>

   challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that
   law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader
   considerations of community social organization and collective
   sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and
   severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social
   capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more
   prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find
   that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which
   the public expresses higher levels of fear. Overall, the findings
   provide provocative evidence that legal outcomes in murder cases are
   influenced by several features of the social environments in which they
   are processed.</td>

   value of friendship networks, little has been written about how social
   relations form and are structured by social institutions. Using data
   from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement study and the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors show that
   the odds of a new friendship nomination were 1.77 times greater within
   clusters of high school students taking courses together than between
   them. The estimated effect cannot be attributed to exposure to peers in
   similar grade levels, indirect friendship links, or pair-level course
   overlap, and the finding is robust to alternative model specifications.
   The authors also show how tendencies associated with status hierarchy
   inhering in triadic friendship nominations are neutralized within the
   clusters. These results have implications for the production and
   distribution of social capital within social systems such as schools,
   giving the clusters social salience as local positions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Pierre Bourdieu developed a theory of democratic politics that is at
   least as indebted to civic republicanism as to Marxism. He was familiar
   with the civic republican tradition, and it increasingly influenced both
   his political interventions and sociological work, especially late in
   his career. Bourdieu drew above all on Niccol Machiavelli's version of
   republicanism, though the French republican tradition also influenced
   him via Durkheimian social theory. Three elements of Bourdieu's work in
   particular-his concept of field autonomy, his view of interests and
   universalism, and his understanding of how solidarity is generated and
   sustained-may be understood, at least in part, as sociological
   reformulations of republican ideas. By drawing attention to these
   republican influences, the article aims to show that the conceptual
   resources which some critics, including Jeffrey C. Alexander, consider
   indispensable to an adequate theory of democracy are not entirely absent
   in Bourdieu's work. On the basis of this reassessment, the article
   concludes that Bourdieu and Alexander are not as opposed in their
   thinking about democratic politics as it might first appear.</td>

   plays an important role in capturing the public eye as well as helping
   students to make more informed choices in their lives and communities. I
   ask six questions that help us as sociologists to think about how
   introductory sociology can better serve our discipline, our students,
   and their communities. These questions ask us to consider who our
   students are, how the course fits with university mission and program
   goals, what we want students to learn in this course and how we can
   build consensus about that common core, the extent to which there is
   alignment between learning objectives and our disciplinary standards in
   sociology, how assessment can be used to improve course design and
   curriculum in general, and the role that introductory sociology plays in
   recruitment and retention of students to the university and to the
   major. Posing such questions will promote further discussion and
   consensus building among sociology colleagues with the aim of improving
   curriculum and student learning.</td>

   article fills the gap in the teaching and learning literature in

   specific areas: learning, teaching, and scholarship. The effectiveness
   of the focus group project was assessed through a one-group
   pretest-posttest survey of the student-researchers' experiences. I
   conclude with a reflection on the practical limitations as well as the
   considerable advantages of training students to conduct focus group

   Inventory (GABI), a teaching tool designed to aid students in (a)
   realizing how sociological theory links to their personal beliefs and
   (b) exploring any combination of 11 frequently used theoretical
   perspectives on gender, including both conservative theories
   (physiological, sociobiological, and structural functionalist) and
   feminist ones (liberal, socialist, Marxist, radical, separatist,
   cultural, multicultural/black, and postmodern feminism). In this
   article, I discuss the inventory, how I use it in my sociology of gender
   class, and how it could be adapted for use in other classes. I also
   analyze qualitative and quantitative evaluations of its effectiveness
   based on responses from students at two universities (N = 603) and
   pretest and posttest results of its impact on student learning
   immediately following the activity (N = 161) and at the end of the
   semester (N = 33). These data suggest that the GABI increases students'
   understanding of theoretical perspectives on gender, encourages them to
   reflect on their own views and (mis)perceptions of theories, and is an
   engaging exercise for students. Most importantly, this is a valuable
   exercise to aid students in realizing how sociological theory links to
   their everyday lives.</td>

   evaluate online courses in comparison to more traditional face-to-face

   sociology courses, and results of a series of hierarchical linear models
   indicate that students feel they have learned less in online courses,
   believe they are treated with more respect in in-class courses, and rate
   online courses less highly than in-class courses. Findings also suggest
   that the negative effects of teaching online are not universal for
   instructors, as the switch to online classes actually results in better
   evaluations for teachers who typically perform poorly in the classroom.
   These findings caution against the broad use of online sociology classes
   as a strategy for coping with increasing enrollments and shrinking
   budgets and suggest educators should select the course format that best
   complements their teaching strengths and skills.</td>

   Issue selection is an important area of study given that advocacy
   organizations have limited time and resources and thus many potentially
   important issues go ignored. Yet issue selection remains an understudied
   question in the scholarly study of advocacy organizations. In this
   article, the author draws on historical data, interviews, and a database
   of statements by major human rights advocacy organizations to examine
   one particular historical puzzle regarding issue selection: why advocacy
   organizations have focused on the recent conflict in the Darfur region
   of Sudan rather than the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo,
   even though more people have died in the Congo. The author finds that
   advocacy organizations select issues not based on their severity but
   based on framing, political opportunities, and organizational resources.</td>

   This paper assesses the project and situates it theoretically using

   tradition focuses on predatory offending, and it has rarely been
   considered as a theoretical basis for the study of more common,
   low-level (mostly nonviolent) deviance. Using commonplace automotive
   incivility as a test case, the present work draws on the routine
   activities approach in precisely this manner to answer recent
   theoretical calls for an empirical sociology of familiar encounters and
   situations. Using data from a nationally representative sample of
   Australians, this article looks at the time/space distribution,
   situational commonalities, and emotional consequences of vehicular
   incivilities. Risk factors consistent with the routine activities
   paradigm include everyday driving activity and microsituations involving
   mixed speeds, crowded conditions, and blocked flows. Results also
   suggest that automotive incivility is more likely than other types of
   incivility to incite feelings of fear and anger.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The biophysical environment is not tangential to the social; it is only
   tangential to conventional sociological thought. Environmental sociology
   arose in the 1970s based on this presupposition, but over time theory
   and empirical research have generally adopted a social constructionist
   or natural realist approach. Despite rejection of the Durkheimian dictum
   of explaining social facts through the invocation of other social facts,
   and thus refusal to presuppose human exemptionalism from ecological
   constraints, scholarship continues to reflect this nature/culture
   divide. When environmental sociologists focus on one side or the other
   of the nature/culture divide, the intertwining and conjoint constitution
   of the social and the biophysical-material is obscured. The intent of
   the present essay is to articulate a co-constructionist ontological
   position sensitive to the temporal emergence of hybridity between the
   social and the natural and amenable to recognition of salient dynamics
   not readily envisioned from either side of the nature/culture divide. In
   doing so, the argument builds upon prior metatheoretical scholarship in

   Jaspers to refer to a period in the first millennium BCE that saw the
   rise of major religious and philosophical figures and ideas throughout
   Eurasia, has gained an established position in a number of fields,
   including historical sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of
   religion. We explore whether the notion of an "axial age" has historical
   and intellectual cogency, or whether the authors who use the label of a
   more free-floating "axiality" to connote varied "breakthroughs" in human
   experience may have a more compelling case. Throughout, we draw
   attention to ways in which uses of the axial age concept in contemporary
   social science vary in these and other respects. In the conclusion, we
   reflect on the value of the concept and its current uses and their
   utility in making sense of human experience.</td>

   sociology textbooks to determine the relationship between categories of
   gender, race, and class and levels of analysis. Previous research found
   that textbooks primarily discuss gender at the micro level, race at the
   meso level, and class at the macro level. Replicating previous
   approaches by using index citations, we find evidence that gender is
   linked to socialization much more than race and class, and there is
   evidence that class is still more likely to be discussed at a macro
   level. Our content analysis findings show a similar pattern, but also
   some evidence for the increased inclusion of theories and examples that
   examine gender, race, and class at multiple levels of analysis.
   Implications of these findings are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The "millennial" historical moment presents fresh dilemmas for
   race-critical instructors. In addition to being well-versed in
   colorblind racial discourse, millennial students are socialized in a
   pop-cultural milieu that implies a more integrated, racially egalitarian
   world than exists in reality and includes claims that U.S. society is
   now "post-racial." Millennials' enthusiastic consumption of race in an
   era of seeming progress leads them to assume an ever greater social
   distance between their generation and the relics of those they consider
   "real" racists, as well as between the former eras of de jure white
   supremacy and the more racially meritocratic structure they presume
   exists today. In light of such obstacles, race-critical instructors must
   employ creative strategies to help students understand and identify
   their connections to larger, structural matters that create and sustain
   racial inequality at the systemic level. I introduce one successful
   approach, where students examine the social reproduction of racial
   inequality by tracing their family histories of wealth and capital
   acquisition and transfer.</td>

   participation. By applying concepts found in visual sociology to
   techniques identified in the scholarship of teaching and learning, I
   created an image-based learning model to address this disconnect. I used
   discussion board image selection, posting and critique exercises
   (image-posts), and personal meaning maps (PMMs) as core assignments.
   This combination increased student comprehension, challenged and altered
   perceptions of key topics, and gave them a greater sense of agency
   through reflexive learning. Additionally, students' reception of this
   model was favorable, with 97 percent reporting that the course met or
   exceeded their expectations and 95 percent reporting that they learned
   more in this class than in any previously taken college-level course.</td>

   specifically at the undergraduate sociology curriculum argue that
   students must engage as practitioners of sociology at each level of
   their program development. In short, undergraduates should do
   sociology-not just read or write sociology. Applying this recommendation
   to teaching statistics, I suggest organizing a course around a
   student-led research project in which students generate the topics,
   questions, and data that are then used to complete a substantive
   research paper. Students are given the opportunity to be actively
   engaged in all stages of the research and data-gathering process.
   Students also present their work in student roundtables, further

   deprivation is the dominant mechanism through which socioeconomic status
   (SES) affects mortality. If such an argument is valid, we would expect
   to consistently see the influence of relative deprivation in situations
   where two or more highly qualified and very similar individuals are
   nominated in a status competition, but only one receives the status
   boost conferred by winning. We studied mortality experiences of Emmy
   Award winners, Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, and presidents and vice
   presidents-comparing each to nominated losers in the same competition.
   Our findings and results of similar studies fail to show consistent
   advantages for winners. The association between winning and longevity is
   sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and sometimes nonexistent. We
   conclude that the critical processes determining the strength and
   direction of any status effect on longevity are changes in life
   circumstances that result from winning or losing, rather than the
   processes that inexorably flow from one's relative position in a status

   This model stands in stark contrast to the traditional notion in the

   through classic forces such as social structure and cumulative
   advantage. We investigate the mobility of fame using a unique data
   source containing daily records of references to person names in a large
   corpus of English-language media sources. These data reveal that only at
   the bottom of the public attention hierarchy do names exhibit fast
   turnover; at upper tiers, stable coverage persists around a fixed level
   and rank for decades. Fame exhibits strong continuity even in
   entertainment, on television, and on blogs, where it has been thought to
   be most ephemeral. We conclude that once a person's name is decoupled

   self-reinforcing processes, career structures, and commemorative
   practices perpetuate fame.</td>

   increasingly perceptible challenge to the 'Christian right' in the
   United States. New organizations and websites are cropping up, a
   wellspring of books are being published, and long-standing progressive
   writers and theologians are garnering more attention and support than
   ever before. Despite significant advances, however, the impact of the
   'religious left' in the American public sphere is still limited. In this
   paper, I ask why. Based on participant observation, discourse analysis,
   and in-depth interviews, and using a multidimensional culturalist
   perspective rooted in Durkheimian and Weberian ideas, I explore the
   symbolic dynamics of the Christian 'left'. I argue that in addition to
   their structural disadvantages, progressive Christians face thorny
   dilemmas regarding authority/legitimacy, rationalization,
   demystification, disenchantment, charisma (or the lack thereof), and
   profanation that, though not insurmountable, are not easily resolved.</td>

   penalty en masse. What factors help to explain this global trend?
   Conventional analyses explain abolition by focusing primarily on state
   level political processes. This article contributes to these studies by
   analyzing world cultural factors that lend to the abolition trend. The
   main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto
   cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of
   the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights
   regime, represents a significant driver of states' abolition. Countries'
   predominant religion is also found to significantly affect the
   probability of abolition: predominantly Catholic nation-states are most
   likely to abolish the death penalty, and predominantly Muslim
   nation-states are least likely to abolish. These findings provide
   evidence for world cultural factors that structure the abolition trend
   globally.</td>

   the U. S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The
   analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level
   narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but
   interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex
   interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps
   explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically,
   over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy,
   and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political
   innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to
   increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to
   respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In
   turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime
   control politics and policies at the national level that reflected
   historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A perennial concern among scholars of globalization is the relationship
   between global social formations and national and subnational political
   and economic developments. While sociological understanding of "the
   global" has become increasingly rich, stressing the complex relationship
   between material and cultural pressures, an undertheorized nation state
   often sits on the receiving end of the sociologist's model of
   globalization. The goal of this article is to help move the sociology of
   globalization out of the analytical trap of global-national dualism by
   developing an account of the transnationalization of political
   authority. Building on neo-Marxist and Weberian theories of the
   transnational, or global state, which explicate the macro-structural
   dynamics that have led to the transnationalization of the state as such,
   I look at the process of the transnationalization of political authority
   from an institutional perspective, one that focuses on processes of
   transnationalization within, and across, specific state agencies. These
   theoretical points are empirically motivated through an historical
   investigation of the transnationalization of monetary authority and its
   relationship to the international diffusion of policies of austerity
   from the era of the classical gold standard through the economic crisis
   of 2008.</td>

   Algeria, this essay excavates his early thoughts on colonialism.
   Contrary to received wisdom, Bourdieu did in fact offer a theory of
   colonialism and a systematic understanding of its effects and logics.
   Bourdieu portrayed colonialism as a racialized system of domination,
   backed by force, which restructures social relations and creates hybrid
   cultures. His theory entailed insights on the limits and promises of
   colonial reform, anticolonial revolution, and postcolonial liberation.
   Bourdieu's early thinking on colonialism drew upon but extended French
   colonial studies of the time. It also contains the seeds of later
   concepts like habitus, field, and reflexive sociology while prefiguring
   more recent disciplinary postcolonial studies. Bourdieusian sociology in
   this sense originates not just as a study of Algeria but more
   specifically a critique of colonialism. It can be seen as contributing
   to the larger project of postcolonial sociology.</td>

   have helped some European regions to resist inroads by Protestantism.
   Based on a neo-Durkheimian theory of rituals and social order, I propose
   that locally based cults of the saints that included public veneration
   lowered the odds that Protestantism would displace Catholicism in
   sixteenth-century German cities. To evaluate this proposition, I first
   turn to historical and theoretical reflection on the role of the cult of
   the saints in late medieval history. I then test the hypothesis with a
   data set of sixteenth-century German cities. Statistical analysis
   provides additional support for the ritual and social order thesis
   because even when several important variables identified by materialist
   accounts of the Reformation in the social scientific literature the
   presence of shrines as an indicator for the cult of the saints remains
   large and significant. Although large-scale social change is usually
   assumed to have politico-economic sources, this analysis suggests that
   cultural factors may be of equal or greater importance.</td>

   this process either to the production of urban space by elites or to the
   consumption of urban space by individual consumers. In this article, we
   take a preliminary step toward bridging this gap by illustrating how
   these groups may, in some cases, be the same actors. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with middle-class parents in Boston, we explore the
   transitions that gentrifiers undergo as they age and have children. As
   young singles and childless couples, our respondents interacted with the
   city mainly as passive consumers. Years later, however, facing pressures
   to relocate in search of high-quality educational options, these parents
   emerged as active producers of the urban landscape through their
   substantial involvement in their children's public elementary schools.
   This school-based engagement reinforced their loyalties to their
   neighborhoods, dissuading them from moving to the suburbs. Since it is
   based on intense interactions with small local institutions, though,
   this strategy will likely be more difficult for parents to sustain in
   larger, less personal high schools. Thus, these parents may reconsider
   their dedication to city living as their children age. We discuss the
   implications of this research for urban theory and policy.</td>

   areas of social life. Yet there are few systematic studies of apology as
   a dependent variable. Analyzing the last statements of Texas death row
   prisoners, we find that the best predictor of apology is affiliation
   with God. Under traditional Western conceptions, God is an actor endowed
   with extraordinarily high status. Drawing on the theoretical paradigm
   known as pure sociology, we argue that death row prisoners who invoke
   God as a third party in their conflict thereby elevate their own status.
   Greater vertical closeness to the victim's side generates more social
   assertiveness and a greater willingness to apologize publicly. In
   addition, affiliation increases prisoners' relational closeness to God,
   enhancing their probability of adopting God's modern message of
   reconciliation. God's status has, however, declined somewhat over the
   past several centuriesa trend that helps to explain the modern religious
   emphasis on reconciliation over punishment, apology over defiance.</td>

   education influences health. This article focuses on the possibility
   that the health benefits of college may vary according to childhood
   (mis)fortune and people's propensity to attain a college degree in the
   first place. Several perspectives from life course sociology offer
   competing hypotheses as to whether the most or the least advantaged see
   the greatest return of a college education. The authors use a national
   survey of middle-age American adults to assess risk of two
   cardiovascular health problems and mortality. Results from propensity
   score and hierarchical regression analysis indicate that the protective
   effect of college attainment is indeed heterogeneous. Further, the
   greatest returns are among those least likely to experience this life
   course transition (i.e., compensatory leveling). Explanations for this

   research on the health benefits of completing college.</td>

   and sociability which has been the focus of recent research in the
   sociology of culture. I propose that cultural variety, as given by the
   number of cultural activities that the person engages in, is tied not
   only to static properties of social networks (such as range), but also
   to the likelihood of having benefited from this connectivity (social
   capital). Taking the classic example of finding a job via a network
   contact as the main outcome, I show that persons who have a propensity
   to engage in a wide variety of cultural activities have a higher
   likelihood of having found out about their current job via a weak tie
   and that different types of weak tie activation are selectively
   correlated with distinct cultural taste profiles. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

   world polity influences individual-level concern for the environment.
   While theoretically-derived propositions about such relationships have a
   deep history in comparative sociology, they-with few exceptions-remain
   untested. Consistent with past research, employed national-level
   measures of world polity integration include the relative presence of
   environmental international nongovernmental organizations (EINGOs) and
   the existence of environmental ministries. Results of multilevel
   analyses of individual-level environmental concern in 37 nations
   indicate that both forms of world polity integration increase the
   likelihood of individual-level environmental concern, net of other
   national-level factors and individual-level characteristics; although we
   find stronger support for the influence of EINGOs as a key variable
   indicating world polity connection. The findings provide unique support
   for world polity theory, suggesting that future research should consider
   how elements of world polity integration influence other forms of
   individual attitudes and behaviors. The results also highlight the
   importance in considering global and transnational factors when
   assessing the determinants of individual attitudes about the
   environment. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

   presence in the state legislatures and the House of Representatives.
   Stereotypes about women suggest that shifts in social conditions affect
   these political outcomes by making such stereotypes more or less
   salient. Findings indicate that beliefs about female competencies-such
   as women's purported unwillingness to endorse violent solutions-should
   reduce support for female candidates when increases in violent crime
   create demands for increasingly severe punishments. Since women also are
   typecast as being more protective of vulnerable populations than males,
   states with larger minority populations should have additional women in
   both legislatures. Pooled time-series models based on 1127 state-years
   show that fewer women were present in the state legislatures or in state
   delegations to the House after increases in the murder rates. States
   with larger minority populations, however, had more women in these two
   legislative bodies. Our result's support claims that under researched
   social conditions produce political climates that either benefit or harm
   women who seek these offices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   attendance, but we know little about how these investments shape
   postsecondary achievement. Two theoretical frameworks suggest diametric
   conclusions. Some studies operate from a more-is-more perspective in
   which children use calculated parental allocations to make academic
   progress. In contrast, a more-is-less perspective, rooted in a different
   model of rational behavior, suggests that parental investments create a
   disincentive for student achievement. I adjudicate between these
   frameworks, using data from nationally representative postsecondary
   datasets to determine what effect financial parental investments have on
   student GPA and degree completion. The findings suggest seemingly
   contradictory processes. Parental aid decreases student GPA, but it
   increases the odds of graduating-net of explanatory variables and
   accounting for alternative funding. Rather than strategically using
   resources in accordance with parental goals, or maximizing on their
   ability to avoid academic work, students are satisficing: they meet the
   criteria for adequacy on multiple fronts, rather than optimizing their
   chances for a particular outcome. As a result, students with parental
   funding often perform well enough to stay in school but dial down their
   academic efforts. I conclude by highlighting the importance of life
   stage and institutional context for parental investment.</td>

   choice theory, social exchange theory, and cultural sociology. These
   perspectives vary in the extent to which interests are an explanatory
   principle, how interests are considered, and how emergent social
   formations are explained. However, they share an implicit recognition
   that the question of when interest-oriented action emerges needs more

   systems, and (d) the relationship between healthcare systems and social

   ignore religion or fold it into ethnicity. A coherent synthesis capable
   of adequately accounting for religious-nationalist violence must not
   only integrate micro and macro, cultural and strategic approaches; it
   must also include a meso level of elite conflict and boundary
   maintenance and treat the religious field as potentially autonomous from
   the cultural field.</td>

   this field are (a) attention to the inseparability of human and nonhuman
   natures and (b) attention to the role that power and social inequality
   play in shaping human/nonhuman interactions. These two characteristics
   of environmental sociology also reveal strong links between this field
   and the broader discipline, in light of recent reexaminations of
   classical sociological writings. We conclude with a consideration of new

   tracks mechanisms by which social forces-from pollution to nutrition to

   gene expression, and induce durable changes in behavior and health. We
   begin with an introduction to the science of environmental epigenetics
   focused on articulating the logic of experimentation and explanation in

   past 50 years. It begins by outlining the importance of C.L.R. James's
   book Beyond a Boundary as a foundational text for the critical sociology
   of race and sport. Two paradigms of research on race and sport are
   sketched: the critical and the functionalist-evolutionary. The article
   then reviews the major contributions to the study of race and sport from
   three areas, namely mainstream American sociology, the sociology of
   race, and the sociology of sport, focusing primarily on the research
   published since 2000. The article concludes by looking at future
   directions of work in the field, suggesting that although sport remains
   marginal to mainstream American sociology and the insights of scholars
   such as James remain overlooked, the best work on race and sport will
   continue to emerge from the subfield of sport studies.</td>

   1960s, it has been relatively hidden in a number of sociological
   subfields and scattered across a range of disciplines. The financial
   crisis of 2008 elevated housing issues to the level of national and
   international debate and protest, and it offers a framework for
   organizing the scholarship on housing into that which studies housing as
   a commodity, on one hand, and as a right, on the other. In the former
   category, I review the literature on mortgage financing; property values
   and wealth; and affordable rental housing, foreclosures, and evictions.
   In the latter category, I discuss the theoretical arguments for a right
   to housing and review the research on activist demands for that right.
   The tension between these two aspects of housing is discussed
   throughout. I conclude by proposing the actual home or apartment as a
   productive area for new sociological analysis.</td>

   more comprehensive and timely sociology of expertise. It suggests that
   we need to distinguish between experts and expertise as requiring two
   distinct modes of analysis that are not reducible to one another. It
   analyzes expertise as a network linking together agents, devices,
   concepts, and institutional and spatial arrangements. It also suggests
   rethinking how abstraction and power were analyzed in the sociology of
   professions. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to
   explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses. This article
   shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the
   deinstitutionalization of mental retardation created a new institutional
   matrix within which a new set of actors-the parents of children with
   autism in alliance with psychologists and therapists-were able to forge
   an alternative network of expertise.</td>

   coordination of futures. Building off theories of temporality and
   action, the authors map three different modes of future
   making-protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes-that actors
   need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a
   wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of
   future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although
   they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in
   interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those
   three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a
   methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms
   through which other theoretical or empirical constructs-such as racism
   or late modernity-operate; and open a window into the ways in which
   people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its

   has left sociology comparatively unscathed. Does this mean that
   postcolonial theory is not relevant to sociology? Focusing upon social
   theory and historical sociology in particular, this article considers if
   and how postcolonial theory in the humanities might be imported into
   North American sociology. It argues that postcolonial theory offers a
   substantial critique of sociology because it alerts us to sociology's
   tendency to analytically bifurcate social relations. The article also
   suggests that a postcolonial sociology can overcome these problems by
   incorporating relational social theories to give new accounts of
   modernity. Rather than simply studying non-Western postcolonial
   societies or only examining colonialism, this approach insists upon the
   interactional constitution of social units, processes, and practices
   across space. To illustrate, the article draws upon relational theories
   (actor-network theory and field theory) to offer postcolonial accounts
   of two conventional research areas in historical sociology: the
   industrial revolution in England and the French Revolution.</td>

   article, I describe a method for continual teaching improvement that is
   based on writing, the well-established practice of teacher reflection,
   and classical sociological principles. This method was developed through
   the analysis of nine semesters of autoethnographic data that I collected
   in the form of daily reflective notes. The benefits of this
   sociologically informed reflective practice include grounding
   evaluations of individual class periods and entire courses in empirical
   data, becoming more efficient with course preparation, providing one
   with a stronger sense of mastery as a teacher, and developing as a
   sociologist by using the classroom as a key site for engaging in praxis.
   This practice can help teachers refine individual courses, improve as an
   instructor in an overall sense and more deeply connect sociology to the
   scholarship of teaching and learning.</td>

   to get students to improve the quality of what they write, they need to
   change how they write. Here, the authors assess whether students'

   in their writing process. Data collected via pretest and posttest
   interviews of 34 students show that writing-intensive seminars help
   first-year students become better planners and revisers yet have little

   in their first semester of college demonstrate higher order writing
   processes at the beginning of their seminar than their second-semester
   counterparts and show more improvement over the course of the semester

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article, we examine common practices and attitudes surrounding
   writing pedagogy in the sociology classroom based on an analysis of
   interviews with 19 sociologists at seven institutions in the Northeast.
   Our discussion is centered on two distinct approaches to writing that
   faculty identified: writing as cognitive development and writing as
   skill development. We observe that when they teach writing, sociologists
   shift their attention back and forth between these two essential
   features of good writing. Our analysis contextualizes writing as a form
   of distributed cognition (Salomon 1993), because it is taught and
   learned across multiple experiences in the academy. In conclusion, we
   suggest that a greater attentiveness to the underlying cognitive
   features of writing will broaden opportunities for campus-wide dialogue
   about writing across the disciplines and enhance our students' ability
   to transfer and build upon their writing experiences across courses.</td>

   increase this feeling exponentially. Active learning approaches to

   few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce

   Papers writing assignment designed to reduce student anxiety in an

   asked students to assess the effect of writing about film on theory
   anxiety. Findings show that the film assignment reduced anxiety about
   writing theoretically and improved student confidence in their ability
   to theorize. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of
   active learning approaches on theory anxiety in order to understand
   whether anxiety mediates the relationship between active learning and
   learning outcomes in theory classes.</td>

   integrate Simmel's late theory of the relational self into the formal

   forms of association among self-relating individuals. On this model,
   every "node" in an interaction has relations not only to others but also
   to itself, specifically between its ideality and its actuality. We go on
   to integrate this self-relation into a formal model of social relations.
   This model provides a way to describe configurations of social
   interactions defined by the forms according to which social relations
   realize participants' ideal selves. We examine four formal dimensions
   along which these self-relational relationships can vary: distance,
   symmetry, scope, and actualization.</td>

   we lack an understanding of the causal mechanisms through which
   political mobilization organizes and reorganizes markets over time. In
   this article I show how the concept of cultural framing-already widely
   used by economic sociologists-can be further developed to explain how
   mobilization reproduces markets in some moments while reorganizing them
   in others. Specifically, I link the concept of cultural framing to
   rent-seeking mobilization within markets to better explain when
   political contestation will lead to new market institutions and when it
   will fail to do so. I illustrate the value of this approach through an
   analysis of deregulation in the U. S. airline industry and conclude by
   discussing the consequences of the model and empirical case for the
   politics of markets, the rise of neoliberalism, and economic
   policymaking.</td>

   cultural vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain perceived
   injustices. This article combines an interpretive analysis of rhetoric
   commemorating the events of September 11, 2001 with an effort to
   construct generalizable cultural theory, demonstrating how the Weberian
   concept of theodicy adds to our understanding of commemorative rhetoric.
   In the case of September 11 commemorations, the theodicies deployed
   exhibit a clear fracture. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville,
   Pennsylvania, have taken a dualistic approach to the problem of
   theodicy, while speakers in Manhattan have taken a tragic approach. This
   variation can be explained through a four-part model that argues
   theodicies are structured by (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3)
   audiences, and (4) genre memory. More broadly, I argue for explicit
   attention to theodicy in cultural sociology, demonstrating that the
   quest for theodicy is a crucial driving force behind the impulse to
   commemorate in the first place.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Urban sociology has tended to study interactions between passersby and
   street persons with an emphasis on the ways street persons become
   bothersome, harassing, or dangerous. This article moves away from the
   focus on the ways interactions in public go awry and focuses on how
   individuals account for the mundane, everyday exchanges they have with
   strangers who seek their help. Based on interview data (N = 31) and
   qualitative analysis of data from an Internet survey (N = 110), this
   article suggests that the presence of beggars does not inherently
   symbolize urban decay to passersby and does not necessarily elicit
   anxiety, but instead provides a valuable texture of urban life. Further,
   the article argues that individuals, when justifying their responses to
   requests for help from needy persons (beggars) in urban spaces, use a
   variety of cultural strategies to maintain their perception of
   themselves as moral persons, both when they choose to help and when they
   refuse. Drawing from these findings, the article suggests that urban
   sociology and the sociology of risk would benefit from sensitizing their
   studies of public interactions to the diverse meanings individuals
   assign to them, rather than presupposing annoyance, anxiety, or fear as
   their predominant characteristic.</td>

   possibilities and providing broad legitimacy to political decision
   making. But do ordinary Americans actually want a deliberative public
   sphere? I examine this question in the context of four contentious
   religion and science debates. Through a multidimensional evaluation
   exercise with 62 ordinary respondents, I find that evaluation of public
   representatives in these debates tends to favor open-mindedness and
   ongoing debate. Further, respondents explicitly discount elected
   representatives who participate in public debate precisely because they
   are seen as violating deliberative norms through their affiliation with
   electoral politics. Respondents want a deliberative public sphere.
   However, this desire reflects an understanding of the public sphere and
   institutional politics as disconnected arenas with incompatible rules
   and objectives, raising multiple questions for democratic theory and for
   political sociology.</td>

   reexamines the influence of human rights treaties, with a focus on two

   that ratified them; and diffusethe effect of treaties on countries
   regardless of ratification. My analysis of two prominent human rights
   treaties finds that they often reduce levels of repression and abuse
   over time and independently of ratification. Some of these effects are
   nonlinear, reversing direction as time elapses or as more countries
   become party to the treaties. These findings are interpreted with
   reference to world polity institutionalism in sociology, and especially
   the Durkheimian strains of this approach. Human rights norms as embodied
   in treaties operate as a kind of civil religion for world society. These
   norms not only have long-term direct effects among countries that
   ritualistically ratify human rights treaties, but they also diffusely
   impact countries irrespective of formal endorsement.</td>

   Francisco Mayor George Moscone and city supervisor Harvey Milk, it is
   the latter who has achieved world recognition. At the time of their
   assassination Moscone was the more well-known figure, an American
   politician with a national reputation. The theories of social drama and
   cultural trauma are applied in this explanatory process. These theories
   provide a framework for analyzing how this incident became a significant
   event locally and nationally. The fact that Milk was one of the first
   openly gay people to hold public office in the United States meant that
   his life and death would have significance for a wide group of people.
   Individuals and organizations associated with gay liberation became
   carrier groups which created the Harvey Milk story and how it was told.
   Such carrier groups saw to it that Milk was remembered, and remembered
   in a particular way.</td>

   hypotheses in the social sciences. With process tracing tests, the
   analyst combines preexisting generalizations with specific observations

   Process tracing tests can be used to help establish that (1) an initial
   event or process took place, (2) a subsequent outcome also occurred, and
   (3) the former was a cause of the latter. The article focuses on the
   logic of different process tracing tests, including hoop tests, smoking
   gun tests, and straw in the wind tests. New criteria for judging the
   strength of these tests are developed using ideas concerning the
   relative importance of necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarities
   and differences between process tracing and the deductive-nomological

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article approaches work talk, a neglected but vital object of
   sociological inquiry, as a possible key to unlocking the mystery of the
   contemporary work ethic as it appears among male professionals living
   and working in the United States and Western Europe. This analytical
   task is carried out through a close examination of the contrasting
   rhetorics, scripts, and vocabularies anchoring French, Norwegian, and
   American forms of hard work talk. This comparative exercise capitalizes
   on material from over one hundred in-depth interviews with comparable
   French, Norwegian, and American male business professionals working in
   finance, law, consulting, engineering and other professional fields.
   Scrutinizing the scripts that members of these three groups use to
   address their motives for working hard in demanding jobs, this article
   maps a legitimation divide between the American respondents and their
   French and Norwegian counterparts. The hard work commentaries of the
   French and Norwegian respondents feature script repertoires that focus
   exclusively on the stimulating and enriching character of their work
   activities. By contrast, the commentaries of the American respondents
   incorporate overachievement scripts addressing both the extrinsic
   rewards of work and the personality traits that make hard work a natural
   expression of personality. These hard work commentaries invoke career
   success and moneymaking as inducements to hard work. But they also
   invoke personality traits such as drive and the innate aversion to
   leisure. This transatlantic divide reflects the greater cultural
   resonance of self-realization in the two European contexts and the fact
   that the French and Norwegians have embraced a more Maslowian approach
   to working life. As I argue in the article's conclusion, these
   transatlantic differences in script repertoires can be viewed as the
   product of the societally specific cultural configurations at work in
   the three countries. Such cultural configurations define what it
   means-in terms of status and authenticity-to work hard in a remunerative
   and rewarding job.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article, I ask for whom is our teaching developed? Although we
   typically think that it is developed for our students, there appears to
   be a considerable gap between how our curriculum, especially
   Introductory Sociology is organized, and what we know about current
   college students. Drawing on data on enrollment in sociology and overall
   in colleges and universities along with recent scholarly portraits of
   college students by Nathan (2005), Clydesdale (2007), and Arum and Roska
   (2011), I offer the following argument: (1) Our "students" are primarily
   those who take Introductory Sociology, and this class, indeed, is our
   public face for most nonacademics; (2) given where U.S. college students
   matriculate, all too often, Introductory Sociology is likely being
   taught by someone not as well connected as we might like to our main
   professional organization; (3) comprehensive textbooks dominate the
   Introductory Sociology market and contain more information that can
   reasonably be covered in one semester; (4) college students are
   "practical credentialists" who spend relatively little time outside of
   the classroom on their studies; and (5) whether or not we as
   sociologists agree on what needs to be covered in Introductory Sociology
   and other courses, we have derived these understandings among ourselves,
   paying little attention to what skills and knowledge our students want
   and/or need. If Introductory Sociology really is our public face, we
   clearly need to spend a considerable amount of time in making sure that
   this is how we want to be seen.</td>

   how they, along with most Americans, tend toward overconsumption. To a
   more limited extent, it may help enhance cognitive understanding of
   consumption. Teaching about consumption in general, and the Not Buying
   It project in particular, offers instructors an excellent pedagogical
   means by which students can acquire a sociological imagination,

   critically assess their world by relating the course content to their
   everyday world. This article details a photography project that has been
   assigned in lower level sociology courses at a four-year university and
   a community college. The project has been successful in encouraging
   students to develop their critical thinking skills and locate course
   material within the context of their everyday lived experiences.
   Examples from projects and a content analysis of 87 anonymous reflection
   papers demonstrate that the project allows students to (1) relate the
   course material to their everyday world, (2) engage in an intellectually
   challenging assignment, (3) critically examine their taken-for-granted
   worlds, and (4) have fun while completing a challenging academic

   teaching undergraduate research methods that (1) incorporates active
   learning assignments and discussion-based learning, (2) integrates a
   cross-discipline and cross-method faculty guest discussion facilitators
   series, and (3) focuses on the challenges and rewards of conducting
   research. The authors propose that opportunities for faculty teaching
   and research collaborations may result from the implementation of these
   strategies in the context of dwindling institutional resources and
   increasing professional demands. Finally, the authors consider how
   involving students in active learning projects focusing on research, and
   encouraging more open and honest dialogue about the challenges,
   struggles, and failures faculty members experience when conducting their
   own research, generates a reciprocal learning environment that is
   enriching for both students and faculty members.</td>

   an analysis of how conceptions of kinship and constructions of race
   shape how families are sorted and matched in an adoption marketplace.
   Drawn from a national sample of adoptive households (n = 63,681), the
   author analyzes whether there is significant variation in the likelihood
   of white married, single, divorced, and same-sex couples choosing
   transracial adoption. Results indicate that "nontraditional" same-sex
   and single adoptive parents are the most likely to adopt non-white
   children, even when controlling for additional market variables.
   Although white adoptive parents, in general, are more likely to
   transracially adopt Hispanic and Asian children, white single and
   same-sex adoptive parents are significantly more likely to adopt black
   children. The author's findings underscore the importance of considering
   how market forces shape even the most intimate aspects of family
   building decisions.</td>

   told through evolving uses of the concept of urban metabolism. After
   recounting the emergence of the modern society-nature opposition in the
   separation of town and country under early industrial capitalism, I
   interpret three ecologiessuccessive periods of urban metabolism research
   spanning three disciplines within the social sciences. The first is the
   human ecology of the Chicago School, which treated the city as an
   ecosystem in analogy to external, natural ecosystems. The second is
   industrial ecology: materials-flow analyses of cities that conceptualize
   external nature as the source of urban metabolism's raw materials and
   the destination for its social wastes. The third is urban political
   ecology, a reconceptualization of the city as a product of diverse
   socio-natural flows. By analyzing these three traditions in succession,
   I demonstrate both the efficacy and the limits to Catton and Dunlap's
   distinction between a human exemptionalist paradigm and a new ecological
   paradigm in sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>U.S. immigration has changed dramatically in the last 20 years:
   immigrants have increasingly gravitated toward new destinations and a
   growing portion are undocumented. In the absence of federal
   comprehensive immigration reform, states are proposing a patchwork of
   laws. While some laws encourage immigrant integration, most seek
   restriction. To understand this trend, this article analyzes Utah as a
   new immigration destination, exploring its transformation from an
   inclusive to a restrictive state. It focuses on a major debate: whether
   to allow unauthorized residents legal driving privileges. Because Utah
   initiated this law earlier than most, it leads this debate. To explain
   its evolution, this article analyzes 10 years of legislative debates and
   articles published on this law. Building on the narrative studies
   literature, I find that both sides of the immigration debate utilized a
   public safety and well-being narrative. However, supporters of the
   driver license law relied on a lower mimetic narrative, characterized by
   logic and factual arguments. In contrast, their opponents wove a
   compelling, apocalyptic narrative to criticize the law. This narrative
   indelibly linked immigration to the dangers of crime and terrorism and
   thus paved the way for the passage of one of the most restrictive
   immigration laws in the United States.</td>

   together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues
   relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1)
   social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend
   socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins
   interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of
   religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively
   substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms
   play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization
   plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious
   outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications
   for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious
   homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as
   limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed. (c)

   chiefly due to the influence of national color-blind ideologies and the
   diversity discourse that follows. Because this ideology and discourse
   are individual in nature and centered on a white norm, it chiefly
   produces consumption-driven actions for individuals and collective
   action that protects those with racial privilege. While prior studies
   have detailed the influence of this ideology on racial attitudes and
   examined the contours of diversity discourse generally, this study
   utilizes the racial formations approach to make concrete links to social
   outcomes in a diverse community. These findings are particularly

   arguments and accusations have abounded regarding economics,
   citizenship, criminality, and culture, but race has remained
   conspicuously sidelined in public discussion. I argue that race is in
   fact central to the debate on immigration, both by those opposed to any
   legalization of undocumented workers in the US and those who favor a
   temporary worker ('work visa') program. In this article, I examine how
   both anti-immigration and pro-work-visa groups framed the immigration
   debate as reported in newspaper articles in the particularly contentious
   period from December 2005 to November 2006. I performed a content
   analysis of three newspapers representing three different regions and
   three differing histories of immigration: the Chicago Tribune, the
   Houston Chronicle, and the Raleigh News &amp; Observer. Using Blumer's group
   position theory, I examine the patterns within the discussion for
   evidence of preservation of racial group position on the part of both
   anti-immigration and pro-work visa advocates.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Social scientists have intensely debated the use of deception in
   experimental research, and conflicting norms governing the use of
   deception are now firmly entrenched along disciplinary lines. Deception
   is typically allowed in sociology and social psychology but proscribed
   in economics. Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are
   generally not based on ethical considerations but on pragmatic grounds:
   the anti-deception camp argues that deceiving participants leads to
   invalid results, while the other side argues that deception has little
   negative impact and, under certain conditions, can even enhance
   validity. These divergent norms governing the use of deception are
   important because they stifle interdisciplinary research and discovery,
   create hostilities between disciplines and researchers, and can
   negatively impact the careers of scientists who may be sanctioned for
   following the norms of their home discipline. We present two
   experimental studies aimed at addressing the issue empirically. Study 1
   addresses the effects of direct exposure to deception, while Study 2
   addresses the effects of indirect exposure to deception. Results from
   both studies suggest that deception does not significantly affect the
   validity of experimental results.</td>

   cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies
   on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the
   contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways
   are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93
   interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s
   to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional
   markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models
   do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities?
   In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that
   respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an
   inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I
   demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and
   women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful
   family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their
   performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left
   many lost in transition.</td>

   language - formerly absent from almost all constitutions - now appears
   in most of them. Rather than characterizing developed or democratic
   states, human rights language is, first, especially common in countries
   most susceptible to global influences. Second, human rights language is
   driven by the extent of the international human rights regime at the
   time of a constitution's writing. Third, human rights language tends to
   appear in newer constitutions and in the constitutions of emergent and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Despite the prominence of teaching in academia, we know little about how
   graduate students learn to teach. We propose the concept of a teaching
   community network (TCN), an informal social network that facilitates the
   exchange of teaching-specific resources. We explore the role of TCNs
   through a case study of a sociology doctoral program at a large state
   university. Results reveal that students rely heavily on informal ties
   within the graduate student community and existing formal programs to
   share teaching-related resources (e.g., information and social support)
   and develop their identities as instructors. We suggest that graduate
   programs facilitate TCNs through formal teacher-training programs and
   structural conditions that encourage informal, one-on-one interactions
   (e.g., shared offices). By cultivating TCNs, graduate programs can
   assist students in developing their teaching skills and identities as
   instructors, thus training students to balance the demands of research
   and teaching within an academic culture.</td>

   made substantive yet marginalized contributions to the discipline. Its
   accomplishments include, but are not limited to, its establishment of
   the first American school of sociology, the first sociology program to
   institutionalize the use of the insider researcher, the first sociology
   program to institutionalize the practice of method triangulation, and
   the first sociology program to institutionalize the acknowledgment of
   limitations in its publications. Despite these accomplishments, the
   Atlanta Sociological Laboratory remains unknown to most professional
   sociologists. This article examines why the accomplishments of this

   community partners when engaging in community-based learning. Often when
   faculty incorporate service- or community-based learning into their
   classes, we measure the "learning" part but not the "service" or
   "community." Focusing more on the latter involves working "with"
   community partners instead of working "for" community partners, and this
   focus creates a more effective experience for all stakeholders involved.
   Achieving this goal of working "with" partners not only requires
   collaboration but also requires an effort to create and develop a sense
   of agency among the community partners. In the current teaching note,
   collaborative projects between undergraduate sociology classes and a
   local senior center are discussed. These projects show enhanced learning
   for the college students as well as an enhanced experience for community
   partners due to the emphasis on establishing and nurturing agency among
   community partners.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article develops the concept of experiential careers, drawing
   theoretical attention to the routinization and de-routinization of
   specific experiences as they unfold over social career trajectories.
   Based on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in two religious
   communities, we compare the social-temporal patterning of religious
   experience among newly religious Orthodox Jews and converted Muslims in
   two cities in the United States. In both cases, we find that as newly
   religious people work to transform their previous bodily habits and take
   on newly prescribed religious acts, the beginning of their religious
   careers becomes marked by what practitioners describe as potent
   religious experiences in situations of religious practice. However, over
   time, these once novel practices become routinized and religious
   experiences in these situations diminish, thus provoking actors and
   institutions in both fields to work to re-enchant religious life.
   Through this ethnographic comparison, we demonstrate the utility of
   focusing on experiential careers as a sociological unit of analysis.
   Doing so allows sociologists to use a non-reductive phenomenological
   approach to chart the shifting manifestations of experiences people
   deeply care about, along with the patterned enchantments,
   disenchantments, and possible re-enchantments these social careers
   entail. As such, this approach contributes to the analysis of social
   careers and experiences of "becoming" across both religious and
   non-religious domains.</td>

   The second part discusses the character of the group differences that

   biosocial causation to include the genetic effects of ancestry. The
   third part develops the argument for a "bounded nature" reformulation of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In contemporary sociology the once prominent study of public opinion has
   virtually disappeared. None of the leading theoretical models in the
   closest disciplinary subfield (political sociology) currently provide
   ample or sufficiently clear space for consideration of public opinion as
   a possible factor in shaping or interacting with key policy or political
   outcomes in democratic polities. In this article, we unearth and
   document the sources of this curious development and raise questions
   about its implications for how political sociologists have come to
   understand policy making, state formation, and political conflict. We
   begin by reconstructing the dismissal of public opinion in the
   intellectual reorientation of political sociology from the late 1970s
   onward. We argue that the most influential scholarly works of this
   period (including those of Tilly, Skocpol, Mann, Esping-Andersen, and
   Domhoff) face an underlying paradox: While often rejecting public
   opinion, their theoretical logics ultimately presuppose its operation.
   These now classical writings did not move toward research programs
   seeking engagement with the operation and formation of public opinion,
   even though our immanent critique suggests they in fact require
   precisely this turn. We address the challenge of reconceptualizing how
   public opinion might be productively integrated into the sociological
   study of politics by demonstrating that the major arguments in the
   subfield can be fruitfully extended by grappling with public opinion. We
   conclude by considering several recent, interdisciplinary examples of
   scholarship that, we argue, point the way toward a fruitful
   revitalization.</td>

   examine the ritualistic outcomes of collective effervescence, emotional
   energy, and group symbols and solidarity among sport fans. I illustrate
   these concepts using case study data from participant observation of
   fans of a U.S. football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and content
   analysis of news articles. I extend Collins' interaction ritual (IR)
   theory by taking the group as the unit of analysis and analyzing group
   solidarity beyond situational interactions and typical sport settings,
   including the significant life events of weddings and funerals. While
   critiquing Collins' (2004) a priori portrayal of sports fans, the
   analysis advances IR theory, improving its utility for understanding
   sports fan behavior.</td>

   establishment of trade-conducive transnational institutions play an
   important role in augmenting the potential for trade globalization,
   there is more disagreement surrounding alternative causal explanations
   of trade during the postwar period. While world-system scholars argue
   that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is
   powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive
   policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the
   emanation of cultural scripts that create compatible national
   institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these
   theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945
   to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results
   provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in
   the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade
   globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the
   world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively
   associated with international trade, there is little evidence to
   validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental
   organizations enhances trade globalization.</td>

   irreducible form of material practice which cannot be adequately

   aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This
   article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive

   present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism
   appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and
   archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling,
   the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce
   educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort,
   unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be
   interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a
   virtuous identity, claims to be "one who aspires."</td>

   punitive agendas in contemporary US politics. Melding existing
   theoretical discussions of penal trends with insights drawn from my own
   ethnographic research on the contemporary anti-trafficking movement in
   the United States-the most recent domain of feminist activism in which a
   crime frame has prevailed against competing models of social justice-I
   elaborate upon the ways that neoliberalism and the politics of sex and
   gender have intertwined to produce a carceral turn in feminist advocacy
   movements previously organized around struggles for economic justice and
   liberation. Taking the anti-trafficking movement as a case study, I
   further demonstrate how human rights discourse has become a key vehicle
   both for the transnationalization of carceral politics and for the
   reincorporation of these policies into the domestic terrain in a
   benevolent, feminist guise. I conclude by urging greater and more
   nuanced attention to the operations of gender and sexual politics within
   mainstream analyses of contemporary modes of punishment, as well as a
   careful consideration of the neoliberal carceral state within feminist
   discussions of gender, sexuality, and the law.</td>

   developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding
   expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed
   towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the "new" military. We
   hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no
   longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many
   uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant
   consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such
   consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this
   hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed
   and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that
   military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per
   soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither
   total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a
   significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's "new"
   military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an
   equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. (C)

   Sicilian bluefin tuna fishery during the modern era. The analysis
   utilizes a sociological framework that draws on theory from
   environmental sociology, specifically metabolic rift theory. Escalating
   pressure on the fishery has contributed to a host of environmental and
   social problems, including pushing this important fishery to the brink
   of collapse. Using a combination of primary and secondary source data,
   this research employs sociological methods and analyzes recent changes
   in the socio-ecological metabolism of the fishery. The study explores
   the unsustainable nature of capitalist food production by examining the
   'rift' in the society and nature metabolism that has emerged in the
   modern Sicilian bluefin tuna fishery. It advances the discussion on the
   ways in which the social relations of modern capitalist production have
   transformed the socio-ecological metabolism in agri-food production.</td>

   (Baker) and 1984 to 1999 (Chin). The current study traces manuscripts
   published in Teaching Sociology from 2000 to 2009. We examine both who
   publishes in the journal and what gets published. In particular, we
   explore change in the systematic assessment of teaching methods and
   techniques since Baker's and Chin's studies and the extent to which
   publications in Teaching Sociology reflect improved assessment. We find
   that while there has been improvement, not all articles reflect the
   growing scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) movement. While the
   mission of Teaching Sociology is to publish materials that would be
   "helpful to the discipline's teachers" (see the journal's mission
   statement at http://asanet.org/journals/ts/index.cfm), the most useful
   information is arguably that which is supported by the kind of
   systematic assessment that SoTL requires. We also discuss implications
   for assessment and sociological SoTL.</td>

   away from the individual, and that students gained a greater

   the course was important for their success but somewhat frustrating.
   Other important student perceptions were that the course was demanding
   and time consuming; past courses helped prepare for the capstone
   experience but that there are gaps in this preparation; they learn best
   via active learning, feedback, and application; they are proud of their
   course achievements; and they are engaged in the discipline but are

   teaching theory is a challenge. A number of activities have been created
   to engage students in sociological theory courses. This note discusses
   an exercise that adds to these activities and is tied to the learning
   outcomes of a theory course. The author's students are given a
   challenge: For 72 hours back-to-back, avoid checking or communicating
   via Facebook or MySpace; making calls from cell phones, unless it is an
   emergency; and texting or e-mailing from cell phones and handheld
   devices. The author found that this Technology Fast Challenge helped
   students foster a sociological perspective and allowed them to engage
   the ideas and questions of major social theorists. The author discusses
   the format of the challenge, the outcomes, and applications to other
   courses.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course
   trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel
   data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents'
   attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured
   or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from
   cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other
   fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a
   rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel
   conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in
   prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among
   adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey
   questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were
   considerably less likely than members of a control group to report
   substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has
   important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to
   be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological
   issue.</td>

   Guided by a social constructionist perspective, findings from five

   research and documentary remain at the social issue level-a phenomenon
   that exists in society, but has not yet been defined as a social

   affecting many thousands of domestic violence victims and their

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>What is the relationship between state-level politics and the resources
   devoted to children's health insurance programs (CHIP)? The authors
   asses this question by drawing on theories from the power resources,
   institutionalist, logic of industrialism, and racial threat schools of
   thought. The authors find that each approach offers some explanatory
   power for per capita CHIP spending. In particular, Republican strength
   in state legislatures and governorships are associated with diminished
   CHIP spending. Professionalized state legislatures, strong state
   financial capacities, and states with a legacy of social policy
   innovation were linked to greater CHIP spending. States with more
   uninsured children tended to spend more per capita. And states with
   greater numbers of blacks spent less per capita. But there was no
   similar effect for Hispanics. The authors conclude that an array of
   forces at the state level figure prominently in cross-state inequality
   and the prospects for social citizenship.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Theorized links between science and secularism are prevalent in classic
   sociological thought. More recently, scholars have critiqued these
   frameworks as oversimplified and empirically untenable. In response to
   such criticisms, contemporary researchers typically overlook or actively
   argue against links between science and secularism. This study analyzes
   data from a random, national survey of adults to examine the empirical
   connections between perceptions of science and secular identities in the
   United States. Analyses demonstrate that perceptions of science
   correlate strongly with American secularism, particularly among atheists
   and agnostics. Additionally, politicized views of science help account
   for the previously documented relationship between political and secular
   identities in the United States. A perspective drawing on the sociology
   of culture and perceived knowledge provides a more useful framework for
   understanding these patterns than theories of secularization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Contemporary social research often has located religion's public
   influence by focusing on individual or collective religious actors. In
   this unitary actor model, religion is a stable, uniform feature of an
   individual or collectivity. However, recent research shows that people's
   religious expression outside religious congregations varies by context.
   Building on this new work, along with insights from Erving Goffman and
   cultural sociology, an alternative, "cultural-interactionist model" of
   religious expression focuses on how group styles enable and constrain
   religious expression in public settings. Illustrating the model are two
   ethnographic cases, a religiously sponsored homeless advocacy
   organization and a secondary comparison setting from an activist
   campaign for housing, both from a U.S. metropolitan area. Shifting from
   actors to settings and group styles clarifies the interplay between
   religious and nonreligious culture over time. The shift refines our
   understanding of how religion's civic or political effects work, as in
   the case of building social capital for collective action. The
   cultural-interactionist model enables us to track historical change in
   everyday group settings. It promotes further research on historically
   changing ways of managing religious diversity, and diverse ways of
   constructing a religious self.</td>

   on this tradition by expanding the discursive locations from which to

   for lifestyle change and expand the concept to include environmental
   practices and themes. I adopt a pragmatist perspective to understand
   lifestyle change as a deliberate process undertaken in response to a

   stratification are defined as the effects of social class origins on
   preparation for future educational attainment. The secondary effects are
   then the net direct effects of social class on the transition to the
   next higher level of education, which are interpreted as average effects
   of class conditions on students' choices. In this article, the standard
   model of primary and secondary effects is laid out in explicit form, and
   primary and secondary effects are then estimated for college entry among
   recent high school graduates in the United States. The challenges of
   estimating these effects for educational transitions in the United
   States are then explained, focusing on the weak warrant for causal
   inference that is used to justify the calculation of counterfactual net
   differences across classes. Alternative estimates of associational
   primary and secondary effects are then offered, after which the
   prospects for the identification of causal secondary effects by
   conditioning on additional confounders are assessed. In conclusion, an
   appeal is made for attention to the policy-relevant patterns of
   heterogeneity that research on primary and secondary effects may be able
   to reveal, and a case is made for elaboration and direct identification
   of the presupposed choice mechanism that has been assumed to generate
   secondary effects in past research.</td>

   empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in
   which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be
   evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of
   individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which
   the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and
   interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations
   of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which
   we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations
   of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were
   formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a
   multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to
   address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural
   reception in a single analytic framework.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article examines why global corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   frameworks have gained popularity in the past decade, despite their
   uncertain costs and benefits, and how they affect adherents' behavior.
   We focus on the two largest global frameworks-the United Nations Global
   Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative-to examine patterns of CSR
   adoption by governments and corporations. Drawing on institutional and
   political-economy theories, we develop a new analytic framework that
   focuses on four key environmental factors-global institutional pressure,
   local receptivity, foreign economic penetration, and national economic
   system. We propose two arguments about the relationship between stated
   commitment and subsequent action: decoupling due to lack of capacity and
   organized hypocrisy due to lack of will. Our cross-national time-series
   analyses show that global institutional pressure through nongovernmental
   linkages encourages CSR adoption, but this pressure leads to ceremonial
   commitment in developed countries and to substantive commitment in
   developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries, liberal economic
   policies increase ceremonial commitment, suggesting a pattern of
   organized hypocrisy whereby corporations in developed countries make
   discursive commitments without subsequent action. We also find that in
   developing countries, short-term trade relations exert greater influence
   on corporate CSR behavior than do long-term investment transactions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However,
   a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral
   behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use
   identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity
   theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify
   their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on
   the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience
   negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue.
   Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations
   that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling
   rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural
   expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally.
   We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university
   students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing
   situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings
   reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are
   significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt
   and shame.</td>

   defines IVs, summarizes their origins, and describes their use in

   the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume

   in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways
   to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in

   election, the article examines recent increases in youth participation.
   Third and finally, this article discusses the case of the Obama

   the complex relationship between movements and electoral politics in
   America today. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities for

   both structural and interactional approaches, stressing shared and
   ongoing meaning. Groups constitute social order, just as groups are
   themselves constituted by that order. The examination of local action
   reveals how interaction orders emerge and create meanings that spread
   throughout a wider network. Despite the limits of a meso-level analysis
   in examining both external webs of constraint and immediate
   negotiations, this approach addresses identity, social capital,
   collective action, group culture, networks, and civil society. By
   building on collective identity, shared history, common spaces, and

   individuals fit into larger structures and through which social
   structures shape individuals.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article, I review three contemporary streams of scholarship that
   are revitalizing the cultural analysis of religion, an approach that
   dates to the discipline's founding. Research from an institutional field
   perspective focuses on the institutions that shape religious belief,
   practice, and mobilization. Work on lived religion, including
   neo-Durkheimian approaches, focuses on religious experience and
   contested practices of sacralization. Scholarship on religious cultural
   tools and symbolic boundaries analyzes religion as symbolic
   legitimation. These three approaches avoid serious problems associated
   with both market and secularization accounts, in part because of the way
   they conceptualize religious authority and religious identity, and in
   part because of their broader scope of inquiry. In the conclusion, I
   combine the insights from these approaches to articulate a promising
   agenda for future research, offering a set of focus questions that are
   relevant to both classical and contemporary concerns about religion's
   role in modern societies.</td>

   organizational and economic sociology during the past two decades.
   Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and
   between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of
   status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the
   contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the
   effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are
   produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has
   contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status
   hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value
   of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than
   focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential
   directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed
   efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and
   substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status
   processes.</td>

   a resource. We can understand this as a position that a social actor
   occupies, or we can imagine such resources as a possession of an actor.
   The study of elites is the study of power and inequality, from above. It
   involves looking at the distribution of social resources, which can
   include economic, social, cultural, political, or knowledge capital. It
   also means exploring the role of institutions such as schools, families,
   and clubs in how such resources are organized and distributed. Over the
   past decade, particularly as social power and economic rewards have
   become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, elite
   sociology has experienced a revival. Empirical observations of these
   phenomena point to the changing character of American inequality.</td>

   and population growth over the past half-century, challenging existing
   paradigms of urban form, race relations, social movements, and
   immigration. This review shows how the timing of Southern
   urbanization-much later than in the Northeast and Midwest-has
   contributed to Southern cities' distinctive spatial patterns and
   political and economic structures. Southern cities were crucial to
   regional transformation, including the Civil Rights Movement and the end
   of one-party rule in the South. Moreover, Southern cities exemplify key
   trends of the contemporary political economy: a new relationship to
   regional industrialization, new forms of entrepreneurial governance,
   flexible labor markets, the importance of finance and producer services,
   and "new destination" immigration. I conclude by examining two Southern
   cities for their relevance to central themes in contemporary social
   research: Atlanta for the study of the African American experience and
   New Orleans for the sociology of catastrophe.</td>

   theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the
   context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for
   how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be
   successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing
   and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is
   made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only
   be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is
   called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is
   iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the
   basic rules for theorizing.</td>

   from several theoretical perspectives in order to explain the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be
   through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a
   three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination
   despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department.
   In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into
   racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into
   institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and
   their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the
   phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not
   to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the
   authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to
   learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the
   classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting
   students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for
   related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public
   sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the
   traditional classroom environment.</td>

   persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The
   expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence
   in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception
   of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes
   promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the
   status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are
   substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries
   around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly
   asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms
   of socialization that promote active participation as well as the
   capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of
   533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries
   published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed
   become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the
   rising status of individuals and children in global human rights
   treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in
   countries with greater individualism embodied in political and
   socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world
   society. The study contributes to both political and educational
   sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on
   empowered individual agency in intended curricula.</td>

   demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing
   uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel
   probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty
   about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using
   data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that
   uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young
   adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing
   HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight
   into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives.
   Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to
   accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are
   certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that
   personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can
   illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors.</td>

   in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is investigated through
   a case study of one sociologist, Emile Durkheim, in a single country,
   France. Reactionary and radical forms of anti-Semitism are distinguished
   and contrasted to Durkheim's sociological perspective. Durkheim's
   remarks about the Jews directly addressed anti-Semitic claims about
   them, their role in French society, and their relationship to modernity.
   At the same time, Durkheim was engaged in a reinterpretation of the
   French Revolution and its legacies that indirectly challenged other
   tenets of French anti-Semitism. In sum, Durkheim's work contains direct
   and indirect responses to reactionary and radical forms of
   anti-Semitism, and together these responses form a coherent alternative
   vision of the relationship between modernity and the Jews.</td>

   can take different strategic forms, such as accessing, bridging, and
   embedding. Pairing this conceptualization with a social-evolutionary
   framework, I argue that the emergence and increasing or decreasing
   prevalence of each form over time result from (1) a combination of
   factors at three analytical levelsmicroagency, mesonetwork, and
   macroinstitutionaland (2) endogenous processes of selection. By focusing
   on behavioral forms and their evolution, this framework is able to
   bridge divides in the guanxi literature, provide a foundation for
   comparative studies of network behavior across societies, and connect
   the study of guanxi with economic sociology more broadly.</td>

   "errors" that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a
   new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity:
   the "epistemic accident," grounded in a constructivist understanding of
   knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic
   accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their
   relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and
   reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and

   own critical globalization perspective. The first three parts summarize
   and assess Wallerstein's theoretical system and his many contributions
   to macro, historical and comparative sociology, to development studies
   and international political economy. The fourth discusses Wallerstein's
   assessment of the evolution of the world capitalist system in recent
   decades, including his views on the concept of globalization, and the
   fifth focuses on earlier and more recent critical appraisals of his
   work, including the present author's own, in light of the recent
   transformations in world capitalism identified with globalization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The goal of this article is to highlight the major trends in the
   establishment of public libraries in developing countries under
   conditions of globalization. Based on a review of research from library
   history and the sociology of culture, the author develops hypotheses
   about the conditions under which public libraries are likely to be
   established in relatively large numbers in developing countries.
   Analysis of historical trends in library establishments and crisp-set
   qualitative comparative analysis of UNESCO data on public libraries in
   six developing nations reveal that globalization is associated with
   decreasing or flat numbers of public libraries on a per capita basis.
   The only observed exceptions are Malaysia and Chile, where public
   libraries have been established in large numbers partly for purposes of
   national integration as a counter to sectarian and ethnic heterogeneity.
   Implications of these findings for research in the information society
   paradigm, and for development theory, are discussed.</td>

   of the 2010 International Sociological Association's (ISA) World
   Congress in Gothenburg, Sweden. Within the Congress, the Research
   Committee 53, Sociology of Childhood, organized a panel focused on the
   health and well-being of children. Together, this collection makes two
   distinct contributions: first in terms of considering children's health
   disparities as an area of concern within sociology, and second by
   considering children's health as a factor that shapes other areas of
   children's well-being. In addition, these papers offer novel empirical
   research on children's health and varied methodological and theoretical
   orientations. Each paper also makes contributions to social policy,
   first in the area of infant health affecting later educational outcomes,
   second in the area of family structure and children's health, and
   additionally in understanding type 2 diabetes for children at the
   individual and structural levels. Finally, these studies highlight the
   interplay-between the individuals' health on the one hand and structure
   and culture on the other-as children's life chances are shaped.</td>

   develop critical thinking skills through inquiry and reflective writing.
   Students compile questions and reflections throughout the course and, at
   the end of the term, use their writings for a comprehensive analytic
   self-reflection that examines their intellectual and sociological
   growth. Following Schwalbe's (2008) urging to emphasize sociological
   thinking over disciplinary nuances in introductory courses, we describe
   several complementary methods for teaching students how to think like
   sociologists. We detail five inquiry exercises and three reflection
   exercises that build up to the final analytic reflection essay. The
   unique value of these exercises is that students not only engage the
   course material throughout the course but also learn to examine their
   own writing as data. In doing so, students learn to value the process of
   learning, inquiry, and critical self-reflection while acquiring and
   constructing self-knowledge.</td>

   small groups and a set of rotating group roles: discussion leader,
   passage master, devil's advocate, creative connector, and reporter.
   Students meet with their group regularly in class throughout the
   semester. Before each group meeting, they are to complete a set of
   readings and a reading preparation sheet for their given reading group
   role. In this article, we outline how to implement these groups, the

   employee non-compete agreements. The sociology of work has overlooked
   non-competes, but data indicate that nearly half of technical
   professionals in the United States are asked to sign such employment
   contracts. Fearing loss of investments in talent and trade secrets,
   firms use non-competes to "strike back" against technical professionals'
   increased mobility following the decline of internal labor markets.
   In-depth interviews with 52 randomly sampled patent holders in a single
   industry, coupled with a survey of 1,029 engineers across a variety of
   industries, reveal that ex-employees subject to non-competes are more
   likely to take career detours-that is, they involuntarily leave their
   technical field to avoid a potential lawsuit. Moreover, firms
   strategically manage the process of getting workers to sign such
   contracts, waiting for workers' bargaining position to weaken. These
   findings inform our understanding of the social organization of work in
   the knowledge economy.</td>

   general election in Malaysia. Using the population of electoral
   candidates in the 2008 general election ( N = 471), the author estimates
   a logistic model predicting the effects of having a blog on winning a
   Parliamentary seat. The results show that opposition candidates benefit
   significantly more from having a blog than do non-opposition candidates,
   as blogging provides opportunities denied to them by Malaysia's
   state-controlled media. Bloggers are more than seven times as likely to
   win an election compared to non-bloggers, controlling for incumbency,
   party membership, and race. In addition to being an alternative avenue
   of information distribution, blogs' potential for building interpersonal
   relationships and their role as mobilization tools in media-controlling
   states are discussed using qualitative examples.</td>

   perspective in political science recognize the importance of examining
   the rise and fall of world powers, and generally agree on the main
   causal mechanisms responsible for the rise and fall process. However,
   there is much less convergence between these perspectives on the
   indicators used to measure the relative power of nation-states. Thus,
   although in agreement over theory, there is much less agreement on the
   identity and timing of hegemonies. This article attempts to overcome
   this impasse by creating a hegemony index to assess the power structure
   of the capitalist world-system. Though results support the world-economy
   view of three hegemons since the 16th century, findings also contradict
   this perspective and show that England is the most powerful nation
   during two successive hegemonic sequences. Conclusions highlight the
   possibility of hegemonic resuccession, while supplementary analysis
   provides evidence of U.S. resuccession since the 1980s.</td>

   those failures not as the simple absence of network governance, but
   rather as a situation in which transactional conditions for network
   desirability obtain but network governance is impeded either by
   ignorance or opportunism, or by a combination of the two. It depicts
   network failures as continuous rather than discrete outcomes, shows that
   they have more than one cause, and pays particular attention to two
   undertheorized-if not undiscovered-types of network failure (i.e.,
   involution and contested collaboration). It thereby contributes to the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The great German theorist Niklas Luhmann argued long ago that meaning is
   the central construct of sociology. We agree, but our scheme of
   stochastic processes-evolved over many years as identity and
   control-argues for switchings of intercalated bits of social network and
   interpretive domain (i.e., netdom switchings) as the core of meaning
   processes. We thus challenge Luhmann's central claim that modern
   society's subsystems are based on communicative self-closure. We assert
   that there is refuting evidence from sociolinguistics, from how
   languages are put together and how languages' indexical and reflexive
   devices (e.g., metapragmatics, heteroglossia, genres) are used in social
   action. Communication is about managing indexicalities, which entail
   great ambiguity and openness as they are anchored in myriad netdom
   switchings across social times and spreads. In contrast, Luhmann's
   concept of communication revolves around binary codes governed
   recursively and algorithmically within systems in efforts to reduce
   complexity from the environment. We conclude that systems closure does
   not solve the problem of uncertainty in social life. In fact, lack of
   uncertainty is itself a problem. Order is necessary, but order at the
   edge of chaos.</td>

   influenced the organization of national and global economies and public
   policies since the 1970s. In this article, we examine the relationship
   between the neoliberal variant of globalization and science. To do so,
   we develop a framework for sociology of science that emphasizes closer
   ties among political sociology, the sociology of social movements, and
   economic and organizational sociology and that draws attention to
   patterns of increasing and uneven industrial influence amid several
   countervailing processes. Specifically, we explore three fundamental
   changes since the 1970s: the advent of the knowledge economy and the
   increasing interchange between academic and industrial research and
   development signified by academic capitalism and asymmetric convergence;
   the increasing prominence of science-based regulation of technology in
   global trade liberalization, marked by the heightened role of
   international organizations and the convergence of scientism and
   neoliberalism; and the epistemic modernization of the relationship
   between scientists and publics, represented by the proliferation of new
   institutions of deliberation, participation, activism, enterprise, and
   social movement mobilization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A satisfactory sociology of markets requires that both order and
   disorder in markets be addressed, yet sociologists have seemed more
   concerned with theorizing market stability and order. Change, however,
   is too fundamental a part of markets to receive so little sociological
   attention. One perspective that provides a fertile ground for moving
   ahead with developing an agenda for studying both stability and change
   in markets is American pragmatist social theory. This article therefore
   examines the influence of a pragmatist viewpoint on two broad modern
   theoretical approaches that have implications for the sociology of
   markets, one focused on stabilization processes, the other on
   institutional designs for promoting change. Most particularly, it draws
   on work carried out from a pragmatist viewpoint and illustrates a
   pragmatic approach to change in markets using the case of the EU's
   Forest, Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) action plan and
   initiative.</td>

   their attention on the production of knowledge. More recently, scholars
   have begun to investigate more fully the structures and processes that
   impede the production of knowledge. This article draws on interviews
   conducted with 41 academic researchers to present a phenomenological
   examination of "forbidden knowledge''-a phrase that refers to knowledge
   considered too sensitive, dangerous, or taboo to produce. Forbidden
   knowledge has traditionally been understood as a set of formal controls
   on what ought not be known. We argue that the social processes that
   create forbidden knowledge are embedded in the everyday practices of
   working scientists. The narrative legacies of past controversies in
   science are of particular importance, as they serve as a tool that
   working scientists use to justify, construct, and hide their acceptance
   of forbidden knowledge. As a result, the precise contents of forbidden
   knowledge are fluid, fuzzy, essentially contested, specialty specific,
   locally created, and enforced.</td>

   the workplace have gained a notable status in sociology and psychology
   of the workplace during the last three decades in the US and in the
   other industrialized nations. One area in which the ongoing debates and
   evidence are inconclusive is the job rewards associated with HPWOs in
   the manufacturing and service economies. Analysing functional and
   numerical flexibilities (the 'internalization' and 'externalization'
   strategies) adopted in the manufacturing and service sectors, this study
   intends to extend our understanding of associations between workplace
   restructuring (HPWOs) and job rewards. The findings reveal that
   'internalized' or standard employees have gained from internalization
   strategy with no significant differences between the two economic
   sectors. However, significant differences are disclosed when the
   consequences of externalization are contrasted between the sectors. The
   externalization strategy has significantly undermined job rewards for
   non-standard workers, except for independent contractors, especially in
   the manufacturing sector. The article ends with a short discussion on
   the theoretical significance of the findings and their policy
   implications in human sources management.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Budget exercises are frequently used in introductory and social problems
   courses to facilitate student understanding of income inequality. But do
   these exercises actually lead to greater sociological understanding? To
   explore this issue, the authors studied undergraduate students enrolled
   in introductory sociology courses during the 2008-2009 academic year.
   Using a unique pretest-pretest-posttest design, the authors captured
   student perceptions of issues of socioeconomic inequality at the
   beginning of the course, after completion of a traditional unit on
   stratification, and after participation in a budget exercise. The unique
   study design allows the authors to examine if and how students make
   gains in understanding inequality sociologically. They also consider
   other learning objectives, including fostering an appreciation of
   obstacles to social mobility and increasing general knowledge about
   inequality. The results suggest that both budget exercises and a
   traditional pedagogical unit of lecture, reading, and discussion play
   limited roles in fostering at least short-term sociological
   understanding as related to these goals.</td>

   educate everyone, from policy makers to community leaders, about the day
   to day realities of life with a shortage of money and an abundance of
   stress." The authors facilitated the CAPS program with two large groups
   of undergraduate students enrolled in sociology, gerontology, and
   psychology courses at a medium-sized private college in south-central
   Pennsylvania. The analysis examines the experiential learning outcomes
   of the students as they reflect on their participation in the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>When students enter college classrooms for the first time they
   inevitably have preconceived images of professors. According to research
   on student evaluations of teaching, these preconceptions have important
   implications in college classrooms. This study explores one avenue
   through which these preconceptions are perpetuated-popular film. Using
   content analysis, the authors examine popular films released between
   1985 and 2005 that contain professors in either primary or secondary
   roles. The findings show stereotypical depictions beyond glasses, bow
   ties, and tweed jackets. Specifically, the authors find stereotypical
   images of race and gender as well as an emphasis on the importance of
   research, sometimes at the expense of teaching or ethical behavior. This
   research provides instructors with knowledge of the stereotypes that
   students may have upon entering the college classroom, which may impact
   classroom interactions, and provides insight into how race and gender
   affect student evaluations of professors.</td>

   the democratization of credit, or financial inclusion: politics
   interfered with the market to benefit marginalized actors, only to cause
   instability and risk. Leftwing theorists focus instead on
   financialization: namely, the shift of profit-making activities from
   industry to finance. These views implicitly draw on Schumpeter and Marx.
   Much like their intellectual progenitors, they emphasize exogenous
   processes to explain financial change. Here I claim that the connection
   between financial innovation and financial inclusion is endogenous. I
   suggest two main typologies of financial innovators: Market Utopians
   (MUs) and Populist Innovators (PIs). Financial inclusion, I submit, is
   the byproduct of the quest for power of the latter.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Many theories of social construction make some reference to sight, yet
   few offer sustained examinations of perception. In light of this, I
   highlight the visual dimension of the social construction of reality by
   analyzing visual perception as a process of 'socio-mental filtration'.
   Building on theories of social construction - most notably those using
   the concepts 'frame', 'paradigm' and 'schema' in which expectations are
   the organizing force of experience, I focus on how social construction
   happens. One key effect of expectations is to enact selective attention,
   which is evocatively captured by the metaphor of a filter. Drawing on
   the case of sex and gender, I demonstrate that using filter analysis to
   identify the specific dynamics of 'socio-optical construction' - adding
   a concrete analysis of visual perception to the general idea of social
   construction - may help scholars to more effectively account for some of
   the 'hard problems' of constructionist theory, such as the body.</td>

   American Sociological Association (ASA) Award for Excellence in the
   Reporting of Social Issues, with the discipline of sociology. I reflect
   on Salgado's biography, method, and concerns in order to demonstrate how
   his work contributes to the awareness and understanding of social
   issues. Toward this end, I summarize sociology's record of involvement
   with visual documentation. Prior to 1915, the American Journal of
   Sociology regularly included photographs that provided visual
   documentation of environments under study. However, as sociology moved
   away from social reform activities and toward scientific investigation,
   the regular publication of photographs ceased. During the 1930s and
   1940s, photographic projects in disciplines and social movements beyond
   sociology developed a variety of methods that would prove useful to
   sociology. During the 1970s, sociologists once again began to use visual
   methods in their teaching, research, and publication, putting sociology
   in the position to both contribute to and benefit from insights and
   social commitments that have distinguished Sebastiao Salgado as a
   globally significant photographer and social activist during the late
   twentieth and early twenty-first centuries.</td>

   analysis examines the historically embedded mediating impact of the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>P&gt;The welfare of farm animals has become a continuing source of
   controversy as states seek greater regulation over the livestock
   industry. However, empirical studies addressing the determinants of
   public concern for farm-animal welfare are limited. Religion and
   politics, two institutional bases of attitudes, are rarely explored. Nor
   have sociologists responded systematically to the popular charge that
   people concerned with animal welfare care less about human well-being.
   This study builds from sociology's stratification literature to address
   new questions about farm-animal welfare. Using a range of animal-welfare
   attitudes and samples drawn from a statewide and a national population
   in 2007, we find support for the religious and political bases of
   farm-animal-welfare attitudes. Frequent church attendance is related to
   less concern with animal welfare. However, we also find that religious
   beliefs can be a source of support for animal welfare. Political
   orientation as reflected by desire for more economic equality and
   greater tolerance of outgroups is also related to concern for
   farm-animal welfare. Formal political partisanship and denomination have
   weaker effects. Concern with farm-animal welfare is consistently related
   to greater concern with human welfare in the food sector.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociology has long shied away from the problem of populism. This may be
   due to suspicion about the concept or uncertainty about how to fit
   populist cases into broader comparative matrices. Such caution is
   warranted: the existing interdisciplinary literature has been plagued by
   conceptual confusion and disagreement. But given the recent resurgence
   of populist politics in Latin America and elsewhere, sociology can no
   longer afford to sidestep such analytical challenges. This article moves
   toward a political sociology of populism by identifying past theoretical
   deficiencies and proposing a new, practice-based approach that is not
   beholden to pejorative common sense understandings. This approach
   conceptualizes populism as a mode of political practice-as populist
   mobilization. Its utility is demonstrated through an application to
   mid-twentieth-century Latin American politics. The article concludes by
   sketching an agenda for future research on populist mobilization in
   Latin America and beyond.</td>

   of three key elements of cosmopolitanism: cultural omnivorousness,

   their advantage but depicts such regulatory arbitrage as a dyadic
   process between firms and regulators. We extend this account by
   including a firm's non-market rivals and suggest that firms view
   regulatory differences as part of a corporate political opportunity
   structure and exploit regulatory variations to disadvantage their
   rivals. Empirically, we focus on variations in right-to-work (RTW) laws
   that signal the pro-business climate in a state; these laws exist in 22
   U.S. states. Using a spatial-regression discontinuity design, we analyze
   how Walmart locates new stores in the face of anti-Walmart activists and
   exploits regulatory discontinuities on the borders between RTW and
   non-RTW states. We find that Walmart is more likely to propose new
   stores, and to open those stores even if they are protested, at the
   borders of RTW states, compared with the borders of neighboring non-RTW
   states. We conclude with a discussion of implications for the study of
   regulation, social movements, and organizations.</td>

   Bankers specialize in moral authority, but when that authority is

   illustrate these processes with historical material from the postbellum

   to create a stable financial system, and why local bankers engaged in a
   process of financial innovation that further destabilized money. I
   conclude with reflections on the shifting structural sources of moral

   religious landscape make it crucial for religious entrepreneurs to deal
   with material problems if they hope to gain adherents. This article
   applies the concepts of problem solving and brokerage (Burt, 2005;
   Knoke, 1990) to a case study of religious leaders in Balaka, a small
   town of rural Malawi. I argue that religious leaders solve problems in
   three major areas-material infrastructure, activities and organization,
   and healthcare-and that they are able to do so at least partly because
   of their connections to various overlapping secular and religious
   networks. I focus both on the provision of material resources and the
   facilitation of effervescent experiences in order to advance a fuller
   understanding of the experience of poverty and the ways leaders in poor

   tests three competing hypotheses about the effects of intragenerational
   social class mobility on distress and psychological well-being at
   midlife. Prior research on this topic investigated the effects of
   intergenerational mobility, but did not look at how mobility during
   adulthood (intragenerational mobility) affects psychological distress
   and well-being. Previous literature is also limited by methodological
   problems that make it difficult to estimate the separate effects of
   prior social class, current social class, and social mobility. This
   study overcomes this methodological problem using a novel approach that
   breaks the linear dependence between prior class, current class, and
   intragenerational mobility. After accounting for prior and current
   class, I find that social mobility is not associated with psychological
   distress and self-acceptance. Instead, mobile individuals come to
   resemble their nonmobile counterparts in their current class on the
   outcomes of study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

   (DSM-III) in 1980. The manual revolutionized American psychiatry and the
   treatment of mental illness, because it served the function of
   classification that had become critical to the field of mental health by
   this time. But this function must be bracketed in order to reveal the
   "extra-functional" origins of the DSM-III. Using field theory, I argue
   that the manual was necessary for reasons other than the function it
   filled as a classification. Specifically, its origin lies in a series of
   conflicts among psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, and clinical
   psychologists within the field of mental health, which followed in the
   wake of the collapse of psychoanalysis as the dominant treatment type
   for mental illness. I reveal the generative formula behind the
   production of the DSM-III, capturing a variety of social processes that
   influenced the format of the manual and made it a useful classification,
   but which are not reducible to function. In this way, I reproduce its
   raison d'etre in a manner similar to how the DSM-III appeared for the
   people who produced it. This focus on generative formulas offers the
   sociology of knowledge a way to capture the epistemic importance of a
   range of different social processes. Most importantly, it avoids the
   functional fallacy of reducing origin to function, and ignoring the idea
   that innovations might appear necessary even without clear recognition
   of their functional consequences.</td>

   They provide a brief discussion of assessment in higher education today,

   from a survey of department chairs. These data indicate that most
   sociology departments are in fact conducting some form of assessment,
   although faculty members often are critical of these activities. The
   authors argue that sociologists are well situated to play a major role
   in carrying out assessment plans by virtue of their disciplinary
   training and skills in analyzing data. Further, the authors appeal to
   readers of Teaching Sociology that assessment and the scholarship of
   teaching and learning are inextricably linked and that it requires only
   a small step from conducting research on the scholarship of teaching and
   learning to doing assessment.</td>

   Based on their analysis, the authors examine the challenges and

   challenges of confinement and reentry. The authors' analysis has

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The use of informal writing is common in sociology. This article
   presents one model for integrating informal written work with learning
   goals through a theoretical framework known as concentric thinking. More
   commonly referred to as 'the PTA model' because of the series of
   cognitive tasks it promotes-prioritization,translation, and analogy
   (PTA)-concentric thinking practiced through PTA provides a basis for
   structuring students' informal writing over the course of a semester.
   The authors present data in which students use PTA to assess their
   journal entries as text at the end of the semester. The students'
   informal responses to their own writing demonstrate the achievement of
   an important course goal-the development of sociological
   mindfulness-while they also reveal a deeper understanding of the
   important features of written work. The authors conclude that when
   informal writing is purposefully linked to a set of thinking goals and
   learning outcomes that are necessary to complete formal course
   requirements, it can serve as a powerful teaching tool to enhance both
   thinking and the ability to convey thoughts in writing. Structured in
   this way, informal written work can enable us to observe and assess
   changes in students' learning that would otherwise remain invisible, and
   it can alter our pedagogy in fundamental ways.</td>

   sociology. Bourdieu has often been misread as an ahistorical
   'reproduction theorist' whose work does not allow for diachronic change
   or human agency. The article argues both that reproduction and social
   change, constraint and freedom, are at the heart of Bourdieu's project.
   Bourdieu's key concepts - habitus, field, cultural and symbolic capital
   - are all inherently historical. Bourdieu deploys his basic categories
   using a distinctly historicist social epistemology organized around the
   ideas of conjuncture, contingency, overdetermination, and radical
   discontinuity. The origins of Bourdieu's historicism are traced to his
   teachers at the Ecole Normale Superieure and to the long-standing
   aspirations among French historians and sociologists to unify the two
   disciplines. The historical nature of Bourdieu's work is also signalled
   by its pervasive influence on historians and the historical work of his
   former students and colleagues. Bourdieu allowed sociology to
   historicize itself to a greater extent than other French sociologists.</td>

   that his analysis of the economy was developed over such a long time
   period, is so rich and goes in so many interesting directions, that we
   are justified in speaking of Bourdieu's economic sociologies in the
   plural. While most sociologists know about Bourdieu's study Distinction
   (1986) and its analysis of consumption, there is less awareness of the
   fact that Bourdieu himself, towards the end of his life, said that he
   had produced three major studies of economic topics. These are: his work
   in Algeria on 'the economy of honour and "good faith" (1950s and 1960s);
   his study of credit (Bourdieu et al., 1963); and his study of the
   economy of single-family houses (Bourdieu et al., 1999). These three
   studies are presented and discussed in detail, and so is Bourdieu's
   attempt to formulate a general program for 'economic anthropology' in
   his article 'The Economic Field' (1997), drawing on such concepts as
   field, habitus and capital. Some critique has been directed at
   Bourdieu's analysis of the economy, and this is also discussed.</td>

   well as qualitative interviews from 2007 to 2009 show virtual saturation
   in the diffusion of phones during this period, but no direct effect of

   telephony: increased technological access to existing networks in a
   context of resource scarcity leads to a strengthening of weak ties and
   the enhancement of core networks among Kenyans. Video ethnographic data
   before and after the 2007 post-election unrest supports this

   these interactions is dependent on the changing institutional
   environment in which they are embedded. Such institutional settings,

   survey data, and then examine qualitative data on multiple emotions and
   "chains" of emotions over time. Qualitative and quantitative data
   together generate a multifaceted understanding of emotions' interactions
   over time and their independent and combined ability to predict who
   returns to the events a year later. Previous work on emotions and
   movement recruitment has confined itself to whether emotional
   experiences were positive or negative or focused in depth on one
   particular emotion. This article's findings show that confusion,
   courage, fear, and hope have a substantial and sometimes interactive

   on the malleability of scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a
   measure that is widely used to assess implicit attitudes, and other
   implicit cognition measures, to provide a theoretical framework for
   incorporating implicit processes into sociological accounts of culture.
   Studies from this literature demonstrate the fundamentally contextual
   and interactional nature of implicit cognition; that is, how the
   cultural environment shapes the activation of cognitive associations.
   Understanding how culture works to influence behavior requires attention
   to the interaction between the cultural environment-including symbols

   representations. Using this theoretical framework, I discuss how
   evidence from the sociology of culture regarding the nature of this
   cultural environment can inform our understanding of culture in action.</td>

   signposting of the ontological, epistemological, and methodological
   boundaries framing the putative intellectual project that is Physical
   Cultural Studies (PCS). Ground in a commitment toward engaging varied
   dimensions or expressions of active physicality, we deliberate on an
   understanding of, and approach to, the corporeal practices, discourses,
   and subjectivities through which active bodies become organized,
   represented, and experienced in relation to the operations of social
   power. Further, drawing on Toby Miller, we suggest that this approach
   requires a motivation toward progressive social change. We consider the
   political and axiological contingencies of PCS, how it is differentiated
   from the "sociology of sport," and how we may produce the type of
   knowledge that is able to intervene into the broader social world and
   make a difference. We are sure many will disagree-perhaps with good
   reason-with our assumptions. Indeed, such differences are welcomed for
   we feel that there is greater progressive potential in a field in
   tension, in healthy contestation, and, in which debates surrounding
   ontology, epistemology, political intent, method, interpretation,
   expression, and impact flow freely.</td>

   developed by &lt;link rid="b25"&gt;Finke and Dougherty (2002), which
   emphasizes both the social and religious capital gained during
   professionalization, to show that resistance to normative institutional
   pressures is possible. The data demonstrate that organizations which act
   to reformulate the role of religious professionals in a way which limits
   both the opportunities and ability of clergy to implement and maintain
   organizational routines and processes can successfully avoid normative
   institutional forces. This research draws on over 50 interviews and 100
   hours of fieldwork with people in the Emerging Church, a religious
   movement that has arisen in the last 25 years as a response to
   increasing distrust of institutional authority. This study helps to
   close the gap between institutional studies of organizations and the
   sociology of religion by suggesting that some, currently overlooked,
   organizational activities can be more accurately understood as
   deliberate attempts to resist institutionalizing forces.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The list experiment is used to detect latent beliefs when researchers
   suspect a substantial degree of social desirability bias from
   respondents. This methodology has been used in areas ranging from racial
   attitudes to political preferences. Meanwhile, social psychologists
   interested in the salience of physical attributes to social behavior
   have provided respondents with experimentally altered photographs to
   test the influence of particular visual cues or traits on social
   evaluations. This experimental research has examined the effect of skin
   blemishes, hairlessness, and particular racial attributes on
   respondents' evaluation of these photographs. While this approach
   isolates variation in particular visual characteristics from other
   visual aspects that tend to covary with the traits in question, it fails
   to adequately deal with social desirability bias. This shortcoming is
   particularly important when concerned with potentially charged visual
   cues, such as body mass index (BMI). The present article describes a
   novel experiment that combines the digital alteration of photographs
   with the list experiment approach. When tested on a nationally
   representative sample of Internet respondents, results suggest that when
   shown photographs of women, male respondents report differences in
   levels of attractiveness based on the perceived BMI of the photographed
   confederate. Overweight individuals are less likely than their normal
   weight peers to report different levels of attractiveness between
   high-BMI and low-BMI photographs. Knowing that evaluations of
   attractiveness influence labor market outcomes, the findings are
   particularly salient in a society with rising incidence of obesity.</td>

   and public reaction to these studies increased my concerns about the
   relationship between social science and public policy, as well as my
   attempts to make my work more accessible to a general audience. In the
   process, I discuss how the academic awards and honors I received based
   on these studies enhanced my involvement in the national policy arena. I
   conclude this essay with some thoughts about public agenda research and
   productive controversy based on my own unique experiences. In short,
   this autobiographical essay shows how a scholar can engage academics,
   policy makers, and the media concerned with bow sociological knowledge
   can inform a policy agenda on some of the nation's most important social

   several areas of contemporary scholarship. After identifying and
   describing three key strands of the early societal reaction perspective,
   I consider how those strands are reflected in more recent work, much of
   which does not explicitly reference the earlier tradition. I identify
   the ways that recent scholarship builds upon and yet extends the earlier
   societal reaction tradition. I close by describing three trajectories
   emerging in recent work that should focus future inquiry: the contingent
   effects of labeling, the causes of gaps between social control discourse

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Since Durkheim's classic work on suicide, sociological attention to
   understanding the roots of self-destruction has been inconsistent. hi
   this review, we use three historical periods of interest (pre-Durkheim,
   Durkheim, post-Durkheim) to organize basic findings in the body of
   sociological knowledge regarding suicide. Much of the twentieth-century
   research focused on issues of integration and regulation, imitation, and
   the social construction of suicide rates. Innovations in the
   twenty-first-century resurgence of sociological research on suicide are
   described in detail. These newer studies begin to redirect theory and
   analysis toward a focus on ethnoracial subgroups, individual-level
   phenomena (e.g., ideation), and age-period-cohort effects. Our analysis
   of sociology's contributions, limits, and possibilities leads to a
   recognition of the need to break through bifurcations in individual- and
   aggregate-level studies, to pursue the translation of Durkheim's
   original theory into a network perspective as one avenue of guiding
   micro-macro research, and to attend to the complexity in both
   multidisciplinary explanations and pragmatic interventions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists have developed a wide range of pedagogical strategies to
   facilitate student learning about racial/ethnic, class, and gender
   inequalities. Despite the growing subdiscipline of the sociology of the
   body and evidence pointing to the prevalence of inequalities based on
   physical attractiveness, the pedagogical literature has yet to develop
   strategies for teaching students about biases based on physical
   attractiveness. In this article, the authors report on a pedagogical
   module that involves student evaluations of photographs (depicting
   individuals ranging in levels of physical attractiveness) using semantic
   differential scales, and discuss the results of this evaluation. The
   authors test for student learning outcomes through (1) a one-group
   pretest-posttest design and (2) an assessment survey with both
   qualitative and quantitative components. Because this photograph
   evaluation typically illustrates students' beauty biases, a discussion
   of these results, paired with relevant readings, provides a powerful
   tool for the exchange of ideas about physical attractiveness biases.</td>

   Here, students use their sociological skills to examine and propose
   solutions to local social problems addressed by community organizations.
   Through analyzing students' course reflection journals and the results
   of pre- and posttests, the authors demonstrate how CBR can help students
   gain a better command of the research process and enhance student
   attitudes toward community service. After participating in CBR, the
   authors find that students indicate greater proficiency in undertaking
   the entire research process, from creating and implementing a research
   plan to making data-derived client recommendations. In addition, by
   showing how CBR can be incorporated into a less obviously applicable
   course, such as Sociology of Sexualities, the authors hope to encourage
   its further expansion in sociology.</td>

   the past few decades. The connection between the two, as well as other
   related variables, has however remained somewhat elusive. This study
   attempts to refine our understanding of how concern for the environment
   is related to pro-environmental behavior such as buying ecologically
   friendly products, driving less, conserving resources at home,
   recycling, etc., by considering the role played by social structural
   context and self-efficacy. Furthermore, through principle component
   analysis a particular dimension of pro-environmental behavior is
   identified so as to produce more robust and consistent results. Social
   structural context and self-efficacy are found to be powerful mediators
   of the relationship between environmental concern and pro-environmental
   behavior. Lastly, social structural context, as measured by the
   availability of curbside recycling, is shown to act as a gateway to
   additional pro-environmental behaviors beyond recycling.</td>

   animated the "narrative turn" in the social sciences since the 1980s, a
   more uniquely sociological approach has studied stories in the
   interactional, institutional, and political contexts of their telling.
   Scholars working in this vein have seen narrative as powerful, but as
   variably so, and they have focused on the ways in which narrative
   competence is socially organized and unevenly distributed. We show how
   this approach, or cluster of approaches, rooted variously in
   conversational analysis, symbolic interactionism, network analysis, and
   structuralist cultural sociologies, has both responded to problems
   associated with the narrative turn and shed light on enduring
   sociological questions such as the bases of institutional authority, how
   inequalities are maintained and reproduced, why political challengers
   are sometimes able to win support, and the cultural foundations of
   self-interest and instrumental rationality.</td>

   have appeared in two waves. The first wave has a productivist
   orientation, showing how the normal workings of industrial production
   damage the environment. It includes impact theories (IPAT and STIRPAT),
   the treadmill of production, growth machine theories, and resource
   extraction/ecologically unequal exchange theories. A second wave of
   theories focuses on environmental destruction and the social movements
   that challenge the agents of destruction. To accommodate popular unrest
   over environmental declines, states have typically created corporatist
   policymaking circles that include long-established, moderate
   environmental nongovernmental organizations and exclude disadvantaged
   and unorganized peoples. Advocates for environmental justice and
   sustainable consumption have attempted to mobilize the excluded,
   articulating a just sustainability theory that addresses both concerns.
   Current controversies in the field focus on the predictive power of
   first- and second-wave theories. This theoretical focus may shift toward
   the political economy of disasters as climate change intensifies.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The economic crisis of 2008-2010 stimulated an already growing
   sociological interest in finance. Before the crisis, disintermediation
   and securitization changed how the U.S. financial system operated, as
   bank operations shifted from the traditional originate-and-hold model to
   originate-and-distribute. During the 1980s and 1990s, the overall size
   and profitability of the financial system grew as deregulation unleashed
   financial innovation and reorganization. Global shifts toward capital
   market integration and liberalization created greater global
   interdependence. Households in the years before the crisis also altered
   their relationship to the financial system, increasing debt loads and
   overall exposure to the stock market. Research reveals the importance of
   politics for many financial market developments, various implications
   for corporate governance, the continuing significance of social factors
   within finance, and the role of theoretical and material devices in
   shaping financial practices. Key directions for future research focus on
   finance in relation to social inequality, informal sectors, valuation,

   post-World War II era had, by the 1980s, emerged as a transformative
   political force in the United States and the world. Yet sociology has
   been slower than other disciplines to come to grips with conservatism.
   In the hope of spurring more research, we review the substantial
   literature on the conservative movement produced by historians,
   political scientists, and serious journalists since the mid-1990s, along
   with the more limited number of sociological contributions. After
   identifying what we see as a promising approach for conceptualizing
   conservatism, we illustrate the benefits of sociological engagement by
   showing how three areas of sociology that might at first glance seem
   disconnected from the movement the-sociology of intellectuals, theories
   of social change, and scholarship on stratification-could profit from
   consideration of the conservative case.</td>

   the various sustainability challenges facing the world today To
   contribute to this endeavor the authors conduct panel analyses of the
   per capita ecological footprints of nations to evaluate multiple
   theoretical traditions within environmental sociology and its sister
   approaches Findings indicate that the consumption-based environmental
   impacts of nations are tied to economic development urban population,
   militarization, and the structure of international trade Ecological
   conditions in the context of climate and biogeography also prove to
   partially shape the environmental harms of human activities Ultimately
   this research suggests that political-economic factors, ecological
   milieu and structural associations between nations all influence
   society/nature relationships Considering the globally unsustainable
   levels of resource consumption and concomitant increases in pollution
   for a growing number of nations throughout the world the authors contend

   is detrimental to the actualization of productivity for workers who were
   bereft of the opportunity In contrast we find that the highest level of

   demonstrate the broad range of social forces, institutions, and
   structures in a semester-long series of in-class and homework
   assignments. RPGs and other simulation games have been frequently
   suggested as a useful teaching methodology because of their unique
   ability to allow students to observe and analyze society from a new
   perspective; however, most games are limited in scope. We present a game
   that is based on a clearly articulated theoretical foundation, reflects
   contemporary American demographics, and recreates the full breadth of
   social structures and relationships. The result is a robust teaching
   tool that develops critical thinking skills, encourages the sociological
   imagination, and is applicable to a wide range of classes and topics.
   Informal student feedback and student evaluations indicate that students
   enjoy the game, that it aids students in understanding sociological
   concepts, and that it encourages social critique beyond the classroom.</td>

   universities and disciplinary organizations has created opportunities to
   develop innovative ways to integrate research, instruction, and
   outreach. This article discusses a collaboration among scholars at the
   University of Kentucky and alternative agrifood movement organizations
   that has evolved as they pursue an alternative agrifood system in
   Kentucky. This collaboration made instructional programs in sociology
   and the honors world food issues track places in which both students and
   instructors can examine "problems" of the conventional agrifood system,
   conduct research, and develop collaborative relationships with community
   activists. We draw on Burawoy's discussion of public sociology and its
   interface with professional, critical, and policy sociologies.
   Supplementing our discussion with literature from social movements and
   science studies, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can render
   sociological knowledge and skills useful as critical support of
   alternative agrifood movements. We argue that the "experiential
   classroom" is an excellent site for the critical examination within the
   agrifood movements of oppositional culture. This, in turn, makes
   possible students' recognition of injustice in the existing agrifood
   system.</td>

   trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific
   community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that?
   We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific
   contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box
   imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that
   as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall
   network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now
   considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the
   non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to
   currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular
   phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting
   meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a
   niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a
   typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en
   route to consensus.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Culture has long shaped individuals' response to problems. A classic
   puzzle in the sociology of health and illness is discrepancy between
   theory and research regarding cultural beliefs and medical care service
   use. "Utilization research," examining individuals' responses to the
   onset of health problems, has not consistently found an effect of
   culture on the uptake of formal treatment. While ethnographic research
   often describes how culture shapes illness behaviors, survey-based
   studies rarely find significant effects of predispositions once "need"
   is controlled. In quantitative studies, individuals report supportive
   treatment beliefs or predispositions to use services but low utilization
   levels, reinforcing claims about lack of utility of cultural ideologies
   in health-care decision making. We ask whether innovations in the
   sociology of culture and cognition provide the theoretical scaffolding
   to conceptualize and measure culture in health service utilization.
   Examining data from the General Social Survey, we focus on how different
   approaches to culture might explain the paradox of high cultural
   predispositions and low actual use. Children with mental health problems
   provide a comparison between suggestions and endorsements. Suggestions,
   sources of care offered by individuals in response to a case description
   without any other social cues, align with new cultural approaches, and
   are measured by responses to open-ended questions about what should be
   done for the child described (meeting clinical criteria for ADHD, major
   depression, asthma, or "daily troubles"). Endorsements, requiring less
   cognitive work and cultural resistance, align with traditional
   conceptualizations of culture, and are measured by closed-ended
   questions that ask respondents to agree or disagree with seeking help
   from different treatment options placed later in the survey. We find
   that suggestions reveal cultural predispositions to use services
   corresponding closely to reported utilization levels; endorsements
   reveal high, unrealistic cultural predispositions to use services.
   Further, suggestions are associated with sociodemographics that proxy
   culture (e.g., race), while endorsements are associated only with
   perceived need.</td>

   its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been
   largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently,
   internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood
   components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by
   defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and
   the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the
   concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on
   critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a
   theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism,
   and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by
   offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance
   concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociology requires a robust theory of how local circumstances create
   social order. When we analyze social structures not recognizing that
   they depend on groups with collective pasts and futures that are
   spatially situated and that are based on personal relations, we avoid a
   core sociological dimension: the importance of local context in
   constituting social worlds. Too often this has been the sociological
   stance, both in micro-sociological studies that examine interaction as
   untethered from local traditions and in research that treats culture as
   autonomous from action and choice. Building on theories of action, group
   dynamics, and micro-cultures, I argue that a sociology of the local
   solves critical theoretical problems. The local is a stage on which
   social order gets produced and a lens for understanding how particular
   forms of action are selected. Treating ethnographic studies as readings
   of ongoing cultures, I examine how the continuing and referential
   features of group life (spatial arenas, relations, shared pasts)
   generate action and argue that local practices provide the basis for
   cultural extension, influencing societal expectations through the
   linkages among groups.</td>

   simply as an ascetic ethos but in broader terms of the cult of

   U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and
   Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations
   Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model
   of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market
   between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that
   industry of employment represents a salient partition of the
   distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the
   current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were
   displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings
   losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment
   in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed
   determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that
   displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses
   in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch
   industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage
   industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those
   who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be
   explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs
   from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are
   re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural
   theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which
   represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic
   skill-based accounts of earnings differences. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All

   on modelling. The authors suggest that if state theory can be
   conceptualized as an 'engine' rather than merely a 'camera', in that
   policy is mobilized to make the world fit the theory, then this has
   implications for conceptualizing states. To examine this possibility the
   authors look through the lens of actor-network theory (ANT) and in doing
   so articulate a relationship between two models of the state in the
   literature. They find that an 'actor model' of the state is accepted by
   many scholars, few of whom develop 'network models' of the state. In
   response, this study introduces an actor-network model and proposes that
   its contribution to state theory is in rethinking the character of
   modern states to be the outcome of actually performed assemblages of all
   those practices of building it, protecting it, governing it and
   theorizing about it.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located
   stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC).
   Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that
   Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor,
   unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a
   shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper
   examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of
   176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the
   US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are
   disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with
   a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three
   further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First,
   findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and
   economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated
   rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town.
   Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race,
   town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly,
   future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological
   implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison
   impact. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc.</td>

   organization of the genre around the semantic template
   actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but
   where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the
   verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet,

   tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism,
   1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article, I attempt to address some enduring problems in
   formulation and practical use of the notion of structure in contemporary
   social science. I begin by revisiting the question of the fidelity of
   Anthony Giddens' appropriation of the idea of structure with respect to
   Levi-Strauss. This requires a reconsideration of Levi-Strauss' original
   conceptualization of "social structure" which I argue is a sort of
   "methodological structuralism" that stands sharply opposed to Giddens'
   ontological reconceptualization of the notion. I go on to show that
   Bourdieu's contemporaneous critique of Levi-Strauss is best understood
   as an attempt to recover rather than reject the central implication of
   Levi-Strauss' methodological structuralism, which puts Bourdieu and
   Giddens on clearly distinct camps in terms of their approach toward the
   idea of structure. To demonstrate the-insurmountable-conceptual
   difficulties inherent in the ontological approach, I proceed by
   critically examining what I consider to be the most influential attempt
   to resolve the ambiguities in Giddens structuration theory: Sewell's
   argument for the "duality of structure." I show that by retaining
   Giddens' ontological focus, Sewell ends up with a notion of structure
   that is at its very core "anti-structuralist" or only structuralist in a
   weak sense. I close by considering the implications of the analysis for
   the possibility of developing the rather neglected "methodological
   structuralist" legacy in contemporary social analysis.</td>

   has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to
   implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus
   on what ''internationalizing'' or ''globalizing'' the classroom actually
   means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose
   of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of
   internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest
   teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of
   teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology
   courses-Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and
   Migration in a Global Context-are used to illustrate how a more
   systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve

   Sociological Association conducted a longitudinal survey of sociology
   majors from the class of 2005, following them from senior year into
   careers or graduate school. The first part of this article provides a
   context for the results from the What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree
   in Sociology? study and a summary of its key findings. Wave I data
   demonstrate strong student interest in sociological concepts, perceived
   mastery of some research skills but not others, and general satisfaction
   with the major. Sociology majors are both idealists and careerists. The
   majority expects to enter the job market after graduation but is not
   satisfied with the career advising they receive. Key findings from Wave
   II demonstrate that more respondents go directly into the job market
   than expected, job search strategies are important in finding a job that
   matches what students learned in their sociology programs, and those who
   find such jobs are more satisfied with the major. The second part
   discusses how the survey findings can be used to enhance curriculum,
   advising, and assessment without vocationalizing the curriculum and
   without adding extra burdens to faculty members' already heavy
   schedules. Finally, the article discusses how the data can be used as a
   baseline for department assessment.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although social status plays a crucial role in the generation and
   maintenance of social inequalities, how status processes operate in
   naturalistic social contexts remains less clear. In the following
   article, I provide a case study of doormen-individuals who
   simultaneously represent status experts and status judges-at a highly
   exclusive nightclub to investigate how people draw status distinctions
   in micro-social settings. Using interview and ethnographic data, I
   analyze on what bases doormen evaluate the relative worth of patrons and
   confer the status prize of admission. I find that in making such
   decisions, doormen drew from a constellation of competence and esteem
   cues, which were informed by contextually specific status schemas about
   the relative material, moral, and symbolic worth of particular client
   groups. Moreover, the ways in which doormen used these cues and schema
   depended on the identity of the specific patron being evaluated. As
   such, I argue that processes of interpersonal evaluation and status
   conferral are contextually specific, culturally embedded, and
   interpersonally variable. Despite such variations, a patron's perceived
   social connections seemed to outweigh other types of cues in admissions
   decisions. I conclude by discussing these findings in light of both
   status characteristics theory and Bourdieu's work on the
   transubstantiation of capital to suggest that social capital is a
   powerful status cue that can, under certain conditions, be a more potent
   source of social distinction and status advantage, or hold a greater
   conversion value, in systems of stratification than other types of
   qualities.</td>

   their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for
   changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look
   at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals
   and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural
   changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with
   animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on
   research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main
   strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as
   well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries
   through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross
   boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study
   contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural
   changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a
   useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and

   off the bench," and Karen and Washington's (2001) plea to make sports
   sociology more central to analyses of social power, this article
   empirically reviews and assesses the sociology of sports from 1977-2008.
   Using a sample of 441 articles selected from the three major sports
   sociology journals during that period, we conclude that sports sociology
   exhibits a strong and increasing bias toward micro-level analyses of
   (for example) how the content of sports frames and constructs the social
   world. A smaller and shrinking body of work examines more macro-oriented
   issues such as the economics and politics of sports, and there seem to
   be few attempts to meaningfully synthesize these micro and macro
   orientations. We think this partiality toward micro-oriented frameworks
   is rooted in factors unique to sports sociology while also reflecting
   larger trends within sociology as a whole. As advocates of popularly
   accessible public sociology, we respectfully suggest that sports
   sociologists try harder to weave macro analyses into their work, not
   necessarily replacing micro-level approaches, but complementing them. We
   believe that sports sociology is well-positioned to become a standard
   bearer for public sociology, but only if it pays more attention to the
   way organized sports intertwines with the organizational, political, and
   economic forces that perpetuate and exacerbate social inequality.</td>

   niches. This proposition is inconsistent with the finding that, although
   women constitute the majority of religious consumers, the majority of
   the religions produced in the American religious marketplace favor men's
   interests relative to women's. Three modifications to the religious
   economies model are suggested to account for this contradiction. The
   first modification is a respecification of "religious capital" that
   takes into account unequal distributions of power among producers of
   religious value and their differential effects on the beneficiaries and
   targets of religious norms. The second modification theorizes religion's
   linkages to other social institutions as sources of cost and benefit
   that are taken into account by religious entrepreneurs. The third
   modification accounts for status-based discrimination and unequal
   distributions of capital as sources of constraint that influence the
   production of religious supply. Several directions for future research
   are proposed.</td>

   supplant the amorphous concept of structure with more precise concepts,
   particularly institutions and networks. All institutions entail both
   embodied and relational aspects. Institutions are relational insofar as
   they map obligatory patterns of "getting by and getting
   along"-institutional orders-that steer stable social fields over time.
   Institutions are simultaneously embodied as institutional paradigms,
   part of a larger bodily agency Pierre Bourdieu called habitus.
   Institutions are in turn tightly coupled to networks between various
   people based on, but not reducible to, strategic interests. Yet social
   interaction sometimes exceeds institutional boundaries, giving rise to
   disjunctive fields and underscoring the prominence of institutional
   failures in the unfolding of antagonistic relations such as warfare.
   Such disjunctive fields can be tracked in relation to some transnational
   networks at the global level without assuming developmental convergence.
   This last point underscores the meaning of neoclassical sociology, which
   eschews assumptions of developmental convergence at the global level.</td>

   change, that is, when we try to specify in theoretical terms how and in
   which conditions historical actors enact and endorse shifts in patterns
   of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories
   that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in
   light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change:
   first, the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of
   moments of breaks and ruptures. Along the way, I develop an argument
   about the conditions of emergence of self-limiting norms and the
   centrality of epistemic beliefs in situations of high disruption.</td>

   on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council.
   Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses
   demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of
   religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is
   important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood
   only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social
   environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which
   we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests
   and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions'
   legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice
   theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the
   population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold
   firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational
   field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts
   firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.</td>

   opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a
   key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of
   an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We
   connect different strands of theory and research in the social
   psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between
   occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from
   the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are
   consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two
   opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to
   experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's
   macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.</td>

   highlighted the need for proficiencies in a number of key areas,

   presentation and interpretation of quantitative data, including tables

   Excel. Moreover, hands-on work in data analysis was highly valued by all
   respondents, particularly as a strategy for mastering these skills. This
   study suggests that effective education in quantitative literacy
   requires both (a) the removal of barriers to the incorporation of data
   analysis in sociology courses and (b) a well-sequenced sociology

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>P&gt;How people respond to questions involving the environment depends
   partly on individual characteristics. Characteristics such as age,
   gender, education, and ideology constitute the well-studied "social
   bases of environmental concern," which have been explained in terms of
   cohort effects or of cognitive and cultural factors related to social
   position. It seems likely that people's environmental views depend not
   only on personal characteristics but also on their social and physical
   environments. This hypothesis has been more difficult to test, however.
   Using data from surveys in 19 rural U.S. counties, we apply
   mixed-effects modeling to investigate simple place effects with respect
   to locally focused environmental views. We find evidence for two kinds
   of place effects. Net of individual characteristics, specific place
   characteristics have the expected effect on related environmental views.
   Local changes are related to attitudes about regulation and growth. For
   example, respondents more often perceive rapid development as a problem,
   and favor environmental rules that restrict development, in rural
   counties with growing populations. Moreover, they favor conserving
   resources for the future rather than using them now to create jobs in
   counties that have low unemployment. After we controlled for county
   growth, unemployment and jobs in resource-based industries, and
   individual social-position and ideological factors, there remains
   significant place-to-place variation in mean levels of environmental
   concern. Even with both kinds of place effects in the models, the
   individual-level predictors of environmental concern follow patterns
   expected from previous research. Concern increases with education among
   Democrats, whereas among Republicans, the relationship is attenuated or
   reversed. The interaction marks reframing of environmental questions as
   political wedge issues, through nominally scientific counterarguments
   aimed at educated, ideologically receptive audiences.</td>

   health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a
   number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women
   have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively
   experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from
   the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and
   persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and
   (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are
   involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data
   from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two
   hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent
   anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss
   the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of
   social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between
   them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future
   theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some
   members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to
   save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely
   together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors-killing
   on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such
   cases-where the same individuals kill and rescue-and discusses their
   relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and
   individualistic theories of killing and rescuing-which explain these
   behaviors with the properties of groups or persons-are inadequate in
   accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995,
   2000)strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell,
   2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals
   during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different
   structures-killing where there is social distance and rescuing where
   there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory
   behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close.
   One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory
   power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme
   variations in individual behavior.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>There is rarely an introductory text in sociology that does not begin
   with C. Wright Mills's (1967)distinction between personal troubles and
   structural or public issues. To lack sociological imagination is to
   confuse between these two levels of analysis in trying to explain public
   issues in terms of personal troubles, or history in terms of the
   individual's biography. "Troubles occur within the character of the
   individual and within the range of his immediate relations with others;
   Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments
   of the individual and the range of his inner life" (Mills, 1967:8).
   Issues are generated in response to the dynamics of the social system
   and unfold within the larger structural and historical contexts where
   the character of the individual takes shape. Yet, the most popular
   explanation of the contemporary financial crisis with its disastrous
   social and economic consequences is personal greed. It is the greedy
   investment bankers, corrupt politicians, and unscrupulous lobbyists who
   are to take the brunt of the current economic meltdown in the United
   States. A few bad apples on Wall Street have created havoc on Main
   Street. Here, one may argue that greed that-if not kept in check-which
   seems to afflict almost everyone, transcending social class and status
   boundaries, may be a public issue-a structural problem-rather than a
   problem within the character of the individual. Not to be greedy within
   the contemporary social and economic system may be considered
   pathological, an instance of personal trouble.</td>

   a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual
   life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology,

   model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result
   from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and
   disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts,
   within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive
   sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences
   and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine.
   Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de)
   coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps
   explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among
   individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying
   lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests
   improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models,

   The concept of "emotive performance" is developed to highlight the

   argue that emotive performance is reflexive, cultural, and
   communicative. As an active social act, emotive performance draws from
   the cultural repertoire of interpretative frameworks and dominant
   narratives. We illustrate the utility of the concept by analyzing two
   episodes of unrehearsed emotive performances by two well-known
   politicians, Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin. The two cases demonstrate how
   emotion can be analyzed as a domain in which culturally specific
   narratives and rhetorics are used to advance the situational agenda of
   actors. The concept opens up a more expansive research agenda for
   sociology. It pushes sociologists to pay greater attention to people's
   experiences, interpretations, and deployments of emotions in social

   interprets their messages. Ethnographic observation of AIDS media in
   situ and interview data reveal how the materiality of objects and places
   shapes the availability of AIDS knowledge in Accra, Ghana. Significantly
   for AIDS organizations, these material conditions often systematically
   obstruct access to AIDS knowledge for particular groups. Attending to
   materiality rethinks how scholars assess the cultural power of media.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical
   work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative
   consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth
   outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have
   documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the
   macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with
   delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among
   adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between
   mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing
   differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for
   delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue.
   Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the
   most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes
   that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem
   behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National
   Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential
   and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and
   substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both
   observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and
   delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future
   research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the
   mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the
   realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound
   transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the
   international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home,
   the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal
   bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show
   that World War II mobilization played an important role. First,
   Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent
   military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft
   manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing
   intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered
   significantly greater losses where both non-white population and
   aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate
   accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and
   path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years
   left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare
   reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall
   of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we
   demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies
   undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This
   intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an
   inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social
   welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and
   abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The teaching and learning movement in sociology in general and within
   the American Sociological Association specifically has a surprisingly
   long history. This history can be divided into three periods of
   activity: early efforts (1905 to 1960), innovation and implementation
   (1960 to 1980), and the institutionalization of gains (1980 to 2009).
   Beginning in the first period, sociologists interested in teaching and
   learning focused cycles of attention on the introductory sociology
   course in higher education, high school sociology courses, and the
   formation of sections within the American Sociological Association. Hans
   Mauksch led a period of significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s.
   Many of those gains were then institutionalized under the leadership of
   Carla Howery beginning in the 1980s. Publication related to teaching and
   learning, which was once spread throughout numerous outlets has, over
   time, become focused in Teaching Sociology. This article presents an
   investigation of the past and present of the teaching and learning
   movement in sociology and offers some suggested direction for the
   movement's future.</td>

   to develop a multilevel team approach within which faculty, graduate

   connected project. The authors describe the three central components of
   the multilevel approach: a newly required research seminar for graduate
   students, an approach to teaching research methods in a joint seminar of
   graduate and undergraduate students, and an approach to teaching
   undergraduate research methods that includes having graduate students
   model research techniques for undergraduates. The authors then assess
   each of these components based on course evaluations and additional data
   gathered from participants. The authors conclude with a series of
   suggestions about how this model might be expanded and developed further
   in their own and other institutional contexts.</td>

   proceeds in four sections. The first section provides an overview of
   service learning and its benefits. This is followed by a detailed
   description of the service-learning project. In the third section, the
   author draws from a postclass survey, course evaluations, and her
   observations to illustrate the ways in which the project enhances

   processes were utilized to introduce the sociological imagination,
   critical thinking, and theory and methods in sociology. The intent was
   to apply basic sociological knowledge to a real-world issue, HIV/AIDS in
   a global perspective. In the process of developing basic skills in
   sociology, a consistent change was noted in students' self-reported
   impressions about people with AIDS in each of four semesters (N = 160).
   Catastrophic contagion characterized their impressions at the beginning
   of the semester; humanizing attributes (encouragement and empowerment)
   replaced catastrophic contagion at the end of the semester. Implications
   of these findings for teaching and learning, and deconstructing HIV/AIDS
   stigma, are discussed.</td>

   the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic

   relevant to what the lay public wants and needs to know, and when it is
   written in non technical English. This article spells out the
   requirements, conditions and processes involved in making relevant
   ethnography acceptable to the lay public and thus turning it into public
   ethnography.</td>

   motion on a global scale. Increasing storm intensities, shifting
   rainfall patterns, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and other
   manifold alterations are being experienced around the world. Climate has
   never been constant in any location, but human-induced changes
   associated with greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use are new and rapidly
   shifting conditions for rural communities and regions across the planet.
   Rural sociologists have long been carving out the contours of this topic
   through research on family well-being, rural livelihoods, community, and
   the environment. Now climate change and subsequent policy responses
   present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of
   this article is to assess lines of research and theory that consider and
   direct our understanding of the impacts of climate change, the ways it
   might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and
   communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global
   realignment. As climate-change impacts and policy responses begin to
   impinge on rural populations, the first line of resistance and
   participation will be the rural community. The distribution of rewards
   from climate-change mitigation is broad and diffuse; the distribution of
   costs, compromised livelihoods, and community disruption often is
   focused.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>P&gt;The effects of highways on transforming human society and promoting
   population change have been investigated in several disciplines,
   including geography, sociology, economics, and planning. Currently, the
   primary highway construction activity in the nation is highway
   expansion; however, this expansion has not been the focus of much of the
   existing literature. This research examines the role that highway
   expansion plays in the process of population change. Specifically, this
   research proposes an integrated spatial regression approach to study the
   impacts of highway expansion on population change in the 1980s and 1990s
   in Wisconsin at the minor civil division level. The integrated approach
   thoroughly considers the factors that influence population change,
   appropriately examines the spatial variations of their impacts,
   simultaneously incorporates spatial lag and spatial error dependence,
   and systematically selects the optimal neighborhood structure. The
   findings suggest that the impacts of highway expansion on population
   change differ across rural, suburban, and urban areas: There are only
   indirect effects in rural areas, both direct and indirect effects in
   suburban areas, and no statistically significant effects in urban areas.
   Overall, highway expansion serves as a facilitator of population change
   within the framework of growth pole theory and location theory.</td>

   trends within spatial areas hypothesized by Massey and others but
   contradicted by the theorizing of Florida and others. The results for
   seven socio-demographic variables show a trend toward increasing
   similarity in the majority of socio-demographic variables in all types

   in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic
   characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with
   the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data,
   suggesting that theories of social change and spatial characteristics
   may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the
   circumstances under which homogenization or heterogenization may be most
   likely are better specified theoretically. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All

   one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we
   know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it.
   Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely,
   what we will call "political ideology"-that is, people's self-placement
   on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We
   focus on that understanding that is in some ways the "ur-form" of social
   cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social
   formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these
   self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the
   development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is,
   when citizens develop such a "political ideology," what does this mean,
   and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their
   subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by
   using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a
   hypothetical policy.</td>

   of, and relationship between, these contexts is imagined in philosophy;
   managed, rewarded, and sanctioned in graduate seminars, journal reviews,

   the effectiveness and rationality of this strategy. Thus
   "postpositivism" can be understood as a series of attempts to

   theory and postmodern anthropology-are considered, and a synthesis,

   U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy,
   scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds
   significance for different populations with competing political agendas
   (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of
   community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as
   naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape
   the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute
   sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of
   community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic
   political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and
   around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze
   how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might
   provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first
   explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking
   both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely
   characterized as 'political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary
   sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct
   or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the
   construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of
   class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race.
   Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance
   of these developments.</td>

   develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths
   become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens
   when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as
   "accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh?
   Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide
   answers and reveal "recoupling'' processes through which institutional
   myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected
   become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling
   accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that
   teachers labeled "turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of
   the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by
   "inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities,
   social interactions, and meaning-making processes.</td>

   then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core
   sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of
   Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in
   many academic fields, especially health research and education;
   Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of
   politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion
   dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing
   surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates,
   increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and
   the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is
   increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative
   data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations,
   Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent
   and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet
   surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data,
   and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of

   the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article the authors draw attention to the most recent and
   promising developments of sequence analysis. Taking methodological
   developments in life course sociology as the starting point, the authors
   detail the complementary strength in sequence analysis in this field.
   They argue that recent advantages of sequence analysis were developed in
   response to criticism of the original work, particularly optimal
   matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and
   culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods &amp; Research. The
   debate triggered a "second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new
   technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors
   bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected
   advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually
   contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in
   less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling
   the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that "anybody who
   believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to
   social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much
   surprised'' (p. 75).</td>

   underappreciated tools for regulating and organizing social life in
   modernity, and they lurk in the background of many sociological works.
   Reviewing the relevance of standards and standardization in diverse
   theoretical traditions and sociological subfields, we point to the
   emergence and institutionalization of standards, the difficulties of
   making standards work, resistance to standardization, and the multiple
   outcomes of standards. Rather than associating standardization with
   totalizing narratives of globalization or dehumanization, we call for
   careful empirical analysis of the specific and unintended consequences
   of different sorts of standards operating in distinct social domains.</td>

   converted into a sociology of interventions, i.e., instead of focusing
   on a certain social type, it analyzes the movement by which knowledge
   and expertise are mobilized to inform a value-laden intervention in the
   public sphere. We first demonstrate that the classical sociology of
   intellectuals was centered on a problematic of allegiance that no longer
   seems productive. In addition, we show that by focusing on a particular
   social type it remained limited to only one mode of intervention into
   the public sphere. We then review two literatures that distance
   themselves from the classical problematic and that could be integrated
   under the common rubric of a sociology of interventions: The first
   literature analyzes intellectual fields and markets. It moves away from
   the sociology of intellectuals by multiplying the relevant actors and
   depersonalizing the term "intellectual" so that it no longer stands for
   a social type but for the capacity to make a public intervention, a
   capacity to which many different actors lay claim. The second literature
   analyzes the public deployment of expertise. It multiplies not simply
   the actors laying claim to the mantle of the intellectual, but the
   formats and modes of intervention itself, i.e., the different ways in
   which knowledge and expertise can be inserted into the public sphere.</td>

   questions: What is music, sociologically speaking? How do individuals
   and groups use music? How is the collective production of music made
   possible? How does music relate to broader social distinctions,
   especially class, race, and gender? Answering these questions reveals
   that music provides an important and engaging purchase on topics that

   network methods has for the past several decades sought to explicate the
   relationships between culture and connectivity. A number of promising
   recent moves toward integration are worthy of review, comparison,
   critique, and synthesis. Network thinking provides powerful techniques
   for specifying cultural concepts ranging from narrative networks to
   classification systems, tastes, and cultural repertoires. At the same
   time, we see theoretical advances by sociologists of culture as
   providing a corrective to network analysis as it is often portrayed, as
   a mere collection of methods. Cultural thinking complements and sets a
   new agenda for moving beyond predominant forms of structural analysis
   that ignore action, agency, and intersubjective meaning. The notion of
   "cultural holes" that we use to organize our review points both to the
   cultural contingency of network structure and to the increasingly
   permeable boundary between studies of culture and research on social
   networks.</td>

   markets, the social movement perspective emphasizes the role that
   contentiousness plays in bringing institutional change and innovation to
   markets. Markets are inherently political, both because of their ties to
   the regulatory functions of the state and because markets are contested
   by actors who are dissatisfied with market outcomes and who use the
   market as a platform for social change. Research in this area focuses on
   the pathways to market change pursued by social movements, including
   direct challenges to corporations, the institutionalization of systems
   of private regulation, and the creation of new market categories through
   institutional entrepreneurship. Much contentiousness, while initially
   disruptive, works within the market system by producing innovation and
   restraining capitalism from destroying the resources it depends on for
   survival.</td>

   underlying causal mechanisms. These mechanisms have special theoretical
   importance because disparities in health behaviors, unlike disparities
   in many other components of health, involve something more than the
   ability to use income to purchase good health. Based on a review of
   broad literatures in sociology, economics, and public health, we
   classify explanations of higher smoking, lower exercise, poorer diet,
   and excess weight among low-SES persons into nine broad groups that
   specify related but conceptually distinct mechanisms. The lack of clear
   support for any one explanation suggests that the literature on SES
   disparities in health and health behaviors can do more to design studies
   that better test for the importance of the varied mechanisms.</td>

   between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of
   Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica,
   CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if
   mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently
   published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social
   distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations
   using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30,
   185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this
   process empirically through a case study of a university housing system
   that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation
   between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the
   larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep
   roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact,
   residence assignment procedures are completely "color-blind." Thus a
   college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of
   preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks
   continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing
   applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to
   halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that
   percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for
   black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist
   preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect
   is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference
   has important consequences for the residential separation process. (C)

   propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the
   propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model,
   inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status
   hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of
   Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor
   model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on
   perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute
   homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the
   single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This
   allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the
   individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the
   propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four
   waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally
   support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality,
   reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements
   in the network members' choices. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender
   equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual
   relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes
   within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether
   variations emerge and whether they are nested within specific issues,
   religious denominations, or reflect more general patterns of race
   differences.</td>

   tradition in sociology. One interpretation of this perspective suggests
   that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an

   exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand,
   recent writings exposing a potential "dark side'' of social capital
   suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties.
   Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S.

   are interested in pedagogical strategies that support critical thinking,
   student participation, and group discussion in large classrooms.
   Audience response systems, or "clickers," are an emerging tool for
   addressing this problem, but predominant pedagogical models for clicker
   use developed in the natural sciences often do not encourage the
   "inquiry-guided learning" that is useful in sociology. This article
   introduces readers to clicker technology and outlines a new pedagogical
   model for clicker use designed to address sociological learning goals,
   including critical thinking, applications of concepts to real-life
   experiences, and critiques of sociological methods. The authors discuss
   the effects of clickers for classroom interaction and students'
   experiences in three undergraduate sociology courses, using quantitative
   and qualitative data about students' perceptions of the effects of this
   pedagogical model on learning. The results suggest that the model
   positively affects participation, critical thinking, and classroom
   interaction dynamics. The authors conclude with practical suggestions
   for instructors considering implementing clickers; in sociology courses.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recently, a growing contingent of "evolutionary sociologists" has begun
   to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from
   evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of
   sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of
   either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers
   and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with
   research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences.
   These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new
   opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's
   relevance to sociology. In this article, the authors review key issues
   pertaining to evolutionary explanations of social behavior, offer
   clarifications and explanations of several issues that are sometimes
   misrepresented and misunderstood, and provide specific suggestions for
   instructors who are interested in updating and improving the quality of
   instruction on this important topic.</td>

   concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use
   culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent
   findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the
   analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals
   to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this
   conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied
   metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet
   Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors,
   and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the
   group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for
   either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied
   metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social
   bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of
   embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and
   group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be
   more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than
   is modernist culture.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>With larger percentages of high school students entering higher
   education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes
   occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using
   in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class
   structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I
   argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for
   stratification because it is there that students gain access to social
   and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that
   upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources
   that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate
   their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial
   factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources
   further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings
   contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing
   that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the
   outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources
   throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that
   symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent
   relationship between social and cultural capital.</td>

   Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work
   of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In
   this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent
   scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of
   "representation" and "dualism" in Durkheim's overall thought. The
   analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism
   is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is
   based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system.
   Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely
   misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of
   Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in
   order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes
   that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the
   primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of
   "individualism." This necessitates the analytical distinction between
   the two conceptions of " the individual," which I label the
   "bio-psychological" and the "sociological."</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an "impulse" toward sociability,
   defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an
   end in itself. While sociability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates
   a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize
   symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans
   engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from
   ethnomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a
   way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to
   interactions among humans. Beginning with a conceptualization of play as
   an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize
   situated interactions, this article argues that humans can engage in
   playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the
   play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of
   the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies
   how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume
   that interactants share intersubjectivity. The article concludes by
   offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities
   of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and
   other situational factors.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Institutional differentiation has been one of the central concerns of
   sociology since the days of Auguste Comte. However, the overarching
   tendency among institutionalists such as Durkheim or Spencer has been to
   treat the process of differentiation from a macro, "outside in"
   perspective. Missing from this analysis is how institutional
   differentiation occurs from the "inside out," or through the efforts and
   struggles of individual and corporate actors. Despite the recent efforts
   of the "new institutionalism" to fill in this gap, a closer look at the
   literature will uncover the fact that (1) it has tended to conflate
   macro-level institutions and meso-level organizations and (2) this has
   led to a taken for granted approach to institutional dynamics. This
   article seeks to develop a general theory of institutional autonomy;
   autonomy is a function of the degree to which specialized corporate
   units are structurally and symbolically independent of other corporate
   units. It is argued herein that the process by which these
   "institutional entrepreneurs" become independent can explain how
   institutions become differentiated from the "inside out." Moreover, this
   article offers five dimensions that can be operationalized, measuring
   the degree to which institutions are autonomous.</td>

   "Developed'' human societies so overuse the finite planet they share
   with "underdeveloped'' societies that the future of all is
   threatened.Medicine's prosthesis concept becomes useful for sociology
   when extended beyond referring to devices for replacing lost body parts
   or restoring impaired sensory powers. If we regard all modern tools and
   machines as prosthetic devices, we see them enabling humans to act as
   giants-giving us colossal resource appetites and huge environmental
   impacts.Prosthetic apparatus (and familiar assumptions) previously
   useful are subject to obsolescence. But there is cultural lag.
   Conceptual habits restrict the way we see our world. The bubble of
   twentieth century experience obstructs our understanding of the future
   into which we giants are plummeting. To explain severe hardships ahead
   in the twenty-first century, sociologists need to break out of our
   discipline's traditional conceptual bubble. Twentieth century
   expectations have become misleading. The basis of past progress (a
   carrying capacity surplus) is gone, replaced by a carrying capacity
   deficit. Earth's diminished carrying capacity will sustain fewer

   problems with optimal matching. First, the author identifies a flaw in

   author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of
   OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an
   empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and
   sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM
   and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates
   the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational
   sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human
   capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal
   improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its
   computational complexity. These results point to the need for more
   systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.</td>

   simply teaching students its discursive assumptions. Rather, it is a
   disposition, in competition with other forms of sensibility, which can
   be acquired only when it is practiced. Adhering to this important
   pedagogical assumption, students were assigned to write their
   sociological autobiography. While in the process of establishing a
   connection between their biography and social history, students were
   encouraged to narrate their life stories using sociological language.
   After completing the project, they were asked to comment on their work.
   Student responses show the positive dimensions involved (including
   unintended therapeutic consequences) and the major hurdles that they
   experienced in executing the assignment. In the latter case, the major
   problem was writing a sociological autobiography qualitatively distinct
   from what might be referred to as "plain autobiography." Results
   reinforce the idea that sociological instruction is better handled when
   sociological imagination is viewed as a linguistic habitus which serves
   both as a medium of communication and an intellectual instrument of
   looking at the social world.</td>

   development reduces society's impact on the biosphere. The empirical
   research informing the discussion has not yet adequately examined the
   social determinants of municipal solid-waste (MSW) generation, an
   increasingly relevant issue, both ecologically and sociologically. A
   primary problem for this research concerns the increasing exchange of
   MSW across state and county borders. A convenient way to avoid this
   problem is to examine variation between counties with landfills that
   service only the county in which the landfills are located. I applied
   this restriction to a cross-sectional analysis of total MSW generated in
   Texas at the county level for 2006. Using robust regression, this Study
   found that two basic measures of modern development, Population per
   square mile and per capita income, are both positively related to total
   MSW generated at the county level and together explain about 73 percent
   of the variation in the dependent variable. The evidence corroborates
   the metabolic-rift theory. The concentration of people onto smaller land
   areas, or urbanization, and increasing wealth in a capitalist economy
   contribute to the metabolic rupture between human society and the
   environment.</td>

   produced two main conclusions. First, the potential costs associated
   with joining a treaty, rather than its substantive content, motivates
   the decision to join. Treaties that protect different rights but
   establish comparable implementation mechanisms exhibit similar patterns
   of membership, whereas treaties that protect identical rights but
   establish different implementation provisions exhibit dissimilar
   patterns of membership. Second, rates of treaty membership differ by
   level of commitment. Countries that sign human rights treaties differ
   from countries that ratify. Results are interpreted with respect to four
   theories of commitment and compliance: realism, liberalism,
   constructivism, and sociological institutionalism. Theories that
   emphasize the importance of a treaty's costs (realism and
   institutionalism) fare better than theories that prioritize a treaty's

   variable and two sets of theoretically distinct control variables. The
   author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and
   democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and
   democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First,
   international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic
   and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to
   conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that
   the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery.
   Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore
   international trade in world-systems and political analysis.</td>

   learning has moved the field well beyond simple description of teaching
   methods. There is no doubt that the journal is more scholarly than in
   the past. Still, we do not take advantage of our rich theoretical
   disciplinary work. There is much to learn sociologically about the
   classroom and other sites of interaction between teachers and students.
   Our classrooms are social sites and our analysis of them can be of help
   to scholars both inside and outside the discipline. In this article, we
   propose a sensitizing concept, the sociology of the college
   classroom-the application of sociological theory and/or concepts to
   understand social phenomena that take place at the level of the
   classroom and other sites of faculty-student interaction. We situate the
   sociology of the college classroom as a subset of the scholarship of
   teaching and learning and the sociology of higher education, Sociology
   of the college classroom can be a place not only where research meets
   teaching, but it can also be a site where sociological theory meets
   pedagogical praxis.</td>

   negotiation in collaborative teaching, using Erving Goffman's (1959)
   theoretical tradition of dramaturgy to analyze the classroom itself as a
   performance venue. A dramaturgical analysis of collaborative teaching is
   especially significant given this growing pedagogical trend because
   identity negotiation in team teaching has the potential to impact one's
   teaching, one's career, and students' learning. We demonstrate that
   despite the positive outcomes of collaborative teaching for both
   teachers and learners, building a successful team is a process that
   takes time, effective communication, risk taking, and trust. Most
   significantly, sustaining a clear definition of the situation in the
   classroom is a challenge when a teaching team is engaged in the ongoing
   negotiation of roles, power, and course structure-in front of students.
   We argue that making identity claims in a collaborative team teaching
   situation is both more challenging and rewarding than acting alone on
   the classroom stage.</td>

   Designing a new course for Honors students provided an opportunity to
   change my traditional teaching style. I envisioned a classroom where
   students enthusiastically became more self-directed learners. I was
   perplexed with mixed reactions from students; while some joined me and
   adopted the model of teaching and learning I proposed, far more than I
   expected resisted this change. Using a sociological framework helped me
   understand that I had overlooked the powerful influence of the larger
   institutional context for shaping and maintaining expectations for
   teacher/student role enactment. I argue that when students' comfort is
   disrupted and their normative role expectations are rendered
   unpredictable or misunderstood, some respond with resistance. Honors
   students, in particular, may be the most resistant to pedagogical
   innovation because they are the most skilled at, and invested in,
   enacting and maintaining the institutionally normative roles.</td>

   terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories.
   Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences
   in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This
   article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to
   develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant
   hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We
   argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under
   circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that,
   compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare
   participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare
   exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in
   states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using
   individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple
   panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged
   with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine
   immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and
   transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare
   benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire
   account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to
   avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of
   dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment
   discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy
   implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.</td>

   laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex
   behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes
   about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural
   orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual
   attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we
   merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to

   Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and
   Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and
   macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural
   orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a
   greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the
   United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

   defend a version of the moral values claim. We show that although the

   overarching moral framework that is extremely resonant to this set of
   voters, and we use in-depth interviews to uncover this framework. A key
   feature of this framework, on which in the 2004 presidential election
   George W. Bush scored high and John Kerry scored low, is the appropriate
   attitude to wealth, which serves as an indicator for a candidate's
   general moral philosophy and as a heuristic about whether the candidate
   will govern with working-class voters' interests in mind. National
   Election Studies data support the argument that this was a key influence
   on the voting decision in 2004, even controlling for voters' partisan
   identification.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa
   has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and
   systematically account for the cross-national variation in the
   prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach,
   this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of
   Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that
   legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation
   of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with
   increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand
   repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and
   systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and
   militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate
   that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the
   religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political
   exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of
   economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic
   mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered
   perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.</td>

   participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have
   ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that
   girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack
   interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of
   accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for
   low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying
   Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant
   observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as
   they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their
   participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while
   enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary
   understanding of social construction by illustrating how social
   structure and cultural discourses interact in shaping everyday social
   interactions.</td>

   integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing
   between "discursive" and "practical" modes of culture and cognition. The
   author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to
   illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he

   to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in
   the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation
   between past levels of lynching and current social control practices
   against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of
   social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we
   hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will
   be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930.
   Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three
   outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but
   the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a
   minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable
   black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal
   hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks,
   and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime
   case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup
   conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control,
   and theories that emphasize minority group threat.</td>

   potential to mutually benefit communities, universities, and students.
   Although a great deal of research reports numerous pedagogical and
   personal benefits for students-from improved grades and increased civic
   engagement to increased understanding and appreciation of
   diversity-there is relatively little research on the impact of service
   learning on the community. To understand when and how service-learning
   courses benefit the community, we conducted in-depth interviews with
   representatives of local community-based organizations that have worked
   with service learners. We report on the primary benefits and costs
   associated with service-learning courses. We identify three types of
   obstacles to successful service-learning courses: issues related to
   student conduct, poor fit between course and organizational objectives,
   and lack of communication between instructors and organizations. We
   develop practical guidelines for addressing these obstacles and for
   ensuring that service learning fulfills teaching and learning goals and
   provides valuable service to community-based organizations.</td>

   world-transforming force that is penetrating more and more aspects of
   social life. It also offers an opportunity to create a learning
   environment that uses the object of study as the medium of study. This
   article examines how instructors can use tourism to teach the sociology
   of tourism, and thereby help students develop an understanding of the
   subject matter through reflexive examination of classroom practice.
   Drawing on research in the sociology of tourism, it outlines a
   conceptual framework for thinking about tourism as a spatial practice
   that includes semiotic, interpersonal and cultural dimensions. Through
   examples, it shows how these dimensions can be synthesized into a
   pedagogical strategy that uses field trips and classroom learning to
   teach the sociology of tourism. The article addresses logistical and
   conceptual issues involved in course planning and implementation.</td>

   to evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative. The results show that
   students in courses with an IDA component significantly improved their
   performance on quantitative skills tests. Efforts to engage students in
   active learning through the use of computers were associated with
   increased student comfort and greater interest in working with data. In
   turn, students who were comfortable working with data exhibited
   especially high levels of quantitative skill. Although students who were
   taught a wide variety of data analysis skills reported greater interest
   in working with data, those who were taught a more limited range of
   skills achieved higher performance scores. Likewise, students who were
   required to complete assignments and undertake graded examinations that
   tested a wide range of quantitative skills had less interest in working
   with data but achieved greater improvements in their test scores.</td>

   the past and thus to possibilities in our future. This article argues
   that big government can democratize society and uses historical
   investigation to make the point. The Study of history emancipates its
   from the tyranny of the present. Progressive social change has come
   about in the United States and elsewhere as combined bottom-up, top-down
   initiatives. I present two such cases of democratization during the New
   Deal era. The first is about rural sociologists' participatory-action
   research with local citizens for policy planning. This program, while
   short-lived, fed into the creation of the field of community
   development. The other is a land-reform experiment among poor African
   Americans. In the 1960s these "resettlement communities" became local
   strongholds of the civil-rights movement, and their descendants carry on
   the Struggle today. I use these two historical instances to show that
   big states as well as social scientists have been effective agents of
   democracy, and suggest that they can be again. History then enable us to
   reimagine, re-new, and re-form our democratic tradition of rural
   sociology.</td>

   what race is, how races differ, and the origins of race. This article
   outlines key empirical, methodological and theoretical considerations
   for a research agenda on racial conceptualization. Drawing on in-depth
   interviews with more than 50 college students, I describe the variety of
   race concepts among respondents, illustrate the importance of using
   multiple measures of conceptualization, and demonstrate the malleability
   of conceptualization, linking it to demographic context and thereby
   raising the question of its future evolution in the changing United
   States of the 21(st) century.</td>

   deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights
   violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master
   narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on
   studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial
   historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the
   degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two
   key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation
   of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective
   trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war
   Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers'
   speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the
   framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for
   apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification
   of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring
   countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that
   arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial
   conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese
   victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights
   language by proponents of the defensive arguments.</td>

   through the vertical flow of exports from lower-income countries, the
   stratified world economy enables higher-income countries to
   misappropriate global environmental space. Tied to their unsustainable
   consumption levels, this misappropriation by higher-income countries
   leads to the suppression of resource consumption in lower-income
   countries, well below globally sustainable thresholds, which negatively
   impacts the well-being of domestic populations. To evaluate key aspects
   of the theory, I test the hypothesis that lower-income countries with
   elevated levels of exports sent to higher-income countries exhibit lower
   consumption-based environmental demand, measured as per-capita
   ecological footprints. Findings for generalized least squares panel
   regression analyses of 66 lower-income countries from 1975 to 2000
   confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional
   results indicate that the strength of the hypothesized relationship
   increased in magnitude during the 25-year period. These findings hold,
   net of the effects of economic development, ecological conditions, and
   other structural factors.</td>

   differs by how we, as social actors, respond and relate to it. The

   In this article, I present data from in-depth interviews with 20
   home-based employees to illustrate how these individuals interact with
   familiar objects in their surroundings to form anchor points for diverse
   lines of conduct. Although I draw from a number of sociological theories
   in my analyses, I further utilize cognitive theory to outline three
   micro-psychological practices (i.e., routinization, goal targeting, and
   emotional alignment) that respondents apply in their attempt to
   establish the desired association between objects and identities. In
   this way, the article both extends previous lines of inquiry into the
   relationship between objects and actors, and makes a new contribution to
   the growing literature on culture and cognition.</td>

   with these personal conflicts deepens our understanding of the social

   to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This
   article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a
   selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective
   action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn
   diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and
   these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In
   Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status,
   exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and
   received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these
   findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies
   show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual
   an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who
   received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more
   and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the
   allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and
   solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.</td>

   embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for
   moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can
   account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social
   settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of
   emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied
   cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are

   calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in
   human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone,
   two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their
   experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats
   to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These
   approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since
   research software for smartphones have been published in open source,
   which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I have written a strictly autobiographical essay about the half dozen
   areas or fields in which I have done sociological research during my
   career. One reason for writing the essay is to encourage students to
   become what I call a "multi," there being too few in sociology, as in
   other disciplines in which most researchers do their work in one field.
   I hope the essay demonstrates that working in many fields can make for a
   satisfying and productive career. Research across areas also encourages
   comparative work, and if enough young people become mufti-field
   researchers, sociologists might then develop more interdisciplinary
   skills, which is even now desirable and may one day be necessary for all
   the social sciences. My essay also describes how and why I became
   interested in my six fields and how I moved between them during my
   career. The rest of the paper describes my major studies and other
   activities in my fields as well as the institutional and other contexts
   that I believe have affected my work.</td>

   manage their feelings in accordance with organizationally defined rules
   and guidelines. Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart introduced this
   concept and inspired an outpouring of research on this topic. This
   article reviews theory and research on emotional labor with a particular
   focus on its contributions to sociological understandings of workers and
   jobs. The sociological literature on emotional labor can be roughly
   divided into two major streams of research. These include studies of
   interactive work and research directly focused on emotions and their
   management by workers. The first uses emotional labor as a vehicle to
   understand the organization, structure, and social relations of service
   jobs, while the second focuses on individuals' efforts to express and
   regulate emotion and the consequences of those efforts. The concept of
   emotional labor has motivated a tremendous amount of research, but it
   has been much less helpful in providing theoretical guidance for or
   integration of the results generated by these bodies of work.</td>

   organic water pollution in less-developed countries, 1980-2000. Using
   panel data from a variety of sources, the author proposes three
   hypotheses: (1) industrial organic water pollution intensity is
   positively associated with foreign investment in manufacturing; (2)
   industrial organic water pollution intensity is positively associated
   with overall export intensity; and (3) industrial organic water
   pollution intensity is negatively associated with the presence of
   environmental international non-governmental organizations. Further
   analyses investigate the impact of organic water pollution on infant
   mortality rates in less-developed countries. In general, findings for
   Prais-Winsten regression analyses with panel-corrected standard errors
   and generalized least squares panel regression analyses of
   less-developed countries confirm the tested hypotheses, and indicate
   that industrial organic water pollution intensity does indeed contribute
   to infant mortality, net of the effects of economic development,
   fertility rates, health expenditures and other relevant factors.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published
   several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were
   addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black
   Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological
   triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church.
   Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a
   comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African
   American community. He addressed the social construction of African
   American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of
   the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was
   recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational
   studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership
   patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and
   ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church
   membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it
   possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these
   areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the
   discipline's past and a bridge to its future.</td>

   recent decades is increased income inequality. While an extensive
   literature has explored the relationship between economic restructuring
   and inequality, the unique contribution of this article is that it
   develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this
   process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap
   between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the
   educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5
   percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of
   Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided
   strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and
   the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income
   gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality.
   Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality
   were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor
   force employed in services, and both were lower where greater
   proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing
   industries.</td>

   of deviance are clearly related to technological innovations (e.g.,
   Internet crimes against children, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying). The
   current undertaking examines the deviance disavowal strategies of men
   arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped
   police interrogations of 18 subjects, about half of whom were arrested
   in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three
   disavowal strategies seeking to maintain a normal definition of self and
   manage the stigma of their arrest. Directions for future studies in the
   sociology of deviance are suggested.</td>

   and Brian Rich's senior seminar in sociology at Transylvania University.
   The essay concludes with advice for the instructor in pursuit of

   evaluating the literature on Japanese higher education and the
   construction of the Japanese student as a form of Orientalism. As I
   embraced international students' unique, context-specific capacities for
   learning, I relied on the illuminating power of C. Wright Mills's
   sociological imagination to heighten their understandings of themselves
   and others. Despite the characterization of Japanese students as passive
   learners, I discovered an engaged and responsive student body who
   developed a keen sociological imagination through storytelling.
   Employing a pedagogy of storytelling, I helped my students successfully
   explore gender and ethnic troubles as public issues in a global context.
   The insight gained abroad has led me to expand my pedagogy at home
   beyond active learning strategies to incorporate stories to enhance U.S.

   institutional power inequalities and that do not advance the social

   innovative approach that helps to address some of these concerns which,
   when used in conjunction with "best practices" of service learning, has
   the potential to make a greater impact on the community than most
   service-learning projects. This paper highlights how two sociology
   programs in two urban universities-a large, elite university and a
   smaller, minority-serving university-have completed significant
   community-based research projects by having classes of students at both
   universities work on projects both consecutively and simultaneously
   across several semesters to complete substantial research projects with
   and for community partners. We use a case study approach to identify
   five key practices that have enabled the two universities to effectively
   collaborate across institutions,</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Though C. Wright Mills made a pivotal contribution to the discipline by
   raising sociologists' awareness of the ideological and bureaucratic
   content of sociological practicality, he may have placed unyielding
   limits on "the promise" he profoundly proclaimed in the "sociological
   imagination." By defining types of practicality in such rigidly
   confining terms, as either "liberal" or "illiberal" those wishing to
   practice sociology in broader and more expansive ways were left with few
   of the alternatives Mills himself wished to extol. Over the past
   generation, the field of applied sociology and teaching and learning
   sociological practice have struggled to develop in the discipline. This
   has posed huge challenges for teachers wishing to address the needs of
   students who have perennially been interested in finding practical
   possibilities for applying their sociology in jobs and careers. The
   purpose of this paper is to: 1) examine the concept of sociological
   practicality propounded by Mills; 2) critically assess the concept of
   sociological practicality in the historical context of American
   sociology, 3) identify and discuss a broad typology of models of
   research and practice from which types of practicality may emerge; 4)
   discuss the implications of this typology for teaching and learning
   sociological practice; and 5) conclude by discussing ways of teaching a
   liberating practicality for sociology.</td>

   article, our critical collective framing perspective begins by focusing
   on state origins of race-based ideology in the mobilization and
   dehumanization leading to genocide. We elaborate this transformative
   dynamic by identifying racially driven macro-micro-macro-level processes
   that are theoretically underdeveloped and contested in many settings. We
   investigate generic processes by exploiting an unprecedented survey of
   refugees from the ongoing genocide in Darfur Our focus is on the
   Sudanese government crisis framing of a dehumanizing collective process.
   Sudanese forces joined with Janjaweed militia to attack black African
   settlements. They aggregated and concentrated racial epithets in a
   collective process of dehumanization anti organized terror which
   amplified the severity of genocidal victimization, the lethal and
   lasting scar of the genocidal state. Our findings question primordial
   and counter-insurgency explanations, while supporting aspects of the
   instrumental, population-resource, constructionist, and cognitive
   perspectives that form the foundation of our critical collective framing
   perspective. It has been more than 50 years since Sutherland famously
   added white-collar crime to public sociology, radically reordering
   discourse about crime. It is time to do the same with Raphael Lemkin
   concept of genocide.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The writings of Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803) foreshadowed several
   of the dominant theories of sociology, social psychology, aesthetics,
   linguistics and literary theory. His ideas impacted generations of
   thinkers, but today he is uncelebrated, mostly unknown. His writings on
   populism, expressionism, and pluralism are relevant to contemporary
   sociology, especially community sociology. Here we consider his views on
   the nature and meaning of community, and his methods Of Studying and
   interpreting communities. These include an emphasis on the essential
   particularity of human communities and their connection to wider systems
   and networks. Herder urges special attention to the elements of context
   (place, time, language, culture) within which communi ties are situated.
   Herder's is an embedded particularism, a focus on individuality and
   diversity within larger unities. He also sensitizes LIS to the
   multivalence and multiplicity of social phenomena. As the proper stance
   for community research he Counsels involvement and empathy rather than
   objectivity and emotional distance, and he urges researchers to be
   sensitive to data from all of their senses, not merely sight. Drawing
   upon Herder's writings, we conclude with several important
   methodological principles relevant to improving current work on the
   nature and conceptualization of communities.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the United States, voter turnout rates have been declining for the
   last 4 decades; however, this pattern differs substantially by region.
   Southern states have actually seen a fairly dramatic increase in turnout
   since the 1950s and currently the South and non-South have almost
   identical rates of voter registration and turnout. Using a series of
   Heckman probit models, which examine voting as a two-step process of
   registering and casting a vote, we systematically investigate
   differences in rates of registering and voting across regions and test
   explanations for regional convergence over time. Using data from the
   American National Election Studies (1956-2000), we find that regional
   convergence in voter registration is primarily due to the removal of
   formal and informal barriers to registration and voting in the South and
   declining efforts to mobilize potential voters in the non-South. In
   addition, we find some fairly distinct differences in which predictors
   are important to each stage of the voting process; for example, race is
   a better predictor of registering to vote than voting. We conclude with
   a discussion of the implications of these results.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Austin Turk (1969) offers a distinctly sociological explanation of
   policing by theorizing that structural reinforcers (e.g., older police
   officer, younger citizen) and reversals (e.g., younger police officer,
   older citizen) of the situationally absolute positional authority of
   police officers affect the relationship between police officers and
   citizens. To this point, however, there have been only three direct
   tests of Turk's theory (Greenleaf and Lanza-Kaduce, 1995; Lanza-Kaduce
   and Greenleaf, 2000; Weidner and Terrill, 2005). All have examined overt
   conflict and the results are mixed. The present research therefore adds
   a fourth test of Turk's (1969) theory to the sociological literature by
   examining the effects of structural reinforcers and reversals on
   citizens' perceptions of the legitimacy and propriety of police actions
   during routine traffic stop encounters. Net of control measures,
   including the legal reason for the traffic stop, and extra-legal
   measures, such as driver gender, the data provide modest to strong
   support for parts of Turk's (1969) theory and absolutely no support for
   others. The conclusion of the present study is that more research is
   needed to determine whether Turk (1969) is correct in theorizing that
   there is a sociology, and not just a social psychology, to
   police-citizen encounters.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article retrieves part of our historical past to address two
   omissions in American feminist sociology on the subject of global
   imperialism. The first section addresses the inadequate attention
   feminist sociologists have paid to how major leaders of the women's
   movement responded to U. S. overseas expansion in the late nineteenth
   and early twentieth centuries. It documents how these early feminists
   had both progressive and reactionary responses to the anti-imperialist
   struggles of their era. Particular emphasis is given to how issues of
   race, class, and gender were interwoven in their discourses on
   imperialism.The second section focuses on how the writings of the most
   famous woman theorist and critic of imperialism during this era-Rosa
   Luxemburg-are virtually ignored in U. S. portrayals of feminist
   sociology and women founders of sociology. To address this omission,
   Luxemburg's theory of imperialism is examined, as well as how it has
   influenced contemporary global feminist works. A critical analysis of
   these Luxemburg-inspired works considers their implications for
   understanding global imperialism today. In this way, the past is used to
   clarify the present.</td>

   processes, and yet the pedagogical implications of this scholarship
   remain largely untapped. In this paper, we employ a framework of
   sociology as pedagogy to show how sociology can enhance and inform
   teaching and learning. We select examples from a range of classical and
   contemporary social thought to highlight the connection between
   sociological theory and the practices of teaching and learning. We use
   these theories to demonstrate a broad application of our notion of
   sociology as pedagogy, however, we believe that all sociological
   knowledge can be mined for its pedagogical significance. Furthermore,
   recognizing how sociological phenomena shape the classroom experience is
   conducive to a more reflexive pedagogy in line with the tenets of the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Critical thinking is often presented as a generic technique. This
   article develops an alternative that links critique more closely to the
   sociological perspective. I suggest three answers to the above question:
   that the sociological perspective is critical for comprehending complex
   issues, that all sociology is implicitly critical by virtue of its
   debunking tendency, and that some sociology is explicitly critical by
   virtue of value commitments that lead to a critique of domination. The
   article identifies some basic themes of what it means to think
   sociologically, discusses sociology's "double critique" in more detail,
   illustrates the critical potential of scientific, humanistic and
   critical approaches to sociology, and explores some implications of this
   approach for how we teach sociology. It concludes by suggesting that the
   goal of fostering critical thinking in our students might better be met
   by returning to the critical roots of our own discipline.</td>

   Internet videoconferencing technology. The instructor used a laptop,
   webcam, highspeed DSL connection, and Polycom (TM) Viewstation to teach
   a course unit of introductory sociology from a remote location to an
   experimental group of students in a large multimedia classroom. The same
   instructor taught a control group of introductory sociology students
   without videoconferencing. The groups were compared using exam scores,
   attendance, classroom observations, and student evaluations. The use of
   Internet videoconferencing did not affect exam scores or attendance.
   However, it substantially lowered student evaluation scores. In
   comparison to classroom-based instruction and due to problems with and
   limitations of the technology, students experienced greater difficulty
   communicating with the instructor, felt more separated, and were less
   engaged in the course. Therefore, they perceived the instructor's
   teaching to be less effective, and evaluations reflected lower scores,
   thereby "punishing" the instructor. Symbolic interactionism is used to
   interpret the results. This research is compared and contrasted with a
   previous study conducted by one of the authors (Koeber 2005), also
   published in Teaching Sociology, which yielded opposite results. In
   Koeber's study the instructor was rewarded with favorable student
   evaluations for the use of new technology that enhanced engagement. We
   conclude that when instructors choose whether or not to use Internet
   videoconferencing, they must weigh the potential benefits associated
   with bridging distance gaps versus potential costs associated with
   reduction in quantity and quality of symbolic interaction that may cause
   students to disengage.</td>

   institution continues to elude clear and full specification. One reason
   for this lack of clarity is that about 50 years ago empirical
   researchers in the field of sociology turned their gaze downward, away
   from macro-sociological constructs in order to focus their attention on
   middle-range empirical projects. It took almost 20 years for the concept
   of the institution to work its back onto the empirical research agenda
   of mainstream sociologists. The new institutional project in
   organizational sociology led the way. Since then, scholars in this
   tradition have achieved a great deal but there is still much more to
   accomplish. Here, future directions for research are considered by
   reviewing how the concept of the institution has come to be treated by
   mainstream philosophers, sociologists of science and technology studies,
   and social network theorists.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article I first examine the ways in which the dual terms of
   structure and agency are used in sociological theories. Then, relying on
   Lacan's notions of split-subject, the formula of sexuation, and forms of
   discourses, and Laclau's theory of ideological hegemony, I argue that
   agency in most current sociological formulations is but a posited other
   of the structure that dissolves if examined closely; it is similar to
   the Lacanian fantasmic object. To resolve the fundamental paradoxes in
   structure-agency theories, I reformulate structures as paradoxical,
   incomplete, and contingent symbolic formations that are always partial
   and unstable due to their inclusion and exclusion operations.
   Consequently, social transformational agency consists in the structural
   inconsistencies that open structural gaps available to social actors. As
   a result, agency can be recognized in two moments conceived as two
   symbolic gestures. From this perspective, agency as such is always a
   possibility qua potential and its efficacy is always retroactively
   recognized-actualized from within a new social structure or symbolic
   order.</td>

   mechanisms, thus reinforcing urban inequality in U. S. cities. The
   results, however, indicate a more complex relationship. On the one hand,
   there are common mechanisms behind the two processes: the pursuit of
   higher property values, fear of crime, and fear of increased social
   heterogeneity. An increase in percent recent immigrants leads to higher
   levels of both segregation and gating. On the other hand, factors such
   as region, percent black, percent Hispanic, percent college graduates,
   and functional specialization affect the two processes differentially.
   Although segregation is less pronounced and declining in the U. S. urban
   Southwest, gated communities are much more prominent there. The results
   challenge the notion that the declines in residential segregation in
   recent decades indicate social progress.</td>

   last two decades. Though nearly everyone now agrees that culture
   matters, how it matters is not terribly clear. What, exactly, is culture
   supposed to do? In this essay, I articulate two ideal-typical - though
   often implicit - ways most sociologists have thought about culture's
   role in action. Although no single sociologist or piece of research
   fully embodies either ideal type, I believe they are real tendencies in
   the field that have real consequences for how research is designed,
   undertaken, and understood. After outlining these approaches, I subject
   them to an engagement with cognitive science. This is not out a desire
   for reductionism but, as I will show, because a crucial difference
   between these perspectives is their implicit model of how human beings
   perceive, acquire, store, retrieve, and act on the symbolic information
   that surrounds them every day. This exercise will lead to the conclusion
   that both perspectives are incomplete and will point toward a synthetic
   approach that can shed new light on how culture matters for action.</td>

   structural configurations ("spaces of relations") and the specific
   cultural content ("rules of the game" and "symbolic capital") of global
   systems. The utility of the approach is demonstrated through an analysis
   of the different forms of the two hegemonic empires of the past
   centuries, Great Britain and the United States. The British state tended
   toward formal imperialism in the 19th century, characterized by direct
   territorial rule, while the United States since WWII has tended toward
   informal imperialism. The essay shows that the difference can be best

   Croatian case and to develop a broader theoretical framework for

   status-group conflict, organizational self-interest, the strategic use
   of cultural ideals of merit, and broader social trends and contingent
   historical events interweave to shape institutional power in the United
   States. The Chosen, Jerome Karabel's monumental study of the history of
   college admissions at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton from 1900 to 2005,
   offers a political sociology of elite recruitment and a cultural and
   social history of the definition of merit that has guided these three
   schools and shaped much current thinking about college admissions. As
   Max Weber reminded us, the very definition of cultural ideals of an
   epoch bear the stamp of elite group domination: not cultural ideals but
   cultural interests and their strategic uses guide institutional power.
   The book provides an impressive empirical demonstration of that
   proposition: it identifies four different definitions of merit as
   organizational gatekeeping tools that have guided Harvard, Yale, and
   Princeton over the last hundred years and shows how these definitions
   were molded by status-group conflict and organizational interests. This
   essay outlines the central arguments of Karabel's book; it identifies
   key contributions for our understanding of the history, culture,
   organizational interests, and politics of these three institutions; it
   highlights the social closure framework guiding the analysis; and it
   reflects on a fundamental ambiguity in Karabel's thinking about
   meritocratic ideals as governing principles for modern stratified
   societies.</td>

   methodological and theoretical elements of a strong program in cultural
   sociology, a program that argues for a meaning-centered social science.
   If meaning is to be so central, then the theoretical tools that the
   humanities have developed to investigate art and language must become
   central to the human sciences more generally. The 'thick descriptions'
   Geertz proposes for social science are powerful reconstructions of the
   empirical, not simply detailed observations. Likewise, the local
   knowledge Geertz valorized is inevitably rooted in more encompassing,
   global meaning-structures, even while every global theme becomes not
   enriched but different as it emerges locally. Interests can never be
   objective, and extra-individual structures are both cultural and social
   at the same time. Yet, while structures are central, they take form only
   through contingent process, and intertwining them is what Geertz's turn
   to performance was about.</td>

   formalism of the early 20th century, the article uncovers the textual
   and structural foundations that gave it a competitive advantage over his
   other writings. In so doing the analysis seeks to reconcile Geertz with
   the structuralism that he famously and perhaps unwisely dismissed as
   irrelevant for interpretative sociology. The reception trajectory of
   Geertz points to the need for a more robust theory of culture than his

   sociology generally - an epistemic dilemma: does an interpretation of

   Geertz suggests the two are not mutually exclusive. In his empirical
   studies he artfully produced 'maximal interpretations' that went beyond
   both extant theories and the immediate data given by participant
   observation. Maximal interpretations, I argue, claim the epistemic
   status of sociological explanations. Indeed, the core problems of the
   philosophy of social science and social theory can be reframed in terms
   of the difference between relatively uncontroversial 'minimal
   interpretation' and relatively tendentious (but powerful) 'maximal
   interpretation'. The implications of this distinction for research can
   be made clear by considering, as an example, what is required to explain
   witch hunts in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America, and the Salem
   witch trials in particular.</td>

   have shaped the discipline of sociology and continue to shape it. It is
   organized around the concept of crisis, arguing that sociology has been
   produced by crises and that it has been defined by its responses to
   crises. It identifies an ethic of control and manipulation as a chief
   product of 19th century responses. It suggests that we have once again
   entered a period of disruption and rapid change, and that the current
   challenge of sociology is to situate ourselves, reflexively, within a
   dense web of philosophical, psychological, social, biological, and
   environmental linkages, recognizing that we can never see the network in
   its entirety because we ourselves are nodes within it. However, the
   ethic of control and manipulation that we have inherited from earlier
   sociological responses often prevents sociologists from developing an
   immanent, reflexive, and ecological approach to the crisis of the
   present that would enable us to place ourselves within this web.</td>

   highlight the shame and embarrassment of subordinate groups when such
   activities devolve into voyeuristic spectacles of human misery. In light
   of these potential harms to nonstudent groups, this article proposes
   guiding questions for educators to address in designing experiential
   activities. These questions draw attention to the following issues: the
   vulnerability of participants, the relative social power of nonstudent
   participants, whether participation is truly voluntary, the
   accessibility of the setting to outside observers, group size, benefits
   to nonstudent participants, duration of activity, protection of
   confidentiality, the role of students in the activity, and the
   curricular focus of the experience.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We have updated Ferree and Hall's (1990) study of the way gender and
   race are constructed through pictures in introductory sociology
   textbooks. Ferree and Hall looked at 33 textbooks published between 1982
   and 1988. We replicated their study by examining 3,085 illustrations in
   a sample of 27 textbooks, most of which were published between 2002 and
   2006. We found important areas of progress in the presentation of both
   gender and race as well as significant areas of stasis. The face of
   society we found depicted in contemporary textbooks was distinctly less
   likely to be that of a white man, very prominent in the 1980s texts, and
   much more likely to be that of a minority woman. Thus, while only 34
   percent of the pictures of identifiable individuals in the textbooks
   examined by Ferree and Hall were of women, almost 50 percent of such
   pictures were of women in the recent texts. Moreover, while the
   percentage of white men portrayed dropped from about 45 percent to 30
   percent, the percentage of portrayals of minority women rose from about
   11 percent to 22 percent. Another sign of progress has been the
   decreasing likelihood of textbooks to depict race and gender as being
   nonoverlapping categories: while women of color apparently "had" only
   race in the sample examined by Ferree and Hall, they "had" both gender
   and race in the sample we studied. Still, our examination of pictures as
   a whole as a unit of analysis found that blacks continue to be more
   likely than any other racial group to be depicted in the presence of
   other racial groups and thus, to idealize the degree of social
   integration in American society. We also still see non-white women
   enjoying very little (in fact, no) visibility in sections devoted to
   theory, despite developments in feminist theory, generally, and
   multicultural feminist, specifically. In general, though, our analysis
   suggests that the various criticisms of introductory texts that have
   appeared in this forum and others can have an impact on the content of
   those texts and, by extension, the sociology we teach.</td>

   overlooks the potential for outsiders to determine the content of
   knowledge within professional disciplines. Using the case of the Sally
   Hemings affair, I introduce the concept of "knowledge advocacy" to
   analyze how outside groups shape historical knowledge. The Hemings
   controversy involved not only historical evidence, but also the
   understanding of objectivity in historical research. Unfolding against
   the backdrop of the professionalization of history, outside advocates
   successfully challenged the disciplined understanding of "objectivity as
   neutrality" eventually embracing "objectivity as the scientific method"
   in their appeal to DNA testing. This study illuminates the strategic
   interplay between professional historians and outsiders engaged in
   knowledge advocacy, the role of objectivity in this struggle, and the
   potential vulnerability a discipline faces when the ideal of objectivity
   is compromised.</td>

   but have rarely examined the role of religion in the lives of scientists
   or how the sciences have changed religiously over time. Here we address
   this shortcoming by comparing religiosity between two samples of elite
   academic natural and social scientists, one in 1969 and one in 2005.
   Findings show an overall decline in religiosity among university
   scientists as well as a change in their religious composition.
   Attendance rates were lower for social scientists in 1969 compared to
   natural scientists, but in 2005 growing parity in attendance occurred
   between the two fields. Findings also show a decline in the proportion
   of Protestant scientists and a growth in Catholic scientists.
   Demographic factors associated with religiosity in the general
   population, with the exception of age and having children, had no impact
   among elite academic scientists. Overall, findings challenge and revise
   older studies on the role of religion in the lives of scientists.
   Specific results are connected to theories that pose science as a master
   identity, which may be mitigated by some institutionalized aspects of
   religion. They also lead to new directions in the sociology of religion
   that take seriously the role of religion in the lives of elites and
   connect societal religious changes to differences between institutional
   spheres, particularly those, such as the academy, that play a leadership
   role in society.</td>

   the complexities of ethnic and racial relations in the contemporary
   United States by focusing on the impacts of 9/11 - particularly in
   relation to immigration policy. Because the attackers entered the
   country through regular immigration channels (i.e., as foreign students)
   the U. S. government has introduced policies to enhance border security,
   restrict immigration, increase the surveillance of immigrant
   populations, and more actively enforce immigration policy. These
   national-security-related immigration policies, however, are
   exacerbating existing tensions and producing new sets of ethnic and
   racialized conflicts in the United States. In this article, I first
   provide an overview of the key national-security-related immigration
   policies that were passed in the wake of September 11, 2001. Then, I
   review some of the recent sociological literature, as well as draw from
   my own preliminary research in the State of New Jersey, to illustrate
   the social impacts of these policies on ethnic and racial relations. I
   conclude with an outline of the ways the sociology of ethnic and racial
   relations specifically, as well as other subfields of the discipline,
   might approach analyses of social conflict in the contemporary United
   States, post - September 11.</td>

   is spent studying sociology's position and status in the academy. Using
   a variant of Dillman's "total designmethod," the author conducted a
   survey of 345 arts and sciences academic deans, asking them to select
   the top-ranked and second-ranked disciplines on a number of items.
   Sociology fared quite well or well on commitment and concern with
   students, success in conducting research aimed at ameliorating community
   problems, ability to work in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary
   teams, involvement in college and university governance, and involvement
   in the surrounding community. Sociology did not fare well on academic
   rigor, success in attracting students to the discipline, success of
   students with regard to occupational and graduate education achievement,

   students to complete one or two courses on sociological theory. The
   instructors for these courses have an extraordinary opportunity to
   affect the perspectives and practices of future generations of scholars.
   This study assesses the backgrounds, attitudes, beliefs, and practices
   of those instructors regarding different approaches to theorizing, with
   particular attention paid to topics related to science and to theory
   construction. Sociologists who teach required theory courses in the
   discipline's top fifty graduate training programs were asked a series of
   questions pertaining to their own training and to the courses they were
   teaching: attitudes toward different kinds of theorizing, perceptions of
   the role that theory plays in sociology and in science, and views on the
   nature of science. Results indicate a strong consensus on the most
   important classical theorists (Marx, Weber, and Durkheim). However,
   attitudes and practices varied widely in regard to other classical
   theorists, contemporary sociological theory, and the role of scientific
   standards in the development of sociological knowledge. The author
   explores some of the implications of these attitudes and practices.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>'Theory' is one of the most important words in the lexicon of
   contemporary sociology. Yet, their ubiquity notwithstanding, it is quite
   unclear what sociologists mean by the words 'theory,' 'theoretical,' and
   'theorize.' I argue that confusions about the meaning of 'theory' have
   brought about undesirable consequences, including conceptual muddles and
   even downright miscommunication. In this paper I tackle two questions:
   (a) what does 'theory' mean in the sociological language?; and (b) what
   ought 'theory' to mean in the sociological language? I proceed in five
   stages. First, I explain why one should ask a semantic question about
   'theory.' Second, I lexicographically identify seven different senses of
   the word, which I distinguish by means of subscripts. Third, I show some
   difficulties that the current lack of semantic clarity has led sociology
   to. Fourth, I articulate the question, 'what ought "theory" to mean?,'
   which I dub the 'semantic predicament' (SP), and I consider what one can
   learn about it from the theory literature. Fifth, I recommend a
   'semantic therapy' for sociology, and advance two arguments about SP:
   (a) the principle of practical reason-SP is to a large extent a
   political issue, which should be addressed with the help of political
   mechanisms; and (b) the principle of ontological and epistemological
   pluralism-the solution to SP should not be too ontologically and
   epistemologically demanding.</td>

   emerged. While not absolutely in sync, there is a striking overlap
   across three of the most visible of these: Boyer's Scholarship
   Reconsidered, Carnegie's Stewardship of the Discipline, and Burawoy's
   Public Sociology. Putting the development of these conceptualizations
   into the larger context of shifts in higher education, I briefly review
   each, putting special emphasis on the synergy among them. However,
   despite these overarching guides and a number of other noted innovations
   (particularly in the scholarship of teaching and learning), new
   challenges have arisen, I end by discussing these new developments,
   drawing from basic sociological research to provide insights for
   maintaining gains and pushing these efforts forward. In particular, SoTL
   and the aging of the cohort of leaders who pioneered these redefinition
   efforts emphasize the importance of Preparing Future Faculty (PFF)
   programs, and the placement of new PhDs with this broad vision in
   PhD-granting departments, as well as in liberal arts colleges and

   considerably more likely than other sociologists to engage students in
   research and somewhat more likely to use simulations or games.</td>

   depends on both the resources of the martyr's supporters and the
   cultural context into which the martyr's image is introduced. Our
   approach is well suited to analyzing how martyrs are used 'on the
   ground' and given cultural and material utility. We highlight the
   attention paid to the conception and reception of the martyr's corporeal
   body, in particular, as a source of identity and meaning, giving
   emotional weight to social ideas about death and sacrifice. Control over
   martyrs' bodies derives from the cultural and political intricacies of
   reputational entrepreneurship, thus employing the body as a medium of
   culture. To examine this concept of embodied martyrdom, we examine the
   cases of Joan of Arc, John Brown, and Che Guevara.</td>

   somewhat problematic recent trajectories of the RSS as a professional

   of disciplinary and organizational inertia that have limited the pursuit
   of new directions. It also presents a discussion of selected factors
   that have contributed to these concerns, including both "external"
   factors that are largely beyond the organizational reach of RSS and
   "internal" factors that are more directly linked to organizational
   characteristics and actions. Drawing upon the distinctions between "red

   alternatives that, if pursued, could help to create an expanded set of
   opportunities and a brighter future for rural sociology, and for the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Many theories in the sociology of emotions assume that emotions emerge
   from the cognitive consistency principle. Congruence among cognitions
   produces good feelings whereas incongruence produces bad feelings. A
   work situation is simulated in which managers give feedback to workers
   that is consistent or inconsistent with what the workers expect to get
   from their performance. Workers' emotional reactions are then obtained.
   The power and status of the managers is investigated. The findings
   reveal that how much time workers have to process their performance
   feedback, and the power and status of the managers, influence workers to
   feel good about feedback that is inconsistent with their expectations.
   These findings are consistent with the enhancement process. We suggest
   that the enhancement process be included in sociology theories on
   emotions.</td>

   mediated-membership leads to unintentional political socialization

   effective in the direct mobilization of their members. This article
   tests these competing claims, while also considering the extent to which
   the mediation process relies on negative social capital (targeted

   from more than 1,600 counties and seemingly unrelated regression
   techniques, the author finds that the presence of men in families is
   integral to community efforts to reduce both female and male violence
   levels, net controls for ecological variables; old heads are moderately
   effective in reducing male violence levels. Men in families have robust
   effects on both female and male violence rates, though male homicide is
   somewhat more responsive to shifts in the presence of men in families
   and old heads. Gender differences across other ecological variables are

   on social evaluation via the lens of determinants of wine price.
   Empirical findings show that under distinct classification systems,
   similar categories and wine attributes have different significances and
   affect wine price differently. These findings shed light on the profound
   consequences of the organizations and structures of categories in

   shortcomings of sociology are indigenous and have nothing to do with
   psychologism. Indeed, a more scientific sociology would look more, not
   less, like psychology. Purity is undesirable in that it is not only not
   a scientific virtue, but is antithetical to the very scientific values
   that Black invokes to justify it. His systems are neither theories nor
   laws, but heuristics, more akin to common sense than to scientific
   theory. Finally, purity is unattainable because though society is indeed
   discontinuous with the individuals who make it up, it and all theorizing
   about it, are ontologically and conceptually dependent upon them.</td>

   to disciplining bodies is not a point of contention for us. It is,
   however, unclear where the disciplining lines are drawn, and what
   happens when bodies that resist corporeal rationality refuse to
   disappear. What are the consequences of/for publicly successful,
   undisciplined bodies operating instead in a corporeal irrationality? Of
   course this entire line of questioning suggests fissures in the
   disciplining systems of corporeal rationality outlined by several
   scholars (Kirk, 2004; Shilling, 2005). It is to when and where such
   disciplining systems come unhinged that we aim this analysis of John

   seldom deployed within a relational perspective that was fundamental to
   Bourdieu's thinking. The article "Bourdieu and Organizational Analysis"

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Adolescent substance use is an important area of research in sociology;
   however, there is a lack of research on nonmedical prescription drug
   use. The dearth of research on this topic is problematic given the
   relatively high prevalence of use among adolescents, the drastic
   increase in use in recent years, and the potential negative consequences
   from misusing prescription drugs. Using data from a national sample of
   adolescents, this research fills an important gap in the literature by
   testing one of the most prominent theories of deviance: social learning
   theory. Findings support variables related to social learning theory as
   correlates of nonmedical prescription drug use. Adolescents with
   definitions that are pro-substance use, whose peers use drugs, and whose
   parents and peers have attitudes that condone substance use are more
   likely to report nonmedical prescription drug use in the past year.
   Important implications and future research directions are discussed.</td>

   and this article is to focus attention on teaching methods that require
   students to actively investigate sociological phenomena. During the
   workshop, participants practiced constructing inquiry-guided learning
   activities suitable for a range of different courses taught throughout
   the curriculum. These activities are described here. Inquiry-guided
   learning (IGL) includes a variety of teaching methods that assist
   students in their investigation of questions and problems. Fundamental
   to IGL in sociology is the notion that students should think and act
   like sociologists. IGL activities provide a means whereby the instructor
   models and the student practices the same disciplinary activities.
   Students "do" sociology rather than just learning about the results of
   others.</td>

   quantitative elements throughout the curriculum but doing so can mean
   challenges in preparation and presentation of material for instructors
   and increased anxiety for students. This paper describes tools and
   resources available through the Inter-university Consortium for
   Political and Social Research (ICPSR) that will aid students and
   instructors engaging in quantitative literacy across the curriculum. The
   Online Learning Center is a source of empirical activities aimed at
   undergraduates in lower-division substantive courses and Exploring Data
   through Research Literature presents an alternative to traditional
   research methods assignments. Searching and browsing tools, archive
   structures, and extended online-analysis tools make it easier for
   students in upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses to engage
   in exercises that increase quantitative literacy, and paper competitions
   reward them for doing so.</td>

   Strategies for addressing these concerns center on building a community

   ongoing active role for students, 2) mechanisms to establish a common
   language of discourse, and 3) a means of monitoring students' feelings.
   Examples are provided which introduce readers to ideas which can help in
   the creation and maintenance of a successful community of learners when
   teaching these difficult subjects. These processes can build student
   engagement and help to reduce student anxieties. More detailed

   "Teaching the Sociology of Gender and Work," that can help students
   understand the mechanisms and consequences of workplace gender
   inequality at the macro- and micro-levels. Cynthia Anderson's class
   project uses wage and sex composition data that allows students to learn
   actively how data are used to study general trends and changes over
   time. It encourages students to explore the reality of their possible
   careers and fields in terms of wages, proportion of women and men, and
   other factors. Sharon Bird's class exercise requires students to
   consider the interactional dynamics of everyday work life and encourages
   them to see the subtle processes of marginalization and exclusion while
   also thinking about how to overcome gender biases. Some of this
   information will contribute to student angst about inequality in the
   workplace; thus, we conclude with suggestions for decreasing potential
   student distress and increasing student empowerment.</td>

   community is enjoying a renaissance in sociology. Yet much research in
   this area relies on exclusively "structural" thinking, attributing group
   identification to mechanisms such as the arrangement of physical space,
   power relations, or high investment requirements. Often neglected is a
   strand of theory that attributes gemeinschaft to shared moral order and
   culture. Using data from the Urban Communes Project, this article
   directly tests the influence of both structural and cultural mechanisms
   in producing the experience of community. Although the results show that
   both structural and cultural mechanisms are positively correlated with
   gemeinschaft, they also confirm the existence of shared moral order as
   the most likely proximate mechanism for creating community in these
   groups. Analyses using fuzzy-set techniques illustrate how culture and
   structure combine to sustain-or inhibit-the experience of community.</td>

   practices can structure and reflect identity and social relations. Based
   on individual and group interviews and observations in Berlin, Get-many,
   this study examines how a group of Turkish men experience and assign
   significance to the activity of caring for domestic pigeons. Building on
   approaches to ethnicity that follow the "cognitive turn," as well as
   recent studies of human-anitnal interaction and cultural examinations of
   nature and the environment, this article demonstrates how: (1) these men
   frame their animal practices within their understandings of ethnicity,
   culture, and territory; and (2) communal relationships formed through
   pigeon caretaking reinforce definitions of Turkish ethnicity and culture
   for participants. Beyond offering in situ data on the link between
   animal practices and ethnicity, the analyses and case suggest how and
   why sociologists should consider animals and nature as potential
   constitutive objects of ethnic identity and culture.</td>

   resources are used in interaction to facilitate social actors' goal of
   self-verification. As the control of resources fosters
   self-verification, self-verification is expected to influence the
   availability of additional resources for actors to use to sustain
   themselves in future interactions. The authors employ a principal theory
   in sociology on the self, identity theory, to theoretically frame this
   research, and they use a representative sample of individuals in newly
   forged relationships to examine the reciprocal relationship between
   resources and the verification of a person identity and role identity.
   The findings reveal that the relationship between resource use and
   identity verification is mutually reinforcing: resource use facilitates
   identity verification and identity verification increases the resources
   available for future use. This reciprocal relationship occurs across
   identities and over time. The results provide insights on the idea that
   resources at the macro-, meso-, and microlevels are mobilized among
   social actors to support the self and each other, help maintain a system
   of interaction, and reproduce culture and social structure.</td>

   conceptual framework for understanding the association of children's
   mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this
   framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of
   attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider
   diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National
   Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent
   classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and
   externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the
   classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school
   completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three
   sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude,
   disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational
   expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude
   and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health
   problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational
   trajectories.</td>

   archives to deposit the maximum possible information for replicating
   published results at the time of publication and are explicit about the

   How do the leaders' goals compare with those expressed in leading SoTL

   explores the challenges raised through teaching the course "Jewish Women
   in Contemporary America," and links these challenges to the pedagogy of
   race, class and gender more broadly. Using the classroom as a research
   site, the authors conducted post-course interviews with students and
   kept detailed field notes on class sessions. The authors use Judith
   Butler's theorization of performativity to analyze classroom dynamics.
   After redesigning and teaching the course a second time, the authors
   conclude that the relationship between "experience" and "theory" must be
   constantly interrogated by both instructor and students; that personal
   narratives merit space within the classroom, but must be problematized;
   and a critical Jewish Women's Studies, based on illuminating the
   socially constructed and hybrid character of contemporary Jewish
   American women's identities, can help to expose the tendency to
   methodological essentialism still prevalent in much of the feminist
   race, class, and gender literature.</td>

   to apply and integrate a variety of concepts and research findings
   covered in our sociology courses; 3) allows us to assess how well
   students understand affirmative action and to what degree they retain
   myths about the programs, and 4) covers an emotionally charged topic
   with enough depth to go beyond surface reactions. We find that this
   integrated approach dispels some of the most common myths, leads
   students to become more thoughtful and analytical, and gives them a good

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Jeffrey Alexander's recent book on cultural sociology argues that
   sociologists must grant the realm of ideas autonomy to determine
   behavior, unencumbered by interference from instrumental or material
   factors. He criticizes the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu as "weak" for
   failing to give autonomy to culture by reducing it to self-interested
   behavior that immediately reflects class position. However, Alexander's
   arguments seriously distort and misstate Bourdieu's theory, which
   provides for the relative autonomy of culture through the concepts of
   habitus and field. Because habitus is a set of durable dispositions
   conditioned by past structures, it may contradict the changed structures
   of the present. Further, the influence of the habitus is always mediated
   by the structure and strategies of the field of contest in which it is
   deployed, so that the same habitus may motivate different actions in
   different circumstances. However, Alexander is correct to argue that in
   Bourdieu's theory culture generally serves to reproduce, not contradict
   social structures. Yet Bourdieu addresses this and other problems in his
   later work, in which he argues for the existence of certain cultural
   universals transcending particular structures.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Travis Hirschi's control or social bonding theory argues that those
   persons who have strong and abiding attachments to conventional society
   (in the form of attachments, involvement, investment, and belief) are
   less likely to deviate than persons who have weak or shallow bonds.
   Later, Gottfredson and Hirschi moved away from the social bond as the
   primary factor in deviance, and toward an emphasis on self-control. In
   short, low self-control is associated with higher levels of deviance and
   criminality irrespective of the strength or weakness of one's social
   bonds. In this article I argue that Talcott Parsons' AGIL schema easily
   incorporates Hirschi's social bond into its broader analytical
   framework. Furthermore, from within the logical framework of Parsons'
   system, Hirschi's move from an emphasis on social bonds to an emphasis
   on self-control is wholly compatible with, and even anticipated by, the
   AGIL schema. The article illustrates, and argues for, the continuing
   importance of theoretical subsumption in sociology and criminology.
   Lastly, a set of testable hypotheses is generated based upon this
   theoretical reformulation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Here we assess the limitations of "social physics" methods for making
   predictions of future social conditions in order to contribute to the
   development of an alternative model of scientific sociology. First, we
   discuss the complexities inherent in causal analyses of social
   phenomena, where social organizing principles change historically and
   causal forces interact to generate outcomes. Second, we analyze the
   assumptions that underlie prediction in the social sciences by using the
   population projections of demographers as an illustrative example.
   Demographers typically make projections assuming the future will be the
   same as the (recent) past. This approach neglects the possibility of
   abrupt historical change, contingent events, and emergent social
   structures. Third, we argue that historical contingency is an essential
   and necessary consideration in any analysis of the world. A historical
   materialist approach provides the basis for better formulating
   nomothetic and idiographic modes of explanation and appreciates the
   important connections between the two. Sociological inquiry should be an
   attempt to distinguish between truly nomothetic processes and emergent
   historical background conditions that only appear nomothetic in a
   specific historical era. We close with an argument for the importance of
   developing a sociological science that runs parallel to nonmechanistic
   approaches in the biological sciences.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although the philosophy of pragmatism influenced American sociology,
   specifically that of symbolic interactionism, its use as a tool for
   explanation of everyday life has been underutilized throughout
   sociology. In this article, pragmatism, specifically the ideas of George
   Herbert Mead and John Dewey provide a framework for the understanding of
   grieving, specifically as it relates to people with mental retardation.
   Both Mead and Dewey's use and inclusion of physics into their
   philosophies proved paramount in their assertions regarding Cartesian or
   ontological dualism. They then demonstrated through the inclusion of
   quantum physics how to avoid positivism, thereby creating the necessary
   link of science with human perception and human action. Mead's use of
   the Theory of Relativity, as well as Sociality; and Dewey's
   incorporation of the Uncertainty Principle, and addressing the sum of
   possibilities, provides a context where the grieving process of people
   with mental retardation will be much more pronounced. People with mental
   retardation, by definition, through their neural networks have an
   inability to perceive existence in a manner that is functionally the
   same as the rest of the population. Their abilities influence how people
   with mental retardation relate to themselves or environment, thereby
   creating either fewer realities or systems from which to interact, or
   creating ones that are functionally dissimilar from the typical
   population, hence the label "mental retardation;" therefore, the loss of
   someone or something creates a greater hole or emptiness for people with
   mental retardation than the rest of society.</td>

   rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological
   concept of reactivity-the idea that people change their behavior in
   reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured-offers a useful lens
   for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed
   for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of
   public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms,
   self-fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and
   then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This
   approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures
   change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is
   important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more
   systematically.</td>

   studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws
   on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in
   selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may

   in the West more generally, have focused on economic transition,
   political instability, and the functional aspects of witchcraft belief.
   A more interpretive approach to the explanation of Salem is proposed: an
   analysis of the intersection of the gendered symbolization of witchcraft
   in colonial Massachusetts and the larger tensions within Puritan culture
   at the close of the 17th century. A broad theoretical implication of
   this interpretive shift is also proposed: that a cultural-sociological
   approach to witch-hunting as symbolic action can bring together feminist
   theorizations of witch-hunting as an exercise in patriarchal power with
   the social history of the broad, structural causes of witch-hunting in
   pre-modern Europe and New England.</td>

   many introductory sociology textbooks have begun to include coverage of
   the topic. Our study first assesses the extent of textual coverage of
   sexuality in a sample of 38 introductory textbooks published after 2000.
   Secondly, we focus on 14 textbooks with a sexuality chapter and/or
   textbooks with more than the average textual coverage of sexuality. We
   find that the emergent "core" of the sociology of sexuality centers on
   sex research, historical and cross-cultural trends in sexuality, media
   representations, gender and sexuality, homosexuality and society, and
   sexual violence. These textbooks vary widely in their attention to the
   intersection of race, class and sexuality and theoretical applications.
   We find lingering heteronormativity, homogenization of homosexuality,
   and problematic representations of non-normative sexuality within the
   chapters. We conclude with comments on the relevance of these findings
   and offer some suggestions to ensure that coverage of sexuality better
   reflects scholarship and discourse within the discipline.</td>

   stratified by socioeconomic background and race/ethnicity. We suggest
   that inequalities in knowledge of the costs of going to college
   contribute to persistent patterns of stratification. We hypothesize that
   disadvantaged parents who believe their child will attend college are
   less certain of the costs of college attendance than more advantaged
   parents. As a result, they are less able or willing to provide an
   estimate of the costs of college attendance, more likely to
   over-estimate those costs if they do provide an estimate, and more
   likely to make larger errors in estimation than comparable middle-class
   or white parents. Using nationally representative data, we find mixed
   support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents
   and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college
   tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On
   average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that
   are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We discuss
   implications of these findings for sociological theory and for
   inequality in postsecondary education. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   research strategy that guides formal sociologists in their efforts to
   distill generic social patterns from their specific cultural,
   situational, and historical contexts. Following in the implicit
   methodological footsteps of Georg Simmel, social pattern analysts view
   specific sociohistorical configurations as mere instantiations of such
   patterns, thereby deliberately disregarding various idiosyncrasies of
   the particular communities, events, and social situations they examine.
   Analytically focused, they thus draw their evidence from multiple social
   contexts, thereby making their essentially decontextualized findings
   more generalizable. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to historians and
   ethnographers, they try to highlight universality rather than
   singularity, thereby focusing their attention on the common formal
   features of any given pattern across those contexts while deliberately
   ignoring differences among its various specific manifestations. The
   outcome of such transcultural, transsituational, and transhistorical
   (that is, transcontextual) mode of inquiry is an empirically grounded
   "social geometry."</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In this article, Jean-Paul Sartre's relationship to the negritude
   movement and black intellectuals in Paris between the 1940s and the
   1960s is examined in sociological and historical context. Sartre's
   version of negritude, developed in his 1948 treatise "Orphee noir"
   prefacing Leopold Senghor's collection of African and Malagasy poetry,
   is analyzed in terms of its role in shaping the discourses and debates
   surrounding negritude and the relationship of black intellectuals to the
   rest of French society. Sartre's phenomenological theories of race,
   juxtaposing dominant and subaltern ideologies, are contrasted with his
   dialectic of negritude. The antinegritude movement of the late 1960s is
   also considered with reference to Sartre's theories and inspiration.
   During this period, the relationship that Sartre established with
   Martinican intellectual and revolutionary Frantz Fanon helped to place
   Sartre into prominence as an activist and a theorist of decolonization
   and Third World politics. Sartre's theories of race, self, and society
   were integral to both his early and later works and warrant review as
   approaches to the sociology of culture and sources of reflection for
   contemporary postcolonial studies.</td>

   upper-level sociology course in Policy and Social Change. The project,
   Breaking Ground, had two main goals: to change students' perceptions
   about persons who are homeless and to increase students' sense of
   efficacy for engaging in social advocacy. Through Breaking Ground,
   students formed a partnership with advocates and homeless clients to
   raise public awareness about homelessness and to organize advocacy and
   fund-raising events for the agency partner. The research element of the
   project used pre-tests and post-tests to assess changes in students'
   beliefs about social justice, self-efficacy, and perceptions of
   homelessness. When compared to students who took the class, but did not
   participate in the described service-learning project, Breaking Ground
   students experienced significant changes in a positive direction in
   their perceptions of individuals who are homeless. There were also some
   small changes in student feelings of self-efficacy and opinions on
   social justice. I explain these results and provide suggestions for
   implementation of similar projects.</td>

   particularly prone to think in anti-cultural terms. External, objective,
   and material forces are conceived as determining unequal distributions
   without reference to the wills of actors via hegemony, domination,
   subordination. But if inequality is imposed by material and coercive
   force, then it can be remedied only by accumulating power and
   counterforce, and by exercising them in an instrumental and potentially
   coercive way. What is missing from this account is meaning, the
   recognition of its relative autonomy. The imposition of inequality, and
   struggles over justice, inclusion, and distribution, are mediated by
   cultural structures. Inequalities are nested inside the discourse of
   civil society, and so are demands for equality. Vis-a-vis the binary
   codes of civil society, protest movements pollute hegemonic forces and
   purify subordinate groups in its name.</td>

   historical research in cultural sociology, using Nietzsche's definition
   of genealogy. The point is to resuscitate a method that has often been
   rejected by sociologists, and demonstrate its value for analyzing forms
   of culture that have become tacit or unarticulated over time. To make
   the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the
   use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi
   in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques
   derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not
   considered classical. Ironically, the Canal du Midi was promoted in
   propaganda campaigns, defining France as the New Rome, but the peasant
   women who actually carried Roman culture in their eyes and hands were
   not socially elevated enough to be New Romans, so they were written out
   of this story.</td>

   sociology. The paper takes up Michael Burawoy's call for public
   sociology and discusses what rural sociologists have to offer to publics
   and how we stand to gain as a discipline in working with publics. The
   paper argues that rural sociologists' ability to adopt a cosmopolitan
   view while negotiating the complexities of global/local processes
   provides a useful theoretical stance for doing public sociology.
   Methodologically, both feminist methods and various approaches to
   networks can guide us as we do public sociology. Then, the paper
   provides two examples of recent efforts to do public sociology with a
   women's community group in Sri Lanka in response to the tsunami and with
   the Pennsylvania Women's Agricultural Network to illustrate the
   possibilities and limitations of working with networks. In conclusion,
   the paper addresses opportunities for doing public sociology, the
   challenges we face as we go public, and future work that is needed to
   develop theoretically and methodologically strong public rural
   sociology.</td>

   punitive attitudes in the United States. Prior research suggests that
   the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas
   influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest
   on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as
   threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the
   concept of "perceived threat" and examining the association between
   aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive sentiments.
   Analysis of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong
   predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in
   areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a
   recent increase in the size of the African American population are more
   punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to material resources for white
   respondents. The results agree with racial threat perspectives on social
   control, but we go beyond extant research by unpacking the micro-level
   processes that are central to the threat hypothesis.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The purpose of this paper is to identify and explain a rather large
   impediment to the use of mixed method research designs that begin with
   survey data. Although supplementing quantitative survey analyses with
   insights derived from qualitative work is increasingly popular, there is
   also heightened concern about ethical issues in research, particularly
   the confidentiality of human research subjects. Surprisingly, there has
   been little discussion about how these two trends intersect, and the
   extent to which they are compatible. In this paper I argue that because
   of the important obligation to protect human research subjects'
   identities (and, to a lesser extent, the proliferation of publicly
   available datasets), few researchers are actually in a position to
   implement this type of mixed methodology. Despite their noted advantages
   over mono-method designs, mixed method designs that start with
   quantitative data and subsequently supplement it with qualitative
   insights may not achieve the dominance that many have supposed and
   desired. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

   the ability to distinguish between private troubles and public issues
   and the competency to use such distinctions to facilitate and engage in
   social change. This article is a case study of low-income rural Whites'
   personal interpretations of health and income inequalities with a
   concern for understanding the potential effectiveness of a community
   action program (CAP) designed to enhance their critical literacy.
   Findings reveal that low-income rural Whites predominantly use
   ideologies of individualism to interpret the inequalities experienced by
   others, they employ a pseudostructural level analysis tempered by
   individualism to interpret their experience of health and income
   inequalities, and they respond collectively along racial and national
   lines when considering overall inequalities. Based on these findings, I
   provide suggestions on how CAPs can more effectively elevate the
   critical literacy of low-income rural Whites.</td>

   femininity that allows for multiple configurations within each, and that
   can be used empirically across settings and groups. The author also

   rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is
   explained by a model of path-dependent memory work that is sensitive to
   how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of
   historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct
   reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of
   different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational
   trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic
   possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing
   contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the
   opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories
   condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the
   collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics
   literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take
   seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.</td>

   ideas into American sociology. We find that rather than being received
   as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate
   new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used
   their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu's
   sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program
   in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for
   presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of
   articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far
   from a recent fad, Bourdieu's ideas steadily diffused into American
   sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books
   in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu's key concepts
   (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four
   core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).</td>

   theory. The niche represents the position or function of an entity, such
   as an organization or population of organizations, within a larger
   community environment. Using the concept of the niche allows researchers
   to go beyond classifying entities to understanding (a) their life
   chances under different and changing environmental conditions and (b)
   how they interact under the competitive conditions induced by a finite
   environment. We briefly review the intellectual history of the niche
   concept as it came from bioecology to sociology. The bulk of the article
   reviews the two major streams of sociological research that use the
   niche concept: the population ecology of organizations and McPherson's
   ecology of affiliation. Finally, we survey commonalities between these
   approaches and highlight new directions, including applications that
   take the niche concept well beyond its origins in organizational
   studies.</td>

   processes, interpersonal behavior, crowd behavior, organizational
   behavior, social relationships, and the behavior of political systems.
   Control system models help us to understand how actors enact social
   roles with enough stability to preserve institutional arrangements,
   while still demonstrating remarkable creativity in unusual
   circumstances. These theories take us away from an oversocialized view
   of the actor, without relegating us to exclusive reliance on grounded
   theory. They provide a foundation for several generative theories of
   adaptive, goal-seeking behavior on the part of social actors and
   institutions. This chapter begins by tracing the history of control
   theorizing in sociology, then-describes several contemporary theoties
   that rely on control imagery, reviews the empirical support for these
   theories, describes some of their significant points of overlap and
   departure, and examines some of the key tested-and untested-implications
   of a control system approach in sociology.</td>

   of the major cornerstones of sociology. Since the publication of Bellah
   and company's Habits of the Heart ( 1996), more attention has been
   directed toward moral sociology while Putnam's Bowling Alone ( 2000) has
   stimulated discussions about social networks and social capital. This
   article meshes these areas while adding spiritual capital to the mix.
   This study draws heavily upon the classical work of W. E. B. Du Bois (
   Du Bois and Dill 1914) on morals, manners, and social uplift, the more
   contemporary work of Stark ( 2004) and Greeley ( 1989) on the perception
   of the supernatural and social behavior as well as Brewer's ( 1979) and
   Koenig's ( 1997, 2002, 2005) work on spiritual well-being and everyday

   produced a series of secondary traumas that continue to thwart recovery

   has gone too far and that we are now in a putative postidentity moment.
   Within the academy this argument has been articulated from two divergent
   positions. The first derides identity politics as a move away from
   materialist concerns. The second, more conservative, position argues
   that identity politics is at fault for being over-political, for reading
   politics into every aspect of knowledge production. I argue that
   identity is in fact a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition
   for any effective oppositional politics. I further suggest that these
   arguments are themselves evidence of the articulation of (white, male,
   and heterosexual) institutional power within the academic field of
   (sport) sociology. As an alternative, I argue for the renewal of a
   critical public sport sociology that draws upon and extends the cultural
   studies tradition of committed and engaged scholarship.</td>

   area of interest and scholarship while enthusiastically working with and
   drawing upon the work of others within and outside sociology, (2)
   broadening the content of SoTL investigations to address teaching and
   learning from additional perspectives, and (3) utilizing an increasingly

   teachers and universities, improving curriculum, and enhancing teacher
   training. I propose that this list be expanded to include setting
   curricular standards. Current trends in educational reform center on
   standards-based education, and although many social science disciplines
   have adapted to this trend, sociology's focus on standards is limited to
   undergraduate education. I analyze the existing state sociology
   standards by measuring them against the American Sociological
   Association's (ASA) Advanced Placement Sociology course, the National
   Council for Social Studies standards, and the sample learning goals from
   Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major Updated (McKinney et al. 2005).
   The results indicate that there are some substantial differences in the
   learning goals set forth by the ASA and those set forth by the states. I
   suggest that since the academic sociological community is in an ideal
   position to address high school social studies content in a variety of
   disciplines, we should expand our efforts in this area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Decades of research have documented the positive impacts of cooperative
   learning on student success: increased learning, retention through
   graduation, improved critical thinking, and intrinsic motivation. One
   cooperative teaching technique, however, has received relatively little
   attention. In the two-stage cooperative, group, or "pyramid" exam
   students first take an exam individually-as in traditional testing-and
   then take the same exam together with their learning group, with the
   exam grade being a weighted combination of their individual and group
   scores. This approach uses the exam itself not only for evaluation, but
   also as a learning tool. Although some researchers have studied group
   exams, they have not isolated the impact of group tests from individual
   achievernent-an important omission. Using data from a mass lecture
   introductory sociology course, I found that holding individual
   achievement constant the group exam process significantly increased
   learning both for students who knew the material initially and for those
   who did not. This suggests that cooperative exams not only enhance
   learning but also allow for the process and form of testing to become
   more closely linked to the process and form of teaching and learning.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Routes to economic development attract considerable attention in
   community and rural sociology. Social scientists draw increasingly on
   studies of social capital and environmental surroundings as they examine
   the factors that facilitate and inhibit economic development. However,
   few empirical analyses exist that analyze the impact of the combination
   of social infrastructure and natural capital on different forms of
   economic development such as on industrial recruitment and
   self-development. Using data collected from six communities in
   Washington State, the interaction of a community's social infrastructure
   and natural capital on industrial recruitment and self-development
   efforts is examined. Results suggest that while natural capital
   positively impacts a community's successful recruitment of outside
   industries, it is not significant for a community's level of
   self-development. However, a community's social infrastructure, measured
   by the existence of active civic organizations, local businesses that
   support local community projects, community-wide fund-raising capacity,
   and extra-local linkages to nearby communities, state, and national
   agencies, positively affects both industrial recruitment and
   self-development. These findings illustrate the need for communities and
   local activists to carefully weigh their advantages and potential
   shortcomings when deciding on an economic development strategy.</td>

   range of dimensions including affect, happiness and satisfaction. It
   largely avoids a concern with the meanings that provide people with the
   purpose, significance, validity and coherence that are a basis of social
   relationships and social integration. Evidence is presented that people
   experience lowered affect in some challenging and stressful situations
   that simultaneously generate meanings that enhance the quality of their
   lives, and that experiences of high affect along with impoverished
   meanings produce low quality of life. This strongly suggests that
   meaning may be a more fundamental dimension of life quality than is
   affect. Meanings may also enhance the quality of life by motivating
   people's involvement in activities that promote social integration and
   the quality of social relationships. Sociologists should work to further
   develop the theoretical and empirical basis of quality of life so that
   it more fully includes dimensions that reflect the meanings that provide

   the study of citizenship and political incorporation. I consider three
   existing models of citizenship: an approach that considers citizenship
   adoption as the product of cost/benefit calculations; an approach that
   understands individuals and groups to be differentially endowed with the
   skills, resources and interests necessary to acquire citizenship; and an
   approach that believes countries adopt citizenship regimes which either
   include or shut out immigrants. I then offer an alternative model of
   structured mobilization which views political incorporation as a social
   process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and
   local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by
   government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement. The material
   and symbolic resources provided by government shape the ability and
   interest of "social helpers" to assist with and mobilize around
   citizenship. The article concludes by considering the implications of
   structured mobilization for various debates in immigration and political
   sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Each workplace operates within a cultural context in which local
   features of interaction influence how employees conceptualize their
   workplace self. Building on small-group research, I argue that
   understanding these idiocultures as action arenas helps to specify how
   group knowledge, practices, and beliefs are expressed and affect
   occupational identity. To demonstrate the power of microcultures, I
   analyzed local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) through
   ethnographic methods. I focused on the Chicago office, demonstrating how
   its culture, which emphasizes autonomy and resistance to authority,
   shapes the staff's images of scientific practice and the contours of
   being a scientist. The culture is revealed in their joking relations as
   well as in other office traditions. I then compared this culture with
   that of Flowerland, a spin-up office established in the 1990s. These two
   offices use their cultures to differentiate themselves, creating
   distinct work practices. As all work groups have local cultures, giving
   greater attention to small-group dynamics helps us understand how
   workers define themselves, how cultures differ, and how the effects of
   these differences shape the experience of work.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article examines historical transformations of Japanese collective
   memory of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by utilizing a theoretical
   framework that combines a model of reiterated problem solving and a
   theory of cultural trauma. I illustrate how the event of the nuclear
   fallout in March 1954 allowed actors to consolidate previously
   fragmented commemorative practices into a master frame to define the
   postwar Japanese identity in terms of transnational commemoration of
   "Hiroshima." I also show that nationalization of trauma of "Hiroshima"
   involved a shift from pity to sympathy in structures of feeling about
   the event. This historical study suggests that a reiterated
   problem-solving approach can be efficacious in analyzing how
   construction of national memory of a traumatic event connects with the
   recurrent reworking of national identity, on the one hand, and how a
   theory of cultural trauma can be helpful in exploring a synthesis of
   psychological and sociological approaches to commemoration of a
   traumatic event, on the other.</td>

   has altered the conditions of interpersonal contact, as well as the
   realms of the lifeworld in which we live. Specifically, the Internet has
   created a new spatiotemporal zone-the zone of the "there and now," a new
   mode of communication-the electronic text chat, and a new social
   gathering place-the online public domain. These creations have in turn
   contributed to the rise of the realm of "consociated contemporaries,"
   the formation of a new matrix of social contact, the maintenance of the
   subjective reality through text chat, and the involvement of the online
   world in the socialization process. In light of such changes, I join
   those who call for a revision of the existing sociological stance on
   human interaction.</td>

   is no longer a productive specialty in sociology. I attribute the cause
   of the demise of the field to its over reliance on the assumption of
   cultural relativity. In contrast to the relativist position, I argue
   that behavior that causes harm will be more likely to be condemned by
   public opinion and that there will be less variation in attitudes toward
   behaviors that cause more harm. Using data from the General Social
   Survey, I find support for the hypothesis that a "deviant" sexual
   behavior that can have a victim, extramarital sex, will be more
   consensually condemned than "deviant" sexual behaviors that do not have
   victims, premarital sex and homosexual sex. I recommend that future
   research focus on the study of values, as the validity of cultural
   relativity can be empirically evaluated.</td>

   collective memory while other events did not. It does so through a
   comparative-historical analysis of Stonewall and four events similar to
   it that occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the
   1960s. The Stonewall riots were remembered because they were the first
   to meet two conditions: activists considered the event commemorable and
   had the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle. That this
   conjuncture occurred in New York in 1969, and not earlier or elsewhere,
   was a result of complex political developments that converged in this
   time and place. The success of the national commemorative ritual planned
   by New York activists depended on its resonance, not only in New York
   but also in other US. cities. Gay community members found Stonewall
   commemorable and the proposed parade an appealing form for
   commemoration. The parade was amenable to institutionalization, leading
   it to survive over time and spread around the world. The Stonewall story
   is thus an achievement of gay liberation rather than an account of its
   origins.</td>

   The analysis shows that analogy was the instigator of it all, enabled by
   the social mechanisms of professional legitimacy, conversation,
   technologies, time, networks, and social support. It demonstrates the
   work sociologists do when theory travels from professional sociology to
   nonacademic audiences and what happens to the theory and the sociologist
   in the process. It reveals the tensions when professional sociology,
   critical sociology, public sociology, and policy sociology are joined. A
   study of sociology in the field, it shows how sociologists negotiate the
   meaning of their work in a nonacademic situation. Thus, this account
   contributes to research and theory on social boundaries, the diffusion
   of ideas, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and current debates
   about public sociology and the role of the sociologist, adding to the
   sociology of our own work.</td>

   political impact of military preparedness. It instead suggests that
   military personnel policies impact social welfare efforts to the degree
   that they alter citizens' relationships to labor markets, directly
   provide social welfare benefits to military personnel, or create
   discursive obstacles to other groups seeking benefits. The results
   indicate that net of military spending, nations with relatively large
   armed forces make smaller social welfare efforts, while nations with

   in the life conditions of animals, conceptual and empirical development
   of the topic is limited. This paper seeks to further develop the
   sociological research on attitudes toward animal well-being. We build on
   insights from contemporary stratification theory to explain the nature
   of animal attitudes and their determinants. We also extend past work by
   examining a broader range of factors related to attitudes about animal
   wellbeing, focusing on place, other social structural factors, and
   individuals' unique animal-related experiences. Data are from a survey
   of over 4,000 Ohio residents conducted in 2002. We find that childhood
   experience has the greatest place-based effect on attitudes. Other
   findings highlight the importance of social structural factors,
   suggesting support for the "underdog hypothesis." Women, people
   experiencing economic hardship, those with less education, younger and
   middle aged people, and blacks tend to be more concerned with animal
   well-being. Individualized, experiential variables are also important.
   Our results reflect the complexity of attitudes about animals and point
   to the need for greater sociological attention to factors left largely
   unexplored in previous studies, including childhood place-based factors,
   economic hardship, and individuals' unique animal-related experiences.</td>

   "Notification" is defined as information transmission motivated by role

   transmission. These rules produce patterns of information dissemination
   different from what individual volition would yield and from what
   technology makes possible. The capacity to wield a socially sanctioned
   repertoire of notification rules is a learned competence. Competent
   notifiers must also understand the local epistemological ecology-the
   distribution and trajectory of information, as well as the projects,
   concerns, and priorities of one's fellows. This study of notification
   introduces the broader concept of "the information order" and is a first
   step in the project of a sociology of information.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study contributes to the sociological study of suicide via an
   exploration of the implications and application of literary texts in
   sociological analysis. The examination of two pairs of literary texts
   suggests that some cases of suicide can be self-affirming. When the
   characters find themselves in circumstances that threaten their
   perception of who they are in their social contexts, they may choose the
   possibility of death over life with a change in self-concept. The
   interpretation of the four selected narrative cases of self-affirmative
   suicide is nestled in complexities of self-identity: two from The Iliad
   by Homer, and one each from Andorra and I'm Not Stiller by Max Frisch.
   Relating the findings to Turner's theory of impulsive versus
   institutional loci of real self, the article argues that institutionally
   constituted characters are more likely than impulsive-selves to find
   self-killing an acceptable resolution to their crises of identity. The
   findings are discussed in relation to classic theory in the sociology of
   suicide, concepts of the real self, and the use of literature in social
   science research.</td>

   emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on
   ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant
   causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in
   practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis
   routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the

   hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of
   these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated
   provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view
   this model as a panacea for providing food to a modem industrial
   workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this
   system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial
   model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural
   community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in
   this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses
   toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in
   a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one
   such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize
   agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security,
   literacy, safety, and rebuilding rural communities. In this paper, I
   detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the
   development of community-based learning in the form of global and local
   public learning communities, service-learning advocacy, and
   international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of
   agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of
   sustainability, I developed a partnership with a Hungarian class which
   allowed students to compare and contrast approaches to sustainable
   development and probe the role of history and culture as causal forces
   in these endeavors. I describe my efforts to develop this partnership
   and weave opportunities for service-learning advocacy into the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although many of us would like to get beyond lecturing, we often lack
   concrete strategies for doing so, particularly in our larger classes.
   This paper suggests one such strategy for creating a discussion-based
   course. The success of such a course is predicated on students reading
   and thinking about the course material (receiving "first exposure")
   prior to attending class so that class time can be devoted to more
   substantively engaging activities grounded in guided discussion. The
   vehicle I propose for achieving this first exposure to the course
   material is the "Course Preparation Assignment" (CPA). This article
   explains the rationale for discussion-based courses, describes the
   development and use of CPAs, and assesses a discussion-based course by
   comparing it to a traditional lecture course on several outcomes. The
   assessment reveals that the use of these assignments to create a

   However, researchers know much less about how collaborative learning
   groups may influence student behavior and the extent to which their
   utility extends to testing as well as projects and papers. In an effort
   to address these gaps, we used quasi-experimental and survey data to
   examine the effects of collaborative testing on Introduction to
   Sociology students' learning, behavior and attitudes. Findings indicate
   that collaborative testing improved students' behavior and attitudes. In
   comparison to a control group, students who participated in
   collaborative testing reported completing more of their assigned
   readings and had improved attitudes toward their learning, the testing
   process, and sociology.</td>

   retained months later. Finally I discuss the study's limitations and the

   in other countries? One tradition in sociology suggests American
   "exceptionalism," while another argues for convergence across nations in
   social norms, such as attitudes toward inequality. This article uses
   International Social Survey Program (ISSP) microdata to compare
   attitudes in different countries toward what individuals in specific
   occupations "do earn " and what they "should earn," and to distinguish
   value preferences for more egalitarian outcomes from other confounding
   attitudes and perceptions. The authors suggest a method for summarizing
   individual preferences for the leveling of earnings and use kernel
   density estimates to describe and compare the distribution of individual
   preferences over time and cross-nationally. They find that subjective
   estimates of inequality in pay diverge substantially from actual data,
   and that although Americans do not, on the average, have different
   preferences for aggregate (in)equality, there is evidence for:1. Less
   awareness concerning the extent of inequality at the top of the income
   distribution in America2. More polarization in attitudes among
   Americans3. Similar preferences for "leveling down" at the top of the
   earnings distribution in the United States, but also4. Less concern for
   reducing differentials at the bottom of the distribution.</td>

   of the question of human agency - specifically, the nature of workers'
   responses to the advent of the new forms of work organization. Drawing
   on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the
   author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and
   effects of workers' responses to the changes they confront in their work
   situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on
   structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the
   fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing
   a fourfold typology of workers' responses, the author shows how each
   type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These
   findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a
   relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and
   practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the
   restructuring of their jobs.</td>

   knowledge on the cultural and symbolic processes that enable, constrain,
   and transform social movements. Merging insights from social movement
   theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the
   author argues that law is a type of " master frame," and that mobilizing
   law's " constitutive" symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely
   overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity,
   and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing
   processes through historical-narrative analysis of the women's movement
   and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical
   evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women's
   movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a
   symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of
   gender ("protective" vs. "equal" treatment) and that this contest was
   waged in explicitly legal terms.</td>

   academic and public spheres, with some calling for legislation to
   prevent instructors from "indoctrinating" students. The debate over
   balance is important to sociology because the discipline is sometimes
   characterized as overtly liberal and activist; but the implications of
   balance for teaching and learning remain unclear. In this article, we
   present the results of a study in which we operationalized balance as
   students' perceptions of whether instructors discussed points of view
   other than their own and invited criticism of their ideas. Using OLS
   regression on undergraduate classes' quantitative evaluations of
   sociology instructors at Indiana University during the 2002-2003
   academic year (N = 99 classes), we asked whether classes perceived their
   sociology instructors to be balanced and whether positive perceptions
   led to better evaluations. We also asked about the relative influence of
   sociology classes' perceptions of balance compared to other influences.
   We found that most classes perceived their instructors as balanced and
   instructors who were perceived as being more balanced received better
   evaluations. However, we also found that balance was not as important as
   other factors in influencing evaluations. We discuss implications.</td>

   interaction with foreign investment across an entire epoch of rapid and
   profound economic transformation, the authors gathered data on the
   complete ownership histories of 1,696 of the largest Hungarian
   enterprises from 1987 to 2001. They develop a social sequence analysis
   to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network resources to
   buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain knowledge and
   legitimacy. During this period, networked property grew, stabilized, and
   involved a growing proportion of foreign capital. Cohesive networks of
   recombinant property were robust, and in fact integrated foreign
   investment. Although multinationals, through their subsidiaries,
   dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence
   that they also built durable networks. These findings suggest that
   developing economies do not necessarily face a forced choice between
   networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Rather than seeking ivory-tower isolation, members of the Rural
   Sociological Society have always been distinguished by a willingness to
   work with specialists from a broad range of disciplines, and to work on
   some of the world's most challenging problems. What is less commonly
   recognized is that the willingness to reach beyond disciplinary
   boundaries can contribute not just to the solution of real-world
   problems, but also to the advancement of the discipline itself. This
   point is increasingly being illustrated in studies of
   environment-society relationships. Most past discussions of humans'
   roles in environmental problems have focused on overall or average human
   impacts, but rural sociologists have played leading roles in identifying
   what I have come to call "the double diversion." First, rather than
   being well-represented by averages, environmental damages are often
   characterized by high levels of disproportionality, with much or most of
   the harm being created by the diversion of environmental rights and
   resources to a surprisingly small fraction of the relevant social
   actors. The disproportionality appears to be made possible in part
   through the second diversion, namely distraction the diversion of
   attention, largely through the taken-for-granted but generally erroneous
   assumption that the environmental harm "must" be for the benefit Of us
   all. There are good reasons why rural sociologists would have been among
   the first to notice both of these "diversions"-and why they will give
   even greater attention to both in the future.</td>

   sociological knowledge is generated by encounters with changing research
   opportunities, here called targets of opportunity. In my case, a study
   of rural communities led to unanticipated conclusions concerning
   buffering mechanisms that protected authorities by absorbing
   dissatisfactions and rebellions. Wartime research in a military setting
   identified sources of group solidarity and effective performance under
   stress. Major societal changes in racial/ethnic relations provided
   opportunities to develop new concepts and empirical findings. Synoptic
   studies of post-World War II American society led to extensive research
   on values and institutions. These macrosociological analyses of
   ethnicity and social systems, in turn, led me to a new sociology of war
   and interstate relations. I also offer here some critical reflections on
   recurrent issues and chronic controversies in American sociology. Final
   sections of the review deal with the continuing search for conceptual
   clarity and cumulative knowledge. I note the obstacles of disciplinary
   fragmentation, but my closing judgment is that sociology now has the
   base of substantial scientific knowledge and methodological expertise
   necessary for investigating crucial twenty-first century problems.</td>

   what demographers call forced migration and mortality and what legal
   sociologists and criminologists understand as war crimes. The challenge
   is to develop a critically informed sociological synthesis that joins
   our understanding of the frequently politicized health and violence
   dimensions of what are also diplomatically called "complex" humanitarian
   emergencies. The frequency of these emergencies is growing, and there is
   an increasing amount of data collected by governmental and
   nongovernmental organizations exposing large-scale violations of human
   rights and war crimes. Yet analyses of these data are often inadequate.
   Although the humanitarian emergency in Kosovo marked a high point in
   collaborative human rights research, the circumstances that allowed this
   collaboration are probably atypical. We consider how, in increasingly
   challenging circumstances such as the Darfur region of Sudan, population
   health and legal and criminological surveys can be joined to provide
   more comprehensive estimates of deaths resulting from violent attacks as
   well as from disease and starvation. The discipline of sociology, with
   its expertise in population-based surveys and other measurement and
   analytic techniques, has the capacity to bridge differences and to
   provide more meaningfully synthesized conclusions.</td>

   prostitution in the late 1800s. Why did reformers succeed in their goal
   of abolishing the state regulation of prostitution earlier in some
   countries compared to others? A qualitative comparative-historical
   approach is used to outline local social movement dynamics and
   consequent paths to abolition in a subset of European countries (i.e.
   the Netherlands, France and Germany), as influenced by two international
   voluntary associations. The findings show that contestation between the
   associations - one more transnational than the other in practice -
   hampered abolitionist successes. International voluntary associations'
   organization, alliances and cultural framings, as they operated in local
   settings, affected the form of local movements as well as their
   outcomes. Rather than challenging state interests, international
   associations sometimes help to reinforce them.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper examines the articulation of goals and means of sociological
   instruction in course syllabi. Three questions guide this inquiry.
   First, do sociology instructors articulate common learning goals? Second
   what pedagogical means do instructors commonly employ to meet these
   goals? Third to what extent have sociology instructors incorporated the
   recommendations presented in Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major
   (Eberts et al. 1990) and in its updated version (McKinney et al. 2004)?
   To answer these questions, we analyzed syllabi from 418 courses
   published by the American Sociological Association's Teaching Resource
   Center. We found that aside from course-specific goals, most syllabi
   shared only a few general, abstract goals in common. The pedagogical
   methods or requirements of students tended to be fairly traditional
   (readings, writing, and exams). Requirements that required more active
   types of learning were less common. While these goals and means do seem
   to reflect what sociologists consider to be important, they do not
   correspond closely to the American Sociological Associations Taskforce
   on the Undergraduate Major's recommendations for the sociology major.</td>

   neoliberal, market-oriented reform in their infrastructure industries?
   Building on world-society and neo-institutional theories in sociology,
   this paper argues that international pressures of coercion, normative
   emulation, and competitive mimicry strongly influence the domestic
   adoption of market-oriented reform. The paper considers the effect of
   such pressures on the adoption of four reform elements: the
   privatization of state-owned firms, the formal separation of the
   regulatory authority from the executive branch, the de facto elimination
   of executive political influence on the regulatory authority, and the
   opening of the retail market to multiple service providers. It finds
   generally robust support for its arguments using a multivariate probit
   analysis of reform adoption in the telecommunications and electricity
   industries of as many as 71 countries and territories between 1977 and
   1999. The results also suggest that the coercive effect of lending by
   the IMF and World Bank differs for each reform element. The paper
   discusses the possibility that, by leading countries to adopt some
   reform elements but not others, international coercion may not produce
   ideal outcomes.</td>

   have focused on the role of technical instruments in laboratory
   practices, this article asks, "What role do technical instruments play
   in the humanities?" Editions of La Comedie humaine, written by Honore de
   Balzac, are taken as a case study. Primarily based on ethnographic
   research with Balzac scholars, this article traces the evolution of
   Balzac text from a unified and unadorned text in the 1930s, to a single
   annotated text in the critical edition of the 1970s, and to a searchable
   electronic format of different versions. The author shows that the
   different schools of interpretation in Balzac criticism (traditional,
   semioticians, socio-critics) constructed these diverse editing
   technologies to influence the evolution of literary theories. For
   instance, traditional scholars' theory of authorship entertains en
   elective affinity with the critical edition of La Comedie humaine.
   Socio-critics challenged its assumptions and constructed electronic
   editions to develop their own theories, particularly on the genesis and
   reception of Balzac texts. By focusing on the epistemic cultures in
   which research practices are embedded, this case study complements
   purely institutionalist perspectives on knowledge-production in the
   academic field and highlights the presence of diverse epistemic cultures
   in literary criticism.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Change in art is all understudied topic in sociological research. This
   article examines protest artworks (arpilleras) produced by shantytown
   women during and shortly after the dictatorship in Chile, to explore the
   question Why political art that is for sale changes over time. This
   research is based oil 136 semi-structured and in-depth interviews with
   various members of the art world in Chile, Europe, and the United
   States, a year's worth of participant observation of art groups in
   Santiago and over five hundred photographs of arpilleras, taken by the
   author and analyzed thematically. Political art that is for sale call
   change because the intermediary (the organization connecting producers
   and buyers) becomes less or more politically conservative, develops a
   precarious financial situation, grows more afraid of repression, and has
   the power to enforce the changes it desires; because the original
   buyer,,; are replaced with new buyers with different motivations; and
   because new artists with new ideas begin making the art, one artist in
   the group produces something different and the idea spreads, artists
   censor themselves, and artists have new experiences or learn about new
   events. Through these sources of change, international social movements,
   local and international political and economic developments, and global
   institutions impact the art. Meanings attached to the art by the
   different parties (intermediaries, buyers, and artists) and class
   differences between artists and intermediaries are also important in
   facilitating change. These findings, based as they are oil political art
   made in a repressive context, not only contribute to our understanding
   of artistic evolution bill they help correct the bias in the sociology
   of art toward "art" made in democratic countries of the "First World."
   They are not just applicable to authoritarian regimes but also to art by
   politicized minority groups in democratic contexts, and to other
   cultural products such as newspapers, magazines, documentaries, and
   books.</td>

   established findings in the sociology of religion, relatively little is
   known about how and why they have their influence. In this study the
   author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in
   network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently
   influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter
   and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, "structural
   availability" works not only by freeing an actor from
   conformity-inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative
   absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates
   individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location
   strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life
   problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number
   of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations.</td>

   Bois and Albion Small as important cornerstones of the U.S. sociological
   tradition. While the work of the "Chicago School" is well known in
   sociological circles, Do Bois' sociological legacy is not. The
   Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996) is a classic empirical sociological
   study that is rarely included in discussions of the development of
   scientific sociology. Likewise, The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003)
   represents one of the first empirically based sociological studies of a
   religious institution. Sociologists of religion routinely discuss the
   contributions of Durkheim, Weber, and Simmel while virtually ignoring Du
   Bois. This is ironic because Du Bois' work on religion was based on
   ethnographic data, field inter-views, surveys, and census data. This
   article provides an overview of Do Bois' sociological study of the Black
   Church in the United States by identifying some of the main themes
   developed in The Philadelphia Negro ([1899] 1996), The Souls of Black
   Folk ([1903a] 1994), and The Negro Church ([1903b] 2003). These studies
   reveal that Du Bois was a pioneer in the areas of evaluation research,
   public sociology, service learning, and congregational studies.</td>

   however, QCA is a temporal and obscures the sequential nature of paths
   of causation. QCA ignores the order of events by treating combinations
   of attributes as though they occur simultaneously rather than as
   unfolding over time. While preserving the essential strengths of QCA,
   the authors present a modification that is capable of capturing the

   dire need for research on the characteristics and experiences of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As the global economy becomes more integrated, incorporating
   international experiences into college curricula becomes increasingly
   desirable for American students and their counterparts abroad. This
   paper describes one model for creating an international, Web-based,
   distance-learning classroom that can be used as a guide for those who
   might wish to pursue similar endeavors. Our replicated experiences
   teaching a sociology course on social control, twice under slightly
   different conditions, provide the basis for identifying the conditions
   and practices that optimize the goals of providing a forum for
   international education and enhancing reading and writing skills. A
   content analysis of the online Student-Led Discussions provides evidence
   that cross-national knowledge and understanding can be enhanced in this
   learning environment. Enrolling students from the United States,
   Belarus, Russia, and Australia, our course demonstrates how instructors
   can create a successful virtual classroom that truly encircles the
   globe.</td>

   Contagion processes and the suitability of significance testing given a

   testing, whereas institutional factors such as department prestige and
   particular editorships help explain growing popularity of the. 05 alpha

   privilege that deserve greater attention. The first involves
   disproportionality, or the privileged diversion of rights/resources:
   Contrary to common assumptions, much environmental damage is not
   economically "necessary" - instead, it represents privileged access to
   the environment. It is made possible in part by the second diversion -
   the diversion of attention, or distraction - largely through
   taken-for-granted or privileged accounts, which are rarely questioned,
   even in leftist critiques. Data show that, rather than producing
   advanced materials, major polluters tend to be inefficient producers of
   low-value commodities, and rather than being major employers, they can
   have emissions-to-jobs ratios a thousand times worse than the economy as
   a whole. Instead of simply focusing on overall/average levels of
   environmental problems, sociologists also need to examine
   disproportionalities, analyzing the socially structured nature Of
   environmental and discursive privileges. Doing so can offer important
   opportunities for insights, not just about nature, but also about the
   nature of power, and about the power of the naturalized.</td>

   in-person observation of the police. However, little research has
   examined how the observers can potentially bias observational data. In
   this paper, anecdotal accounts from a variety of field settings are
   categorized into four potential sources of observer bias. Secondary
   analyses of data from a large-scale observational study of police are
   used to assess the impact of three out of the four type of observer bias
   (reactivity, going native, and burnout). There is evidence of reactivity
   for arrest, but not use of force behavior and little support for going
   native and burnout. More generally, observer bias is categorized as: (1)
   threats to the validity of observational data collected at different
   stages of fieldwork; and (2) the potential for human error implicit in
   observational data. The incorporation of a semi-structured field diary
   is suggested to more systematically document all four types of observer
   bias in future research. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.</td>

   existing literature in the sociology of sport, sociology of the body,
   and interactionism to inform my analysis. With this approach, I
   illustrate the complicated relationship women athletes have with their
   bodies in relation to physical competition and dominant notions of
   femininity today. Key reference groups influenced the players'
   self-perceptions and encouraged the women to closely monitor their own
   appearances and actions. While undoubtedly affected by these
   interactions as well as their place in the gender hierarchy, many women
   athletes subtly resisted notions of idealized bodies and constructed
   their own meanings about their bodies and experiences. Investigating the
   day-to-day body awareness and negotiations of women athletes reveals the
   gendered nuances of sport and the complicated relationship between
   cultural ideals and female embodiment.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is an inquiry into how a new truth about sleepiness is being
   produced in a society increasingly organized around the primacy of
   expertise and its representation in print and visual media. Sleepiness
   originally described a benign, naturally occurring corporeal moment, a
   precursor to sleep. Increasingly, however, a new and disturbing meaning
   of somnolence is found in a juncture of medical and epidemiological
   research, social movements, and popular culture. Alongside the idea that
   sleepiness is a tranquil promise of repose is another, emerging truth.
   Sleepiness, we are told, is hazardous to self and others, and,
   importantly, it is each person's responsibility to resist this seductive
   call of the body. How, we ask, is a private, routinely occurring state
   of partial consciousness deprivatized, linked to public health
   vernaculars, and transformed into a reprobate condition? This
   alternative, disturbing truth about sleepiness is shown to be emerging
   from several disparate, seemingly unrelated caches of scientific
   studies, social movement literatures, magazines and newspapers, and web
   sites. The ideas of Michel Foucault, who pioneered the contemporary
   study of discourse, are shown to be particularly apropos to this
   inquiry, though not without some modification to make them more amenable
   to a contemporary society shaped increasingly by what Zygmunt Bauman
   calls "liquid modernity."</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>There has been little in-depth theoretical study in sociology of the
   motives of women and men who are childless by choice. This article
   begins to remedy this deficiency by analyzing the motives articulated by
   twenty-three childless women and men using Weber's typology of social
   action and distinction between primary and end motives. In-depth
   interview and focus group data reveal that, compared to men, women more
   often were affected by the parenting models of significant others, saw
   parenting as conflicting with career and leisured identities, and
   claimed the lack of a "maternal instinct" or disinterest in children as
   dominant influences. Men more explicitly than women rejected parenthood
   because of its perceived sacrifices, including financial expense. Both
   women and men were motivated by personality traits that they deemed
   incongruent with good parenting. Declared motives especially
   demonstrated instrumentally rational action in Weber's schema, although
   affectual and value-rational actions also were present. Respondent
   motives are compared to those that they, and empirical studies, have
   attributed to parents.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>While the scholarship of teaching has risen in prominence in the past
   few decades, little is presently known about the structure of knowledge
   creation and dissemination in that area of scholarship. Such basic facts
   as the characteristics of programs that perform and publish the research
   (e.g., B.A., M.A., or Ph.D.), or the identities of specific schools that
   are leaders in teaching scholarship remain undocumented. This article
   explores the topic through counts of articles and notes published in a
   major outlet in the scholarship of teaching, Teaching Sociology, during
   the decade of the 1990s. We address the following: (1) Does publication
   of teaching scholarship vary by the type of degree program (e.g., B.A.,
   M.A., and Ph.D.) or by other characteristics? (2) Are some institutions
   centers of teaching scholarship? (3) How wide is the scope of teaching
   scholarship across the nation's departments? Overall, we find that a
   variety of sociology departments have established records of teaching
   publishing. Yet, some departments are leaders and appear to create a
   climate favorable to teaching scholarship.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I use a quasi-experiment and follow-up questionnaire to ascertain the
   effects of PowerPoint multimedia presentations and a Blackboard course
   website on the course grades and perceptions of teaching effectiveness
   of introductory sociology students. Results of t-tests showed no
   statistically significant difference in course grades between
   experimental and control groups. However, students' responses to
   standardized teaching evaluations were considerably more favorable in
   the experimental group; all measured dimensions of perceived teaching
   effectiveness yielded statistically significant increases, with
   substantial increases in perceptions of instructor rapport and grading.
   I use the ideas of George Herbert Mead to interpret the results and
   increase sociological understanding of the relationship between the
   introduction of instructional technology and student perceptions of
   teaching effectiveness. In Mead's terms, the introduction of technology
   is not merely a self-involved act performed by the instructor that
   changes the modality of course presentation but a social process
   involving both instructor and students. Within this process the
   introduction of technology is both a nonsignificant gesture, which
   elicits from students an unconscious or "instinctively" favorable
   impression of the course, and a significant symbol, which calls forth
   behavioral responses from students, conscious actions that substantially
   alter their perceptions of the course. Students not only reacted
   positively to the instructor's use of technology but through their own
   use of the technology increased their involvement in the course and came
   to perceive its teaching more favorably.</td>

   performed socially relevant science without the preconditions

   Anchored in structuration theory, this article explores the sociology of

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Contemporary sociology conceptualizes religion along two dimensions: the
   institutional and the individual. Lost in this dichotomy is religion's
   noninstitutional, but collective and public, cultural dimension. As a
   result, theories of religious modernity, including both sides of the
   secularization debate, are unable to recognize or evaluate the social
   power of noninstitutionalized religious communication. This article
   offers a reconceptualization of religion that highlights its cultural,
   communicative dimension. Original research on religious talk provides an
   empirical ground for a theoretical discussion that highlights: (1) the
   "invisible" nature of religion in modern societies, as theorized by
   Thomas Luckmann and (2) the social power attributed to communication by
   contemporary cultural sociologists and cultural theorists. I argue that
   conceptualizing religion as an evolving societal conversation about
   transcendent meaning broadens the empirical and theoretical grasp of the
   religion concept.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Ever since Maurice Halbwachs's pioneering work, most scholars have been
   content to explore collective memory through texts and commemorative
   symbolism. Assuming that a study of collective memory has fuller meaning
   when it takes into account what ordinary people think about the past, we
   compare historians' and commemorative agents' representations of Abraham
   Lincoln to what four national samples of Americans believe about him.
   Five primary images-Savior of the Union, Great Emancipator, Man of the
   People, First (Frontier) American, and Self-Made Man-are prominent in
   the cumulative body of Lincoln representations, but recent surveys show
   that only one of these images, the Great Emancipator, is dominant within
   the public. Lincoln one-dimensional Emancipator image, which differs
   from the multi-dimensional one evident in a 1945 sample, reflects new
   perceptions of the Civil War shaped by late twentieth-century minority
   rights movements. Thus, "bringing men [and women] back in" involves
   survey evidence being added to historiographic and commemoration
   analysis to clarify one of sociology most ambiguous concepts, collective
   memory, and to explore its social and generational roots.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Since Durkheim pioneering study, official suicide statistics have been
   suspected of underreporting the true suicide rate. A majority of
   researchers asserts that mistakes are minimal and not systematic while a
   minority claims that suicide statistics are systematically biased.
   Lingering uncertainties about suicide rate accuracy call into question
   the claims of scholarship and the efficacy of prevention programs. From
   the perspective of the sociology of professions, the critique of suicide
   accuracy challenges the professional authority of death investigators.
   Ethnographic observations show that medical examiners tend to
   underclassify suicides because the suicide classification requires
   positive proof of suicidal intent and because false negatives do not
   challenge the authority of medical examiners as much as false positives.
   Sufficient proof for suicide results from medical examiners' privileging
   of pathological evidence, the legal threshold to interpret evidence, and
   close relationships with law enforcement and clinicians. The same
   professional characteristics that safeguard forensic authority result in
   suicide underreporting: medical examiners protect their authority by
   determining suicide conservatively. Relatives acting to avoid the stigma
   of suicide and public health officials concerned with underreporting
   have a marginal influence on suicide determinations. This article
   contributes to the sociology of professions literature by analyzing how
   a professional group maintains authority in spite of profound criticism
   from outside parties.</td>

   When will third parties further violence, and when will they foster
   peace? These are questions addressed by Black theory of the third party.
   The authors conducted the first systematic test of the theory, drawing
   on quantitative and qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 100
   men imprisoned for assault or homicide. Specifically, they tested
   Cooney's elaboration of Black theory, which argues (1) that the social
   location of a third party, based on ties to the principals, predicts
   whether he or she will act as a partisan or settlement agent or remain
   uninvolved, and (2) that the third-party structure of a conflict, based
   on the general configuration of all the third parties present, predicts
   whether the conflict will escalate to violence. The study results
   confirm most of the theoretical predictions regarding both third-party
   behavior and violence. The discussion also extends the theoretical
   model, offering new concepts and suggesting how the theory can be
   applied to a range of subjects, such as international war and the
   long-term historical decline of interpersonal violence.</td>

   demonstrated the potential of collaborative learning strategies for
   improving student learning. This paper examines the use of
   computer-mediated communication to promote collaborative student
   learning in large introductory sociology courses. Specifically, we
   summarize a project we conducted during the 20002001 academic year in
   which we added online collaborative learning activities to the
   curriculum of two large sections of introductory sociology. Drawing on
   Novak et al.'s (1999) Just-In-Time Teaching methods, we developed online
   activities to help prepare students for subsequent in-class work and to
   cultivate a sense of group solidarity among smaller teams within the
   larger class. The results suggest that student engagement in the online
   group learning activities was strongly predictive of better student
   academic achievement on the biweekly quizzes, cumulative final exam, and
   course paper. These findings highlight the potential value of online
   group work for fostering collaborative learning environments in large
   lecture courses as well as for enhancing student learning.</td>

   to facilitate such pedagogical experiences, few concentrate on

   can we help sociology students get the most out of an experience in a

   critical pedagogical approach to travel-study abroad by presenting a
   case study of a unique three-week intensive class taught in Cusco, Peru.
   Following Kaufman's (2002) four-point model of critical pedagogy, I
   recommend that understanding, reflecting, analyzing, and engaging in
   social action can help structure the application of critical pedagogy to
   travel-study abroad in sociology. My research suggests benefits of such
   an approach, including working with a native educational institution,
   pairing sociology and Spanish students, and using home-stay families as
   informal teachers. I conclude by offering suggestions for faculty
   interested in creating a travel-study abroad course, to a developing
   nation in particular.</td>

   important shifts. First, it must modify the manner in which it engages
   in the production of new knowledge by pursuing a more balanced portfolio
   of investments in disciplinary and transdisciplinary research. Second,
   it must take a bold step to build bridges to new entities whose
   missions, goals, and values closely align with those of the Rural
   Sociological Society. And third, it must take a more proactive role in
   generating quality, scientifically sound information that is aligned
   with the needs of federal and state policy communities, particularly
   information that can better articulate how policies are likely to impact

   in understanding the development of self and the subsequent behaviors
   that emanate from and within trash talking in college athletics. Here a
   Meadian perspective is used to explain the act of trash talking at both

   historical sociology. The author grounds his approach in ongoing
   methodological debates over temporality and sequence in historical
   processes and the assumed trade-off between historical particularity and
   causal generality He promotes narratives that exploit both the
   sequential/ eventful and contextual properties of analytic time, with an
   approach that combines and builds on two emerging developments in
   narrative methodology: the use of rational choice theory and the idea of
   "increasing returns" in path-dependent historical processes. While doing
   narrative in this way will not be appropriate for analyzing all
   historical processes, it can be a useful methodological strategy for
   many of the questions, events, and outcomes that interest historical
   sociologists. The author draws oil his own research program on early
   equal employment law in the mid- to late 1960s to illustrate how this
   method can work in practice.</td>

   movies into ( 1) static flip books, where node position remains constant

   as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly

   curious that a concept that could not be more profoundly sociological
   does not have a niche in the sociological literature. This essay begins
   with the economics paradigm of agency theory, which casts a very long
   shadow over the social sciences, and then traces how these ideas diffuse
   to and are transformed (if at all) in the scholarship produced in
   business schools, political science, law, and sociology. I cut a swathe
   through the social fabric where agency relationships are especially
   prevalent and examine some of the institutions, roles, forms of social
   organization, deviance, and strategies of social control that deliver
   agency and respond to its vulnerabilities, and I consider their impact.
   Finally, I suggest how sociology might make better use of and contribute

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper focuses on theory in sociology. I suggest that,
   notwithstanding the benefits that accrue from the development of
   theoretical ideas and research in a competitive environment, competition
   can also have undesirable consequences. I argue that such tendencies
   should be countered by cooperation in our theoretical and research
   efforts (e.g., multimethod research). I also advocate the development of
   abstract formulations that are precise and systematic because such
   theories are more clearly understood and capable of being investigated,
   can lead to the development of more clearly defined questions, and can
   help us achieve the goal of greater cooperation. To provide an
   illustration of these points I discuss a recently developed line of
   theory and research related to "structural ritualization theory." This
   work focuses on "deritualization, "that is, the breakdown of previously
   engaged in ritualized practices due to disruptive events. Four studies
   are discussed: an experimental investigation of positive, negative, and
   neutral disruptions of ritualized practices in task groups; a study of
   personal accounts of individuals interned in concentration camps; a
   qualitative analysis of pioneering reports on disasters which shows how
   such events result in the breakdown of ritualized behaviors; and,
   historical research that focuses on "dark ages" as macrolevel
   disruptions leading to large-scale deritualization. I conclude by
   reemphasizing the value of theory and the need for cooperation,
   summarizing analytical concerns generated by deritualization research,
   and suggesting the need for applied efforts based on these principles
   and research.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The reciprocal connection between religion and family life makes the
   topic of religious intermarriage of particular importance in the
   sociology of religion. Spousal influences are key for motivating
   religious switching and other religious commitments. Religious
   intermarriage has also been shown to influence a host of other outcomes,
   including spousal conflict, domestic violence, divorce, and fertility.
   Using data from the 1973-1994 GSS, I estimate log-multiplicative models
   examining patterns of association between spouses' religious
   affiliations across two broad cohorts. Two-step and FIML Heckman's
   selection models are used to determine how education, migration, cohort,
   and denominational origins influence the probability of intermarriage
   and the distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Religious intermarriage
   increases across cohorts, but declines in homogamy are limited to
   liberal religious groups. Catholics and members of conservative sects
   are less likely to intermarry compared to others. The relative ordering
   of distances between religious groups was unchanged across cohorts.
   Educational attainment increases the likelihood of intermarriage, and
   marriages in which the woman has more education are more likely to be
   heterogamous. However, educational factors have no impact on the
   distance of intermarriage if it occurs. Geographically stable rural
   Southerners are least likely to intermarry and if they do, choose a more
   similar spouse. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Inc.</td>

   to challenge the standard political-institutional (PI) account of state

   resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title
   VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the
   literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence
   of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies
   can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory
   construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social
   movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a
   "moving target," with state and societal actors building on legal as
   well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By
   reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced
   explanations of state policy that are both "political" and
   "institutional" and that highlight the centrality of legal
   interpretation and judicial review to political sociology.</td>

   The research focuses on the narrower topic of attitudes toward economic

   religiosity and religious affiliation to such attitudes. The
   contributions of the religious components are assessed independent of
   other factors identified to be important in the two areas. Using data
   from the 1987 panel of the General Social Survey, multiple analyses of
   variance reveals relatively strong structural effects but no
   relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward economic justice.
   Religious affiliation is statistically significant, but of sufficiently
   limited "captured variance that substantive interpretation must wait
   future research.</td>

   addressed relative to families of color. We found that whites were more
   often presented as a comparison group to families of color rather than
   as groups with histories and experiences of their own. We recommend that
   textbooks avoid separate sections for families of color, examine whites
   with the same scrutiny as families of color, examine white privilege as

   others have suggested that involving students in service learning may
   actually reinforce their tendency to blame victims of social problems
   for their own conditions. Little research has considered the role of
   service learning In the political socialization of America's youth and
   how it might relate to the political Intolerance that characterizes the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists tend to eschew biological explanations of human social
   behavior. Accordingly, when evolutionary biologists began to apply
   neo-Darwinian theory to the study of human social behavior, the
   reactions of sociologists typically ranged from indifference to overt
   hostility. Since the mid-1960s, however, neo-Darwinian evolutionary
   theory has stimulated a "second Darwinian revolution" in traditional
   social scientific conceptions of human nature and social behavior, even
   while most sociologists remain largely uninformed about neo-Darwinian
   theory and research. This article traces sociology's long-standing
   isolation from the life sciences, especially evolutionary biology, to
   divergence in the metatheoretical assumptions that typify conventional
   sociological thought versus contemporary evolutionary biology. We
   conclude with a discussion of the recent emergence of a nascent
   "evolutionary sociology" that integrates sociobiological reasoning with
   contemporary sociological thought.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>When examining environmental justice and injustice, surprisingly few
   studies have examined the experiences of Native Americans. In filling
   this gap, we criticize and build on environmental and political
   sociology. We make the case and provide evidence that the US. military
   pursues a pattern of environmental "bads" that cannot be reduced to
   capitalism and that coercive state policies can mold the spatial
   distribution of people relative to environmental dangers. Our
   contribution, then, is both theoretical and substantive. First, we
   recast the environmental sociology literature by specifying the scope
   conditions under which a "treadmill of production" and a "treadmill of
   destruction" are applicable. Specifically, we argue that a "treadmill of
   destruction" is driven by a distinct logic of geopolitics that cannot be
   reduced to capitalism. Second, we provide empirical evidence of the
   "treadmill of destruction" by examining the environmental inequality
   endured by Native Americans at the hands of the US. military. We have
   collected data on a large number of military bases that have been closed
   but remain dangerous due to unexploded ordnance. We provide evidence
   that Native American lands tend to be located in the same county as such
   hazardous sites. In the twentieth century, the United States fought and
   won two global wars and prevailed in a sustained Cold War The
   geopolitical demands of remaining the world leading military power
   pushed the United States to produce, test, and deploy weapons of
   unprecedented toxicity. Native Americans have been left exposed to the
   dangers of this toxic legacy.</td>

   importantly, it examines the potential for learning communities to
   incorporate active and collaborative learning techniques as a vehicle to
   subvert dominant views of diversity, to see diversity as intersecting
   social inequalities that can be rearranged in favor of greater social
   equality. The effectiveness of a learning community with the theme of
   diversity for meeting these goals is assessed using qualitative and
   quantitative data. It is concluded that the pedagogic framework of the
   learning community did indeed push students to problematize their
   student role. Finally, a review of results from a pre/post-test
   questionnaire suggests that students entered the community as a fairly
   homogenous group in their views of diversity and left as a more
   heterogeneous group, indicating some shift in consciousness, however
   slight.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article presents a social-organizational approach to explaining
   empirical variation in rates of altruism. The efforts of organizations
   are mostly responsible for much of the altruism seen today, and the
   substance of these efforts varies. Although research from social
   psychology and organizational studies suggests that altruistic action is
   sensitive to social context, the link between individual and
   organizational aspects of altruism has not been clearly articulated. In
   particular our knowledge of "one-shot," organizationally managed
   altruism is limited. I suggest that the factors of organizational
   resources, scope, and persistence are likely to generate higher rates of
   individual altruism in the absence of long-term relationships that
   encourage giving behavior The approach is applied to the case of
   cadaveric organ procurement in the United States. The analysis
   highlights the central role of organ procurement organizations (OPOs).
   Quantitative analysis of OPO procurement rates shows that, while

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article encourages sociologists to study gender as a social
   institution. Noting that scholars apply the institution concept to
   highly disparate phenomena, it reviews the history of the concept in
   twentieth-century sociology. The defining characteristic most commonly
   attributed to social institution is endurance (or persistence over time)
   while contemporary uses highlight practices, conflict, identity, power,
   and change. I identify twelve criteria for deciding whether any
   phenomenon is a social institution. I conclude that treating gender as
   an institution will improve gender scholarship and social theory
   generally, increase awareness of gender's profound sociality, offer a
   means of linking diverse theoretical and empirical work, and make
   gender's invisible dynamics and complex intersections with other
   institutions more apparent and subject to critical analysis and change.</td>

   sociological theory and research. It has to be, distinguished from
   policy, professional, and critical sociologies. Together these four
   interdependent sociologies enter into relations of domination and
   subordination, forming a disciplinary division of labor that varies
   among academic institutions as well as over time, both within and

   In this paper I provide an alternative reading of The Religious Factor's
   impact on sociology of religion that points to its larger theoretical
   implications. I argue that the book should be understood in relation to
   continuing debates about the classification of religious traditions,
   differentiation among socioreligious groups, intergroup relations among
   religious traditions, and friendship ties within religious communities.
   Through understanding these contributions, the book's legacy as well as

   requires consideration of constructs in addition to those developed by

   consist of emotional support and companionship. The media also help

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Drawing on interviews with peer-review panelists from five
   multidisciplinary fellowship competitions, this paper analyzes one of
   the main criteria used to evaluate scholarship in the humanities and the
   social sciences: originality. Whereas the literature in the sociology of
   science focuses on the natural sciences and defines originality as the
   production of new findings and new theories, we show that in the context
   of fellowship competitions, peer reviewers in the social sciences and
   humanities define originality much more broadly: as using a new
   approach, theory, method, or data; studying a new topic; doing research
   in an understudied area; or producing new findings. Whereas the
   literature has not considered disciplinary variation in the definition
   of originality, we identified significant differences. Humanists and
   historians clearly privilege originality in approach, and humanists also
   emphasize originality in the data used. Social scientists most often
   mention originality in method, but they also appreciate a more diverse
   range of types of originality. Whereas the literature tends to equate
   originality with substantive innovation and to consider the personal

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Has sociology become more socially integrated over the last 30 years?
   Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage
   between social interaction patterns and the structure of ideas,
   suggesting that scientific collaboration networks affect scientific
   practice. I test three competing models for sociological collaboration
   networks and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been
   growing steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline
   coauthorship network. The results show that participation in the
   sociology collaboration network depends on research specialty and that
   quantitative work is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative
   work. However, structural embeddedness within the network core given
   collaboration is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is
   consistent with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has
   potentially integrative implications for theoretical development in
   sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The prestige of academic departments is commonly understood as rooted in
   the scholarly productivity of their faculty and graduates. I use the
   theories of Weber and Bourdieu to advance an alternative view of
   departmental prestige, which I show is an effect a department position
   within networks of association and social exchange-that is, it is a form
   of social capital. The social network created by the exchange of PhDs
   among departments is the most important network of this kind. Using data
   on the exchange of PhDs among sociology departments, I apply network
   analysis to investigate this alternative conception of departmental
   prestige and to demonstrate its superiority over the conventional view.
   Within sociology, centrality within interdepartmental hiring networks
   explains 84 percent of the variance in departmental prestige. Similar
   findings are reported for history and political science. This
   alternative understanding of academic prestige helps clarify anomalies -
   e.g., the variance in prestige unconnected to scholarly productivity,
   the strong association between department size and prestige, and the
   long-term stability of prestige rankings - encountered in research that
   is based on the more conventional view.</td>

   other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that
   emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the
   examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find

   across geographic territory at two ends of the spatial scale continuum,

   different scale of focus, subnational stratification processes across
   middle-range spatial units, those between the city and nation-state.
   While characterizing much contemporary rural sociological research, this
   approach to spatial inequality does not tend to be seen as a coherent
   tradition that cross-cuts substantive areas. First, I discuss why
   attention to subnational inequality, rural regions, and middle-range
   spatial units are important to social science understanding of
   stratification processes. Second, I provide an overview of contemporary
   research traditions in rural sociology which, taken together, form a
   distinct and innovative approach to spatial inequality. Third, I draw
   from my own work to explain how factors affecting socioeconomic
   inequalities across middle-range territorial units may be conceptualized
   and provide two sets of empirical examples. Finally, I discuss what
   should be done in terms of furthering rural sociology's regional
   approach to spatial inequality.</td>

   entrepreneurship. Drawing on research in economic sociology and economic
   geography, this paper examines the role of social learning in vendor
   innovation. Data from a 1999 mail survey of farmers' market vendors in
   California, New York and Iowa show that business innovation, as
   represented by intensity of vendors' innovative marketing practices and
   vendors' successful enterprise expansion, was modest. Social learning
   through engagement with customers contributed to more innovative
   marketing by vendors, while social learning through engagement with
   customers and fellow vendors increased the likelihood of vendors
   diversifying to additional markets beyond the farmers' market. Certain
   individual and enterprise characteristics also influenced vendor
   innovation. This suggests that, although important, the beneficial
   effects of social learning for vendors at farmers' markets remain
   moderated by human capital and structural factors.</td>

   struggles that inevitably arise over material and ideal interests. While
   current cooperative theory privileges the economic element, a political
   economy of cooperation emphasizes cooperatives' tentative bridging of
   economic and political spheres with a democratic ethos. The
   cooperatives' democratic political structure exists in tension with a
   capitalist economic structure and other sites of friction. These
   contradictions are: in the realm of social relations, between production
   and consumption; in the realm of spatial relations, between the local
   and the global; and in the realm of collective action, between
   cooperatives as both traditional as well as new social movements. Where
   neo-classical economic models seek to eliminate or reduce these
   tensions, political economy views these tensions as functional to
   sustainability by creating an "institutional friction" that facilitates
   innovation, flexibility and long-term adaptability. This political
   economy of cooperation is intended as a step toward the development of a
   multidimensional sociology of cooperation.</td>

   hypotheses developed to explain the distribution of endangered species
   across the globe, there is a paucity of social science literature
   designed to specify these hypotheses in more detail or test them with
   comparative, national-level data. This study draws on several models
   from environmental sociology to specify conceptually the relationship
   between social and economic factors and rates of endangered mammals and
   birds. Specifically, I developed hypotheses based on neo-Malthusian,
   ecological modernization, treadmill of production, and world-systems
   theory and analyzed data on endangered species, population, land use,
   economic size and growth, energy use, and industrial pollutants from one
   hundred twenty nations. The results support ecological modernization's
   position that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP per
   capita and endangerment rates, but they also indicate that GDP growth is
   associated with a monotonic increase in these rates, thus supporting a
   treadmill of production argument. Yet these relationships vary by
   world-systems position. Endangerment rates in peripheral nations are
   affected more by GDP growth, whereas rates in semiperipheral nations are
   affected more by deforestation, GDP per capita, and growth in energy use
   per capita.</td>

   Senechal de la Roche (1996) and propose the following geometrical model:
   Pure terrorism arises intercollectively and upwardly across long
   distances in multidimensional space. Yet because social distance
   historically corresponded to physical distance, terrorism often lacked
   the physical geometry necessary for its occurrence: physical closeness
   to civilians socially distant enough to attract terrorism. New
   technology has made physical distance increasingly irrelevant, however,
   and terrorism has proliferated. But technology also shrinks the social
   universe and sows the seeds of terrorism's destruction.</td>

   ideal of "sustainable development" retains currency across a remarkably
   broad swath of the political spectrum in debating alternative scenarios
   for the future. By adapting Weber's classic categories of value spheres
   and collective rationality, I distinguish contemporary approaches to
   operationalizing the concept of sustainability and elucidate the
   practical implications of each. For some, the social, ecological, and
   economic dimensions of sustainability are synergistic components of a
   single meaningful goal, pursued by either an overarching technique or a
   unifying ethic. In contrast to these unifying models, one may conclude
   that the dimensions of sustainable development invoke values that
   inevitably conflict in any complex social interaction to derive
   strategies for collective action. Framing the concept in such terms, as
   a dialogue of values, highlights the need to adapt social institutions
   to mediate value conflict at different scales, and points to
   opportunities for engaging development debates through applied research
   on comparative governance.</td>

   hypotheses about necessary and sufficient causes, and these procedures
   address the skepticism that mainstream methodologists may hold about
   necessary and sufficient causation. Likewise, new techniques are
   available for analyzing hypotheses that refer to complex temporal
   processes, including path-dependent sequences. In the area of

   providing endogenous explanations of cultural phenomena. The focus is on
   works that provide cultural explanations of cultural processes, as
   opposed to the social structural and "production of culture"
   explanations otherwise predominant in the literature. I examine three
   distinct approaches: a "post-hermeneutic" approach devoted. not to the
   question of cultural interpretation but to the issue of subjects'
   manipulation of culture in the quest for meaning; a semiotic approach
   focused on the mechanics of symbol systems; and an ecological approach
   that emphasizes the role of competition and niche density in explaining
   both cultural stasis and change. The three approaches have in common a
   general lack of interest in traditional conceptions of meaning
   (verstehen), choosing instead to focus on issues related to the internal
   structure and dynamics of cultural expression. This marks a new
   opportunity for synthesis and exploration in a field traditionally
   devoted to extra-cultural explanation of cultural phenomena. Both
   endogenous and exogenous explanations are offered for the rise of this
   new trend in the sociology of culture.</td>

   majors? (2) What barriers do students see to engaging in such
   experiences? (3) What supports for involvement do students recognize?
   (4) What are students' overall attitudes about OOCLO? (5) What variables
   are associated with participation in OOCLO? All students from one
   medium-sized, public, Midwestern university who were enrolled in the
   required sociology senior experience course in one academic year were
   given the self-administered questionnaire. Results indicate most
   students participate most frequently in OOCLO that involve low student
   initiative, effort, and commitment. Lack of time is reported as a
   critical barrier to participation. Factors viewed as key supports for
   participation include convenient/spare time, useful and interesting
   activities, no cost, and teacher encouragement. Involvement in OOCLO was
   significantly related to engagement in the discipline and to skipping
   fewer classes. Structural factors were more important for participation
   than were individual characteristics.</td>

   understanding, I supplemented weekly seminar meetings with focused
   Web-based discussions of issues in a "Race and Education" senior
   sociology seminar. These Web-based discussions were structured by
   specific questions and discussion roles. Before seminar, Staters posted
   on the course Web site the most important thing they learned from a
   reading, describing what was most difficult, and raising new
   sociological questions. After seminar, Responders replied to the
   questions and difficulties posted and posed further sociological
   questions. Two days later, Integrators synthesized and integrated what
   they had learned that week from others' postings, readings, and seminar
   discussion, and raised further questions. Analysis of student postings
   suggests that students' engagement with the ideas of others increased
   during the semester and their thinking became more complex. This paper
   discusses the processes that contributed to students' learning and
   suggested pedagogical changes. It also raises questions for further
   research.</td>

   instructing students about controversial issues in sociology. Within the
   second, more narrowed focus, we describe a class exercise involving the
   recent Vermont Supreme Court decision to legalize civil unions as an
   approach to addressing contemporary debates in sociology pertaining to
   the decline versus transition of the American family social institution.
   This project is developed using a three-pronged pedagogical approach
   involving critical theory, problem-based learning, and information
   literacy. While the technique described in this article is taken from a
   course on the Social History of American Families, the method can be
   modified for a variety of courses including sociology of the family,
   sociology of gender, introduction to sociology, and social problems.</td>

   industrialization in the dairy sector of the United States. We offer the
   perspective of historical sociology to this debate, arguing that time
   and place significantly determine the outcomes of processes such as
   industrialization. We present an historically-grounded explanation for
   the rise of industrial dairying, which first occurred in Los Angeles
   County. Beginning with the immigration of Dutch dairy farmers to Los
   Angeles (L.A.) in the 1920s, a contingent and sequential
   process-embedded within the local/California political economy-of
   exploding population growth, rapid urbanization, and skyrocketing land
   prices led to repeated geographical relocations and expansions of
   large-scale dairies during the next three decades. We conclude that
   agricultural industrialization is not inevitable but instead is the
   result of contingent factors (cultural and political-economic) as well
   as the particular sequencing of events and processes. In thus
   historicizing the industrialization debate, we seek limited, rather than
   universal, generalizations.</td>

   rates have not been intensely investigated. Centralized democracies that
   reduce public influence by using corporatist methods to resolve disputes
   should have lower incarceration rates, but the opposite should be true
   in decentralized polities with federalist political arrangements where
   mass publics have greater control over punishment. Threat hypotheses are
   assessed by examining the effects of minority presence and economic
   inequality. This study uses a panel design to examine these effects on
   imprisonment rates in 13 of the most progressive democracies from 1970
   to 1995. With the murder or overall crime rates, social disorganization,
   and additional indicators held constant, the presence of corporatist and
   federalist political arrangements explain cross-national differences in
   incarceration rates. The evidence suggests that internal racial or
   ethnic threat produces larger imprisonment rates as well. The findings
   indicate that a well-developed comparative political sociology of
   punishment should help us understand contrasts in the proportion of the
   population that is incarcerated in advanced democracies.</td>

   sociologists often study environmental attitudes. While much of this
   work is atheoretical, the focus on attitudes suggests that researchers
   are implicitly drawing upon attitude theory in psychology. The present
   research brings sociological theory to environmental sociology by
   drawing on identity theory to understand environmentally responsive
   behavior. We develop an environment identity model of environmental
   behavior that includes not only the meanings of the environment
   identity, but also the prominence and salience of the environment
   identity and commitment to the environment identity,. We examine the
   identity process as it relates to behavior, though not to the exclusion
   of examining the effects of environmental attitudes. The findings reveal
   that individual agency is important in influencing environmentally
   responsive behavior, but this agency is largely through identity
   processes, rather than attitude processes. This provides an important
   theoretical and empirical advance over earlier work in environmental
   sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>By the late 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu had become the primary public
   intellectual of major social scientific status at the head of the
   anti-globalization movement that emerged in France and in other Western
   European countries. This article discusses how Bourdieu became a leading
   public intellectual, a role that seems to contrast with his early years
   as a professional sociologist. It explores what seemed to change in
   Bourdieu's activities and outlook as sociologist and what seems to have
   remained constant. It identifies several institutional conditions that
   seemed necessary for Bourdieu to be able to play the kind of public
   intellectual role he did in his later years. Bourdieu's movement from a
   peripheral position to a central location in the French intellectual
   field, the changing character of the field itself, the growing influence
   of the mass media in French political and cultural life, the failures of
   the French Socialists in power, a cultural legacy of leading critical
   intellectuals in France, a unifying national issue of globalization, and
   the political conjuncture in 1995 all intersected in ways that opened a
   path for Bourdieu to choose new and more frequent forms of political
   action. His responses to that combination of factors at different
   moments reveal both a striking continuity in desire to preserve the
   autonomy of intellectual life and a change in view and strategy on how
   best to do that. The article concludes with a brief evaluation of
   Bourdieu's public intellectual role.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Robert Merton presented two, not always clearly differentiated theories
   in his seminal explorations on the social-structure-and-anomie paradigm:
   a strain theory and an anomie theory. A one-sided focus on Merton's
   strain theory in the secondary literature has unnecessarily restricted
   the power and effectiveness of Merton's anomie theory. For although
   structural strain is one way to explain why deviance occurs in the
   context of anomie, it is not the only way. We contend that scholars who
   are critical of strain theory should not automatically discard Merton's
   anomie theory, because the perspective of anomie is compatible with
   several other theories of crime and delinquency. Offering examples of
   previous integration efforts, we maintain that Merton's theoretical
   model can benefit from the input of other theories of crime and deviance
   as much as these other theoretical perspectives can fine-tune their
   models and explanations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper explores the ethnographic technique of the focused
   revisit-rare in sociology but common in anthropology-when an
   ethnographer returns to the site of a previous study. Discrepancies
   between earlier and later accounts can be attributed to differences in:
   (1) the relation of observer to participant, (2) theory brought to the
   field by the ethnographer (3) internal processes within the field site
   itself or (4) forces external to the field site. Focused revisits tend
   to settle on one or another of these four explanations, giving rise to
   four types of focused revisits. Using examples, the limits of each type
   of focused revisit are explored with a view to developing a reflexive
   ethnography that combines all four approaches. The principles of the
   focused revisit are then extended to rolling, punctuated, heuristic,
   archeological, and valedictory revisits. In centering attention on
   ethnography-as-revisit sociologists directly confront the dilemmas of
   participating in the world they study-a world that undergoes (real)
   historical change that can only be grasped using a (constructed)
   theoretical lens.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A single unified frame of reference for determining how sociology should
   be taught does not exist; nor does it exist for describing the optimum
   design for instituting curricula in sociology at different colleges and
   universities. Yet patterns and themes appear to persist at particular
   institutions that reflect the influence of their peculiar historical
   development and social contexts. This perspective underlies the
   examination of sociology at Howard University since its beginning as a
   series of lectures in 1895. Four factors are emphasized: the historical
   mission of the university, the special research and intellectual
   interests of departmental faculty, with particular discussion of the
   influence of E. Franklin Frazier; the struggles of traditional
   perspectives in opposition to the need to respond to new demands in
   society, and the demand of students for new courses outside the boundary
   of the existing curriculum. While I conclude that sociology at Howard
   University has always generally exhibited major facets of mainstream
   sociology, the most enduring thematic focus in research and teaching has
   centered on problems associated with racial and social inequality.</td>

   Sovereignty Commission and secondary sources regarding Tougaloo
   College's academic life such as college catalogs, institutional

   institutional constraints related to a historically African-American
   liberal arts college in Mississippi. Through grantsmanship, Borinski
   developed a Social Science Advancement Institute, Social Science Forums,
   and a Freshman Social Science Seminar. Between 1947 and 1999, he
   produced approximately 22 students who received Ph.D.'s, approximately
   10 in sociology or social work; and approximately 88 students received

   Findings from the quantitative analysis indicate learning outcomes

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article develops an interactive, theoretical model of emotional
   feedback and amplification. Whereas the sociology of emotions typically
   examines how affect arises, this article focuses on the aftermath of an
   evoked emotion as it evolves in ongoing interaction. I argue that
   interactions serve as a stimulus to evoke emotional responses, but as
   interactions continue, these interactions provide an additional stimulus
   that feeds back into the initial emotion, amplifying it. I articulate
   two modes of emotional feedback and amplification: spontaneous and
   managed. Spontaneous amplification is a by-product of unplanned but
   continuous interactions. In contrast, managed amplification results from
   purposeful interactions and can be initiated through either surface
   acting or deep acting. The process of feedback and amplification is more
   likely under structural and cultural conditions that facilitate ongoing
   interactions. An empirical elaboration of the model is drawn from an
   ethnographic study of "TD's Restaurant." Examining how feedback and
   amplification occur in different settings is an ongoing task for
   sociologists interested in emotions, work and occupations, mental
   health, and social movements.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This essay explicates the role of countersystem analysis as an essential
   mode of social inquiry. In the process, particular attention is given to
   the place of negation and the future. One underlying theme is the
   asymmetry between the negative and the positive features of social
   activities, the negative being more readily identifiable empirically
   than the positive. A corollary theme, building on the observations of
   George Herbert Mead, is: one engages the present through experience; one
   engages the future through ideas. Furthermore, as Anthony Giddens,
   Ulrich Beck, and Niklas Luhmann suggest, we in late modernity seem to be
   facing a future that is more contingent than it was in early modernity.
   After articulating the foundations of the mode of inquiry we term
   "countersystem analysis," we employ Karl Mannheim as a point of
   departure for critically surveying a constellation of
   scholars-conservatives as well as reformers-who have relied upon some
   version of countersystem analysis in addressing the future. Such an
   orientation serves to advance not only theoretical inquiry but empirical
   investigation as well.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>External validity refers to the generalization of research findings,
   either from a sample to a larger population or to settings and
   populations other than those studied. While definitions vary,
   discussions generally agree that experiments are lower in external
   validity than other methodological approaches. Further, external
   validity is widely treated as an issue to be addressed through
   methodological procedures. When testing theories, all measures are
   indirect indicators of theoretical constructs, and no methodological
   procedures taken alone can produce external validity. External validity
   can be assessed through determining (1) the extent to which empirical
   measures accurately reflect theoretical constructs, (2) whether the
   research setting conforms to the scope of the theory under test, (3) our
   confidence that findings will repeat under identical conditions, (4)
   whether findings support the theory being tested, and (5) the
   confirmatory status of the theory under test. In these ways, external
   validity is foremost a theoretical issue and can only be addressed by an
   examination of the interplay between theory and methods.</td>

   China about two millennia before it did in European states? In this
   paper, comparative historical arguments about war and state-making are
   combined with agency theory to answer this question. The Spring and
   Autumn and Warring States eras that preceded the Qin unification of
   China created the necessary conditions for bureaucratization by
   weakening the aristocracy, creating a bureaucratic model, facilitating
   the development of roads, and providing trained and disciplined
   personnel. Comparative analysis shows that the main factor
   differentiating Qin China from other states and empires was the extreme
   weakness of the aristocracy produced by an unusually long period of
   severe warfare. Although Qin China was more bureaucratic than any other
   state or empire prior to the seventeenth century, it was far from
   completely bureaucratic. The persistence of monitoring problems
   prevented its full development, necessitating deviations such as the use
   of severe negative sanctions, the creation of redundant positions, and
   limiting bureaucratization to the top of the administrative system. The
   further development of the bureaucratic administrative system in the Han
   dynasty is also discussed.</td>

   protest events in New York State between 1968 and 1973 are tested with
   the aim of understanding the broad mechanisms of social control used by
   authorities during this cycle of mass protest. Contrary to the popular
   perception of overzealous police repression of protest in this period,
   results show that police did not attend the majority of protest events.
   Tests of dominant explanations of police presence using logistic
   regress, on analysis indicate that the best predictor of police presence
   at a protest event was how threatening the event was-police attended
   larger protest events and those that used confrontational tactics. Tests
   (using multinomial logistic regression) of explonations of police
   action, given police presence at an event, indicate that extreme forms
   of police action were also triggered by threatening characteristics of
   events. Events in which subordinate groups and social movement
   organizations participated were also more likely to draw police action.
   Novel contributions include the comparison of dominant explanations of
   protest policing and methods that move beyond the tradition of examining
   repression through police presence or absence.</td>

   recognition of a specific logical theorem in the field of artificial
   intelligence in the 1990s. Ethnographic observations, interviews, and
   textual analysis, reveal the impact of a heterogeneity of practices of
   evaluation and other forms of interaction between the author of the
   theorem and a varied community of interlocutors, especially during the
   draft stage of the theorem. Individual and collective representations of
   the theorem were structured by the proliferation and polysemy of its
   reformulations, by the imperfect access to proofs and counterproofs, and
   by the coordination of action within opposed groups. The stabilization
   of debates over and the certification of the theorem were not based on
   the simple victory of one side over another but on relatively unified
   responses by critics and by the author's responses to
   critiques-responses that tended to allow for multiple interpretations.
   This ethnography of logic in development illustrates why sociologists
   should not consider logic to be just a methodological tool; it is also a
   privileged object that enables exploration of the material and social
   forms of intellectual work, including the building of credibility.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>How power is extended vertically through hierarchies and horizontally
   through industrial networks and markets is a classic issue in sociology
   that was once extensively studied by Weber. Yet it is little studied
   today. Definitions of power exclude power exercise beyond the single
   relation, as does research in exchange networks. In contrast, research
   in organizations recognizes the extension of power, but offers no theory
   to explain how it is produced or to identify the conditions which might
   further or impede it. Here the extension of power beyond the single
   relationship is called power-at-a-distance. New theory offering metric
   predictions is applied to power-at-a-distance in exchange networks. That
   theory identifies the conditions that extend power beyond the dyad and
   the conditions that tend to block that extension. Five experiments on
   contrasting structures broadly support those predictions. Relations
   between power-at-a-distance and power centralization are theorized.
   Practical problems of extending power are addressed and further research
   is proposed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Karl Polanyi's 1944 book, The Great Transformation, has been recognized
   as central for the field of economic sociology, but it has not been
   subject to the same theoretical scrutiny as other classic works in the
   field. This is a particular problem in that there are central tensions
   and complexities in Polanyi's argument. This article suggests that these
   tensions can be understood as a consequence of Polanyi's changing
   theoretical orientation. The basic outline of the book was developed in
   England in the late 1930s when Polanyi was working within a specific
   type of Marxist framework. However, as he was writing the book, he
   developed several new concepts, including fictitious commodities and the
   embedded economy, that led in new directions. Because circumstances did
   not give him the time to revise his manuscript, the book is marked by a
   tension between these different moments in his own theoretical
   development. The result is that Polanyi glimpses the concept of the
   always embedded market economy, but he does not name it or elaborate it.</td>

   in the first place - how the multitude of transactions designated
   (somewhat arbitrarily) as economic were abstracted from the rest of
   social life and reconstituted as an object, the economy, which behaves
   according to its own logic. This article investigates the social sources
   of some innovations in economic thought that contributed to the
   emergence of the economy, particularly statistical indicators and
   mechanical models. By examining the redefinitions of the object of
   economic research developed by Irving Fisher and Wesley Mitchell in the
   1890s and the first decades of the twentieth century, I argue that the
   abstraction of the economy from the remainder of social life was a
   strategy linked to the position of these innovators within the field of
   economics, conceived as a social structure. Possessing a specialized
   scientific cultural capital, but lacking upper class background,
   contacts, and dispositions that characterized the founders of academic
   economics, Fisher and Mitchell elaborated new definitions of their
   discipline's object of study, and a new type of economic expertise.</td>

   authors propose that the act of storytelling extends temporally and
   socially what might otherwise be an individual, discrete, and ephemeral
   transaction. Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a
   social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant,
   institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized
   authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including
   symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although
   such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional
   change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific
   social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending
   the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of
   resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of
   the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance
   can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of
   power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories,
   they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social
   structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.</td>

   Consideration of the knowledge currently available and the knowledge

   considerable opportunity for sociologists to contribute to STL within
   faculty assessment. Contributions can be made in understanding what
   constitutes STL and methods for assessing contributions in this area of

   Sociology majors interested in crime and deviance are likely to take

   by U.S. sociologists predominantly rely on the official U.S. measure.
   After reviewing the shortcomings of the U.S. measure, this article
   examines several theoretical and methodological advances in poverty
   measurement. After synthesizing literature on poverty measurement, I
   argue that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative
   historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute;
   (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of
   taxes, transfers, and state benefits, and (5) integrate the depth of
   poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates
   sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of
   these criteria. Due to sociology's neglect of these criteria, this
   article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval
   measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally,
   using the Luxembourg Income Study, I examine the empirical patterns with
   these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967
   to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available for
   future research.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the analysis of cross-classified data, sociologists often focus on
   building flexible models for the marginal distributions of a selected
   set of variables. One strategy for achieving flexible modeling is to
   design models for telescoping marginal distributions. As an illustration
   of telescoping distributions, consider a joint distribution of four
   cross-classifying variables: occupational attainment, education level,
   race, and gender A set Of telescoping distributions would be the
   univariate occupation distribution, the bivariate occupation by
   education, the trivariate occupation by education by race, and the
   entire joint distribution. A methodology that enables the telescoping
   modeling strategy is mixed parameterization, which has its roots in the
   statistics and sociology literatures. In this article, the authors
   develop a scheme of multilevel mixed parameterization that can be
   applied to a hierarchy of marginal distributions of reducing dimension.
   An example from the General Social Survey illustrates mixed parameters
   for telescoping models.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and
   research into the connections between associations and democracy. This
   article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy
   into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds
   of associations make: to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic
   governance in various (d) political contexts? Associations enhance
   democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of
   associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills,
   offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the
   quality and equality of representation, facilitating public
   deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to
   participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all
   mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations
   are better suited to advance some contributions than others.
   Further-more, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy
   for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of
   democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations
   appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance-liberal
   minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and
   participatory democracy-are also discussed. Finally, the democratic
   priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual
   features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example,
   associations that resist government authority are more crucial than
   those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.</td>

   conceptions of "social justice" and "morality" as empirically
   demonstrable phenomena. After briefly discussing relevant ideas
   associated with classical sociology and recent theoretical approaches to
   the question of sociocultural relativity, I suggest that any attempt to
   deal with the issue of social justice must involve an empirically
   grounded view of universal human nature as an emergent process that
   reveals itself time and time again within the seemingly infinite
   diversity of a socially constructed world. I further suggest that the
   path to understanding emergent human nature might include an integration
   of linguistic analysis, contemporary brain research, and the quest for
   human universals. After considering the practical (and impractical)
   implications of a successful search for emergent human nature for the
   discipline of sociology, I conclude the address with a real life example
   that illustrates the essence of human species powers even in the face of
   authoritarian oppression.</td>

   decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than
   counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the

   0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with

   What are the most important dimensions and types of higher-level

   geographic patterning of suicide. this classic debate is revisited using
   techniques of spatial analysis and data for two geographies: late
   nineteenth-century French departments, and late twentieth-century U.S.
   counties. Results of the French analysis contradict Durkheim's claim
   that "imitation" plays no role in shaping the geographic patterning of
   suicide. Suicide rates for northern and southern French departments
   cluster geographically even when the clustering of multiple dimensions
   of social integration is controlled. These findings are replicated in a
   contemporary analysis of nonwestern U.S. counties. Results for the
   American West, however support the Durkheimian view that suicide
   clusters in geographic space only because important structural
   predictors of suicide, including measures,of social integration, do so
   as. well. These discrepant findings are reconciled and it is concluded
   that the geographic patterning of suicide is shaped by both social
   integration and imitation.</td>

   by subjects. A game theoretic model of strategic interactions between
   rulers and subjects is developed to more fully specify the relationship
   between state-making and revolt in France between 1515 and 1789.
   Quantitative analyses of revolts throughout France are combined with a
   brief case study of revolts in Guyenne (the most quarrelsome French
   province) to test propositions derived from the model. Offensive war
   (but not war in general) and administrative centralization increased the
   likelihood of revolt, while the presence of the Estates General (the
   national legislative assembly) decreased it. The effect of taxation on
   revolt depended on the historical context-high taxes and offensive wars
   tended to incite revolts prior to the Fronde (a cluster of revolts in
   1648-1653), but had no effect afterwards. It is argued that the outcomes
   of significant revolts, like the Fronde, often serve as important
   turning points in the history of state-making. Potentially similar
   events in medieval England and early modern Spain are also discussed.</td>

   sociological study. Previous studies, however, neglected to consider
   differences in levels of homeownership between nonmarried black and
   white women in the context of place. Accordingly this paper focuses on
   the interaction between place, race, and gender and its impact on
   homeownership for nonmarried persons. The study employs the Integrated
   Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) and logistic regression analysis to
   address the following questions: Has the racial differential in
   homeownership for nonmarried women changed from 1970 to 1990? How do
   place, race, and gender interact to determine the levels of
   homeownership for nonmarried women? The findings reveal that, although
   black women were less likely than white women to own homes, the racial
   differential declined dramatically in rural areas over the two-decade
   period. The overall trend of decline was opposite to that for urban
   areas.</td>

   substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion
   is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an
   impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs;
   and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent
   that their activities provide elected officials with information and
   resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is
   articles published in major sociology and political science journals
   from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of
   organizations on policy. The major findings include. political
   organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and
   nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some
   evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral
   concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.</td>

   neighborhood effects. Neighborhood effects are community influences on
   individual social or economic outcomes. Examples include labor force
   activity, child outcomes, criminal behavior, and other socioeconomic
   phenomena. The existing theoretical and empirical literature is
   reviewed. Conceptual definitions from sociology are linked and
   contrasted with economic models. Early studies are criticized for
   failing to account for a number of endogeneity concerns. Recent
   empirical studies are also explored. The results of these papers
   demonstrate that although neighborhood characteristics are important,
   their influences are much smaller than suggested by previous research.
   An additional emphasis is dedicated to linking the neighborhood effects
   literature to other research of local or spatial activity within
   economics, sociology, and geography. In particular, the potential
   employment of local interaction game theory and spatial econometrics in
   neighborhood effects research is discussed. Additionally, a catalogue of
   existing empirical research is assembled. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Max Weber has typically been regarded as a central thinker in the
   liberal tradition of social analysis. At the same time, critics have
   long noted how his democratic commitments were compromised by his
   nationalism. Drawing on existing criticism, I discuss the importance of
   charismatic leadership in Weber's thought and its implications for his
   understanding of the process of democratization. Reconstructing core
   concepts in Weber's political thought, I analyze how Weber's concept of
   plebiscitarian leadership unites charismatic domination with nationalism
   and skepticism concerning effective democratic politics. I show how
   Weber's concept of plebiscitarian rule grew from deeply held political
   values and his engagement with German politics. I then generate
   propositions regarding the problem of democratization in regime
   transitions and apply them to contemporary charismatic leaders and
   ethno-nationalist mobilization in post-Communist transitions. T argue
   that as much as it anticipates the central dilemma of charismatic
   solutions to political crisis, Weber's thought favors nationalist and
   plebiscitarian responses to democratization that have been largely
   discredited by historical experience.</td>

   particular focus on Alvin Gouldner's work. From that session came this
   symposium. for which various papers presented were developed into
   articles. The session and these articles raise important issues for what
   they tell us both about Gouldner's work and about where sociology is as
   a discipline today. Among these issues are (1) the optimistic quest for
   objective value-free knowledge positivism entailed in the past versus a
   self-reflexive quest for knowledge that entails a tragic acceptance of
   its limits at present. (2) the effort to distinguish social theory from
   sociology, ideology. and politics, with all of whom it overlaps as they
   strive to be both social diagnosis and social therapy. (3) the
   production of knowledge as dependent both on the lived experiences that
   shape our biographies and on the intellectual influences available in
   the local settings where we work, (4) the effort to warn us against the
   various excesses to which our disciplinary and personal commitments give
   way, and (5) the role social theory can play as a search light that
   illuminates our way in the darkness of the empirical world in which we
   live, while it simultaneously casts a shadow.</td>

   understanding the transitions Alvin Gouldner made during his career as a
   sociologist. This article argues that a latent tragic orientation or
   vision existed during Gouldner's early career as a standout in the field
   of industrial sociology and that this tragic vision became manifest
   around 1962 as Gouldner was developing more and more strident
   denunciations of establishment sociology. This case study of Gouldner's
   career teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the tragic
   vision in helping sociologists to understand the limitations of the

   contributions ever made to the sociology of ideas. Overshadowed soon

   The coming crisis of Western Sociology. the earlier book has suffered
   neglect. In an effort to correct this situation, we situate Enter Plato
   against the backdrop of other mid-twentieth-century works in the
   sociology of knowledge and related areas, arguing that Gouldner's study
   was one of the first sustained responses to Robert K, Merton's call for
   a sociology of knowledge that would steer a middle course between the
   abstract, speculative tendencies of the field's European founders and
   the relatively atheoretical contributions of their American
   counterparts. We build on this interpretation to offer a contemporary
   sociological appraisal of Enter Plato, considering its positive and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The movement to assess student learning more comprehensively and more
   systematically began in earnest in the mid-1980s, and today is
   entrenched throughout higher education. However, commentary about
   assessment continues to be dominated by anecdotal reports and analyses
   of the strengths and weaknesses of particular programs. In order to
   obtain a broad-based picture of the development of assessment programs
   within sociology, 150 sociology departments were randomly selected and
   sent a self-administered questionnaire regarding the level of
   development of their departmental statement of purpose, departmental
   goals and objectives, the use of and experience with particular
   assessment mechanisms, and a summative judgment about the amount of work
   invested in assessment to date and the effects of that work.Almost
   two-thirds of the 70 responding departments have a departmental
   statement of purpose, but only about half of the departments have
   articulated specific learning objectives for students. Departments in
   public institutions are much more likely than departments in private
   institutions to have a statement of purpose and are somewhat more likely
   to have learning objectives. The most common assessment mechanisms being
   used are evaluations of specific assignments in required major courses,
   student surveys, alumni surveys, external reviewers, and evaluations of
   research projects. However, the most beneficial mechanisms are perceived
   to be reviews by external evaluators, work in a capstone course,
   in-house comprehensive exams, and in-house exams given early and late
   during a student's progression through the sociology major. Responding
   institutions reported that they have dedicated only a moderate effort to
   their student learning assessments and that the information received
   from those assessments has provided only moderate value. The
   implications of these assessment patterns found in sociology departments
   are discussed.</td>

   sociologists regarding usage and impact of various outcomes assessment
   strategies. The data are broken down by school type-public and
   private-as well as by school size. Alumni and senior surveys and
   capstone products are used most often, while commercial exams, external
   review of student work, and oral exams are used least often. Few
   differences exist for school type and size. Impact on the curriculum and
   teaching is modest at best, with faculty members at private and smaller
   schools reporting greater impact. The implications of outcomes
   assessment for power redistribution are examined.</td>

   issue. Arguments often center on assessment methodology, but the real
   source of disagreement is usually the underlying model of learning
   informing the methodology. This article describes a program for
   assessing student learning at a community college using critical
   theories of knowledge and the learning process. The faculty-designed
   assessment program includes an annotated bibliography assignment
   required in all introductory sociology sections. Faculty identified
   three types of literacy that students were expected to understand and
   practice as a result of the assignment: resource, social structural, and
   social scientific. Student learning in these areas was tracked across
   semesters using a survey, faculty observations, and sampled evaluations
   of completed bibliographies. All measures of learning indicate
   significant improvement in learning outcomes. The article records and
   discusses the program methodology within the framework of critical
   pedagogical theory.</td>

   behavior). We show how assessing a desired outcome requires attention to
   four specific areas: organizational context, the articulation of a
   learning model, program design and implementation, and outcomes
   assessment. Our findings, based on multiple indicators gathered over
   time and including both summative and formative measures, suggest that
   our graduates are generally achieving the outcomes established for them.
   We discuss how our results are used to inform decision-makers, and how
   inconsistencies discovered between the program's desired outcomes and
   students' actual achievements are managed within the framework of the
   program. Finally, we highlight several lessons learned as a result of
   this intensive process, linking its benefits to programs within
   sociology and other disciplines.</td>

   mixed results. We describe different assessment designs available for
   different types of curricula and report results from a
   quasi-experimental design comparing the level of critical sociological
   reasoning skills between students near the beginning and those finishing
   their studies. Those students finishing their program, organized as a
   loosely-spiraling curriculum with a capstone course, displayed stronger
   sociological reasoning skills even when controlling for each student's
   overall GPA. An analysis of course syllabi revealed an academic
   environment with variable standards inconsistently associated with
   course level. Several recommendations are offered for the "real world"
   implementation of sociology curriculum assessment. We think the

   examine how human interest stories create collective attention,
   essential for the establishment of a public or demos, and the
   limitations of that process. Although human interest stories are not
   unique in this regard, such stories encourage shared identification,
   important for social cohesion and the maintenance of a public sphere.
   However, since the embedded story is presented as one that is not
   perceived as having lasting societal impact, it directs attention away
   from political action. We present four processes through which human
   interest stories operate. (1) media placement - how media structure and
   occupational interests produce stories that capture reader loyalty, (2)
   identification potential - the creation of scenes and personae that
   audiences feel they "know" and with which they can identify, (3)
   narrative arc - the process by which a story maintains reader interest,
   exposing conflicts and changes in likely outcomes, and (4) discursive
   space - the role of moral issues, provoking discussion and the
   possibility of active involvement of audiences. To explore these
   processes we analyze the case of Floyd Collins, the Kentucky caver
   trapped for seventeen days in 1925, and detail the associated media
   frenzy.</td>

   technologies has resulted in the creation of the Internet, a global
   network of computers that has been growing at an exponential rate.
   Although the Internet/World Wide Web combination is widely hailed as a
   new, powerful engine of global social and economic change, there has
   been very little sociological theorizing and even less sociological
   research on the globalization of the Internet. Using classical
   macrosocial theories of development as a springboard, we hypothesize
   that the level of development, political openness/democracy, mass
   education, the presence of a sizeable tertiary/services sector, and
   interactions between some of these variables will drive the Internet's
   growth and spread around the globe. In our cross-national analysis of
   approximately 74 developed and developing countries, we find that
   Internet capacity is not in fact a simple linear function of economic
   and political development, but rather has been driven by complex
   interactions that could aptly be termed "post-industrialism." Uncovering
   some of these structural preconditions and determinants of Internet
   diffusion provides a first step toward providing a theoretical and
   empirical sociology of this "third technological revolution." (C) 2002

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Postmodern social theory is often seen as entirely distinct from and
   even antagonistic to modem sociological thought. This article endeavors
   to challenge this framing by tracing the emergence of postmodernist
   social thought to a historical development in Western societies
   intimately tied to the conditions of emergence of modern sociology, that
   is, to the crisis of the loss of the sacred for the modern intellectual
   class. Postmodern theory is linked to two Purportedly opposed schools of
   modern social thought, Durkheimianism ami Bergsonianism by demonstrating
   the careful concern in each of these strands for a renovation of the
   sacred in the wake of the devastating effects Enlightenment and
   materialist thought had on traditional modes of the sacred for
   intellectuals (if not for larger segments of Western societies).
   Explicit textual evidence of this influence is also examined.</td>

   classroom setting. We then apply the theoretical concept of emotion
   management to teaching methods, considering ways that teachers can
   structure the course to best manage and utilize emotions in the
   classroom. A collection of emotion management strategies and exercises,

   content and instructional materials, they have failed. I argue that a
   new approach is necessary, one that focuses on improving high school
   sociology teacher training. Professional associations and academic
   departments must both contribute to efforts to improve the formal
   sociological education and professionalization of high school teachers
   of the discipline. Improving teacher training is the best way to enhance
   the quality of secondary sociology courses, and may also help rectify
   the discipline's distorted public image as high school students gain a
   more accurate appreciation and understanding of fundamental sociological
   insights from their better trained teachers.</td>

   the meaning and value of the sociological imagination. While this task
   is daunting under typical circumstances, it is more difficult when
   instructors are committed to raising students' critical awareness of
   social conventions that maintain systems of racial oppression. In this
   paper, we discuss our experiences with teaching this aspect of the
   sociological imagination to a group of ethnically and economically
   privileged students. Based upon our experiences and existing research,
   we propose that a rise in students' political conservatism and their
   adoption of color-blind racism may explain our students' recalcitrance
   and the increasing reports of resistance from those who teach race and
   inequality courses. We provide details of an assignment that eased
   students' recalcitrance by enabling them to demonstrate to themselves
   the fallacies of scientific racism. The assignment, a critical
   assessment of Rushton's scathing review of "Gould's Mismeasure of Man, "
   required students to exercise their sociological imagination to
   successfully unmask the agendas, fallacies, and consequences of
   "scientific racism." Quotes from the students' assignments and the
   course evaluations show that the assignment conveys to recalcitrant
   students the utility of sociological analysis.</td>

   histories portray different strategies of organizing associations and
   adapting themselves to state control, societal conditions and members'
   interests. A disciplinary model was the most prevalent organizing
   strategy, but its viability ebbed and flowed with political oppression,
   the state of sociology as a discipline and internal associational
   conditions such as disciplinary composition and dissension. Two of the
   seven associations have survived continuously since being founded, while
   the other five have perished and been reborn from one to five times.
   Political oppression and internal associational dissension are what are
   mainly responsible for these associational deaths; for the state of
   sociology and its place in the academy for rebirths; and for the
   organizational cooptation of member interests for associational survival
   and growth.</td>

   lifetime. Championed by reputational entrepreneurs, reputations emerge
   from competitive fields of interpretive possibilities. The purification
   of Pete Seeger's image, from vilified Communist to national hero, lets
   us study both reputational change and the relationship between art and
   politics. An objectivist model suggests that reputations simply reflect
   truth. An ideological model claims that Seeger's redemption is shaped by
   a biased media. Neither sufficiently explains the competitive nature of
   reputational politics. Our constructionist model takes into account both
   the role of reputational entrepreneurs and the structural constraints
   they face. We chart Seeger's reputation through four historical periods:
   recognition among his peers on the Left (1940s), ruin in the McCarthy
   period (1950-62), renown among sympathetic subcultures (1960s), and
   institutionalization as a cultural icon. While it has clear advantages,
   institutionalization can also have a dampening effect on an artist's
   oppositional potency.</td>

   concentration within major urban areas. Los Angeles and New York City
   are two of the most important immigrant meccas today. Recent studies of
   immigrant adaptation within these cities have emphasized material
   factors at the expense of cultural considerations. This paper adopts a
   comparative perspective to demonstrate extreme differences in the
   symbolic construction of identity vis-a-vis immigrants in these two
   urban areas. Using The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times as
   indicators of elite cultural orientations, a content analysis is
   performed. The results demonstrate the social construction of an
   exclusive "threat" narrative in Southern California, and an inclusive
   "immigrant as victim" narrative in the New York metropolitan area. I
   argue that this extreme variation in cultural orientations must be
   understood as the result of divergent material and symbolic contexts. In
   order to demonstrate the importance of cultural factors, this paper
   focuses on symbolic differences between these areas and the influence
   these differences have on the political process of inclusion/exclusion.</td>

   away from mainstream sociology, to the detriment of both. For
   sociologists working in this field, application of Max Weber's political
   sociology is proposed as one way to reconnect their research with
   longstanding concerns of the discipline. Weber's political sociology
   contains a conflict model focusing on structured inequalities of class,
   status, and power. Its relevance to both contemporary sociology and
   sociological disaster studies is illustrated through a reexamination of
   one of the early classic studies of disaster. The paper concludes with
   an overview of Weber's thoughts about the role of values in research and
   a brief comparison of Weber's political sociology with alternative
   theories.</td>

   religiousness are a product of differential socialization. Yet, there is
   little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the
   literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the
   relationship between differential socialization and differential
   religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World
   Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between
   traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs
   and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the
   two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model
   involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new
   approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being
   irreligious constitutes risk-taking behavior. This model is able to
   predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and
   cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the most widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been
   how to interpret patterns of family change in the United States during
   the past four decades. Much of these debates focus on a thesis advanced
   by a number of scholars and political activists-that such features of
   family structure as high divorce rates and an increasing proportion of
   single-parent families have led to the decline of the family. Although
   past research has examined the causes and historical trends involved in
   family change, scholars have neglected important questions about family
   attitudes that have been raised in recent debates. Have levels of public
   concerti with family decline increased over time? If so, what are the
   sources of these attitudes? And have changing levels of public concerti
   with family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage?
   This study applies a theory of religious influence to answer these
   questions. Results show that public concern with family decline
   increased steadily after 1980, leading to a new and increasingly large
   cleavage in presidential elections. The analyses also find that high
   levels of concern with family decline are concentrated among evangelical
   Protestants who attend church regularly. In addition to extending
   sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions,
   these results bear productively on theory and research in political
   sociology and the sociology of religion. I discuss their relevance to
   long-standing debates over political trends among evangelical
   Protestants and the influence of Christian Right movement organizations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The recent literature on immigrant transnationalism points to an
   alternative form of economic adaptation of foreign minorities in
   advanced societies that is based on the mobilization of their
   cross-country social networks, Case studies have noted the phenomenon's
   potential significance for immigrant integration into receiving
   countries and for the economic development in countries of origin.
   Despite their suggestive character, these studies consistently sample on
   the dependent variable (transnationalism), failing to establish the
   empirical existence of these activities beyond a few descriptive
   examples and their possible determinants. These issues are addressed
   using a survey designed explicitly for this purpose and conducted among
   selected Latin immigrant groups in the United States. Although immigrant
   transnationalism has received little attention in the mainstream
   sociological literature so far, it has the potential of altering the
   character of the new ethnic Communities spawned by contemporary
   immigration. The empirical existence of transnationalism is examined on
   the basis of discriminant functions of migrant characteristics, and the
   relative probabilities of engaging in these kinds of activities is
   established based on hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications
   for the sociology of immigration as well as for broader sociological
   theories of the economy are discussed.</td>

   internships to research projects and field trips, The questions include:
   Among the goals of the project, are there primary and secondary goals or
   are the goals given equal weight? Is participation in the project
   mandatory or voluntary? Should the CBL component of a course be
   concentrated in one site or dispersed across many sites? How similar or
   different should each student's individual participation in the project
   be? How central should direct client/community interaction be to
   students' activities? Based on a review of the CBL literature in
   Sociology and feedback from the students and partner organization in our
   own CBL project, we discuss each question and outline some of the
   advantages and disadvantages of various decisions, focusing on the
   competing interests of students, instructors, and partner organizations.
   The aim is not to advocate one kind of project or design over another
   but rather to help other project planners anticipate and avoid pitfalls
   noted in the literature and maximize the benefits of CBL.</td>

   systematically compares the outcomes from two groups of students, one of
   which was involved in relatively unstructured community work and the
   other in a structured service learning assignment and examines the
   benefits experienced from this transformation. Although adding the
   structure necessary to accomplish effective service learning involved
   careful preliminary reflection, planning, and coordination, the study
   suggests that the service learning approach enhances students'
   development of a sociological orientation and understanding of
   structural linkages to poverty. It also indicates that students involved
   in structured service learning may better master course materials than
   students involved In less-structured community work, as measured by
   objective examination. Finally, the study supports earlier claims
   reported in the literature that service learning might be a particularly
   effective way of improving the efficacy of introductory sociology
   courses.</td>

   loops, market and political arenas can develop symbiotically into
   relatively coherent "fields" that gradually embed actors' orientations
   and activities. Using these insights, this article develops and tests a
   theory of European integration focusing on the case of the European
   Community, the first pillar of the European Union. Traders, organized
   interests, courts, and the EC's policy-making organs, over time, have
   produced a self- sustaining causal system that has driven the
   construction of the European market and polity. The generality of this
   explanation to a sociology of markets and polity-building projects is

   demonstrating the existence of competing explanations for the question
   of why abusive relationships continue. I find that a certain kind of
   explanation, multiple victimization arguments that emphasize the
   numerous ways battered women are victimized, are most common. Through an
   analysis of social science citations, news papers, and legislative and
   judicial decisions, I conclude that one multiple victimization argument
   in particular Lenore Walker's battered woman svndrome (Walker, 1979, The
   Battered Woman. New York: Harper Row; Walker, 1984, The Battered Woman
   Syndrome. New York: Springer), has become the most recognized
   explanation for why abusive relationships continue. The syndrome was
   best able to meet the criteria necessary, for gaining cultural
   authority, put forth by, Schudson (1989, Theory, and Society,
   18:153180): retrievability, rhetorical force, resonance, resolution, and
   institutional retention. In recent,ears, however this authority, has
   been threatened as social and cultural conditions have changed, leaving
   competing understandings of the domestic violence issue to challenge
   Walker's claims.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Are the politics of economic regulation contingent on institutions?
   Drawing on arguments about institutional mediation and the institutional
   bases of rational action, we explore how institutions shape the dynamics
   invoked in two theories of regulation. We argue that institutional
   arrangements affect both the clarity and the content of group interests
   in regulation. Event history analyses of U.S.. states' passage of fire
   insurance regulation from 1906 to 1930 support these arguments in
   several ways. Market-heterogeneity dynamics specified by cartel-capture
   theory affected the passage of regulation only under some
   conditions-namely, relatively depoliticized settings with little overt
   conflict or uncertainty about policy outcomes. In addition, interest
   group dynamics were conditioned by the consolidation of
   interorganizational fields around a particular model of market order,
   which allowed divergent interest groups to converge in support of
   regulation. The research suggests ways of thinking about theoretical
   generality and specificity, regulatory politics, and the relationship
   between institutional theory and rationality.</td>

   possibility for resistance from a subordinate position? This paper aims
   to resolve these seemingly incompatible perspectives. By extending
   Randall Collins's interaction ritual theory, and synthesizing it with
   Norbert Wiley's model of the self this paper suggests how the emotional
   dynamics between people and within the self can explain social inertia
   as well as the possibility for resistance and change. Diverging from
   literature on the sociology of emotions that has been concerned with
   individual emotional processes, this paper considers the collective
   level in order to explore how movement action is motivated. The
   emotional dynamics of subordinate positioning that limit women's options
   in face-to-face interactions are examined, as are the social processes
   of developing feminist consciousness and a willingness to participate in
   resistance work. Pointing toward empirical applications, I conclude by
   suggesting conditions where resistance is likely.</td>

   isolated the social and political forces that account for the legality
   of this punishment. Racial or ethnic threat theories suggest that the
   death penalty will more likely be legal in jurisdictions with relatively
   large black or Hispanic populations. Economic threat explanations
   suggest that this punishment will be present in unequal areas.
   Jurisdictions with a more conservative public or a stronger
   law-and-order Republican party should be more likely to legalize the
   death penalty as well. After controlling for social disorganization,
   region, period, and violent crime, panel analyses suggest that minority
   presence and economic inequality enhance the likelihood of a legal death
   penalty. Conservative values and Republican strength in the legislature
   have equivalent effects. A supplemental time-to-event analysis supports
   these conclusions. The results suggest that a political approach has
   explanatory power because threat effects expressed through politics and
   effects that are directly political invariably account for decisions
   about the legality of capital punishment.</td>

   of their degree of consensus (the degree to which all group members
   agree) and their degree of "tightness" (the degree to which holding some
   belief implies holding or not holding other beliefs). Two theoretical
   claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal
   properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to
   produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of
   authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The
   clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as
   an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order
   translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs.
   These claims are tested with data on 44 naturally occurring communities.</td>

   dismissing such efforts use the standards of physics as grounds for
   their objection. Although recognizing that no natural science can serve

   includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather
   than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse
   data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number
   of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction
   as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability
   to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it
   and in its development. Other sciences are briefly cited as well, but

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among
   variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as
   interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response
   to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how
   simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but
   enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information,
   emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in
   collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly
   and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in
   revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide
   theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than
   the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the
   emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical
   model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a
   brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in
   computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs
   fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We
   then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social
   structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology
   has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new
   methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the
   papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social
   networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs
   are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological
   theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology,
   social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with
   a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological
   potential of this approach.</td>

   Administration reflect two interdependent trends that have emerged over
   the past two decades: an increased capability among corporations to
   shape public policy to benefit their narrow interests, and a marked
   decline in the efficacy of democratic forces to defend progressive
   environmental policy. This article theorizes key aspects of
   antienvironmental thought and practice-facets include scientific
   production, civil-political societal relations, interclass coalition
   building, procorporate propaganda, and domination of opposition-to
   demonstrate the existence of a coordinated countermovement. The theory
   is guided by a political sociology adapted from the method of Antonio
   Gramsci that comprehends policymaking in terms of material interests
   without reducing human agency to structural imperative. Evidence
   marshaled to support the theory is gathered from the antienvironmental
   literature, public relations product, and information on political and
   economic affiliations between and among antienvironmentalists and their
   organizations.</td>

   behavior and social movements, in the study of social groups and group
   dynamics, in the interaction of structure and agency, and in the study
   of the social constructions of group identity. Examples drawn from
   several sociology courses are used to illustrate how the "sociological"

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper examines the relationship between rural socialization and
   hunting participation. Assessments of the cultural significance of
   hunting as a "way of life" in rural areas echo traditional assertions of
   the importance of rurality, but do not consider the interplay between
   rural residence and other variables that affect hunting participation.
   Although previous research has demonstrated that rural residents are
   more likely to participate in hunting, as are males and those who are
   influenced by family, the interaction of these variables is poorly
   understood. A national survey used a socialization framework to explore
   the more specific conditions under which rural upbringings were
   associated with increased hunting participation. Rural upbringings
   fostered air increase in hunting primarily when the socialization
   relationship between agent and target was unlikely to do so and when
   participation was consistent with gender norms: rural males whose
   fathers did not hunt were more likely to hunt than urban males whose
   fathers did not. In no other cases did rural upbringings result in an
   increased propensity for hunting. Therefore we suggest that broad
   statements about the cultural significance of hunting to rural life be
   made more cautiously, with the effects of other variables taken into
   account.</td>

   addresses topics informal sociological models and the definition,

   standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary
   sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This
   demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many
   formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every
   scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and
   model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation
   of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment
   of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate,
   and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These
   studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that
   otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in
   particular, define and interpret social indicators.</td>

   sociologists. In an effort to generate greater domestic interest in the
   field, an examination of Max Weber's methodology and an update to his
   study of music is proposed. Fewer occupations or cultural projects are
   more social than making music, and the domestic sociological community's
   absence from the debate is deplorable given the dominant position our
   country possesses regarding musical production. Weber's Sociology of
   Music, which combines urban theory, class/labor theory, rationalization
   theory, and even climatic changes, is an excellent place to begin a
   thorough discussion of the social components of music. Our present
   understanding of cultural theories, urban theories, and Habermas's
   Communicative Action Theory can be employed to improve on Weber's
   theory; toward a new approach for the study of the sociology of music.</td>

   to 426 students taking Introduction to Sociology. We found that nearly

   unrelated to religious belief and practice, gender and race, educational
   performance and grade expectations, and end-of-semester pressures. These
   results are entirely consistent with Colin Campbell's theory of modern

   century, sociologists usually avoid acknowledging progress for fear of
   encouraging complacency about social problems. In four paradoxical ways,
   progress raises concern about social problems. The paradox of
   perfectionism is that optimistic beliefs in social perfectability
   highlight failures to achieve perfection and thereby foster pessimism.
   The paradox of proportion is that reducing large problems makes smaller
   problems seem relatively larger. The paradox of proliferation is that
   social progress encourages recognition of a larger number of problems.
   Finally, the paradox of paranoia is that progress fosters fears of
   social collapse. Sociologists need to consider the consequences of
   downplaying progress.</td>

   dogging discussion of federal civil rights legislation in the early
   1990s, this article highlights sociology's role in shaping employment
   law and shows how apparently technical legal arguments about allocating
   burdens of proof affect labor market resource allocation among the
   classes, races, and genders. Contrasting institutional-sociological with
   liberal-legal concepts of discrimination, the article shows why
   disparate impact theory has been the most sociological approach to Title
   VII enforcement. It also shows how disparate impact-a theory and method
   for establishing legally cognizable employment discrimination injurious
   to women and minorities-is, and is not, related to affirmative action-a
   policy encompassing a broad range of procedures intended to provide
   positive consideration to members of groups discriminated against in the
   past. Finally, a competing incentive framework is used to show that,
   although disparate impact creates some incentives for employers to adopt
   quota hiring, such incentives are counter-balanced by major incentives
   working against race- and gender-based quotas. Major counterincentives
   stem from disparate impact itself, from other aspects of equal
   employment law, and from organizational goals shaping business response
   to the legal environment.</td>

   history of sociological theory, its broadest purpose being to stimulate
   a dialogue among competing "narratives" that will reduce the

   dilemmas in contemporary society. This dialogical purpose provides a

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Critics of Visions in this symposium raise three general questions. The
   question of inclusiveness is addressed by linking pertinent criteria to
   the book's aims; that of justifying national traditions by reviewing
   pertinent evidence; and that of the viability of dialogue by arguing
   that responsive communication does not entail full agreement. A number
   of particular issues the critics raise are addressed by the book's
   arguments regarding the relation of the discipline of sociology to its
   philosophical background, the international setting of early sociology,
   Durkheim's individualism, Weber's distinction between naturalism and
   interpretability, Marx's treatment of Feuerbach and of nationalism, and
   the relation between power and knowledge. This response concludes by
   explicating the proposal that the time may be ripe to rejoin a number of
   the elements of Aristotelian social science that had been delegated to
   various national traditions of social theory in the modern era.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The strategies that Russian and American banks use to evaluate the
   creditworthiness of prospective credit card holders are compared.
   Drawing on Knight's theory of risk and uncertainty, the authors argue
   that uncertainty, inherent in any credit transaction, can only be
   reduced to measurable risk if there are institutions that create
   stability over time, categorize events properly, and allow for
   verification and accumulation of information. In the United States, the
   gradual evolution of institutions underpinning rational calculation
   permits the transformation of uncertainty into risk. In Russia, however,
   such institutions are absent, and a great degree of uncertainty prevails
   in consumer credit. Using data from original fieldwork in Moscow, this
   study demonstrates that when actors face uncertainty and are unable to
   calculate risk, they rely on trust. Russian banks use and extend their
   existing social ties, or in some cases build new ties. They also exploit
   cardholders' own networks, unrelated to the bank, to increase their
   accountability through anchoring. These strategies, however, keep the
   market embedded, limited in size, and uninsurable. The authors conclude
   that calculation of probabilities (and economic rationality in its
   formal sense) is not an innate human ability but a social capacity that
   exists courtesy of institutional arrangements.</td>

   violence. These methods, many of which include self-disclosure in the
   classroom, can break down the barriers between students and the social
   world. We explore the classroom management of student self-disclosure of
   sensitive topics drawing on our experiences teaching sociology at a
   large, urban university in which a number of students used their
   employment in the sex industry as springboards into class projects.
   Students' concerns with peer disapproval and the processes through which
   they disclosed their involvement in the sex industry raised several
   pedagogical and ethical issues that have not yet been addressed in the
   self-disclosure literature. We examine a number of difficulties with
   students disclosing information partially, either to teachers or to a
   few classmates, on classroom dynamics and teacher-student interactions.
   Finally, we evaluate a number of strategies, such as hidden involvement
   fictitious informant, and full disclosure, for managing self-disclosure
   in the sociology classroom, and we discuss additional steps that
   teachers can take to address sensitive topics in class.</td>

   work on the sociology of civilizations. His main concepts for
   civilizational analysis are located within the sociological tradition,
   in particular, the work of Durkheim, Mauss and their school and Max
   Weber. The article focuses especially on the historical, comparative and
   analytic value of Nelson's distinction among three types of structures
   of consciousness (sacro-magical, faith and rationalized structures),
   particularly the historical role of rationalized structures. It suggests
   how these concepts might be given both a fuller analytical
   differentiation and more detailed historical specification. The article
   emphasizes how intercivilizational encounters provide the settings for
   cultural innovations which serve as starting points for the later
   historical transformations of civilizations. Outcomes of civilizational
   encounters between Greece, Rome and Judaism in the Hellenistic era are
   given special attention. The article's main themes are illustrated
   throughout by reference to a variety of substantive issues and
   historical comparative civilizational contexts. These include the role
   of world religions, sciences, philosophies and other cultural forms in
   the ancient world, Western Europe, Russia and elsewhere.</td>

   increase sympathy for the least affluent and enhance support for
   redistributive policies, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   may have the opposite effect. After controlling for shifts in partisan
   control of the presidency, nonwhite presence, family incomes, and union
   strength, the results suggest that civil rights activity leads to
   redistributive tax codes, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   such as riots or crime reduce tax progressivity. Additional findings
   suggest that these relationships are contingent. The positive
   relationship between civil rights actions and redistributive tax
   policies is significantly stronger when Democrats control the
   presidency, but the negative relationship between riots and egalitarian
   taxation is enhanced during Republican administrations.</td>

   whether parents also chronometricalized their children's lives. Working
   with 206 advice-seeking letters written by fathers and mothers in the
   1920s and 1930s to nationally known educator and author Angelo Patri

   childhood," employ it in a multivariate analysis, and find that an urban
   environment heightened parents' tendencies toward chronometricity, while
   the financial strain of the Great Depression did just the opposite. Our
   results show how age can be viewed as a social construction, subject to
   the influence of ideology and economics, and that the scheduling of

   once a core concern of American sociology. Yet the extensive post-1965
   wave of immigration to the United States has done little to rekindle
   scholarly interest in this topic, even as politicians and other public
   figures advocate public policies to restrict immigration as a means of
   preventing crime. Although both popular accounts and sociological theory
   predict that immigration should increase crime in areas where immigrants
   settle, this study of Miami, El Paso, and San Diego neighborhoods shows
   that, controlling for other influences. immigration generally does not
   increase levels of homicide among Latinos and African Americans. Our
   results not only challenge stereotypes of the "criminal immigrant" but
   also the core criminological notion that immigration, as a social
   process. disorganizes communities and increases crime.</td>

   Regression results show that a number of life chance and social choice

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Medical sociology and public health share many of the same concerns in
   the study of social and cultural factors that affect the health of the
   population. Differences in theoretical approaches, methodological
   procedures, conceptualization and measurement, and research objectives,
   however, often serve to limit the potential for collaboration between
   the two disciplines. Sociologists possess many of the theoretical models
   and analytical techniques needed in public health for the study of the
   impact of socioeconomic status, poverty, inequality, differentials in
   power, and social and cultural differences on disease outcomes and
   health status. Although in the past, public health professionals were
   dependent primarily on the theoretical and analytical models offered by
   epidemiology and social psychology, current trends in public health
   research ha ve opened a wider variety of opportunities for sociologists
   to contribute to public health research. Public health has reached a
   crossroads that leads in two directions: a broad approach that addresses
   the sociocultural foundations of health and a more narrow approach
   focusing on more proximal risk factors such as individual lifestyles or
   health risk behaviors. This article presents a review of the factors
   that led to this crossroads in public health and offers suggestions as
   to how sociologists might take advantage of the opportunities afforded
   by the broader approach to public health that is gaining momentum among
   some public health practitioners. Medical sociologists are uniquely
   equipped to assist public health in recapturing its historical
   commitment to social justice in the maintenance of health for the entire
   population.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Managed care is prompting a large revision not only in the ways doctors
   are employed and paid but also in the essence of the relationship
   between doctors and patients. In medical sociology, a discipline with a
   long-standing focus on scrutinizing the role of both the physician and
   the patient, there has already been discussion of a shift from the
   doctor as more all knowing to a less dominant position vis-a-vis both
   the patient and delivery of care. Patients are aware of shifts that
   place physicians in an environment characterized by new roles and
   responsibilities, such as acting as a gatekeeper. Limitations on health
   care coverage and the rethinking of roles have led to a depiction of the
   patient as the consumer of care and the managed care plan's becoming the
   commercial enterprise from which a service is obtained. The model of the
   patient as consumer of medically related goods and services appears to
   be growing, as does a model of the physician as one who contracts for a
   specified range of services for specific patients. In this article,
   trends in and problems with contemporary managed care are raised. Calls
   for patients' rights legislation may be among the health trends of the
   new millennium.</td>

   implications for research in medical sociology in the new millennium.
   This study discusses the background and usage estimates of Internet
   technology and how this technology affects individuals gathering of
   health information. Potential consequences of this technology for
   patient-provider interactions are also examined, as are the implications
   of Internet communication for social support and health. Current
   measures of social support may be underestimating the effects of social
   support on health by not assessing the influence of support garnered
   through communications on the Internet. The Internet also presents a
   variety of new research venues that medical sociologists should pursue.
   Two of these possibilities-on line surveys and analysis of online
   communication and text-are discussed. Although the Internet is
   increasing research opportunities for medical sociologists, the fact
   that a digital divide still exists with regard to Internet access and
   use cannot be ignored.</td>

   determinants of health. The specific nature of this influence, however,
   is still a mystery. In the new millennium, racial and ethnic
   differentials in health are bound to become a major focus in medical
   sociology not only because of their persistence but also because of the
   demographic changes taking place in the United States. It is estimated
   that racial and ethnic minorities are expected to increase from the
   current level of 25 % of all Americans to 40 % by 2030 and that minority
   groups will make up more than hall of the U.S. population by 2050. Thus,
   overcoming health disparities attributable to race and ethnicity has
   become more urgent in ensuring good health for the nation. This article
   suggests that analyses of the health status of Latinos, the second
   largest minority group in the country, must attend to cultural factors.
   The need for a culture-specific approach to Latino health is
   indispensable to such discourses in medical sociology.</td>

   and why it is violent. Whereas my earlier work addresses the question of
   why collective violence is violent, here I apply and extend Donald
   Black's theory of partisanship to the question of why violence
   collectivizes. I propose in general that the collectivization of
   violence is a direct function of strong partisanship. Strong
   partisanship arises when third parries (1) support one side against the
   other and (2) are solidary among themselves. Such support occurs when
   third parties are socially close to one side and remote from the ther
   and when one side has more social status than the other Third parries
   are solidary M-hen they are intimate, culturally homogeneous. and
   interdependent. I focus in particular on lynching: Lynching is a joint
   function of strong partisanship toward the alleged victim and weak
   partisanship toward the alleged offender. Unequal strong partisanship
   appears in both classic lynchings (of outsiders) and communal lynchings
   (of insiders) across societies and history. Where partisanship is weak
   or strong on both sides, lynching is unlikely to occur. Evidence
   includes patterns of lynching in various tribal societies. the American

   significant differences between Ph.D.-granting and M.A.-granting
   programs in exam structures, though there is considerable consistency in
   exam structures within each type of department. in most Ph.D. and M.A.
   programs, there have been recent changes in the format, content or
   evaluation of exams. Ph.D. departments with higher rankings offer
   students more freedom in taking exams and report higher rates of
   successful completion. The substance of exams is quite diverse, both in
   terms of topic areas and readings within those areas, indicating little
   in the way of a sociological "canon" passed down to future professionals
   in the discipline.</td>

   telephone survey interview, however, laughter threatens standardization.
   Consequently, some survey research centers prohibit interviewers from
   laughing during the administration of surveys. The data for this study
   are recorded telephone interviews from one such survey research center.
   How interviewers handle the "laughter invitations" of respondents is
   analyzed Because these interviewers are not taught what to do when
   laughter occurs, they rely on their tacit knowledge, either accepting
   the invitation, declining it, or engaging in "pseudo-laughter":
   Interviewers most often decline or use a pseudo-laughing response.
   Laughter patterns in a survey research center that does nor prohibit
   interviewer laughter are examined for comparison, and generally much
   more reciprocation and laughter are observed. Respondent laughter
   exhibits a central tension in the telephone survey interview: How can
   interviewers maintain both standardization and an appropriately
   affiliative social relationship with respondents? The differential
   management of this tension is explored in terms of survey methodology,
   the sociology of (social) scientific knowledge, and the organization of
   talk in institutional settings.</td>

   place of the tourist in sociology. The sociology of tourists first
   focused on their economic, and then their physical and sociocultural
   impacts, in the stereotypical case of mass tourists of the metropolis
   visiting historical and peripheral locations. More recently, Graburn and
   Smith differentiated tourists by class, gender and lifestyle, and then
   by national origin. Tourism has come to be seen as a form of expressive
   and perhaps therapeutic culture comparable to art, play and leisure. The
   tourist as sight-seer was first castigated by snobbish social
   commentators, and then valorized as a seeker of authenticity by
   MacCannell, and as a easter of gazes by Urry. Cohen usefully examined
   the range of tourists' experiences and authenticities. In this special
   issue Lengkeek and Harrison re-examine tourist differentiations,
   authenticities and subjective experiences. Thorns and Perkins conjoin
   the notion of the tourist as sight-seer with that of physical performer,
   while Liebman Parrinello looks at the tourist as both embodied and as
   technologized.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The concept of sacrifice used to be a dominant theme in social
   scientific theorizing, but it is now so neglected that recent work
   speaks of the need for a "recovery" of sacrifice. Similarly,
   self-sacrifice in the service of family members, formerly seen as high
   virtue, is now often characterized as personality defect or
   self-defeating behavior. Neither self-sacrifice nor family love play a
   significant part in the prevailing family theories, grounded as they are
   in the assumption of self-interest and framed in the logic of
   utilitarian individualism and the rationalized marketplace. This
   "silence" is more ideologically based than reflective of family process.
   The absence of a language of sacrifice and love limits our ability to
   give voice to our experience, and the professional neglect of these
   concepts diminishes our understanding of the processes they name. Some
   recent work on sacrifice by scholars in other disciplines has
   implications for family theory. We draw from the disciplines of
   economics, history, philosophy, literature, sociology, and from life as
   lived by everyday people ill making the case that self-sacrifice is a
   powerful and essential part of social lift, generally, and family life
   in particular. It merits a more substantial place in contemporary
   theory. Some theoretical approaches compatible with self-sacrifice as
   principle and practice are offered..</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Trends and patterns of religious mobility have played a central role in
   theoretical controversies in the sociology of religion. Early
   examinations focused on how social status might motivate religious
   switching, and recently scholars have claimed that diminishing status
   differences between denominations have opened denominational boundaries
   and led to higher rates of religious mobility. Scholars working from
   rational actor perspectives have generated several hypotheses. First,
   human capital and adaptive preference theories suggest that switching
   will remain infrequent, and will tend to occur between similar
   denominations. Second, "strict church" perspectives argue that demanding
   sectarian denominations will have higher retention, and be more
   attractive destinations. Third, market niche perspectives argue that
   niche overlap will foster high rates of religious mobility. Finally,
   theories emphasizing normative constraints on religious choices suggest
   that quasi-ethnic religious groups will have a greater hold on members.
   This article examines trends and patterns of religious mobility in the
   U.S. between 1973 and 1998 using data from the General Social Surveys.
   Retention rates, distributions of original and destination affiliations,
   and mobility tables are compared across three periods, and four broad
   cohorts using log-multiplicative association models. I find some support
   for hypotheses generated by status theories, and for several
   propositions from rational actor theories, however the decline of
   denominationalism perspective is unsupported.</td>

   explanations for the often-documented association between size of place
   and urbanity traits and to raise the possibility that cultural factors,
   too often neglected in urban sociology, play an important role in this
   relationship. Using survey data from a sample ages 15-89, we compare
   four sets of respondents with different child/adult residential
   configurations: those who grew up in nonurban places and as adults live
   in nonurban places (locals), those who grew up in nonurban places but as
   adults reside in urban places (cosmopolitans), those who grew up in
   urban places and reside in urban places as adults (urbanites), and those
   reared in urban places but residing as adults in nonurban places
   (escapees). The sets are compared with respect to six different measures
   of urbanity-anonymity, tolerance, alienation, community social bonds,
   deviant behavior, and involvement in unconventional subcultures. Our
   results support the contention that size has an independent effect on
   urbanity, but Various structural theories generally fail to explain many
   aspects of the relationship. Instead, the views of Hummon (1990) about a
   shared culture of place are most consistent with our findings. We
   conclude by noting the kinds of contributions such a culturalist
   perspective can make to understanding the link between size of place and
   individual characteristics. (C) 2001 Academic Press.</td>

   from several intellectual traditions to suggest that economic conditions
   may affect civil society, which in turn may influence social tolerance.
   These ideas are explored, using multivariate analysis of pooled General
   Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994. The results suggest that the
   fabric of civil society and economic conditions may contribute somewhat
   to espoused tolerance. Greater economic security, together with the
   attitudes fostered by a vibrant civil society including greater trust
   and less anomia, appear to increase espoused social tolerance. Period
   effects and the effects of other demographic factors remain strongly
   related to expressions of tolerance. While alternative interpretations
   may be offered depending on whether the interaction terms, Year x
   Education or Cohort x Education, are included in the analysis, the high
   correlation between the two suggests that these interpretations cannot
   be seen as oppositional. Finally and most important, the analysis
   reveals many parallels between espoused racial and homosexual tolerance,
   suggesting a more generalizable model of social tolerance.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Fringe religions, often referred to as new religious movements (NRMs),
   or "cults," are a fascinating and theoretically insightful form of
   deviant behavior. For the most part, however, those who have studied
   deviant religions have identified themselves as sociologists of religion
   rather then deviance theorists, and their books and articles dealing
   with deviant religion have primarily been directed toward sociologists
   of religion. As a result, sociologists tend to reach religion as
   deviance in sociology of religion courses but not in deviance or social
   problems courses. The purpose of this paper is to highlight significant
   literature and important theoretical connections relevant to the
   teaching of deviant religions in deviance and social problems courses.
   Deviance conceptions and theory can be easily applied to the study of
   cults, and the result can be academically and intellectually stimulating
   to professor and student alike.</td>

   problems in the agricultural sciences at land-grant universities.
   Employing data from a 1995-1996 nationwide survey of land-grant
   agricultural scientists, I use multiple regression techniques to
   investigate the relative importance of 19 sources of influence on
   agricultural scientists engaged in six research areas:
   productionist-oriented, sustainable agriculture, environmental, basic,
   consumer-oriented, and rural community-oriented. The first objective of
   this paper is to revisit and assess many of Busch and Lacy's findings
   about the influences on land-grant agricultural scientists. I find that
   different types of land-grant research are influenced by distinct
   combinations of factors. The second major objective is to extend Busch
   and Lacy's work by spotlighting the significant influences on
   sustainable agriculture research. My multivariate findings show that
   this research appears to exhibit influences that reflect its dual
   productionist and environmental character.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>White-on-black violence was a fact of life in the Deep South during the
   decades straddling the turn of the century. Yet though the lynching of
   blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a
   relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex
   and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to
   reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate
   causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the
   analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into
   patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole.
   This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure
   of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930.
   Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of
   local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching
   histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel
   mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the
   analysis of discrete incidents.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interest in
   religion's special meaning-making function. At the same time, scholars
   have become increasingly sensitive to the fact that the meanings evoked
   by religious symbols, stories, and practices are not universally shared
   and that they vary by social context. To date, sociologists of religion
   interested in the problem of shared meaning have not employed methods
   that can bring together diverse religious meanings and social settings
   in the same research design. As a result, their work has produced few
   empirical generalizations upon which a long-term research agenda might
   be built. In other subdisciplines, such as cultural sociology,
   researchers have employed new quantitative methods that can empirically
   connect variations in cultural meanings to variations in social context.
   This article calls for importing these methodological advances into the
   sociological study of religious meaning.</td>

   sociology does not figure strongly in this tradition. Several
   influential accounts-such as those by Noel Annan, Philip Abrams, and
   Perry Anderson-exist to explain this fact. I examine these accounts and,
   while largely agreeing with the explanations, question whether we should
   accept the authors' conclusions. In particular, we need to ask whether
   England was so different from other countries in this respect. Moreover,
   even if sociology was weak in England, does this mean that the
   contribution of English social theory was also weak? What alternative
   traditions of social thought might exist? In examining the English case,
   we may get some insight not just into the "peculiarities of the English"
   but also into the way in which the history of sociology has come to be
   written and into some of the assumptions underlying the nature of
   sociology as a discipline.</td>

   of knowledge provides important insights into the role of conflict in an
   intellectual field, his microsociology is more problematic. In
   particular. Collins's micro theory ignores the fundamental importance of
   social interpretations. This leads him to use a vague and unproductive
   notion of emotions. Nevertheless, we can usefully apply Collins's
   findings to sociological theory itself As in philosophy we see the same
   competitive appropriation and elaboration of accumulated intellectual
   capital and the same struggle over the limited resources necessary to
   intellectual production, especially over what Collins calls the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For more than a decade, sociologists of religion have been debating the
   answer to a basic question: What is the relationship between religious
   pluralism and religious vitality? The old wisdom was that the
   relationship was negative, that pluralism undermines vitality. This view
   has been challenged by advocates of a supply-side model of religious
   vitality. They argue that the relationship is positive-that pluralism
   increases vitality-and this empirical claim has become foundational to
   the larger project of applying economic theory to religion. We review
   the relevant evidence and reach a straightforward conclusion: The
   empirical evidence does not support the claim that religious pluralism
   is positively associated with religious participation in any general
   sense. We discuss this conclusion's theoretical implications, and we
   identify potentially productive directions for future research on
   religious pluralism, church-state relations, and religious competition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The distinctive contribution of sociological social psychology cars be
   referred to as sociological miniaturism, a way of interpreting social
   processes and institutions that is microsociological more than it is
   psychological. We argue that social psychology of this variety permits
   the examination of large-scale social issues by means of investigation
   of small-scale social situations. The power of this approach to social
   life is that it permits recognition of the dense texture of everyday
   life, permits sociologists to understand more fully a substantive
   domain, and permits interpretive control. In the chapter we provide
   examples of this approach from two quite distinct theoretical
   orientations: symbolic interactionism and social exchange theory. We
   discuss the ways in which the study of two substantive topics, social
   power and collective identity, using these perspectives can be informed
   by closer collaboration between theorists within sociological social
   psychology. In the end it is our hope that pursuing such integrative
   theoretical and methodological efforts will produce a more complete
   understanding of important social phenomena. We offer sociological
   miniaturism as a promising vehicle for advancing the earlier call for
   greater mutual appreciation of and rapprochement between diverse lines
   of social psychological work in sociology.</td>

   courses dealing with race, class, gender, and sexual orientation. These
   include heightening student awareness of the issues and the dynamics of
   inequality. Bath outcomes initiate active engagement with the structures
   and institutions of society. Aii too often, however, apathy, cynicism,
   and helplessness characterize student responses to such courses. A
   solution to this problem is to structure an interdisciplinary course
   using not only a sociological paradigm, but also paradigms of English
   and art. This yearlong course develops the individual student's ability
   to recognize and generate a deep appreciation of multiple perspectives
   (including their own), and helps them acquire critical assessment
   skills. I recommend here an array of resources for teaching about
   resistance and change while establishing an understanding of the
   existence and causes of inequality in American society. Included in this
   battery of resources are readings, mainstream and alternative video
   media, Internet exchanges, student-produced videos, issue-oriented
   student writing, and class discussions.</td>

   anticipated or actual, calls for accountability. Consistency and
   inconsistency become issues when we attempt to hold self, or other,
   accountable.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Unlike older sciences such as physics and biology, sociology has never
   had a revolution. Modern sociology is still classical-largely
   psychological, teleological, and individualistic-and evert less
   scientific than classical sociology. But pure sociology is different: It
   predicts and explains the behavior of social life with its location and
   direction in social space-its geometry. Here I illustrate pure sociology
   with formulations about the behavior of ideas, ideas, including a theory
   of scienticity that predicts and explains the degree to which an idea is
   likely to be scientific (testable, general, simple, valid, and
   original). For example: Scienticity is a curvilinear function of social
   distance from the subject. This formulation explains numerous facts
   about the history and practice of science, such as why some sciences
   evolved earlier and faster than others and why so much sociology is so
   unscientific. Because scientific theory is the most scientific science,
   the theory of scienticity also implies a theory of theory and a
   methodology far the development of theory.</td>

   misattribute in a downward direction the level of formal education
   attained by women, even when the female faculty member is a full
   professor. The misattributions are linked to the imputed statuses
   "teacher" for women, and "professor" for men, regardless of the actual
   positions held or the credentials earned by faculty members and graduate
   student instructors. We suggest that a process of marginalization
   explains the empirical findings-a process that is attributed by others,

   incurred. Consequences for students and sociology professors are

   addresses how poverty information is packaged as the intersection of
   class, race, and gender, and how this depiction has changed from
   the;1980s to the early 1990s. I conducted a quantitative content
   analysis of the number of index citations and the location of poverty
   information they reference; the number and composition of poverty
   tables; and the number, type, and race/gender composition of
   illustrations of poverty. Newer textbooks reveal a racialized and
   genderized depiction of poverty which differentiates the topic of
   poverty from inequality topics. Instead of promoting the development of
   a multicultural perspective, the selective location of poverty
   information via ghettoization and topic context appears to counteract
   the impact of the inclusive content of that information. implications of
   and possible strategies for overcoming the conventional topic-chapter
   format of textbooks are discussed.</td>

   the central focus of recent discussions about pedagogical approaches to
   controversial topics. These discussions, while invaluable, fail to fully
   explore two issues.. first, the need for collective as well as
   individual strategies to deal with the problems generated by race
   relations courses; and second, the unique experiences of graduate
   students of color teaching this class at predominantly white
   universities. This paper offers a model for a collective strategy that
   departments can use to more effectively deal with problems associated
   with such courses. This model is provided by a year-long workshop
   organized by our department to analyze and address challenges posed by
   race relations classes. Our workshop was racially and ethnically
   diverse, allowing us a unique opportunity to deliberately explore the
   experiences of teachers of color. Drawing from this diversity, we
   develop a multidimensional analysis of the institutional and pedagogical
   constraints that create problems for race relations instructors, and we
   sketch a multidimensional approach to minimizing these problems.</td>

   most of these courses appear to emphasize reading and talking about
   teaching, rather than actually preparing to teach, in this seminar, by
   drawing on critical, feminist and humanist scholarship, the participants
   put ideas about pedagogy into practice. Each participant developed an
   undergraduate course from scratch, including a syllabus, assignments,
   lesson plans, assessments and a statement of teaching philosophy.
   Moreover, the seminar itself modeled many of the teaching techniques the
   participants might use in their own courses, including extensive peer
   review. Finally, by practicing the work habits of constancy and
   moderation from Advice for New Faculty Members: Nihil Nimus (Boice
   2000), the participants began to get more done in less time with less
   strain. The positive outcomes of this seminar suggest that this approach
   may be informative to faculty members designing or revising similar
   courses.</td>

   organizations through the mechanisms of enhanced collaboration,
   mitigated competition, and better information exchange. Moreover, these
   benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a
   cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among
   competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information
   culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by
   customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The
   first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the
   friendship-network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with
   performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a
   given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to
   dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved
   if a manager's competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the
   benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis
   examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows
   that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors.</td>

   food-processing transnational corporation (TNC) Archer Daniels Midland
   (ADM) and Asian-based firms. In an "economy and society" conceptual
   framework grounded in the sociology of agriculture and food, we
   investigate the powers and limits of TNCs in the global era. We argue
   that TNCs maintain significant powers which allow them to avoid the laws
   and regulations of nation-states. ADM was able to organize an illegal
   global cartel to control the world production and price of the feed
   supplement lysine. In addition, TNCs' actions in the global arena are
   limited by their inability to trust business partners and to organize
   and maintain systems of social control; these roles historically have
   been played by the nation-state. We conclude that despite their
   significant powers, TNCs' contradictory position in the global arena
   provides opportunities that can be used to democratize society.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research in urban sociology posits that the proliferation of
   female-headed families in American cities is a result of declining
   economic prospects due to profound changes in the structure of the urban
   economy. Meanwhile, macro-level theory and research in criminology
   suggest that an association exists between family structure and rates of
   lethal violence among juveniles. Given these two streams of sociological
   thought, there is good reason to expect that increases in juvenile
   homicide rates since 1970 may be due, in part, to changes in the
   structure of the economy and the family during the 1970 to 1990 period.
   However, the nexus between deindustrialization, female-headed families,
   and juvenile homicide has received little attention in extant research.
   The objective of the current study is to remedy this gap in the
   literature by bringing together ideas about deindustrialization and
   female headship in an attempt to explain city-lever changes in Black and
   White juvenile homicide rates between 1970 and 1990. In particular, the
   research investigates the hypothesis that a decline in the manufacturing
   base of cities increased rates of female headship and thereby indirectly
   raised homicide rates. Race differences in the hypothesized structural
   relationships also are examined.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Drawing on a social capital theoretical framework, I examine race,
   ethnic, and gender wage inequalities. Specifically, I extend past
   research by analyzing differences in the mobilization of different types
   of job contacts, what these types of contacts and their level of
   influence "buy" job seekers in the labor market, and the extent to which
   differences in social resources explain between-group variations in
   wages. Four aspects of job contacts are implicated: the race and gender
   of the job contact, the strength of the relationship between the job
   seeker and the job contact, and the job contact's influence. Employing
   the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, I find that white men are more
   likely to mobilize weak, white, male, and influential contacts, those
   contacts hypothesized to positively impact employment outcomes.
   Moreover, their greater mobilization of male and influential ties helps
   to explain a substantial part of their wage advantage over white women
   and Latinos. However, in many ways, their overall social resource
   advantage seems somewhat overstated. They reap no advantages over
   blacks, Latinos, and white women in their use of weak and white ties.
   Furthermore, results indicate that the benefits of social resources
   appear largely contingent on the social structural location of job
   seekers mobilizing them, less on any benefits inherent in different
   "types" of job contacts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article outlines an emotional achievement perspective for the study
   of emotions in social movements. Following Denzin's work on emotions, I
   consider emotions as self-feelings that are situated, interactional, and
   temporal in nature. The concept of emotions as achievement complements
   Hochschild's emotion management perspective. While management focuses on
   control, achievement emphasizes articulation and creativity. I argue
   that, although individuals may be compelled to suppress feelings in the
   organizational context, different social contexts and practices make it
   possible for individuals to pursue emotional fulfillment and
   self-realization. In social movements, the process of emotional
   achievement among participants unfolds as a process of mobilization. An
   analysis of the emotional dynamics of the 1989 Chinese student movement
   shows that emotions were inextricably intertwined with identities and
   action and that the emotional dynamics generated in this process
   significantly contributed to movement mobilization. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the theoretical contributions of the
   emotional achievement perspective.</td>

   actual circumstances of African American and white women in the
   nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States reveals the relationship
   between gender and economic and political development has been a dynamic
   historical one, culminating recently in a radical transformation of
   women's lives and work. I develop the implications of this argument for
   older analytic divisions between work and home, or productive and
   reproductive labor, and for recent shifts in theory. Coherent grasp of
   the events currently altering women's lives provides a clear way to join
   gender with earlier theoretical concerns, as another moment of social
   transformation brought about by a still-infolding process of economic
   and political development.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper introduces Niklas Luhmann's final,work, Die Gesellschaft der
   Gesellschaft (The Society of Society). According to Luhmann,
   sociologists have failed to produce even a partially adequate theory of
   society. Epistemological obstacles and humanist concerns for rationality
   and justice have prevented true progress in the discipline. With his
   "radically antihumanist, radically antiregional, and radically
   constructivistic " social system theory Luhmann intends to bring about a
   sociological enlightenment. Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft focuses on
   communication as the only genuinely social phenomenon. Social systems
   differentiate and evolve as they communicate in three separate
   dimensions: the social, temporal, and functional. The path of evolution
   results from a history of variation, selection, and restabilization
   within these discussions. Communication, bit by bit, produces social
   structures that, recursively, produce future structures. Society is
   communication. Sociology, as the science of society: is communication
   about how different societal systems operate, communicate, evolve, and
   maintain their boundaries.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although violence against women is an important topic for many sociology
   classes, teaching about it can be problematic. Students may see violence
   against women as an individual rather than social problem, may
   trivialize or blame victims, or may react defensively. In this paper, I
   present an approach to teaching about violence that addresses some of
   these difficulties. Students keep a one-day journal of their experiences
   of fear and use of safety strategies, and then analyze their findings
   both individually and in discussion with their classmates. This analysis
   helps students to see violence not simply as an individual experience,
   but as a form of social control that differently affects social groups.
   In this paper, I describe this exercise, illustrate its effectiveness
   using excerpts from students journals, and discuss the advantages and
   disadvantages of this pedagogical approach.</td>

   We offered an integrated service-learning option in a variety of
   sociology courses and assessed socio-demographic and other student
   characteristics to explore differences between participants and
   nonparticipants. We surveyed undergraduates (N = 413) from across the
   academic spectrum and enrolled in sociology courses at a large state
   university. The results contradict previous findings: we found
   heterogeneous participation in the service-learning project; no
   statistical association between prior and current service; commuter
   status and employment appear to influence student decisions to opt; and
   non-social science majors are more likely to participate than social
   science majors. Confirming previous studies, males are less likely to
   participate than females. Research in sociology shows strong support for
   service learning in passing on sociology. Results suggest students'
   other life demands should be taken into account when implementing a
   service-learning option.</td>

   ten upper-level sociology courses were used to examine the role of
   instructor likability/rapport on student perceptions of learning and
   ratings of overall teaching ability. The results suggest that students
   who rate their instructor high in likability reward that instructor with
   high ratings in overall reaching ability. However, high likability
   ratings are also associated with a decrease in student perceptions of
   learning. The negative effect of likability on perceived learning
   juxtaposed with its positive impact on global teacher ratings gives some
   credence to sociological critiques of student consumerism in higher
   education. Namely, when students approach college as customers, they
   expect to be entertained and served only in ways they find pleasing.
   Suggestions for more appropriate use of student evaluations of teaching
   (SETS) and their impact on how sociologists define teaching
   effectiveness are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Demographic transition theory posits that modernization, particularly in
   the form of urban industrialism, fundamentally alters the environmental
   context surrounding fertility decision-making, thereby reducing the
   advantages of having children. While fertility research has either
   questioned the link between modernization and fertility or attempted to
   provide the intervening links between the two, there has been, little
   theoretical or empirical refinement of the macrosocial/contextual
   principles of the theory. We argue that human ecology and evolutionary
   theory can help respecify and revitalize demographic transition theory.
   Our respecification produces a more logical account of fertility decline
   that emphasizes the influences of service economies and the social
   adaptations attendant on ethnic heterogeneity and preindustrial social
   complexity. Analyses of changes in total fertility rates in
   approximately 60 less-developed countries suggest: (I) general (if
   partially ambiguous) support for demographic transition theory, (2)
   confirmation of a robust effect of service-sector dominance on
   fertility, and (3) the importance of ethnic homogeneity and
   preindustrial social complexity to demographic transition.</td>

   frameworks employ the process of self-reflection to counter the
   reproduction of inequalities in ethnographic investigation. Although it
   is not a cure for this dilemma, we argue that researchers can be
   self-conscious about the ways in which they reproduce power in the
   course of their work; furthermore, sustained attention to these dynamics
   will enrich ethnographic accounts. We begin by outlining the diverse
   ways in which feminist ethnographers draw on standpoint epistemology to
   generate strong reflexive methodological strategies. Then we describe
   challenges posed by postmodern and postcolonial critics, and outline how
   feminists have contributed to these debates and have responded with
   innovative methodological strategies, especially in relation to
   self-reflexive techniques. In conclusion, we discuss how rural
   sociologists might incorporate these methodological insights into their
   ethnographic investigations.</td>

   narrative approach represents an epistemological shift and should force
   us to interrogate the crucial role played by narrative in the
   construction of reality. Affirmative action provides a perfect example,
   as sociologists actively define and construct what constitutes

   (1991) threefold commitment framework to deviance and social control.
   The central individual-level theories of deviance (differential
   association/social learning, opportunity, social control, and labeling)
   share the generic sociological goal of theorizing continuity in lines of
   action. This suggests the centrality of the concept of commitment, and
   in fact the concept is used throughout the study of deviance and social
   control. The threefold framework provides a superior conceptualization
   of commitment for the field of deviance. In addition, it integrates
   insights from the central deviance theories and directs attention to a
   wide variety of un- and underexplored directions for further research in
   deviance and social control. In addition, I briefly discuss broader
   implications of the commitment framework for other areas of inquiry,
   such as the study of social protest and the sociology of organizations.</td>

   that crowds occur within a larger social context. Mob sociology was
   diffused throughout the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s
   through a national civil disorder training program and a variety of
   police manuals and magazines. It is highly compatible with the escalated

   whether this research tradition has powerful tools for assessing
   causality. Yet, recent contributions make it clear that scholars are not
   in consensus with regard to the more basic: issue of which procedures
   and underlying logic are in fact used in small-N causal assessment.
   Focusing on the field of comparative-historical analysis, this article
   attempts to clarify these procedures and logic. Methods associated with
   three major strategies of small-N causal inference are examined: nominal
   comparison, ordinal comparison, and within-case analysis. The article
   argues that the use of these three strategies within particular small-N
   studies has led scholars to reach radically divergent conclusions about
   the logic of causal analysis in small-N research. One implication of
   this argument is that methodologists must sort our the interrelationship
   between strategies of causal inference before arriving at conclusions
   about the overall strengths and limitations of small-N analysis.</td>

   studying women and gender use in articles published in mainstream
   journals. The research is based on an analysis of 1,826 gender-content
   articles published between 1984 and 1993 in 15 major sociology journals.
   Specifically, we explore whether feminist-oriented articles use
   different types of data, data collection methods, and statistical
   techniques than other articles addressing women and gender. The
   relationship between the rank of an academic journal, author's sex, and
   type of research method is also examined. We find that a large majority
   of gender-content articles are based on secondary, quantitative data.
   When the first author is a man, articles are somewhat more likely to be
   based on secondary data and to use quantitative statistical techniques.
   In general, we find that feminist research in the discipline is based on
   a melange of methodological approaches, reflecting the contested nature
   of feminist epistemologies.</td>

   eliminate affirmative action using stare referendums, often engaging in
   misleading public campaigns. in this political atmosphere, the role of
   education is significant. For many of our students, introductory
   sociology may be one of the few courses in which they are exposed to
   serious academic discussions about affirmative action. We examine the
   extent to which sociology texts accurately present affirmative action
   policy in the United States using a sample of introductory texts
   published from 1994 through 1997. We critically examine whether material
   presented either confronts or contributes to widespread myths about
   affirmative action policy. We conclude by offering practical suggestions
   to strengthen affirmative action presentations in sociology texts,
   including drawing upon significant empirical and theoretical
   sociological literature about affirmative action too often ignored by
   textbook authors.</td>

   short-term experiential assignments reduce the logistical concerns

   analytical reflection, especially for instructors of smaller courses and
   for non-field trip activities, in large introductory lecture courses,
   additional steps to structure the reflection process can successfully
   alleviate many of the problems dealing with lack of analysis. Proper

   the undergraduate learning experience. The animated television series,
   The Simpsons, can be particularly effective for illustrating
   sociological themes and encouraging critical thinking among today's
   undergraduates. Borrowing from Mills (1959), The Simpsons complements
   teaching philosophies that stress applying the sociological imagination
   to the observation of everyday life. We have found that the show is an
   effective pedagogical tool for demonstrating sociological concepts and
   fostering students' understanding of the course material Students can
   relate to the show and by engaging them in critical discussions, The
   Simpsons is a valuable pedagogical resource to the sociology curriculum.
   The true indication of successful teaching is measured by the students'
   ability to grasp course material effectively, and then use that
   knowledge beyond the classroom. The Simpsons provides an excellent way
   To accomplish this goal.</td>

   new workers via employee referrals-provides key insights into the notion
   of social capital. Employers who use such hiring methods are
   quintessential "social capitalists," viewing workers' social connections
   as resources in which they can invest in order to gain economic returns
   in the form of better hiring outcomes. Identified are three ways through
   which such returns might be realized: the "richer pool," the "better
   match," and the "social enrichment" mechanisms. Using unique company
   data on the dollar costs of screening, hiring, and training, this
   article finds that the firm's investment in the social capital of its
   employees yields significant economic returns.</td>

   taste as a means to maintain social distance among different social
   classes, conflict with tastemaking practice in pluralistic societies
   where taste standards are no longer exclusively defined by a society's
   elite strata. To better account for the heterogeneity of tastemaking in
   modem societies, this article suggests a framework for analysis in which
   taste is considered as a collective interpretive activity that unfolds
   in distinct institutional contexts and is shaped by culturally available
   rhetorics of aesthetic judgment. Two conflicting but complementary
   rhetorics are identified: the rhetoric of refinement and the rhetoric of
   authenticity. Drawing on historical studies of taste, the role of
   institutional context for tastemaking is demonstrated. Taste in
   pluralistic society emerges in socially, politically and rhetorically
   contested institutional spaces where it is negotiated among a plurality
   of actors who have recourse to alternative rhetorics and
   classifications.</td>

   contributions to the social dimensions of shame by six sociologists
   (Georg Simmel, Charles Cooley Norbert Elias, Richard Sennett, Helen

   show that Cooley and Lynd, particularly, mane contributions to a theory
   of shame and the social bond Lewis's idea that shame arises from threats
   to the bond integrates the contributions of all six sociologists, and
   points to toward future research on emotion, conflict, and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Race has always been a significant sociological theme, from the founding
   of the held and the formulation of classical theoretical statements to
   the present. Since the nineteenth century, sociological perspectives on
   race have developed and changed, always reflecting shifts in large-scale
   political processes. In the classical period, colonialism and
   biologistic racism held sway. As the twentieth century dawned, sociology
   came to be dominated by US-based figures. DuBois and the Chicago School
   presented the first notable challenges to the field's racist
   assumptions. In the aftermath of World War II, with the destruction of
   European colonialism, the rise of the civil rights movement, and the
   surge in migration on a world scale, the sociology of race became a
   central topic. The field moved toward a more critical, more egalitarian
   awareness of race, focused particularly on the overcoming of prejudice
   and discrimination. Although the recognition of these problems increased
   and political reforms made some headway in combatting them, racial
   injustice and inequality were not surmounted. As the global and domestic
   politics of race entered a new period of crisis and uncertainty, so too
   has the field of sociology. To tackle the themes of race and racism once
   again in the new millennium, sociology must develop more effective
   racial theory. Racial formation approaches can offer a starting point
   here. The key tasks will be the formulation of a more adequate
   comparative historical sociology of race, the development of a deeper
   understanding of the micro-macro linkages that shape racial issues, and
   the recognition of the pervasiveness of racial politics in contemporary
   society. This is a challenging but also exciting agenda. The held must
   not shrink from addressing it.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The variant of new institutionalism that is our focus is a
   pan-disciplinary theory that asserts that actors pursue their interests
   by making choices within institutional constraints. We organize our
   review of the theory around its behavioral assumptions, the operation of
   institutional forms, and processes of institutional change. At each
   stage, we give particular attention to the potential contributions of
   sociology to the theory. The behavioral assumptions of the theory amount
   to bounded rationality and imply transaction costs, which, in the
   absence of institutions, may frustrate collective ends. The principle
   weakness of these behavioral assumptions is a failure to treat
   preferences as endogenous. We categorize the institutions that arise in
   response to transaction costs as to whether they are public or private
   in their source and centralized or decentralized in their making. In
   detailing the resulting categories of institutional forms, we identify
   key interdependencies across the public/private and
   centralized/decentralized dimensions. The new institutionalism is in
   particular need of better theory about private decentralized
   institutions, and theorists could turn to embeddedness theory and
   cognitive new-institutional theory as a source of help on this topic.
   The dominant view of institutional change is that it is evolutionary,
   driven by organizational competition, and framed by individual beliefs
   and shared understandings. Sociology can refine the change theory by
   adding better explanations of the behavior of organizations, and of the
   processes by which institutional alternatives come to be viewed as
   acceptable or unacceptable.</td>

   must adopt postmodern strategies to educate for survival. The
   metanarratives that served the modern age, such as "science" and

   that has not been studied in these textbooks is the topic of disability,
   in this research, 25 introductory sociology textbooks, published between
   1996 and 1998, are investigated to determine the portrayal of
   disability. Using content analysis, the authors examine these books for
   textual representation of disability and pictorial depiction of
   individuals with disabilities. Results indicate that introductory
   sociology textbooks provide a limited amount of information about
   disability. From the written material, two major themes are identified:
   disability as a defining social characteristic and disability as a basis
   for minority group membership. in addition, textbook photographs present
   a selective depiction of individuals with disabilities. Suggestions for
   providing a more comprehensive portrayal of individuals with
   disabilities are discussed.</td>

   four things in developmental stages: recognize basic concepts to
   cultivate sociological perspective, apply sociological concepts,
   interpretive frameworks, and analytical tools to real world problems
   (fostering greater commitment to life-long learning about one's
   community and the world at large), offer explanations extending one's
   own thinking, sensibly gather data to test those explanations (providing
   the tools for a culture of inquiry and evidence), and envision how
   sociology can be used for organizational effectiveness and improvement
   of community outcomes (empowering our students for lives of constructive
   involvement). A variety of assessment strategies are proving vital.
   Broad stakeholder input was used when clarifying program objectives.
   Deliberations about how to change our program are being stimulated by
   performance problems in internships and on major papers. We have learned
   that developmental goals are not readily achieved without changes
   throughout the program's curriculum, and implementation has been
   incremental, initial changes have increased the confidence of graduating
   seniors, and job placement has improved.</td>

   psychology that heretofore has been the exclusive domain of
   psychologists. Specifically, I develop a social structural perspective
   on the choice shifts make within groups. During interpersonal
   discussions of issues, choice shifts occur when there is a difference
   between group members' mean final opinion and their mean initial
   opinion. Explanations of choice shifts have emphasized group-level
   conditions (e.g., a norm, a decision rule, a pool of persuasive
   arguments, a distribution of initial opinions). I argue that choice
   shifts are a ubiquitous product of the inequalities of interpersonal
   influence that emerge during discussions of issues. Hence, I bring
   choice shifts squarely into the domain of a structural social psychology
   that attends to the composition of networks of interpersonal influence
   and into broader sociological perspectives concerned with the formation
   of status structures.</td>

   sociological explanations of social outcomes (from rational choice and
   economic theory, cognitive psychological theories of intelligence, and
   communitarian social philosophy), social theory should specify the
   constitutive force of social signification. After identifying a key
   weakness in theoretical approaches currently available in sociology, the
   inadequacy of various conceptions of the social, I analyze three
   significant new works in cultural studies in order to sketch out
   alternative ways of defining and measuring the force of social
   signification. The essay concludes with an attempt to establish the

   Immanuel Wallerstein and selected works by second-generation comparative

   extend our understanding of how religious institutions contribute to
   expanding democracy, but nearly all analyze religious institutions as
   institutions; few focus directly on what religion qua religion might
   contribute. This article strives to illuminate the impact of religious
   culture per se, extending recent work on religion and democratic life by
   a small group of social movement scholars trained also in the sociology
   of religion. In examining religion's democratic impact, an explicitly
   cultural analysis inspired by the new approach to political culture
   developed by historical sociologists and cultural analysts of democracy
   is used to show the power of this approach and to provide a fuller
   theoretical account of how cultural dynamics shape political outcomes.
   The article examines religious institutions as generators of religious
   culture, presents a theoretical model of how religious cultural elements
   are incorporated into social movements and so shape their internal
   political cultures, and discusses how this in turn shapes their impact
   in the public realm. This model is then applied to a key site of
   democratic struggle: four efforts to promote social justice among
   low-income urban residents of the United States, including the most
   widespread such effort-faith-based community organizing.</td>

   and cognitive factors, but neglect technologies of memory other than the

   the social and cultural patternings of public and personal memory, but
   neglect the ways in which those processes are constituted in part by

   acceptance of the concept of cultural pluralism (and its contemporary
   variant, multiculturalism) in popular and academic discourses today
   should be investigated as a problem in the sociology of knowledge. In
   this context, this article discusses briefly how cultural pluralism is
   used in popular and academic discourses today. Then, it identifies the
   normative structure of and the domain assumptions underpinning, the
   concept The article constructs an argument that the concept lacks
   conceptual precision and analytical rigor; that its ontological claims
   for race and ethnicity cannot be justified; and that it is
   epistemologically incoherent, as shown by its internal contradictions.
   The article concludes that the ideological implications of the concept
   should be investigated and that discourses on cultural pluralism,
   generally, would benefit by resurrecting Milton Gordon's concept of the
   eth-class.</td>

   argue that contemporary Hollywood movies are useful tools to illustrate
   some of our discipline's central concepts and to serve as an exercise in
   the application of the sociological imagination. Films, however, come
   prepackaged with a particular worldview or theoretical perspective.
   Thus, they require the sociologist to consider the theory-laden nature
   of movies as part of the analysis of social life that they depict. in
   order to do this, I analyze three groups of movies through the use of
   sociological concepts such as Griswold's "cultural diamond" and
   Jameson's ideology/utiopa distinction.</td>

   developmental process, and therefore, reacher training programs should
   incorporate a developmental model. We review existing theory and
   research on the development and training of graduate reaching assistants
   and apply this perspective to an individual teaching assistant training
   program at the University of Washington, a large research university.
   This training program was designed, and has been modified over the past
   20 years, to draw on current lines of thinking regarding teaching
   assistant training practices. Hence, it is organized around the
   developmental and cognitive issues facing new, and advanced graduate
   assistants. Using evaluative program data and feedback from those who
   have completed this training program, we elaborate upon the usefulness
   of a developmental approach for the preparation and Training of graduate
   assistants ii, sociology.</td>

   understanding so that we may More fruitfully tie this pedagogy to our
   field. A base for such grounding can be found in the work of C. Wright
   Mills, who built on the work of John Dewey, We argue that incorporating
   sociologically informed service learning into the curriculum is
   necessary for completing the progressive educational and social reforms
   sought by both, thus enabling us to fulfill Mills' "promise" for our
   discipline (Mills 1959). On the other hand, a sociologically uninformed
   service-learning experience may hinder, rather than help, the movement
   toward a just society because students may objectify community residents
   and blame them for their problems. Thus, we present potential problems
   associated with service-learning and argue for the concept of addressing
   key sociological insights prior to immersing students into a program of
   service-learning.</td>

   autobiography, and it examines the utility of using such a text. A
   survey evaluation of this approach reveals that students generally
   accept a multicultural approach to social psychology and feel that it

   the ontology of the social, to redefine the substance of collective
   representation, the principle of domination and the criteria for
   membership. Religious nationalism transforms the territorial
   nation-state into a vehicle in and by which to extend the materiality of
   its culturally specific categories, codes, values and narratives. It
   thereby challenges social theories, like that of Bourdieu, that
   deculturalize power, as well as those, like Alexander, that culturalize
   it in an institutionally restrictive manner. Religious nationalism is
   not a retreat to the premodern, but an effort to bound and energize the
   elemental modem moments, that of the self and the national-state.
   Religious nationalism represents the return to text, to the fixity of
   signs, the renarrativization of the nation in a cosmic context. It
   returns us to bodies and souls, a zone to be defended against things on
   the one side and beasts on the other. It offers a way to secure morality
   against an increasingly post-humanist world. Its discourse of difference
   seeks to bound the nation. Religious nationalism restores the binaries
   of inside and outside, us and them, good and evil, man and woman and
   centers them in sacred space.</td>

   analysis is based on five national surveys, 1992-1996, collected by the
   Sociology Institute of the now Czech Academy of Sciences. Net of
   controls, both Czech and Slovak rural respondents report more economic
   strain and unemployment, a difference that persists over the surveys.
   These experiences account for rural residents' greater economic anxiety,
   their fear of economic development and unemployment, which also persists
   over the surveys. These experiences and anxiety explain, in turn, their
   lower level of support for the reforms, and endorsement of a return to
   socialism and strong-hand government. Rural and urban respondents of the
   two countries have experienced the world differently since 1990, and
   this is expressed in their economic anxiety and political preferences.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent work in the sociology of professions highlights the central
   importance of abstract discourse in professionalization processes.
   Drawing on the work of Kenneth Burke, I argue that broadening the focus
   of analysis from "abstract discourse" to "narratives of expertise" will
   provide the ability to (1) more clearly analyze the social conditions
   that are conducive to the efficacy of abstraction as a basis for a claim
   of expertise and (2) theorize and empirically examine the formation and
   maintenance of a collective professional identity. To assist in the
   reformulation of professionalization studies around narratives of
   expertise, I develop a modified extension of Burke's five key terms of
   dramatism (act, agent, scene, agency, and purpose). Burke's pentadic
   scheme enables researchers to show how narratives of expertise ground
   jurisdictional claims and the constitution of professional identity in
   one of the elements of pentad. I illustrate the empirical power of the
   pentadic scheme through an examination of claims of psychotherapeutic
   expertise, particularly claims of marital and familial expertise.</td>

   science and sociology, it has been dramatically transformed. The
   intellectual diffusion of agency theory illustrates this process. Agency
   theory is a general model of social relations involving the delegation
   of authority, and generally resulting in problems of control, which has
   been applied to a broad range of substantive contexts. This paper
   analyzes applications of agency theory to state policy implementation in
   economics, political science, and sociology. After documenting
   variations in the theory across disciplinary contexts, the strengths and
   weaknesses of these different varieties of agency theory are assessed.
   Sociological versions of agency theory incorporating both broader
   microfoundations and richer models of social structure, are in many
   respects the most promising. This type of agency theory illustrates the
   potential of art emerging sociological version of rational choice
   theory.</td>

   conditions explain subsequent shifts in total spending on jails and
   prisons. Increases in the political strength of the the Republican
   Party, past breakdowns in the family, and growth in the tax base lead to
   greater spending on correct-ions as well, but neither unemployment nor

   the organizational and institutional forces that shape positions on
   risk, safety and risk as dynamic properties of social systems, and the
   social forces that create and allocate risk. In particular, sociologists
   need to place more emphasis on exploring the roles played by
   organizations and the state in hazard production and on formulating a

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is a contribution to the uses of life histories and the
   dialogue regarding the "standards" for their use. Through a
   meta-analysis of life histories in the United States since the
   publication of the Polish Peasant. we develop a typology to critically
   evaluate their methodological/theoretical practices in sociology. We
   find a broad range of uses of life histories in the areas of substantive
   focus, analysis, relationship of oral history and the subject,
   relationship of oral/life history to other materials, purpose of the re
   search, and relationship of oral/life history to other phenomena. We
   conclude that life history methods have not had the transformative
   effect on sociology that they have had in other disciplines. By and
   large, the actual production of life histories continues to be
   ahistorical, to be characterized by abstract empiricism, to extinguish
   subjects, and to ignore the link between biography and history.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The enduring effects of an individual's birth order have been subject to
   a long and lively debate in sociology and other disciplines. Recently,
   in response to Sulloway's (1996) Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family
   Dynamics, and Creative Lives, interest has increased in the possible
   effects of birth order on social attitudes. Using quantitative,
   historical data, Sulloway found that birth order is a better predictor
   of social attitudes than is gender, class, or race. His novel,
   evolutionary theory asserts the universal influence of birth order
   across eras and cultures. We use contemporary data to test Sulloway's
   contention that firstborn adults are more conservative, supportive of
   authority, and "tough-minded" than laterborns. Examining 24 measures of
   social attitudes from the General Social Survey (GSS), we find no
   support for these claims, either in terms of significant effects or even
   the direction of nonsignificant coefficients. An expanded inquiry using
   all (202) relevant attitudinal items on the GSS yields similar results.
   In our analysis, variables discounted by Sulloway-gender, race, social
   class, and family size-are all linked to social attitudes more strongly
   than is birth order: Our findings suggest that birth-order theories may
   be better conceptualized in terms of modest effects in limited domains
   and in specific societies.</td>

   effects of computer multimedia in four large lecture classes. Graduate
   instructors and students responded in focus groups to multimedia
   technologies with consistent themes, including enhancement of cognitive
   strategies (note taking and organization of ideas) and motivation.
   However, students also expressed distancing from the instructor. Surveys
   of the same student groups and a journal kept by the course professor
   reflected similar themes. Student achievement outcomes (pre- and
   posttest scores) showed no differences across two classroom applications
   of multimedia presentations: static and dynamic. Sociology instructors
   should consider adopting more complex computer multimedia in light of
   balancing interests: (1) resource scarcity in education and (2) few
   direct demonstrable effects of media on objective measures of student
   test outcomes in this and other research. However, our participants
   consistently cite considerable enhancement of students' cognitive skills
   and motivations (especially note taking and student interest levels),
   and our instructors endorse the positive effects of multimedia
   development on the process of reworking and rethinking their course
   curricula and materials.</td>

   promotes active learning as students apply sociological ideas to explain
   empirical reality. Using heavy metal music as an example, I present a
   two-part model for integrating a cultural analysis of this music and its
   subculture into the introductory course. Students first conduct a
   sociologically grounded cultural analysis of heavy metal music. Then
   they expand this analysis during the rest of the course by applying new
   concepts, theories, and research to explain this cultural object
   sociologically The article's final section discusses the application of
   this model in a range of class contexts and provides student responses
   to its use in an introductory sociology course.</td>

   systems is a potentially fruitful one in both political science and
   sociology. Existing attempts to measure constraint, however, have had
   severe drawbacks, both conceptual and methodological. This paper argues
   that this constraint is better conceived of as the absence of dispersion
   in a table of cross-classified beliefs and demonstrates that measures
   based on this conception are better at discerning the presence of
   constraint where it is quite likely to exist, namely, in small,
   ideologically focused groups. The approach to constraint outlined here
   has a number of other advantages: it is equally appropriate to interval,
   ordinal, or nominal data; it does not require external criteria of what
   responses should be associated with others; it is not
   variance-dependent; it does not assume that constraint is equivalent to
   either reduced dimensionality or pairwise association; and it is equally
   appropriate for mass and nonmass belief systems. It is also simple to
   conduct tests of significance difference across populations. Finally,
   this paper outlines the proper way to standardize such measures, which
   applies to other uses of the entropy measure, such as the quantification
   of income inequality. (C) 1999 Academic Press.</td>

   sociology further from the reaches of the broader public, diminishing
   its long-standing tradition of addressing public issues. Re-establishing

   appreciating its strengths without overlooking its unjust and injurious
   aspects. That experience shapes my answer to the question "Saving
   Sociology?" If there is anything in sociology that I would like to
   save-in both senses "to keep" and "to rescue"-it is sociology as a
   critical, reflective discipline, a discipline that not only studies
   society but also contributes to its change. As the contemporary world
   moves toward a "global" society, we are increasingly facing the dilemmas
   of multiculturalism. Sociologists often investigate other societies or
   (like myself) look back at their own from a spatial and cultural
   distance. This situation has created a dilemma for many scholars: Should
   we criticize problems stemming from "indigenous" beliefs and practices
   of other societies? Cultural relativism argues that different cultures
   provide indigenous answers to their social problems that should be
   judged in their own context. While this approach correctly encourages us
   to avoid ethnocentrism, it has led to inaction towards the suffering of
   oppressed groups. Reflecting on the relativist approach to sexual
   dominance, I question some cultural relativist assumptions. Discussing
   how "indigenous" responses to male domination in many cases disguise and
   protect that domination, I will challenge the "localist" approach of
   relativism and argue for a universalist approach.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>What is the value-added character of sociology? In an era of change and
   unease in higher education, can a case be made for sociology in terms of
   intellectual and scholarly substance rather than in terms of
   bureaucratic and political considerations? As a scholarly and
   instructional activity, what is the value of sociology beyond what other
   disciplines have to offer? I address these questions affirmatively in
   this paper by identifying and elaborating four distinctive foci of the
   sociological eye that together frame the window onto the world that
   sociology provides. These distinctive features are a focus on the
   relational connections among the constituent elements of the objects of
   sociological analysis; a focus on the socially contextual embeddedness
   of those objects of analysis; a focus on vexing social conditions and
   processes construed as social problems; and an ironic perspective, that
   is, a penchant for discerning and illuminating the incongruous,
   unexpected, discrepant aspects of social life. I argue that these foci
   are more pronounced in sociology than in other social sciences and that
   together they congeal into a window onto the social world that is unique
   among the social sciences and humanities, thus accounting for the
   value-added character of sociology.</td>

   short account of my own involvement in ARS, I give a brief rendition of
   what sociology as a field has been during the past quarter century-that
   is, what was "out there" to be reflected in the pages of ARS. I lay out
   some statistics on trends in the size, countries, and universities
   represented, coauthorship patterns, and gender ratios in ARS. These
   statistics are very informative but contain few surprises. Next I trace
   and analyze an issue that has commmanded the attention of editors of ARS
   throughout its history-unity or diversity of sociology as a discipline.
   Finally I conclude that the ARS does indeed reflect the field in ways
   that can be documented, but that this process of reflection is subject
   to many imprecisions generated by the editorial process itself.</td>

   form of an interesting idea that draws the mind onward. It begins by
   examining the linguistic style of aphorisms, their reconceptions of
   experience from deceptive surfaces to more fundamental truths, their
   psychological and social effects on the vanity and status of their
   creators and conveyers, and the decline of their conceptual charisma
   into cliche until a surprising modification restarts the aphorism-cliche
   cycle. The investigation of aphorisms broadens to their intellectual and
   cultural contexts by examining their expansion into articles and
   collection into books, the different aspects of a topic revealed by
   aphoristic perspectives and scientific sequences, and the similarities
   (and differences) between aphoristic and postmodern ways of knowing.
   This article ends with a series of aphorisms on the cognitive substance
   of alluring knowledge, which distinguish some of the components of

   sport psychological imaginations. In order to effect this rapprochement,
   some serious adjustments to the ways in which many applied sport
   psychologists and spore sociologists think about and conduct research
   are required. Thus, the initial part of this article expresses some
   critiques, albeit brief, of current tendencies within both sport
   sociology and sport psychology. We deemed these critiques necessary to
   advance a neo-Millsian position on the articulation of social structure
   and personality. This neo-Millsian position draws on the
   ego-psychoanalytical tradition to offer suggestions for how we might
   reconceive the problems of indispensability/expendability in the
   Prolympic structures of sport and for how we might, using a
   life-histories (biographical) methodology, engage in useful or practical
   research, especially on the problematics of how individuals
   handle/mishandle early, pre-career, and mid-career failure, and, in the
   long-run, inevitable failure at the end of their careers. Where, then,
   is the common ground between sport sociology and sport psychology? We
   argue that it is the analysis of ego-practices and ego-defenses as
   learned, consciously or unconsciously, over our biographical lives as
   they intersect with, and are contoured by, social history and social
   structure.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper examines the professional socialization of undergraduate
   sociology majors with a focus on research training. The first section of
   the paper argues that strong professional socialization requires a
   cumulative curriculum that provides students with a solid set of
   research skills designed to build the sociological imagination. Next,
   the paper presents data that explore the structuring of research
   training in the undergraduate major nationwide and the extent to which
   this training follows recommendations on "study in-depth" within our
   discipline. Finally, a case study is presented that illustrates how to
   integrate research training throughout a cumulative curriculum in
   undergraduate sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study examines how the peer review process influences the writing
   and publication of sociology textbooks and the teaching of sociology.
   The research analyzes reviewers' comments regarding a recently published
   text and compares them with peer review patterns observed by other
   authors and editors over the past decade. The results show that peer
   review affects sociology texts in at least five ways: (1) degree of
   innovation, including the book's focus, organization, and content, (2)
   length, (3) reading level, (4) ancillaries and accessories, and (5) the
   marketing strategies that will be used by publishers to "sell" the book.
   The findings suggest that, although the peer review process generally
   provides authors and editors with beneficial ideas for the resulting
   book, it compounds other problems.</td>

   activities? This field study of Vermont and Quebec maple syrup producers
   and their households and enterprises examines the diversity of
   motivations and concerns in contemporary maple syrup production.
   Farmers, former farmers, and non-farmers all produce maple syrup. The
   concept of embeddedness provides a framework for understanding how
   producers understand their involvement with maple syrup, by highlighting
   the social and cultural context of economic action. An embeddedness
   perspective emphasizes how other work activities, household relations,
   the surrounding community, and the resource environment shape the
   possibilities for and understandings of minor resource production
   activities. Maple syrup generally only supplemented the household income
   of the 76 producers interviewed. Producers articulated a cultural
   economy of syrup production centered on its contribution to overall
   livelihood, cultural identity, and lifestyle. Reasons included managing
   risks, making seasonal use of land and labor resources, developing a
   retirement income, demonstrating a rural, agrarian identity, and
   strengthening family and community ties. Implications for policy include
   the place of minor resource production activities in securing rural
   livelihoods and providing cultural anchors in rural regions experiencing
   demographic and economic change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Typically, using data from a nonexperimental study, quantitative
   sociologists model one or more outcomes as a function of independent
   variables, interpreting the resulting parameter estimates as effects.
   This article compares the usual approach to causal inference in
   sociology with an alternative approach that builds explicitly on a
   counterfactual account of causation. The comparison is relevant because
   sociologists typically interpret (incorrectly) parameter estimates
   obtained using the first approach as supporting causal statements that
   are counterfactual. To make matters concrete, the author reconsiders an
   attainment model of Featherman and Hauser, who are interested in
   comparing the effects of family background on achievement, by sex and
   time. This analysis suggests the coefficients in the regressions of
   respondent's education and occupational status on background should not
   be interpreted as effects. However because a child's sex is determined
   without regard for his or her subsequent achievements, sex may be viewed
   as randomly assigned, justifying treating sex as the cause and the
   background variables as covariates. Unfortunately, the way in,which the
   data were collected preclude such a treatment.</td>

   Husserl's notion of eidetic science. This thesis is demonstrated by the
   corroboration of Simmel's revision of neo-kantian epistemology for
   sociology with Husserl's phenomenology, and the parallel discussion of
   Simmel and Husserl concerning cognitive levels and exact and

   exemplar of his eidetic insights. An important consequence of this
   demonstration is the vindication establishing the scientific legitimacy
   of Simmel's methodology regarding the sociology of the forms of
   association. Woven throughout is discussion concerning the doctrine of
   the complementarity of eidetic and empirical science. Simmel's
   methodology is shown to have been ahead of its time through conjoining
   these two modes of scientific investigation.</td>

   with whom they have prior noncommercial relationships? Using data from
   the economic sociology module of the 1996 General Social Survey, we
   document high levels of within-network exchanges. We argue that
   transacting with social contacts is effective because it embeds
   commercial exchanges in a web of obligations and holds the seller's
   network hostage to appropriate role performance in the economic
   transaction. It follows that within-network exchanges will be more
   common in risky transactions that are unlikely to be repeated and in
   which uncertainty is high. The data support this view. Self-reports
   about major purchases are consistent with the expectation that exchange
   frequency reduces the extent of within-network exchanges. Responses to
   questions about preferences for in-group exchanges support the argument
   that uncertainty about product and performance quality leads people to
   prefer sellers with whom they have noncommercial ties. Moreover, people
   prefer to avoid selling to social contacts under the same conditions
   that lead buyers to seek such transactions; and people who transact with
   friends and relatives report greater satisfaction with the results than
   do people who transact with strangers, especially for risk-laden
   exchanges.</td>

   The discussion then turns to alternative approaches. The use of
   narrative and of path dependency to construct explanatory sequences are
   strategies that strike a welcome balance between causal generalization
   and historical detail. But these approaches typically fail to identify
   either the causal mechanisms or the trajectories that link events in
   different eras. These gaps can be filled by rethinking sequences of
   events across periods as reiterated problem solving. Successive U.S.

   methodological strategy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Influenced by classical sociology, constructionist tradition and Pierre
   Bourdieu's writings, this article examines the capital of Russian
   bankers who are perceived as the prime movers of Russia's transition to
   the market. The bankers were selected as subjects for analysis because
   they represent profit-making enterprises in a country where money and
   capital had pejorative meanings prior to the recent capitalist-style
   reforms. It was not money but social relations that served as a primary
   medium of exchange in the Soviet system. Exploring what constitutes the
   major 'currency' in the new Russia, this article also questions whether
   the bankers' constructions of self and society differ from the
   prevailing code of the Russian/Soviet cultural repertoire that is seen
   as anti-individualistic, anti-materialistic and anticapitalist. Relying
   upon a survey of 484 bankers and 61 interviews with managers from Moscow
   and St Petersburg commercial banks, the article comes to the conclusion
   that these bankers possess substantial holdings in the form of money and
   social resources, and are also culturally well equipped for market
   experiences. However, their economic, social and cultural capital is
   only partially converted into symbolic capital interpreted as the most
   universal form of capital. Inadequacy of symbolic capital may question
   the legitimacy of other economic, social and cultural assets, and have
   negative repercussions for market-building in Russia.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lifetime employment was a cornerstone of the Chinese socialist system
   constructed under Mao. In this system organizations served the function
   of social security and as a result, many organizations were overburdened
   with bloated work forces and retirees that drew from organizational
   coffers well into old age. Labor contracts fundamentally alter this
   system, as they allow firms to end the socialist institution of lifetime
   employment. Yet there is significant variation on the
   institutionalization of labor contracts in organizations. Based on a
   sample of 81 films in industrial Shanghai, I show that organizations
   that are experiencing uncertainty in the economic transition are more
   likely to institutionalize labor contracts on an organizationwide basis.
   There are two types of ol organisational uncertainty in the economic
   transition: economic uncertainty and administrative uncertainty In cases
   of economic uncertainty, firms that lost money in 1990 and firms that
   are burdened by large forces of retired workers are more likely to place
   their workers on labor contracts. In the case of administrative
   uncertainty firms that are at the highest levels of the industrial
   hierarchy are also significantly more likely to place their workers on
   labor contracts. Although these upper level firms were the most
   protected under the command economy: these are being forced to handle
   the greatest among the responsibilities in the economic transition and
   as a result, they experience the greatest sense of being set adrift by
   the state.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>An important segment of writings on postindustrialization is distinctly
   utopian in stressing the greater mastery and control made possible by
   recent innovations in information technology. The utopian theme
   underscores the technical outcomes of innovations and highlights their
   benefits for ameliorating social problems. By contrast, our work
   suggests that many of the social problems in contemporary society are a
   consequence of recent innovations in information technology. We argue
   that postindustrial theorists are correct in stressing mastery over
   certain technical problems but incorrect in slighting the destabilizing
   effect innovations have on organizations and the markets in which these
   organizations participate. These destabilizing effects complicate
   organizational strategies by increasing market risk and uncertainty.
   Since most organizations are risk aversive, social problems are created
   as organizations externalize their costs and pass along risk to other,
   more dependent actors. Illustrations from two institutions, politics and
   the economy, indicate that many postindustrial innovations are
   associated with heightened competition as well as greater risk and
   uncertainty across the institutional order. We conclude that
   postindustrial technology introduces no net gain in managing the
   complexities of the social world. Risk and control are both integral to
   technological innovation and constitute the paradox of
   postindustrialization.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study employs interlocking analytical devices from the perspectives
   of several disciplines to explore members' meanings through definitions
   of "high technology" given by workers in design engineering. The
   comparative analysis employs concepts from art history, sociology of
   culture, anthropology and science studies to explore the appeal of "high
   technology" in comparison with the aura of original artworks and the
   status accrued by symbolic tools. Additionally, the role standardization
   has played in the development of engineering as a profession is explored
   in historical context as are the recurring themes of speed and "the
   new." The findings reveal that how engineers use new technologies in the
   world of messy practice and their conceptual framework regarding
   so-called "high technology" do not map well onto one another. The study
   illustrates the perspective of science and technology studies that views
   all technology as socially shaped and society shaping, its construction
   accomplished through messy patched-up practices rather than clean,
   linear paths or perfect techniques.</td>

   come from a longitudinal study of a representative sample of Bulgarian
   SOEs for the period fr-om 1989 (the last year under communism) to 1993
   (three years after major macroeconomic shifts). We investigate how
   changes in authority structure, work organization, technology marketing
   strategy, and organizational boundaries during these years affected
   organizational performance in 1993. We also assess the degree of path
   dependence in performance and the role of competitive industry
   conditions. Numerous organizational changes made by SOEs during early
   transition had little effect on performance. Yet organizational
   performance from 1989 to 1993 was highly path-dependent, although this
   dependence was mediated by the competitive conditions: Stronger markets
   displayed less path dependence. Overall the results favor the
   interpretations derived from selected neo-institutional and ecological
   perspectives of organizational sociology over neoclassical economic
   interpretations.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article explores the ways that the feminist organization
   Sociologists for Women in Society(SWS) has become an arena of change in
   the discipline of sociology, academic institutions, and larger society.
   We begin with an examination of feminist models of power and change,
   followed by a brief history of SWS and an exploration of the use of
   power in sociology, academia, and beyond. We find that SWS has
   influenced both the organizational governance structures of sociology
   (such as the American Sociological Association) and the production of
   sociological scholarship. As a result, the presence of women is more
   apparent than ever before, and sociological paradigms are more inclusive
   and attentive to the voices of "outsiders." Academic institutions have
   been challenged and changed by an SWS presence and the monitoring of
   women's experiences in the academy. Beyond the discipline and academia,
   SWS strives to participate in the making of public policy that affects
   women's lives and to be a presence both domestically and internationally
   in issues affecting the status and well-being of women. We conclude with
   the recommendation that sociologists use their experiences and knowledge
   to create change in the institutions where women practice and the world
   in which they live.</td>

   grounds of moral autonomy and heteronomy (rule-from-another as opposed
   to rule-from-oneself) on classical sociological theory, arguing that
   both Weber and Durkheim understood sociology to have a contribution to
   make in the debate,with Kant over the grounds of ethical action. Both
   insisted that the only possible ethical action was one within the bounds
   of rational knowledge that was inherently authoritative, but this sat
   uneasily with their focus on the relation between concrete social
   authority and the authoritativeness of beliefs in the sociology of
   religion. In rejecting Comte's explicit avowal of the embodiment of
   moral authority in the secular priesthood of sociologist, Weber and
   Durkheim had to paper over the social authority supporting the
   formulation of this rational knowledge. Each then produced a sociology
   of knowledge without a well-specified mechanism, in turn encouraging the
   development of the sociology of knowledge as ct flawed sub-discipline.</td>

   socially defined, publicly visible beings of intersubjective experience.
   I argue that the sociology of the person proposed by Durkheim and Mauss
   is more accurately described as a sociology of institutions of the
   person and neglects both folk or ethnopsychologies of personhood and the
   international production of persons. I draw upon the work of Goffman to
   develop a sociology of the person concerned with means, processes, and
   relations of person production. I also propose that the work of Goffman,
   Foucault, and others provides insights into the contemporary technology
   of person production and into how its control and use affects relations
   of person production. I conclude with a brief outline of the theoretical
   connections among institutions of the person, folk psychologies, the
   social constitution of the person, and the prospect of a distinctively
   sociological psychology.</td>

   associated with using a laptop computer and presentation software during
   lectures. This discussion is informed by our own experience as well as
   end of the semester grades and student course evaluations from six
   sections of introductory social statistics that were taught between the
   fail of 1995 and the spring of 1997. Direct student quotes are used
   throughout the paper to emphasize particular points and to provide
   insight into students' perspectives on the computer presentations. Based
   on this objective and subjective evidence, we conclude that computer
   presentations can act as useful tools in courses like social statistics
   and methods. These presentations encourage classroom interaction,
   heighten interest, and provide a structure to lectures that can
   facilitate student comprehension and performance. This article also
   discusses potential problems that arise when using this technology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I seek to explain the emergence of social differentiation by developing
   a theory of information and social structure. This theory makes
   explanations of social differentiation offered by Spencer and Durkheim
   more precise by borrowing simple assumptions from Carley's constructural
   model and from the symbolic interactionist perspective. My arguments
   amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption
   of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of
   social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple
   assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social
   construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally
   undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time.
   The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural
   homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or
   the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the
   information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory
   positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social
   differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated
   social systems such as organizations and societies. I consider
   implications of this theory for the origins of sociodemographic
   dimensions, the study of inequality, and the sociology of culture.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to objectively
   measure. This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that
   typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors.
   Systematic errors, or "biases," are the focus of this paper. Campbell
   and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the
   best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors,
   but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding
   for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We
   show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more
   relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can
   examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the
   potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic
   errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
   subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR
   papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the
   reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for
   comparable-worth investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do
   far more to understand the systematic error present in their subjective
   variables.</td>

   approach to the topic of social relations (Cerulo 1997; Cerulo and Ruane
   1997; Cerulo, Ruane, and Chayko 1992). With few exceptions, literature
   on the subject dichotomizes social relations with reference to the scope
   of the interaction (small group versus large group) and the mode by
   which social actors connect (direct connections versus mediated
   connections). Further, many researchers implicitly rank the social value
   of each relational form. Sociologists typically identify a society's
   primary and most valuable relations as the result of direct, physically
   copresent exchange, exchange involving relatively few interactants. In
   contrast, secondary relations often are characterized as faceless,
   impersonal, ingenuous, and fleeting-the result of large-group exchange
   established via mediated or mechanized connections. Cerulo (1997)
   suggested the need to reformulate any definition of social relations
   built upon the small group/large group or the direct/mediated
   dichotomies. She presented several critical elements upon which new
   definitions could be built. In this piece, we configure those elements,
   building six new analytic taxonomies-tools we hope will provoke a richer
   discussion of connecting, interacting, and resulting forms of social
   relations.</td>

   associations-can lead to models that are more directly relevant for
   addressing the kinds of questions arising in those cases. In this
   article, the authors explore some of the similarities and differences
   between the log-linear models approach to modeling categorical data and
   a marginal modeling approach. It has been noted in past literature that
   the model of statistical independence is conveniently represented within
   both approaches to specifying models for cross-classifications of
   counts. The authors examine further the extent to which the two families
   of models overlap, as well as some important differences. The authors do
   not present a complete characterization of the conditions describing the
   intersection of the two families of models but cover many of the models
   for bivariate contingency tables and for three-way contingency tables
   that are routinely used in sociological research.</td>

   among survivors of stroke. The episodes of crying analyzed here took
   place during interviews including the patients, the patients' spouses,
   and an interviewer. This investigation innovates on past studies within
   the sociology of emotions by concentrating on the interpersonal
   dimension of emotional displays of persons with brain damage. This study
   also contributes to research on stroke patients' "pathological crying"
   from the field of neuropsychology because it concentrates on the social,
   and not only the neurological or otherwise individual-level, nature of
   such crying. We first present overviews of both the sociology of
   emotions and the neuropsychology of poststroke emotionalism and address
   how our study contributes to both fields. We then discuss our
   participants and method of analysis and finally present our findings
   with respect to the techniques of the management of crying exhibited by
   the stroke patients' interlocutors as well as by the patients
   themselves.</td>

   An overview of "Teaching Sociology" indicates that probably only a small

   argued that college professors are free to teach radical theory, but
   that radical pedagogy is hindered by institutional constraints. The

   by, market competition. The tradition is to test such arguments with
   market concentration data; firms with stronger control over their market
   can afford the long-run investment of R&amp;D. Network theory has broadened
   our understanding of how competition is a function of structure within
   and beyond a market. Producers earn high profit margins to the extent
   they are few and their customers and suppliers are many and
   disorganized. The first condition is measured by the traditional
   concentration ratio for a market. The second condition is measured by
   the network constraint of suppliers and customers. My purpose in this
   paper is to describe how our understanding of the market competition
   effect on innovation is enriched when the concentration measure of
   marker competition tradition in economics is replaced with the network
   model of market competition now prevalent in sociology. Results indicate
   that markets facing competitive environments, in high constraint market
   positions, show greater R&amp;D intensity and faster rates of innovation
   than do industries facing less competitive pressure. These effects
   persist even with controls for technological opportunity and
   appropriability, in contrast to traditional models using only
   concentration data to measure competition. (C) 1998 Academic Press.</td>

   general, we now know that low income groups and communities of color are
   disproportionately exposed to toxic wastes. In this paper I argue that
   future research requires a shift in methodological approach. Learning
   how groups come to be exposed to toxic wastes requires an understanding
   of the organizational processes that shape decisions regarding
   production practices and regulatory enforcement strategies. I conclude
   by making three claims: (I) Documenting that disempowered groups are
   exposed to toxic wastes more than other groups is important.
   Disentangling whether race or class matters more is more dubious. (2) If
   we want to make claims about process, we should study process and not
   outcomes. (3) Insofar as we have to study outcomes, we should be more
   aware of which outcomes we want to study and what types of inferences we
   are able to draw from outcomes.</td>

   framework for understanding age as accomplished, i.e., as something that
   is both a process and the outcome of ongoing interactional work. The
   common expression "act your age" provides the useful metaphor of
   performance. We perform our own age constantly, but we also give meaning
   to other ages and to age more generally in our actions and interactions,
   our beliefs and words and feelings, our social policies. This essay
   offers two routes to the conclusion that age is accomplished. The first
   involves drawing parallels between the study of age and the study of
   gender The second route uses Existing scholarship, which recognizes that
   age is far more social than chronological. I draw on work in the social
   constructionist, symbolic interactionist, and life course traditions to
   develop the framework of age-as-accomplished and to show its potential
   to organize much of what we already have leaned about age and aging.</td>

   in nonmetro labor markets, the emergence of producer services as st
   catalyst of socioeconomic growth, and federal spending. Using a model
   that is informed by a variety of perspectives in sociology and economic
   geography, and commuter zones (CZs) as spatial units of analysis, we
   estimate the effects of manufacturing concentration, producer service
   concentration, and federal spending on per capita income, per capita
   earnings, and private nonfarm employment growth during the 1983-1988
   business cycle recovery. The OLS and interaction models show that all
   three factors help explain why metro areas outperformed nonmetro areas
   during this time period. The effects of producer service concentration,
   however, best fit with our expectations. Implications of our findings

   tradition in the sociology of the marked that devotes greater
   epistemological attention to "politically salient" and "ontologically
   uncommon" features of social life, Although the "unmarked" comprises the
   vast majority of social life, the "marked" commands a disproportionate
   share of attention from sociologists. Since the marked already draws
   more attention within the general culture, social scientists contribute
   to re-marking and the reproduction of common-sense images of social
   reality This has important analytic consequences. This article argues
   for developing a stronger tradition in a sociology of the unmarked that
   explicitly foregrounds "politically unnoticed" and taken-for-granted
   elements of social reality. Three strategies are proposed toward this
   end: (1) reversing conventional patterns of markedness to foreground
   what typically remains unnamed and implicit, (2) marking everything by
   filling in all the shades of social continue so that each shares the
   same degree of epistemological ornamentation, and (3) developing an
   analytically nomadic perspective that observes social phenomena from

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although the focus of their work was rarely explicitly sociological,
   Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari developed concepts that have important
   and often profound implications for social theory and practice. Two of
   these, sense and segmentarity provide us,with entirely new ways to view
   sociological problems of meaning and structure. Deleuze conceives sense
   independently of both agency and signification, That is, sense is
   neither the manifestation of a communicating subject nor a structure of
   language-it is noncorporeal, impersonal, and prelinguistic, in
   his,words, a "pure effect or event." With Guattari, Deleuze notes that
   it is not a question of how subjects produce social structures, but how
   a "machinics of desire" produces subjects. In Deleuze and Guattari,
   desire is not defined as a want or a lack, but as a machinery of forces,
   flows, and breaks of energy. The functional stratification we witness in
   social life is only the molar effect of a more primary segmentation of
   desire that occurs at the molecular level, at the level of bodies. In
   Deleuze and Guattari, bodies are not just human bodies, but "anorganic"
   composites or mixtures, organic form itself being a mode of the body's
   subjectification. The problem of the subject, and thus of the
   constitution of society, is first a problem of how the sense of bodies
   is produced through the assembly of desiring-machines. The subject, we
   could sag: is the actualization of desire on the incorporeal surface of
   bodies.</td>

   writings of Bourdieu, Loury, and Coleman, among other authors. It
   distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their
   dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature
   emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits
   mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these
   positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also
   deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
   four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples.
   Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an
   individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final
   sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I
   argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability,
   social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However,
   excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.</td>

   sociology in Japan. The sociological discipline in Japan has made
   remarkable progress since World War II. The rapid economic growth during
   the 1960s, which was prompted by Western influence, had an effect on the
   direction of the discipline's development. After providing a brief
   overview of historical events, I consider scholarly publications during
   the last 30 years to illuminate substantive trends in sociological
   research. As might be predicted, the changing substantive interests of
   Japanese sociologists have been in many ways a response to societal
   changes and needs. I also examine the trends in theory, methods, and
   empirical research. A content analysis of articles published in the
   major Japanese sociological journals shows the growing emphasis on
   theoretical scholarship and the decreasing emphasis on empirical
   research in recent years. The conclusion presents some considerations
   concerning the future direction of Japanese sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The protection of habitat for an officially designated "threatened"
   species, the Northern Spotted Owl, is widely seen as having endangered
   the survival of a very different "species," namely the rural American
   logger. In spite of the widespread agreement on this point, however, it
   is not clear just how many jobs have been endangered, over just how long
   a period, due to the protection of spotted-owl habitat and of the
   environment more broadly. In the present paper, we analyze longer term
   employment trends in logging and milling, both nationally and in the two
   states of the Pacific Northwest where the spotted-owl debate has been
   most intense, to determine the length of time over which such
   environmental protection efforts have been creating the loss of logging
   and milling jobs. There are three potential key "turning points" since
   the start of high-quality employment data in 1947-the 1989 controversy
   over the federal "listing" of the Northern Spotted Owl under the
   Endangered Species Act, the earlier increase in environmental
   regulations accompanying the first Earth Day in 1970, and the
   still-earlier "locking up" of timber after the passage of the Wilderness
   Protection Act in 1964. We also examine the effects of two other
   variables that have received considerable attention in the ongoing
   debates-levels of U.S. Forest Service timber harvests and the exporting
   of raw logs. We find that the 1989 listing of the spotted owl has no
   significant effect on employment-not even in the two states where the
   debate has been most intense. Instead, the only statistically
   significant turning point came with the passage of the Wilderness Act in
   1964. The direction of the change, however, was precisely the opposite
   of what is generally expected. Both nationally and in the Pacific
   Northwest, the greatest decline in timber employment occurred from 1947
   until 1964-a time of great economic growth, a general absence of
   "unreasonable environmental regulations," and growing timber harvests.
   The period since the passage of the Wilderness Act has been one of
   increased complaints about environmental constraints, but much less
   decline in U.S. logging employment. If logging jobs have indeed been
   endangered by efforts to protect the environment in general and
   spotted-owl habitat in particular, what is needed is a plausible
   explanation of how the influence of the owls could have begun more than
   forty years before the species came under the protection of the
   Endangered Species Act.</td>

   parenting by examining the theoretical relationship between the mother
   identity and mothers' emotional response of jealousy to father-child
   interactions. Using identity theory, we predict that in response to
   father-child interactions, mothers with a more prominent mother identity
   will report the emotional experience of jealousy, and mothers with a
   more salient mother identity will report coping strategies designed to
   reduce the jealous experience. Since prominence captures the affective
   dimension of an identity, it should be tied to one's emotional response
   in a situation. Further, while salience captures the behavioral
   dimension of an identity, it should be related to the coping strategies
   which follow from and manage one's emotional response in a situation.
   The results confirm these expected relationships. We discuss not only
   how emotion may serve to maintain the mother identity, but also how
   mothers' emotion may unintentionally serve to maintain social structural
   arrangements with respect to parenting.</td>

   individual development and academic achievement for undergraduate
   students are student involvement, student integration, and high effort
   at academic tasks (e.g., Astin 1984; Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini
   1991; Terenzini and Wright 1987). Student involvement and integration
   are often measured by frequency of academic and social interactions with
   faculty members, participation in student organizations, integration
   into the major program, and participation in research projects. These
   experiences can be conceived of as part of the academic and professional
   socialization of students and often occur outside the traditional
   college classroom. In this paper, we discuss the importance of these
   out-of-class experiences and review the literature on outcomes of this
   "other" or "informal" curriculum. In addition, we argue, by sharing some
   data on academic and professional socialization from students, faculty
   members, and departments, that most departments do not adequately
   provide these beneficial opportunities. After a discussion of barriers
   to providing these experiences, we conclude with a call, and some

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Courses on quantitative research methods play a central role in many
   undergraduate programs in sociology. However, students' anxiety over the
   courses is a major concern for instructors. Many students perceive the
   subject as inherently uninteresting and difficult. This paper describes
   an experiment designed to introduce aspects of quantitative reasoning
   into a large substantively focused class in the social sciences. The
   experiment assessed whether students can learn quantitative reasoning
   skills in the context of a large "nonmethods" class in sociology. The
   experiment measured students' mastery of these skills by comparing their
   competence at quantitative reasoning at the beginning and end of the
   class term. The results revealed that students' abilities to interpret
   and manipulate empirical data increased significantly. Further, the
   increase occurred independent of students' basic reasoning skills as
   measured by baseline SAT verbal and math scores. This paper discusses
   the implications of these findings for teaching quantitative methods in
   sociology undergraduate curricula.</td>

   understanding political divisions in democratic polities lies with
   membership in social groups. Much recent scholarship, however, has
   argued that political cleavages arising out of social group memberships
   have declined. This study investigates these claims, analyzing the
   magnitude of and interrelationship among four major social
   cleavages-race, religion, class, and gender-in U.S. presidential
   elections since 1960. We improve over dichotomous measures of religion
   and class and introduce statistical models that permit measurement of
   relative shifts in the vote choice of the core groups making up each
   cleavage. Our results do not support claims about the declining
   magnitude of social cleavages. The race cleavage has increased
   considerably since 1960, and the gender cleavage more modestly during
   this period, while the class cleavage has remained stable, and the
   religion cleavage has declined slightly. We find evidence of a slight
   increase in social group cleavages in presidential elections from 1960
   through 1992. Net of change in the race cleavage, the overall social
   cleavage has been stable during this period.</td>

   1990 are used to demonstrate an historical shift in the definition of
   "nature" from resource to life-sustaining global ecosystem. This newer
   scientific model increased nature's relevance to world society, and thus
   catalyzed an exponential rise in international discourse and activity
   concerning the environment. The effect is evident in event-history
   analyses of the rate at which international environmental treaties were
   formed during the period 1870-1990. Two organizational changes also
   played a role in the proliferation of international environmental
   treaties: the overall structuration of the world polity had a positive
   effect, and the consolidation of an official intergovernmental
   environmental domain had a negative effect, even with the effects of
   population growth and industrial degradation held constant.</td>

   normative evaluation of managerial acts in organizational contexts. We
   test several propositions on the relationship between social status and
   normative;evaluation derived from Donald Black's theoretical framework
   on social control. The research design consists of a factorial survey of
   200 managers. Each respondent evaluated the seriousness of a normatively
   questionable managerial act. In each vignette, the perpetrator's social
   status was systematically manipulated in either a high or a low
   condition. The results generally support the argument that the higher a
   manager's social status the less vulnerable that individual is to
   unfavorable normative evaluations, holding constant the act. The paper
   closes with discussion of our findings in light of social structural and
   rational choice perspectives on informal social control in
   organizations. Additionally, we discuss methodological issues related to
   experimental research on informal social control in organizations, the
   consistency of our findings with those from previous studies of social
   control across diverse settings, potential;theoretical applications and
   extensions of Black's framework in organizational contexts, and
   practical implications for the implementation of corporate codes of
   conduct and corporate dispute resolution systems.</td>

   argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from
   affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals
   purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community
   in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating
   themselves with others who share their values and preferences and

   epistemological argument did not appear in its completed form until the
   1912 publication of The Elementary Forms of the Religions Life. There
   Durkheim outlined a theory of enacted social practice as the foundation
   for an epistemology. Yet neither Durkheim's contribution to a theory of
   social practice nor his epistemological argument have been recognized as
   such. The early critics played a pivotal role in creating and
   perpetuating this misunderstanding. The first highly negative wave of
   criticism in English, which treated Durkheim's arguments as naive,
   inadequate philosophy, appeared between 1915 and 1924. Inadequate as
   these initial criticisms were, citations show that they have been
   heavily relied upon. On these critics' authority, scholars rejected
   Durkheim's epistemology altogether, focusing instead on his sociology of

   Philadelphia Plan-a crucial moment in the shaping of federal equal
   employment law. Tying together political sociology's concept of policy
   feedback with legal and cultural sociology's concept of culture as a
   resource, the article explains how actors who were hampered by the
   explicit language used to embed equal opportunity values into law turned
   apparent constraint into an opportunity to transform law. The article
   simultaneously illuminates an underdeveloped aspect of equal employment
   law's unfolding and builds more general theory to help explain how law's
   language, general cultural values expressed in law, and alternative
   methods used to interpret law mediate the effects of past law on future
   law. Defining concepts of value centrality and explicitness of legal
   language, the article uses its case study to suggest hypotheses about
   how variation in centrality of cultural values and explicitness of
   language used to incorporate these values into law affect variation in
   mobilization of different types of cultural strategies by actors
   struggling over law interpretation and enforcement.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx
   are complementary, contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist
   society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's
   critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of
   reification, Georg Lukacs contended that the combination of Marx's and
   Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially
   transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By
   comparing Lukacs's theory of reification with Habermas's theory of
   communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian
   Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of "doing theory" has shifted
   from Marx's critique of economic deter terminism to Weber's idea of the
   inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an
   important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself
   as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions
   of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social
   value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second
   step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to
   Each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of
   communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of
   social organization.</td>

   of classical sociology's key notion referring to social position-the
   Weberian German concept of Stand-have been stripped to create a
   simplified and inaccurate representation of social inequalities. Some
   historical material from central Europe is surveyed, with a brief look
   at Japan, to demonstrate validity problems created by blanket
   application of the culturally specific, streamlined notions of
   status/class. As an alternative, a notion of contingent social closure
   argues that relaxing the modernizationist assumptions of a single
   transition from estate to status/class increases the
   comparative-historical sensitivity of research on social structure,
   inequality, and stratification. A dynamic reading of Polanyi suggests a
   reconceptualization of institutions as the "raw material" of social
   change. This might help to avoid the outdated contrast of the "West" vs.
   its "Others".</td>

   limited, however. by their retention of dichotomous conceptions of
   culture and structure in the emergence of protest, of cultural and
   instrumental orientations in ongoing collective action, and of cultural
   and political targets of protest. As a result, they have neglected,
   respectively, continuities between structured inequalities and the
   movement challenges that are made to them, the cultural shaping of
   instrumentally rational decisionmaking, and the strategic possibilities
   that lay in cultural challenge made within the sphere of institutional
   politics. I draw on recent theorizing in the sociology of culture and on
   several case studies of collective action in order to highlight these
   lacunae and to propose analytical alternatives.</td>

   processes. The Yamaguchi model is introduced with a discussion of its
   advantages over conventional methods and a comparison with recently
   developed relevant models To overcome the obstacle that existing
   statistical software cannot directly estimate the Yamaguchi model the
   author has developed a method that converts estimated parameters from
   standard multinomial logit estimation into parameters of the Yamaguchi
   model. This method makes it possible and easier for researchers to
   estimate the Yamaguchi model using standard statistical software and a
   simple programming of linear transformation. The method is simple and
   straightforward and thus merits application to an analysis of
   interdependence with panel darn. This article also provides a detailed
   empirical example to illustrate an application of the method.</td>

   conflicts that pitted qualitative against quantitative sociology; the
   fledgling discipline of sociology against medicine, psychiatry, and
   psychology; and advocates of therapy for addicts against those who would
   simply punish them. By casting the meaningful experience of drug effects
   exclusively in terms of symbolically mediated mental representations of
   brute physiological sensations, Lindesmith's theory posits an
   epistemologically untenable dualism between mental and bodily perception
   that unnecessarily limits the explanatory scope of sociological
   research. As an alternative to this dualism, a praxiological approach to
   the meaning of drug-induced behavior and experience is proposed.</td>

   ''core'' conceptions of theory and method that remain entrenched in
   sociology textbooks. In conjunction with recent developments in history
   and philosophy of science, sociologists of science speak of the disunity
   of science and describe the local-historical origins of particular
   scientific facts and laws. ''Core'' sociology textbooks devote no
   attention to the methodological implications of recent sociology of
   science. Elementary textbooks present upbeat versions of the discipline
   that emphasize sociology's scientific methodology; they describe
   sociological methods as implementations of a general research process
   designed along hypothetico-dedective lines. Viewed from the vantage
   point of SSK, such widely disseminated elementary versions of sociology
   promote an asociological conception of science. In this paper we suggest
   that the ''epistemic flattening'' accomplished by SSK's research on the
   natural sciences provides a valuable antidote to current anxieties about
   the coherence and scientific status of sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Emerging from recent social and political struggles, the notion of
   'civil society' can and should be transformed into a sociological
   concept on both the theoretical and empirical level. This means going
   beyond the Marxist and social democratic understandings of civil society
   as a world of selfish economic interests, on the one hand, and beyond
   the liberal equation of civil society with legal protections of
   individual rights, on the other. Civil society should be conceptualized
   as a realm of solidarity, a 'we-ness' that simultaneously affirms the
   sanctity of the individual and these individuals' obligations to the
   collectivity. The solidary sphere, in principle and in practice, can be
   differentiated not only from markets and states but from such other
   noncivil spheres as religion, family and science. Yet differentiation
   does not preclude tension and conflict over boundaries. Civil solidarity
   is 'compromised' and 'distorted' by these boundary relations, and also
   by competing, more primordial definitions of community, such as race,
   language, nation, territory, and ethnicity. While civil society can be
   identified with 'universal reason' in a philosophical sense, in
   sociological terms it must be articulated by more concrete and
   identity-related symbolic constructs. For this reason, sociological
   approaches to civil society must be tied to cultural sociology, to
   theories of symbolic codes and narratives.</td>

   ape of increasing interest to sociologists. In the case of high-culture
   literary texts, the central evaluation process takes place through canon
   formation. We explore the mechanisms of canon formation and of cultural
   valorization processes more generally by analyzing the critical history
   of Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Published in
   1937 to lukewarm reviews, the novel is currently considered a core
   canonical text. We specify three processes involved in the
   reconstruction of Hurston's novel and in the establishment of the
   African American literary canon: (I) the application of new evaluative
   criteria, (2) the reconstruction of textual meaning through newly
   available interpretative strategies, and (3) changes in the
   institutional and organizational environment that allowed new claims on
   high-status critical positions to be made by those previously outside
   the literary hierarchy. The implications of this study for theoretical
   models of cultural valorization in sociology are considered.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article argues that the medical record is an important focus for
   sociological research. In medical work, the modern patient's body that
   Foucault has so aptly described is produced through embodied, materially
   heterogeneous work, and the medical record plays a crucial role in this
   production. It does not simply represent this body's history and
   geography; it is a central element in the material rewriting of these.
   Simultaneously, the record fulfills a core role in the production of a
   body politic. As the record is involved in the performance of the
   patient's body, it is also involved in the performance of the clinic in
   which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that different records
   and different practices of reading and writing are intertwined with the
   production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic, and bodies of
   knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical record affords
   the interplay and coordination of divergent worlds. Seen as a site where
   multiple stories about patients and organizations are at stake,
   including the interoperability between these stories, the medical record
   becomes highly relevant both analytically and politically.</td>

   This field has had a history of ethnographic and qualitative research
   since ifs beginnings. Because few studies in medical sociology derive
   from immersion in a setting, the authors examine those qualitative works
   in which researchers and subjects had sustained contact. They focus only
   on major areas in which ethnographic contributions have clustered: (1)
   disability, chronic illness, and terminal illness; (2) caring and
   curing; (3) medical sociology in aging research; (4) socialization into
   health care professions; and (5) the ethnography of ethics. Throughout
   this review, the added value of ethnographic research to each specific
   area is noted. Ethnographic research has enriched medical sociology with
   its emphasis an descriptive detail, meanings, ongoing processes, and
   concepts. The article ends with a discussion of methodological
   considerations for conducting research and a summary statement.</td>

   reduces the amount of violence in human societies. Are they right? I
   review the cross-cultural and cross-national evidence on the impact of
   the state on the most common form of extreme violence-lethal conflict
   (i.e., war, rebellion, homicide, and execution). Drawing on the
   sociology of conflict management (Black 1993), I argue that the
   relationship between the state and lethal conflict is nor negative as
   Hobbesian theory predicts. Rather, it appears to be U-shaped. A
   combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political
   science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when
   state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or
   centralized. Between these extremes, in less centralized states, lethal
   conflict typically declines.</td>

   introducing small-group work to provide more direct exposure to the

   small-group work are summarized in the content analyses of students'
   responses to four questions: What is a source of pride in your
   racial/ethnic background When have you been discriminated against? When
   have you discriminated against others? How are you privileged? Results
   reveal an implied white racism, frank gender discrimination toward

   findings are discussed within the context of the systems of inequality
   approach, within the context of the course, and within the wider

   sustainable development. Taught by three primary professors and
   augmented by various on-site discussants, the semester-long curriculum
   integrated sociology and political economy with agricultural ecology.
   Our guiding philosophy dictated that the curriculum be empirically
   based, involve working collaboratively, and utilize multidisciplinary
   investigation. Faculty members and students worked together in a number
   of sites throughout the country to investigate the human and
   environmental problems of sustainability. Students were open to
   interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field
   reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is
   challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that
   this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This
   report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also
   considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a
   learning community.</td>

   revision of the sociology major to promote greater ''study in depth.'' A
   key recommendation in the report is that the major include at least four
   levels of sequencing. These consist of introductory courses, skills
   courses, advanced substantive courses, and capstone courses. St. Cloud
   State University revised its sociology major to incorporate many of the
   recommendations in the ASA report. An initial revision of the major
   omitted the third level of sequencing, but a recent revision includes
   all four levels. Faculty members concerns about scheduling, enrollments,
   and autonomy slowed the pace of change and influenced the content of the
   major. The experience of St. Cloud State University suggests that
   implementing the ''study in depth'' guidelines is a difficult but

   and being from the past onto the future, and that sociological forms of
   presentation are rhetorical defenses of ideologies. Postmodernism
   contends that sociological theory presents reified constructs no more
   based in reality than are fictional accounts. Kenneth Burke's logology
   predates and adequately addresses postmodernism's valid charges against
   sociology. At the same time, logology avoids the idealistic tendencies
   and ethical pitfalls of radical forms of postmodernist deconstruction,
   which acknowledge neither pretextual and extratextual worlds nor the way
   sin which experience is embodied. While not fully articulated, Burke's
   logology gives primacy to an embodies, social world prior to text
   (body-as-World). Sociology can strengthen both its theoretical arsenal
   and its response to postmodernism by reacknowledging and reclaiming
   Burke's logology.</td>

   human sciences while having very little influence on the arts of
   sciences. This variation is explained using a sociological framework
   emphasizing the organizational forms that underpin or are implicit in
   epistemological positions. The fine arts and the harder sciences are,
   respectively, too weakly and too strongly organized to be open to
   epistemological influence. By contrast, the human sciences might
   plausibly be organized either more loosely or more tightly, and
   epistemological argument is used in part to urge movement in one or the
   other direction. This persvective is applied to the academic study of
   literature both historically and in relation to a current
   epistemological dispute between realist and relativist scholars. The
   argument is unresolvable in practice, it is argued, because of
   constraints on scholarly interpretation set by consumers. Parallels are

   coherence, or class background of the state bureaucracies, and of
   institutional characteristics that ensure state effectiveness. This view
   has several problems: it assumes what has to be explained, makes it
   difficult to understand changes in state autonomy, and tends to make
   autonomy the characteristic of strong, cove states. This paper calls for
   a new approach to study state autonomy, one in which power is a
   characteristic of a relationship, not of actors or organizations
   (Emerson 1962), and uses this approach to examine changes in state-class
   relationships based on taxation during the mid 1930s in Bolivia. The
   paper then argues that state autonomy depends on the relative costs of
   state policies and on the availability of political allies to the state
   vis-a-vis the opposing economic elite. This approach allows us to
   specify the power dependence of the state on a gir,en class, the
   conditions under which that relative dependence changes in favor of the
   state, and is applicable to both weak and strong states.</td>

   in the sociology of sport. Because of this tradition, the literature is
   replete with tabular demonstrations of the stacking phenomenon Many of
   these data arrangements violate an important convention in table
   presentation: Percents should be computed in the direction of the causal
   factor. This procedure allows one to contrast the distribution of the
   dependent variable between/among categories of the independent variable
   and enables determining what differences if any, exist between/among
   categories of the independent variable. The consequences of this
   violation for stacking studies is that, technically, position appears to
   affect race whereas, logically race affects position played. Because so
   many competent researchers have published tables that run the ''wrong
   way,'' it is appropriate to examine the rationale behind the cause and
   effect rule for percentaging tables and instances in which this ''rule''
   may be broken.</td>

   stratification along such dimensions as race, class, gender, ethnicity,
   and nationality. By extending classroom heuristics into the social world
   of ''everyday life,'' this approach enables students to explore a
   familiar social place-the postindustrial shrine to American consumption
   culture-through the critical lens of the sociological imagination. The
   application of sociological principles learned in the classroom to the
   larger community or ''real world'' helps to enhance the relevance of
   sociology as a scientific discipline to students when they return to the
   traditional academic setting. Although the paper is based on experiences
   from a multidisciplinary class (N=63) that was not trained in
   qualitative research techniques, the assignment can be utilized
   effectively in more advanced undergraduate and graduate courses,
   including research methods classes.</td>

   sociological discourse as the core organizing features of modern
   societies. Yet such economically centered models of stratification often
   disregard factors like physical violence and the intra-household
   distribution of resources that shape power and autonomy for all groups.
   Using a sample of textbooks from 1983 through 1988, we examine
   ''mainstream'' sociology, that is, the sociology that teachers,
   students, and textbook publishers have treated as nonproblematic. We
   show how stratification analysis is applied to class, race, and gender
   in profoundly unequal ways. Rather than integrating macro, meso, and
   micro levels of social structure as interactive and mutually
   determinative in their discussions of race, class, and gender,
   introductory sociology textbooks segregate stratification processes.
   They discuss class at the societal (or macro) level of analysis, gender
   at the individual (or micro) level, and race at a group (or meso) level.
   We analyze the quantitative and qualitative elements of the coverage of
   class, race, and gender in indexes, texts, pictures, and captions, and
   suggest that attention to feminist theories of gender would produce a
   more integrated, multilevel, and interactive view. of stratification.</td>

   the metropolitan area population, translated into large absolute numbers
   for personal disaster behavior; (2) social class (or socioeconomic
   status) was important as a differentiating factor in earthquake-related
   behavior; (3) there was little dissatisfaction with organizational
   efforts to deal with the earthquake consequences along with (4) no
   noticeable increase in dissatisfaction from the time of the initial
   impact up to the year's anniversary of the disaster; (5) the
   earthquake-related sheltering and housing of people was not as
   problematical as the extensiveness of the activity might suggest; (6)
   the volunteering pattern of individuals was quite complex; (7) there was
   extremely heavy mass media usage in the earthquake aftermath; and (8)
   earthquake victims learned little from their experience on how to
   prepare for future disasters. The paper primarily uses these

   about human behavior in disasters that might be comparatively examined

   related to pesticide use and water quality issues is evidenced by
   several trends. These trends include the increasing documentation of
   water pollution by farm pesticides, the changing characteristics of farm
   ownership and operator tenure, and evolutions in resource policy and
   protection planning. This paper utilizes a theoretical approach to the
   sociology of land tenure to interpret results from an investigation of
   landlord involvement in environmental decision making regarding
   pesticide selection on rented land. Eight counties with high
   susceptibility of water contamination by pesticides were selected for
   study. Structured, in-person interviews were administered to in-county
   landlords, and a mail survey was used to poll out-of-county landlords.
   Results indicate that participation is generally low with very little
   difference between landlord groups. Renters make most of the
   organizational and operational decisions on rented farmland. Landlord
   participation is predominantly based on economic, rather than on social
   or environmental, factors. Furthermore, while economic variables are
   important predictors of participation for both groups, gender and social
   ties to the renter tend to increase local landlord involvement, but not
   absentee involvement. These results have important implications for both
   federal programs and further research on land tenure and environmental
   stewardship.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>With his recent introduction of "posthumanism," a decentered variant of
   constructivist sociology of science, Andrew Pickering advertises novel
   conceptual resources for social theorists. fn fact, he tenders nothing
   less than a fundamental reordering of social thought. By invoking the
   concept of "material agency," Pickering seeks to redefine the
   relationship between "Nature " and "Society," while dismissing the
   "humanist bias" inherent in sociological inquiry. However, for all its
   ambition and good intentions, posthumanism delivers only analytical
   inconsistencies, the consequences of an uneasy synthesis of pragmatist
   and poststructuralist influences. When translated into the language of
   conventional sociological theory, these problems surface as an
   inadequate treatment of human agency The works of the original
   pragmatists, particularly C.S. Peirce and G.H. Mead, illustrate how the
   objectives of posthumanism can be achieved without decentering,
   suggesting a renewed appreciation of "humanist" sociologies.</td>

   its possible limits. Under what circumstances might the neoinstitutional
   predictions regarding organizational inertia, institutional isomorphism,
   the legitimacy imperative, and other fundamental beliefs be overshadowed
   by? more traditional sociological theories accentuating organizational
   adaptation, variation, and the role of specific global and local
   technical environmental demands? We analyze longitudinal data from 1971
   to 1986 for 631 private liberal arts colleges facing strong
   institutional and increasingly strong technical environments. Our
   findings reveal surprisingly little support neoinstitutional
   predictions. (I) Many liberal arts colleges changed in ways contrary to
   institutional demands by professionalizing or vocationalizing their
   curricula; (2) global and local technical environmental conditions, such
   as changes in consumers' references and local economic and demographic
   differences, were strong predictors of the changes observed; (3) schools
   Became less, rather than more, homogeneous over time; (4) schools
   generally did not mimic their most prestigious counterparts; (5) the
   illegitimate changes had no negative (and often had positive)
   performance consequences for enrollment and survival. Our results
   suggest that current research on organization-environment relations map
   underestimate the power of traditional adaptation-based explanations in
   organizational sociology.</td>

   environmental sociology to date, going on to propose ways in which the
   existing research can be used as a foundation for a new generation of
   research into the 21st century. It argues that environmental
   sociologists need to avoid the omphaloskepsis that sometimes afflicts
   other fields of sociology, but that there is a real opportunity to do
   so. Three options appear particularly promising: (a) broadening the
   now-established base of sociological research that deals systematically
   with environmental variables; (b) devoting greater attention to the ways
   in which socially constructed ''definitions of the situation'' may
   contribute to (and not simply permit the evading of) the environmental
   problems that societies face; and (c) beginning more line-grained
   analyses of the connections between specific human activities
   (particularly economic activities) and specific components of the
   physical environment. Contributions to date have clearly established the
   fact that such connections exist; the work of a much broader range of
   sociologists will be needed, however, to help develop an improved
   understanding oi the nature, causes, and extent of those connections.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.</td>

   In investigating this transformation, I focus upon two cognitive
   processes: the splitting of the fetus apart from the pregnant woman and
   the concurrent lumping of two distinct mental entities-a fetus and an
   infant into one new medical category: the fetus-infant. In addition,
   textual evidence shows a shift in cognitive orientation away from
   classifying fetuses based on gestational age to an emphasis on what I
   term functional age. Further, new knowledge enables physicians to affect
   functional age, making the fetus with mature function in utero
   conceptually no different from a baby.</td>

   these complex biological processes into discrete temporal units. This
   paper examines nor the meaning of ''the menstrual cycle,'' per se, but
   hegemonic Western culture's intersubjective notions of how to carve lip
   this inherently unstructured phenomenon in the first place. Although
   sociologists of cognition have still to consider this sociomental
   structuring of ''the menstrual cycle'' as a case of mental cartography,
   and sociologists of time have still to consider ''menstrual time'' as a
   case of sociotemporality, I conclude that the mental mapping out of what
   constitutes the elements of this rhythm is a highly social act with
   serious implications for women's lives.</td>

   social construction, collective agreement, and socialization. While
   objective danger certainly exists, perceptions of danger do not derive
   directly from observation of the empirical world. The objective
   environment provides only inconsistent and ambiguous information,
   permitting ample room for socially constructed beliefs. Three cognitive
   frameworks-the Cautious, Confident and Neutral frameworks-organize
   perceptions of safety and danger. Each framework begins with a default
   assumption about safety and danger and ''marks'' certain items as
   different from this default. In shaping expectations, these frameworks
   also contribute to perceptions of horror, humor, excitement and fear.
   Finally, I use these frameworks to analyze the psychological concept
   ''phobia'' as a sociological phenomenon.</td>

   analyses which have found purchase across the discipline and which
   seemingly defy the forces of theoretical balkanization. This

   theory growth in social science. This model focuses on theory. We show
   how recent work in the sociology of science suggests an equally
   important place for methodological preference in guiding social
   research. Bringing in method allows us to recognize that what often
   passes for fundamental metatheoretical differences among subfields in
   sociology actually consists of minor squabbles over resource allocation.
   We show that not only does social theory grow strategically through

   confirming an allusion-that is, confirming both its ''content'' and its
   prior inexplicit conveyance. The author reviews the past treatment of
   ''action'' in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an
   empirically grounded account. The account of ''confirming allusions'' is
   offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several
   instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and
   used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration
   of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is
   formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic
   techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it
   implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of
   repetition in talk-in-interaction. Tn conclusion, the significance of
   both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture

   sociology. This paper attempts to open a discussion on nonrationality by
   analyzing one of the most fruitful theorizations of the concept:
   Simmels. Simmel developed a theory that placed nonrationality on the
   same plane with rationality and attributed to the former a role as
   fundamental as the latter's in the foundations of action, and as central
   as the latter's in the generation of existential meanings. The gradual
   eclipse of the nonrational elements of life in the expanses of a modern,
   highly rationalized world imply, then, an impoverishment of being. I
   argue that Simmel's theory of the nonrational can serve as a model
   capable of enriching our understanding of society and of the person and
   can, in this sense, serve as a counterpoint to current sociological
   theories that emphasize the rational elements of life and conceive the
   person in primarily rational terms.</td>

   shed light on current discussions regarding civil society; how his
   analytical insights help to show how action within civil society as well
   as other historical contexts is channelled by cultural,
   social-structural, and social-psychological configurations (plus
   transformative human agency); and how his ontological commitment to a
   "relational social realisin" contributes to ongoing attempts to rethink
   the foundations of historical-comparative investigation.</td>

   I should like to reciprocate the compliment by using this commentary not
   only to address specific objections that they raise, but to step back
   from these criticisms to examine their connection to Alexander's work
   more generally. My claim is that as a tool for analyzing the development
   of ideas-the development, that is, of various intellectual products or
   kinds of social-scientific knowledge-Alexander's work is fundamentally
   antisociological. Since my own goal has been to work out a sociology of
   ideas, we necessarily clash-albeit in more serious and consequential
   ways than Alexander and Sciortino identify.</td>

   networks in rural settings contain ties of greater intensity and role
   multiplexity, are based more on kinship and neighborhood solidarities
   rather than on friendship, are smaller, are denser, and have greater
   educational, race-ethnic, and religious homogeneity, but less age and
   gender homogeneity. Our results are generally consistent with these

   Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing
   possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial
   communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network

   This view ignores his considerable achievements using the methodology of

   lectures on the history of French education (The Evolution of

   dozen more books on how to construct scientific theories in the seven
   years after 1965 marked the beginning of the end of; rather than the end
   of the beginning of the theory construction movement in sociology.
   Although the formal mode of theory construction is dead now, efforts

   System, Change and Conflict. The paper argues that little of that

   communities and changes in the built environment. I draw on data from a
   case study of land-use discourse in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, to
   explore the ways in which imagery shapes the rhetoric available for
   land-use debate and how this, in turn, affects changes in zoning. Of
   particular importance in this process are heritage narratives. These
   broad renditions of a community's history are a form of constitutive
   rhetoric. When successful, they create an audience to whom subsequent
   appeals can be made, and they set boundaries on the content and
   direction of public discourse. The analysis suggests that communication
   and rhetorical processes are central to ecological change and that to
   dismiss these phenomena in favor of macrostructural forces is to miss a
   significant aspect of the human dimensions of local change and of the
   processes through which places are stratified.</td>

   on deviance take an individual-level approach; groups are brought in

   groups of different kinds (not only cults and communes), arguing that
   such groups are important sources of deviant behavior and are relatively
   neglected in deviance studies. Particular attention is given to
   ''deviance production groups''-groups that take in ''normal'' people and
   turn them into deviants, to some extent, such as the Branch Davidians,
   the Ku Klux Klan, and witches' covens. The course is also distinctive in
   its degree of emphasis on sociological concepts and theory, its
   complementing of other deviance courses, and its dependence on group
   discussions and presentations during class. Lectures are relatively
   infrequent; students are expected to use a study guide and to learn
   substantially from an instructor-prepared text on the deviant groups
   covered.</td>

   collection than in the theoretical vitality of the discipline. The
   failure to match theoretical and conceptual advances with appropriate
   data leaves sociologists grappling with ''modern data to study a

   and spatial divisions of labor and the contributions of feminist theory
   and research to the conceptualization of work and household illustrate
   the theoretical advances and the empirical deficiencies faced by the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The current decline of the developmentalist paradigm, and its view of
   the rural as increasingly residual, revitalizes rural sociology. The
   blossoming of studies of rurality and ecology is paralleled by the
   growing currency of globalization as an object of analysis. This is more
   than a coincidence-in fact, globalization crystallizes local diversity.
   The two phenomena go hand in hand. But each needs to be understood as an
   historical construct; that is, they need to be problematized. In
   problematizing ''globalization,'' I argue that it must be understood as
   a post-developmentalist construct. The postwar goal of national
   development, institutionalized in the international Bretton Woods
   regime, has run its course-dramatized by the assault on developmentalist
   states and institutions in the monetarist regime established under the
   auspices of the 1980s debt crisis. The nationally oriented institutions
   of the developmentalist era are now being replaced by globally oriented
   institutions under the legitimizing cloak of efficiency and financial
   credibility. Related to this trend, producing communities scramble to
   reposition themselves either through finding niches in a new global
   economy or through resistance to global pressures. Either way, there is
   a new emphasis on defining the local. This article explores the
   conjunction of global and local definition.</td>

   major contributors to environmental sociology. In part, this is because
   several areas of longstanding rural sociological interest (e.g.,
   sociology of resource management and outdoor recreation, studies of
   resource-dependent communities) essentially came to be redefined as
   environmental sociology during the 1970s. The most significant role of
   rural sociologists in building environmental sociology, however, has
   perhaps been the fact that the material and biophysical nature of the
   phenomena they have traditionally studied contributed to a general
   predisposition to recognize the ''materiality'' of social structure and
   social life. I assess the major strategies that have been developed for
   theorizing this materiality and then indicate some of the most critical
   lines of debate and dissension. I argue that if these debates are
   examined in their specifics-rather than as incompatible perspectives or
   ''paradigms''-some opportunities for synthesis become apparent. Some
   suggested avenues of synthesis are set forth.</td>

   little recognized. I outline how concern with space, uneven development,
   and the social relationships of peripheral settings have provided
   substantive boundary and conceptual meaning to rural sociology,
   propelled its evolution, and left it with a legacy of strengths,
   weaknesses, and challenges. A willingness to tackle the dimension of
   space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists
   apart fr om other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with
   general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial
   covering laws, and proto-typical relationships of modern or Fordist
   development settings. Conceptual openings have left sociologists
   questioning their past agenda. Coupled with the ''creative marginality''
   inherent in the questions and contexts addressed by rural sociologists,
   this makes tile subfield central to contemporary sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Collective violence is often social control: self-help by a group. It
   typically defines and responds to conduct as deviant. When unilateral
   and nongovernmental, it appears in four major forms-lynching, rioting,
   vigilantism, and terrorism-each distinguished by its system of liability
   (individual or collective) and degree of organization (higher or lower).
   Following Donald Black's paradigm of pure sociology, the central
   assumption is that collective violence varies with its location and
   direction in social space-the conflict structure. I offer ten
   propositions that predict and explain the likelihood and severity of
   collective violence in general and the four forms of collective violence
   in particular Conflict structures with a high degree of relational
   distance, cultural distance, functional independence, and inequality
   between the adversaries are associated with collective violence in
   general. Each of the four forms depends on the degree of social
   polarization between the parties as well as the continuity of the
   deviant behavior to which the violence responds.</td>

   one sexuality, and one gender, congruent with each other and fixed for
   life. Postmodern feminists and queer theorists have been interrogating
   bodies, desires, and genders, but sociology has not. Deconstructing sex,
   sexuality and gender reveals many possible categories embedded in social
   experiences and social practices. As researchers, as theorists, and as
   activists, sociologists have to go beyond paying lip service to the
   diversity of bodies, sexualities, genders. The sociologist's task should
   be to deconstruct the conventional categories of sex, sexuality, and
   gender and build new complex, cross-cubing constructs into research
   designs. There are revolutionary possibilities inherent in rethinking
   the categories of gender, sexuality and physiological sex. Sociological
   data that challenge conventional knowledge by reframing the questions
   could provide legitimacy for new ways of thinking. Data that undermine
   the supposed natural dichotomies on which the social orders of most
   modem societies are still based could radically alter political
   discourses that valorize biological causes, essential heterosexuality,
   and traditional gender roles in families and workplaces.</td>

   invites knowing the probable future consequences of contemplated
   actions, give more attention to prediction and the study of

   Sociology-explicitly, rigorously, critically and objectively-focusing on
   achieving freedom and wed-being for human beings Think (4) globally and
   (5) holistically, even when working locally. (6) Take the meaning of
   time seriously and explore the real though sometimes hidden, alternative
   present possibilities for the not-yet-evidential future. (7) View people
   as active agents who strive to create the futures that they want. And
   (8) in defining society, emphasize expectation, choice, and decision as
   people, through historical actions, construct society by attempting to
   transform their images of desirable futures into social realities.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although widely recognized as one of sociology's true classics, Max
   Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism has largely
   failed to influence the development of sociological theory in the United
   States. Because it has been read almost exclusively as a study of the
   "role of ideas" in economic development, its diverse and multifaceted
   theoretical contributions generally have been neglected. This study
   explicitly calls attention to The Protestant Ethic as a theoretical
   treatise by examining this classic in reference to four major debates in
   postwar sociological theory in the United States. Moreover, it
   demarcates an array of major parameters in American theorizing. The
   conclusion speculates upon the reasons for the strong opposition to The
   Protestant Ethic's theoretical lessons and argues that a style of
   theorizing unique to sociology in the United States has erected firm
   barriers against this classic text.</td>

   implications for the way in which social research is and should be

   competing causal explanations are misdirected. Further; the emphasis on
   causation in contemporary sociology is often misdirected.</td>

   communities are formed, and individuals become scientists. These
   relationships were arranged around the negotiable boundaries between the

   nontraditional resources for leaching sociology, the pedagogical uses of
   science fiction have not been examined for 20 years. This essay first
   asserts the need for an update based on changes in society and in
   science fiction over the past two decades. The paper then focuses on the
   uses of SF to teach sociology and critical thinking by describing how SF
   can help students to ''make strange''(i.e., develop a skeptical,
   questioning stance), to ''make believe'' (i.e., develop critical and
   creative thinking), and to ''make real'' (i.e., use sociological
   concepts and theories). As illustration, the essay concludes with a
   detailed description of the use of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale
   in teaching introductory sociology.</td>

   years of Rural Sociology; this note employs a similar analytic
   frame-work for the 292 articles and research commentaries published from
   1986 to 1995. While particular topics ebb and flow in terms of their
   importance, there continues to be a consistent focus on the substantive
   issues of traditional concern. Predictions in 1985 as to what the next
   retrospective would show proved to be fairly accurate. Applied empirical
   and quantitative studies continue to dominate the pages of the journal,
   but other types (e.g., qualitative and historical studies) now appear
   with greater frequency. The theoretical foundation of rural sociology
   has been enriched with conceptual frameworks from general sociology and
   other social sciences. New twists on the traditional concerns of
   agricultural constituencies and rural community leaders have broadened
   the range of topics addressed, reflecting the major social structures,
   processes, and issues currently affecting rural peoples and communities.
   The article concludes with an interpretation of recent trends and
   speculations on future directions.</td>

   Agency, the ability to choose among alternatives where the choice makes
   an important difference, exists in social phenomena but has no
   counterpart in nature and cannot be dealt with adequately by positivism.
   A technological science perspective is suggested as an alternative for a
   science of sociology that can deal with the reality and importance of
   agency. Eight differences between the traditional perspective and the
   alternative are sketched. The alternative requires changes in the kind
   of generalized knowledge produced and the way it is produced,
   accumulated, and refined. The changes, though seemingly small, would
   produce a major reconstruction of much of sociology; such changes could
   result in important progress by the field of sociology.</td>

   science perspective for sociology based on a theory of humans as
   technological agents and an epistemology that includes ethical values.
   As with any sociological perspective, however, Warner and England's
   comments help to focus on and understand some aspects of social life and
   not others. This commentary provides a complementary focus by
   emphasizing the dialectical relationship between human agency and
   technological agency. Furthermore, I argue that a dialectical view is
   necessary for grounding Warner and England's theoretical argument and
   for acting on their ethical argument. Implications of a dialectical
   perspective for the meaning and politics of technology are explored. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the suitability of ''science'' as a

   perspective for sociology is a helpful effort to maintain a balance
   between our emphasis on agency and creativity and on the constraining
   side of society. We emphasize agency as part of a dialectic between
   human effort and societal resistance for three reasons. First, it forces
   reconceptualization of the nature of the science of sociology by
   shifting from a positivist mode to one that is pragmatic. The meaning of
   scientific findings changes. Second, agency has been ignored
   historically while constraint has been overemphasized. We seek to
   establish a balance by reentering the notion of agency into sociological
   discourse. Third, agency is a mechanism for modifying constraints and
   solving the problems associated with social technologies. In the closing
   paragraphs of the reply, we suggest that the view under discussion be
   seen as an ethical pragmatism. Agency forces us to ethical questions and
   a pragmatic understanding of science.</td>

   other relations, such as capitalist and class relations, were also
   present. This article seeks to reestablish, contrary to the revisionist
   view, the centrality of lineage in African precolonial societies to
   allow for a paradigmatic shift that repudiates evolutionism and brings
   precolonial societies back to the center of the African debate. Because
   in such a reoriented debate Africa ceases to be marginalized and on the
   fringes of other historical experiences, the shift allows,
   paradoxically, the integration of scholarship on Africa into universal
   social theory.</td>

   is different from those that have appeared in the literature. In
   contrast to the ideological and technical readings, it suggests that the
   origins of the crisis are to be found in the hermeneutic challenge that
   has resulted from the linguistic and multicultural turns. Both of these
   developments have given rise to new discourses within the academy that
   are competing with subfields such as the sociology of the arts and
   race/ethnic relations. The nature and impact of this new competition is
   examined in greater detail through the case of the sociology of race.
   The analysis reveals that these competitive challenges are hermeneutic
   in nature and not primarily technical or ideological. The paper
   concludes with some suggestions for crisis resolution.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The use of computer simulation experiments as a tool for working with
   theories is not as widespread in sociology as it is in most scientific
   disciplines. This brief articles explains how modeling is a distinctive
   activity from either ''theory'' or ''empirical analysis'' but how it
   informs both and connects them. Simulation models are artificial objects
   created to translate theoretical generalizations into specific scenarios
   involving states (variables and/or actors) and rates (the dynamic causal
   laws hypothesized to generate change over time in the states).
   Simulation models are analyzed to understand the full range of
   implications of theoretical statements as they apply to producing
   historical realizations under particular circumstances. Simulation
   analysis operates by a method of experimentation, unlike mathematical
   modeling and statistical modeling. The strengths and limitations of
   these three approaches to studying models are discussed and suggested to
   be complementary rather than competitive with each other. Last, this
   article briefly points out some of the unique features of the exemplars
   that compose the remainder of this special issue of Sociological

   feminist theory? Notwithstanding indications of increasing openness to
   feminist theory, journals and texts on sociological theory reflect a
   continuing pattern of neglect. Identify reasons for this pattern;
   including tensions resulting from the introduction of gender as a
   central analytical category: Nor only does gender challenge the
   dichotomous categories that define sociology's boundaries and identity,
   it also displaces the discipline's central problematic of modernity. The
   significance of this displacement is apparent when the discipline's
   responses to feminist and postmodernist theory are compared I discuss
   the relevance of feminist theoretical work to contemporary issues in
   sociological theory, with specific attention to the synthetic nature of
   feminist theorizing to work on rethinking power resistance, and
   oppression, and to efforts to effect a conceptual shift from
   ''either/or'' to ''both/and'' thinking and to establish new grounds for

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the ''political culture
   concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly Habermas's account of the
   Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original
   political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory
   in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture
   is used in a way that is neither political nov cultural. Explaining this
   peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its
   companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number
   2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself
   is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here
   called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual
   relationships that combine into Angle-American citizenship theory. The
   method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to
   analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and
   dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in
   cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative,
   and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical
   findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called
   the Angle-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an
   epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a
   metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in
   political sociology.</td>

   any sort for graduate students. In the past 20 years, however, concern
   for teaching excellence has increased, as has evidence of the

   teaching assistants and graduate students teaching their own courses
   receive formal training, an indication of little change in the

   empirical. First, we try to create some unity about what sociologists
   mean by ''the sociological imagination,'' and how they implement this
   concept. We argue that sociologists, like academics in other
   disciplines, fry to speak in a certain ''voice'' which provides a unique
   analytical framework but is distinct from the jargon of the discipline.
   Our second, empirical goal is to assess why students do or do not learn
   the ''voice'' of sociology. We found that certain background
   characteristics df students hinder or help the development of this
   voice. In addition, contradictory, confusing, and competing
   pedagogies-both within sociology and across disciplines-impede the
   development of the sociological imagination.</td>

   implosion of the Soviet empire in 1989-1990 - may be obtained by
   recombining aspects of the sociology of religion analyses of Weber and
   Durkheim. In particular, their complementary notions of 'charisma' and
   'collective effervescence' provide an understanding of how social actors
   in coercive secular states, confronted by a seeming monopoly of the use
   of physical force, are able, in certain exceptional circumstances, to
   mobilise and disarm the state. The assembling of the societal or
   national community is the background to Weber's discussion of
   charismatic leadership and the foreground to Durkheim. The 'velvet
   revolutions' of 1989 in various countries of Eastern Europe may be seen
   as manifestations of an historical moment of 'collective effervescence'
   in which the assembled collectivity itself, more than individual

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the most difficult environmental policy challenges facing the
   United States and other societies is that of finding ways to safely
   dispose of hazardous and toxic substances, including nuclear waste
   materials. Efforts to site such facilities have been uniformly
   unsuccessful, due largely to strong public opposition. Although
   supporters of such facilities often emphasize the potential for local
   economic development and other opportunities, opponents focus on a
   variety of threats involving potential risks associated with waste
   disposal. Survey data collected in rural areas of Nevada and Nebraska
   where nuclear waste disposal facilities have been proposed reveal that
   respondents' positions on issues of perceived health and safety risks,
   trust in responsible agencies, anticipated local economic effects, and
   concerns about environmental contamination are key variables predicting
   local response. Even in areas where there may be substantial local
   support for economic opportunities associated with the facilities,
   broad-based fears about nuclear materials and a legacy of distrust in
   the agencies responsible for managing nuclear wastes suggest that
   proposals for such facilities will almost inevitably continue to
   generate strong public opposition.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Sociological efforts to understand environment-society relationships
   fall primarily into four conceptual categories. The first three,
   involving analytical separation, analytical primacy, and balanced
   dualism, all draw distinctions between biophysical and social aspects of
   human experience, with subsequent analyses being based on these a priori
   distinctions. The fourth or constructivist approach questions this
   naturalized dichotomy, calling attention instead to mutual contingency
   or conjoint constitution: What we take to be ''physical facts'' are
   likely to be strongly shaped by social construction processes, and at
   the same time, what we take to be ''strictly social'' will often have
   been shaped in part by taken-for-granted realities of the physical
   world. Technology offers important opportunities for tracing these
   interconnections, being an embodiment of both the physical and the
   social. The point is illustrated with a long-term historical analysis of
   a specific physiographic feature-a mountain-that has undergone little
   overt physical change over the centuries, but has undergone repeated
   changes in its social meanings and uses. Few of the changes would have
   been possible in the absence of the mountain's physiographic
   characteristics; similarly, few would have occurred in the absence of
   changing sociocultural definitions and possibilities. The challenge for
   sociology is not just to recognize the importance of both the physical
   and the social factors, and certainly not to argue over the relative
   importance of the two, but to recognize the extent to which what we rake
   to be ''physical'' and ''social'' factors can be conjointly constituted.</td>

   Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation

   ''pure science'' model dominated, to (3) the domination of the

   explicated in this article. Adapting means altering life and self to
   accommodate to bodily losses and limits and resolving the lost unity
   between body and self It means struggling with rather than against
   illness. The process of adapting consists of three major stages: (1)
   experiencing and defining impairment, (2) making bodily assessments and,
   subsequently, identity trade-offs, as ill people weigh their losses and
   gains and revise their identity goals, and (3) surrendering to the sick
   self by relinquishing control over illness and by flowing with the
   experience of it. Adapting seldom occurs only once. Rather chronically
   ill people are forced to adapt repeatedly as they experience new losses.
   The data consist of 115 interviews about experiencing chronic illness
   and 25 more focused interviews about the body in chronic illness. The
   strategies of grounded theory provided the methods for completing the
   analysis.</td>

   those in the hard sciences. The results are generally consistent with
   previous findings for the hard sciences and suggest that job placement
   in sociology values academic origins over performance. The two strongest
   determinants of the prestige of a first job are the prestige of the
   Ph.D.-granting department and the selectivity of the undergraduate
   institution. In contrast, the effects of predoctorate single- or
   first-authored publications and of mentor's recognition are weak, though
   significant.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>I explore a set of contradictions crucial to Durkheim's work, that
   revolve around the issue of whether modern society (i.e., industrial
   capitalism) is structured according to the principle of individual
   mobility or the principle of caste. Specifically, I analyze Durkheim's
   theories of race, class, and sex to determine if they describe modern
   society in terms of individuals or in terms of castes. I find that
   Durkheim has both a dominant and a subordinate theory for each category.
   I also find that his theories of race and class differ significantly
   from his theories of sex. Durkheim's dominant theories of race and class
   and his subordinate theory of sex are theories of individuals in modern
   society. Conversely, his dominant theory of sex and his subordinate
   theories of race and class are theories of castes in modern society. I
   view Durkheim's social theory as a quintessential construction of
   modernity, and I view Durkheim as a quintessential liberal ''of sorts.''
   I conclude that the contradictions at the heart of Durkheim's social
   theory are contradictions at the heart of modern society-and at the
   heart of liberal ideology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with a recent trend toward the revival of
   the ''political culture concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly,
   Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in
   common with the original political culture concept associated with
   Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases,
   the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither
   political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central
   problem addressed in this article and one to follow I hypothesize that
   this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an
   historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual
   network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into
   Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology
   of concept formation is introduced to analyze historically and
   empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual
   network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and
   sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional
   analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual
   network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American
   citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of
   social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that
   continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.</td>

   of social psychological integration, this study examines students'
   access to initial funding, resources in the department, indicators of
   prior ability, current professional activities, mentoring processes, and
   social psychological factors for their effects on socialization into the
   academic profession.  Access to initial funding and to mentoring have
   substantial effects on PhD students' professional socialization, but
   prove to be less than rational processes in the graduate program.  This
   socialization process is found to be based more on particularistic than
   on universalistic criteria in the allocation of departmental resources
   and mentoring.  Implications for graduate student mentoring, funding,

   introductory sociology textbooks and the scholarly activity of their
   respective authors.  Although all four texts use a wide array of source
   material to support their positions, we found substantial differences in
   the sources selected as noteworthy, including a heavy reliance on
   nonacademic sources such as newspapers and weekly magazines.  The use of
   popular sources was associated with the author's scholarly publication
   records:  stronger records coincided with a more scientifically grounded
   presentation of the discipline.  Despite the limitations of the standard
   introductory textbook, we view it as the best way to convey the content
   of sociology.  Also, because most students probably base their
   perceptions of sociology on the introductory course, the textbook plays
   a pivotal role:  how source materials are used to present sociology in
   introductory textbooks may affect students' perceptions about the
   utility of the discipline.</td>

   scientific study of social order.  Recently this scientific foundation
   has been attacked by both liberals and conservatives.  The attacks have
   left the discipline vulnerable both inside and outside academia.  This
   paper argues that other sciences have faced similar problems.  By
   following their example and by teaching sociology courses as laboratory
   sciences, we are most likely to legitimate the knowledge of the
   discipline and overcome public and student skepticism.  Improvements in
   computer software offer a growing number of laboratory options for
   classroom use, including surveys of students, which permit scientific
   demonstrations of social facts.  Although such surveys are not new to
   the discipline, they should be used more frequently to overcome
   students' skepticism and to motivate students to pursue independent
   social investigations.</td>

   had a greater influence on sociology than vice versa: several core
   subfields of sociology - such as labor market sociology, stratification,
   and work and organizations - have been significantly influenced by
   economic theories; but sociology has had relatively little impact on
   economics. Communication between economics and sociology is hindered by
   intellectual barriers such as fundamentally different assumptions with
   regard to the roles of induction and deduction, as well as by
   institutional and professional obstacles. Opportunities are growing for
   integrating sociological and economic explanations, as the interests of
   sociologists and economists are converging and more work is now

   and political sociology. It then details some lessons that political
   sociologists might take from four contemporary literatures in political
   science: (1) rational choice work on rational individual action in
   institutional context; (2) the ''nonlinear social systems'' literature
   on the contextual determination of intensely embedded social actions;
   (3) the game-theoretic literature on strategic interactions among large
   emergent class and state actors; and (4) a more qualitative inductive,
   and contextualized approach to the analysis of class and state action
   extending the tradition of Barrington Moore. The four literatures share
   a commitment to social action that is decreasingly common among
   sociologists. Yet they address questions of institutional constraint,
   contextual dynamics, and macrosocial history akin to those that are
   engaging their sociological contemporaries. This balance of attention
   between action and its constraints is the common element drawn from the
   several instructive political science literatures.</td>

   frequently from psychologists than the reverse. This is in part because
   sociologists more often assess the degree to which status
   characteristics, social relationships, and structural contexts influence
   individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, while psychologists more
   often explicate the mechanisms through which such social factors affect
   individuals. I illustrate these differences by discussing points of
   parallel theoretical development between the two disciplines,
   substantive divisions of labor, and selected topics of mutual inquiry.
   Although sociologists benefit substantially from psychologists' work,
   sociologists could offer their counterparts more pointed demonstrations
   that sociological mechanisms are crucial for explaining key
   psychological phenomena and that structural contexts constrain
   individuals' behaviors in ways often overlooked by psychologists.</td>

   scientific study of religion. Sociology has made considerable progress
   by incorporating specialized knowledge of religion from disciplines
   ranging from gerontology and community psychology to religious
   economics, church history, and even theology. Sociology has also
   generated insights in other disciplines concerned with the study of
   religion, at times shaping the types of questions asked, the concepts
   and research methods employed, and the conclusions reached in these
   fields. To elaborate our arguments, iue focus on two important
   substantive areas: (1) research on the relationships between religion,
   meaning systems, and personal well-being; and (2) research on religious
   behavior and religious markets. We underscore the integrative role of
   sociology, and identify several neglected opportunities for synthesis.
   In addition, briefly assess the effect of sociology on work in other
   disciplines and on the functioning of religious organizations.</td>

   environments that have traditionally prevailed in the Black communities
   of the rural South and urban non-South. We emphasize regional variations
   in (1) the social role of religious institutions, (2) the availability
   of alternative lifestyles and secular opportunities for status and
   resources, and (3) the social norms and community expectations regarding
   church involvement A series of hypotheses regarding patterns and
   correlates of church participation are then tested, using data from the
   National Survey of Black Americans. Findings indicate that historical
   regional variations in African American religious life persist in the
   contemporary period. Moreover, our results suggest that the rural
   southern Black church retains ifs traditional ''semi-involuntary''
   character and we discuss the broader theoretical implications of this
   issue for future research in the sociology of religion.</td>

   strategies for overcoming our poor public image.  Seven strategies for
   doing so are discussed:  (1) Write clearly.  (2) Write for a mass

   reviews transition theory and argues for the theoretical importance of
   institutional factors in fertility decline. Sub-Saharan Africa serves as
   the locus of the analysis because it remains the world region with the
   highest fertility and the one in which the transition is just beginning.
   The organization of agricultural production is hypothesized to be
   important for fertility behavior and is identified as one of three
   institutional areas in which rural sociology may be uniquely qualified
   to contribute.</td>

   to social distance, the author provides an extension of the aspects of
   territorialization to the entire globe.  A global sociology requires a
   reactivation and global application of two nearly forgotten
   subdisciplines:  sphragistics, that is, the discipline that investigates
   ideas and practices related to the use of seals and signet rings; and
   ekistics, that is, the scientific study of human settlements.  Among the
   subconcepts that are elaborated in service to these developments are
   home territorialization, boundaried communication, and the
   territorialization of the body politic.  Examples are drawn from
   post-cold war developments in Eastern Europe.</td>

   innovative entrepreneurship, on business cycles, and on the modern
   corporation have attracted muck attention among social scientists.
   Although Schumpeter's theoretical and sociological writings resemble the
   works of Marx, Durkheim and Weber in that they further our understanding
   of the rise and nature of modern society, his contribution to social
   theory has yet to be assessed systematically, Arguing that Schumpeter's
   perspective, if understood in social theoretical terms, provides a
   promising starting point for the sociological analysis of the changing
   relationship between economy and society, I concentrate on two elements
   of his work that are of value to theoretical sociology today: the
   distinction between creative action and rational action that is
   fundamental to his theory of the entrepreneur and his thesis that the
   success of the capitalist system leads to its demise.</td>

   extending his theory of the conscious subject to the feminist concern
   with the issue of domination. We present a theoretical analysis of the
   subjective and intersubjective experiences of individuals relating to
   each other as dominant and subordinate; as our theoretical point of
   departure we use Schutz's concepts of the we-relation, the assumption of
   reciprocity of perspectives, typification, working,
   taken-for-grantedness, and relevance. Schutz's sociology of the
   conscious subject is striking in its lack of any extended consideration
   of power; perhaps one reason why support for his work has diminished
   since the mid-1970s. Our overlayering of feminist sociological theory's
   interest in domination with Schutz's concerns about subjectivity and
   intersubjectivity produces an elaboration and a critique of Schutz and
   expands feminist understanding of relationships of domination.</td>

   driven by a calculus of expected utility. We believe these efforts to
   extend microeconomic models to extraeconomic exchange can benefit from
   specification of societal constraints on individual choice. One type of
   constraint locates the actor in an evolving network of social ties that
   limit opportunities for exchange. Another approach assumes that choices
   are influenced by unintended outcomes that operate behind the backs of
   the actors. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years
   incorporating social structure and unintended consequences into formal
   models based on individual choice optimization. We critically examine
   leading contributions to network exchange theory (part 1) and
   evolutionary models of collective action (part 2), and assess how these
   and related developments may shape the future of rational choice theory
   and its place within sociology.</td>

   departments in the United States. An assessment is provided of both
   positive developments and problems experienced by departments and the
   discipline in general. Issues examined include student enrollment and
   degree recipients over the last two decades, enrollment trends in other
   disciplines, recent trends in advertised sociology faculty positions,
   the status of women and minorities, and which departments have and have
   not been eliminated. Based upon this assessment and the growing
   literature in the field dealing with these issues, future prospects for
   departments are discussed, problem areas are identified, and
   recommendations are made concerning the strengthening of the profession.
   While recognizing the challenges faced by sociology, this appraisal
   suggests that negative perceptions within the discipline concerning
   these difficulties can become exaggerated. Attention is directed to
   several issues affecting the status of sociology, including the effects
   of a ''rhetoric of despair.''</td>

   crisis are traced to the acceptance of outside values, ideological and
   otherwise, as a means of specifying what is and is not sociologically
   appropriate. As this occurs, we become more and more an adjunct of other
   intellectual and policy-oriented projects, becoming less and less a

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In Goffman's introduction to Interaction Ritual, he implores
   sociologists ''to identify the countless patterns and natural sequences
   of behavior occurring whenever persons come into one another's immediate
   presence.''  This article, in addressing Goffman's entreaty, amalgamates
   a number of sociological theories on interaction ritual from Durkheim
   and Goffman with others in contemporary literatures in the sociology of
   emotions and social psychology to describe a set of ''patterns and
   natural sequences of behavior'' imbedded in voices of interaction
   partners.  These patterns are shown to establish an element of social
   structure, and this research describes an objective method of
   identifying and measuring this element that previously was known on a
   qualitative basis alone.  A social status ordering pattern founded upon
   interpersonal deference and power relations is identified through
   analysis of acoustic energy levels in voices of interview partners. 
   Nonverbal measures are performed using a dual-channel Fast Fourier
   Transform analyzer and results are explained using a carrier spectrum
   model.  This report sets forth an interesting new way of objectively
   measuring the macro social constraints on micro interaction.</td>

   reflected on how best to characterize Gilbreth's management of women, I
   began to see that my notion of how to write critical, historical
   biography rested heavily on a binary, modernist conceptual foundation.
   My research experience rocked this foundation by convincing me that we
   should see selves as multiple and interests as malleable, and that we
   should broaden our conception of power to include disciplinary power
   which circulates through people rather than belonging to them. The paper
   concludes by affirming the merits of new ways of writing about people
   that acknowledge their multiple selves without sacrificing the political
   strength of modernist language.</td>

   pass slowly (protracted duration) when conscious information processing
   is high; lived time is perceived to be synchronized with clock time
   (synchronicity) when conscious information processing is moderate; and
   lived time is perceived to have passed quickly (temporal compression)
   when conscious information processing is low. We examine that portion of
   the theory concerning temporal compression in light of empirical
   materials. Since episodic memory erodes as time passes, we hypothesize
   that this generates the experience of temporal compression by lowering
   the density of conscious information processing. Our data were drawn
   from three different age cohorts, and we find strong support for the
   hypothesis.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The social philosophy of meaning and emotions represented in the work of
   Susanne Langer was recognized by Talcott Parsons, but has yet to be
   incorporated into mainstream sociological theoritizations.  Langer's
   work is as potentially important to contemporary microsociology, and the
   sociology of emotions, as the work of Peirce, Mead, or Schutz.  The
   impediment to appreciating her work resides in contemporary confusions
   regarding the nature of logic.  Sociologists often subscribe to
   Wittgenstein's denial of the validity of formal logic in constructing
   theories of human behavior.  Langer has been misunderstood because her
   theoretizations address more than discursive logics and meanings.  The
   thrust of Langer's work is that logic and meaning exist on a
   nondiscursive level of emotions.  Though her work is more than 50 years
   old, we are now in a position to appreciate it because we are now
   exploring and conceptualizing the notion of social inferencing as
   existing beyond formal logic.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research has revealed that war-making has played an important
   role in molding society and has precipitated a new look at
   state-building, the relationship between the state and society, and the
   ties between war-making and capitalism. In this study, I illuminate
   weaknesses in the received view of regional processes, and I demonstrate
   the value of bringing the state into analyses of regional
   transformation. Case studies of the steel industry, airframe
   manufacturers, and military installations contrast pre- and postwar
   trends to determine if the state's World War II investments transformed
   regional processes or if wartime investments merely reinforced processes
   that were already underway. For the steel industry, the
   civilian-oriented and economistic reasoning of the received view of
   regional processes is most persuasive. In contrast, the state's wartime
   logistic and strategic priorities molded the dramatic expansion of U.S.
   military bases during the war-growth machine politics played an
   important secondary role. The airframe industry offers the most
   interesting case-the economic influences on this industry intersected
   with both military and political factors. Thus, this study provides
   evidence that regional processes are molded by the overlapping, and at
   times competing, needs for use of space by economic, political, and
   military actors. The immediate lesson is that it is important to bring
   the study of war-making into the sociological mainstream.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In a thought-provoking appraisal of the state of macrosociological
   theory, Gerhard Lenski argues that its shortcomings can be rectified, in
   part, by reference to nomological reasoning. Moreover, developments in
   behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics offer
   interesting insights into analyses of social behavior across time and
   space and, in the process, reveal some useful hints about the manner in
   which sociocultural theorists might proceed in developing more elegant
   theoretical statements. With these considerations in mind, the argument
   elaborated in this essay suggests: (1) that contemporary sociocultural
   science has much to contribute to the development of a general theory of
   social behavior; (2) that theory refinement in the sociocultural
   sciences can be enhanced significantly by reference to general
   principles (specifically, an amended version of the ''maximization
   principle'') developed in recent years in the evolutionary behavioral
   sciences; and (3) that reliance on such general analytical principles is
   enormously helpful in clarifying some seemingly troublesome theoretical
   problems in, for example, studies of social demography and human ecology
   and of social stratification and mobility.</td>

   widespread attention in social science. Having sat out the spirited
   debates over sociobiology in the 1970s, most sociologists are largely
   unaware that the field has prospered and is now a respected,
   interdisciplinary science with a growing number of influential scholars
   within the social sciences. This article takes a critical look at
   sociobiology with a consideration of both its historical origins and its
   now modified theoretical stance, which is exemplified by Timothy
   Crippen's article 'Toward a Neo-Darwinian Sociology.'' In addition, this
   essay summarizes an alternative approach that might be called
   ''evolutionary sociology. '' While it also incorporates the Modem
   Synthesis, it uses established sociological methods and theory, along
   with primate data and the fossil and archaeological records, to consider
   the biological legacy of humankind.</td>

   these general reservations are grounded in an unnecessary fear of
   resurgent Social Darwinism, unwarranted concerns regarding determinism

   crisis'' and the message from the history of science that the crisis may
   be susceptible to resolution through an application of a general law
   pertaining to a neighboring science (sociobiology in our case). From
   here, the article proceeds to pinpoint the basic argument of Professor
   Crippen's article (this issue) and then critically examines the two
   articles that critically accompany it. We find some errors of
   interpretation in Professor Maryanski's article, but on the whole it is
   a constructive critique of Crippen's essay and a related invitation to a
   biologically informed evolutionary sociology. By contrast, Professor
   Freese's interminable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and
   in the process offers a tortuous, tendentious itinerary of politically
   correct interpretations of scientific inquiry in general and
   sociobiological science in particular.</td>

   that the sports media reinforce a masculine sports hegemony through

   the presentation of female athletes as driven by cooperation rather than

   within the social sciences to ignore temporality and, consequently,
   historical contingency in social processes. These critical assessments
   have generated alternative formal research methods that either (a)
   continue to use variable-centered procedures but allow relations between
   variables to change through time, or (b) abandon variable-centered
   procedures altogether and move exclusively to event-centered analyses.
   After considering alternative conceptions of historically contingent
   determination that may be produced by two different formal methods
   (time-varying parameter regression and event structure analysis), the
   authors design a combined strategy that temporally nests interdependent
   forms of contingency and illustrates the approach in an empirical
   analysis of the  ''relief explosion'' in the late 1960s. Contrary to
   exhortations for exclusivist strategies, the results suggest that
   variable-centered and event-centered methods can be fruitfully combined
   In particular event structure analysis is shown to be a useful
   qualitative procedure for ''unpacking'' and interpreting quantitative
   turning points in time-varying parameter time series models. This
   strategy allows macroquantitative and historical/cultural processes to
   be integrated with formal methods.</td>

   intellectual contributions as a sociologist and social theorist.  Among
   his nearly 2000 published writings, The Philadelphia Negro and Souls of
   Black Folk have all the qualities of classic works.  Yet, neither has
   been officially canonized by sociology.  The exclusion of Du Bois can be
   explained with tolerable plausibility by reference to his two key
   concepts in Souls of Black Folk:  the veil and the double-self.  One can
   only wonder what might have been significantly different about
   sociology, especially its theories of the Self and of field studies of

   the novels as well as the conventional texts of political theory, it
   reveals a political program for reform of the ancient regime.  This
   reform is founded on a reform of domestic mores.  Rousseau's attendant
   conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more
   unified than that found in modern sociology.  Rousseau shows that the
   domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a ''modern''

   academic discourse.  Style and its evaluation, I argue, are not givens,
   but are created and negotiated by a body of readers, judging a text.  To
   explain the process by which style comes to be known, I choose the case
   of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in
   1899.  I demonstrate that style was always important in the
   interpretation of his work, and that this ''classic'' can be read as
   literature, scholarly discourse, humor, or poor writing-or a combination
   thereof.  A consensus on the qualities of Veblen's style has never
   emerged.  Focusing on claims emphasizing Veblen's irony, I suggest that
   an ironic interpretation is particularly likely when an author analyzes
   those with superior status.</td>

   sociology, a less capital-intensive discipline. An ordinary least
   squares analysis of the careers of 100 PhD graduates from the class of
   1976 finds that sustained employment in a Doctor of Philosophy
   (PhD)-level department is associated with increased productivity. The
   amount of variance explained is similar to that in studies of the hard

   Essentially, this paper argues that the turbulent transition period of
   this decade is one that may be characterised as a 'new world of new
   worlds', presenting a vast ensemble of challenges for the sociological
   analysis of modernity. A historical perspective with previous periods of
   transition from one social order to the next is proposed, as well as a
   discussion of salient general socio-psychological features of the
   contemporary situation, such as changes in collective identity. Finally,
   attention is given to a methodological approach suitable to make sense

   with the development of producer services in two deindustrializing urban
   communities - the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) of
   Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Sample surveys of producer services in each
   metropolitan area reveal that establishments: (1) tend to be primarily
   dependent upon the revenue generated by local trade within the local
   metropolitan area; (2) tend to simultaneously engage in nonlocal trade
   and directly contribute to interurban integration and dominance of large
   metropolitan centers; and (3) engage most extensively in trade, both
   locally and nonlocally, with other service-sector industries, rather
   than manufacturing. These findings suggest that producer services
   development may be sustained in deindustrializing urban communities and
   that it is not primarily dependent upon trade with locally based
   manufacturing industry.</td>

   substantial disciplinary variation in perceptions that one's field is
   stagnant. We examine the extent to which variation in pessimism about
   the intellectual state of one's field can be explained by theories that
   attribute it to field-level variation in anomie and consensus. We also
   examine the effects of individual-level characteristics on disciplinary
   discontent using a multilevel analysis. We find that both anomie and
   consensus exert strong effects on the average levels of scholarly
   pessimism within fields. In addition, there is an interaction effect
   involving the level of consensus in a field and whether the field is
   primarily pure or applied. The multilevel analysis shows that the
   effects of field-level variables are not attributable to compositional
   differences in individual characteristics and that, as a group, the
   field-level variables are stronger determinants of scholarly pessimism

   article on country music and suicide. First, Mauk et al.'s charge that
   suicide is an individual act that cannot be assessed through group
   statistics is a paradigmatic critique that can be leveled against the
   bulk of sociological work on suicide. The position of Mauk et al. is
   precisely that which Durkheim ([1897] 1966) polemicized against in order
   to legitimate the discipline of sociology in the nineteenth century.
   Second, their notion that ''psychological autopsies'' constitute the
   only legitimate methodology for studying suicide is an overstatement.
   Third, the noted ecological fallacy problems can, in fact, be remedied
   through properly specified models. Many ecological relationships
   involving suicide have been replicated with individual-level data.
   Fourth, the charges that our subcultural argument is ''barely implied'
   and that the notion of a country music subculture is a myth are
   inaccurate. We reiterate our subcultural theory as well as the evidence
   in support of such a subculture.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We examine the conditions that affected the progressivity of the
   individual income tax in the United States between 1916 and 1986. A
   multivariate time-series analysis shows how macroeconomic conditions,
   state imperatives, the organizational capacities of social classes, and
   political conditions have affected the progressivity and the symbolic
   component of the income tax. Progressivity is measured by the difference
   between the effective tax rates paid by moderate income and very high
   income families. The symbolic component of this tax is measured by the
   difference between the nominal tax rate and effective income tax rate
   paid by very high income families. The results reveal that changes in
   tax progressivity are due largely to macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions, such as unemployment, economic development, and budget
   deficits, although the organizational capacities of social classes and
   political conditions, such as labor organization and political
   participation, also have effects. Changes in progressivity are due
   primarily to adjustments in the rates paid by very high income families.
   However the impacts of these conditions on tax progressivity changed
   somewhat when the federal income tax was transformed into a mass tax
   during World War II. Finally, political conditions have a relatively
   greater effect on the symbolic component of the income tax than on
   progressivity. Overall, this analysis supports a structural theory of
   the state in which the influences of politics and social classes on
   revenue extraction are circumscribed by macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions.</td>

   often defined politically as crime, are defined by their actors as
   necessary, legitimate, and morally appropriate. We then link this
   concept to two distinct substantive subfields of sociology: (1)
   criminology and the sociology of deviance and social control, and (2)
   political sociology and the sociology of social movements. A review of
   the literature on organized defiance suggests a clear theoretical
   confluence between the microstructural concept of biographic
   availability, drawn from the resource mobilization and political process
   perspectives within the sociology of social movements, and social
   control theories of crime and deviance. Likewise, there is a similar
   confluence between the socialization effects of prior activism, also
   from the resource mobilization perspective, and differential
   association/social learning theory in criminology. Finally, we present
   results from a study of the defiant activities of some members of the
   sanctuary movement. The form of defiance examined here, the smuggling of
   undocumented Central Americans across the United States-Mexico border,
   provides a unique test of the scope and power of both social control and
   social learning theories.  Based on self-report survey data collected
   form a sample of 141 participants in the Tuscon, Arizona, sanctuary
   movement, our findings provide strong support for social learning theory
   but fail to support social control theory.  In fact, the observed
   effects of the control theory variables are generally in a direction
   opposite to that predicted by the theory.  Implications of the study for
   the theoretical development of criminology and deviance and for the
   sociological study of social movements are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Most students learn how sociologists study class in introductory
   sociology courses. This exposure also influences how students think
   about class stratification; thus it is important to know how
   Introductory textbooks portray this stratification. Sociologists
   conceptualize class in two principal ways. Distributional approaches
   depict classes as aggregates of individuals possessing some criterion
   (e.g., income). These conceptions label people descriptively, but cannot
   designate the social forces at work in class stratification, Relational
   approaches focus on relations of control and subordination which are
   established through interactions; they highlight the potential for
   conflict among classes as well as the existence of a system of
   oppression and privilege. Both approaches teach students about
   inequality, but in very different terms. A content analysis shows that
   depictions of class stratification in 15 introductory texts are
   overwhelmingly distributional This finding has implications for how
   instructors portray class stratification in contemporary societies.</td>

   informal writing assignments can facilitate learning. Two classes of
   Introduction to Sociology were taught back-to-back in the same way by
   the same professor, during the fall 1992 semester In each class,
   students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. a journal-writing
   group or an attendance group. In one class, journals were collected
   three times a semester on random, unannounced dates; in the other class,
   journals were collected at the end of the semester, on the day of the
   final. Essay examinations and multiple-choice examinations were given.
   Attendance was recorded in each class. It was hypothesized that students
   who kept journals would ha ve significantly higher test scores than
   students who did not keep journals, and that students who kept journals
   in the class in which journals were routinely collected would have
   higher test scores than students who kept journals in the class in which
   journals were collected only at the end of the semester Neither
   hypothesis was supported, but number of absences and prior grade point
   average did explain variances in essay scores and multiple-choice
   scores. This finding suggests that professors may be justified in
   requiring attendance as a strategy for increased learning.</td>

   religion, but as the declining scope of religious authority. A focus on
   religious authority (1) is more consistent with recent developments in
   social theory than is a preoccupation with religion; (2) draws on and
   develops what is best in the secularization literature; and (3) reclaims
   a neglected Weberian insight concerning the sociological analysis of
   religion. Several descriptive and theoretical ''pay-offs'' of this
   conceptual innovation are discussed: new hypotheses concerning the
   relationship between religion and social movements; the enhanced
   capacity to conceptually apprehend and empirically investigate
   secularization among societies, organizations, and individuals; and
   clearer theoretical connections between secularization and other
   sociological literatures. Ironically, these connections may indeed spell
   the end of secularization theory as a distinct body of theory, but in a
   different way than previously appreciated.</td>

   first classic. Rereading it 100 years later enables us to see major
   domains of the contemporary world where its analysis remains, of
   actuality, heuristic or yet to be fully appreciated: for example, its
   themes of anomie as economic deregulation and corporatism as an
   institutional arrangement to deal with anomie. At the same time,
   Durkheims discourse reflects its historical embeddedness, such as his
   discussion of the sexual division of labor, which needs to be reworked.
   A second feature of emergent contemporary social solidarity unforeseen
   by Durkheim (and the great majority of theorists of change) is what may

   consciousnesses and the division of labor. The former is best evident
   among primitive societies where a ''mechanical solidarity,'' evidenced
   by repressive law, prevails; the latter in advanced societies where
   populations evidence greater ''dynamic density,'' and juridical rules
   define the nature and relations of functions. In combating individualism
   and basing the existence of societies on a ''consensus of parts, ''
   Durkheim refutes his positivistic emphasis which denies the relevance of
   ends to a scientific study of society. In his discussion of social ends
   is a latent anti-mechanistic trend. The theory of unilinear development
   is established on deficient ethnographic data. It assumes the absence of
   division of labor among primitive societies and of any ''mechanical
   solidarity'' among modem societies. Repressive and restitutive law
   Durkheim seeks to use as indexes of mechanical and organic solidarity,
   but he does not establish with any precision the perfect associations
   which he assumes obtain between his types of solidarity and of law.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>What was Durkheim doing-in the sense of an intended social action-in
   writing De la Division du travail social? At least a part of the answer
   is that Durkheim's project was linguistic-i.e., he was attempting to
   replace an outworn vocabulary of Cartesian metaphysics with a more
   Germanic lexicon-one in which simplicity gave way to complexity, the
   abstract to the concrete, the ideal to the real deduction to induction,
   rationalism to empiricism, and so on. To some extent, this was motivated
   by the superiority-widely acknowledged among intellectuals of the Third
   Republic-of German science and Protestant scientific education. But an
   additional motivation was Durkheim's belief that only a real, concrete
   entity-society as a ''thing'' (chose)-could provide an object worthy of
   the veneration of the ''new man'' of the Republic. Durkheim's attempt to
   construct a science of social facts was therefore itself subsidiary to
   another, ''higher'' purpose-i.e., the construction of a moral authority
   (real, concrete, complex) adequate to the needs of the Third French
   Republic. Rather than an end in itself, Durkheim's sociology should thus
   be seen as a means to other ends-i.e., the ''construction'' of a
   particular kind of ''fact''-within a specific social and historical
   context.</td>

   anything but classics. Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society is an
   instance of the former; his Rules of Sociological Method of the latter.
   Both books are based on errors of fact and method. Division of Labor was
   so intentionally the classical theory of modern divided societies that
   Durkheim, son of generations of rabbis, totally misrepresented the facts
   of Ancient Israel. In Rules, Durkheim was so intent on writing the
   canonical text of sociology's methods that he stipulated rules that even
   he (in Suicide) could not use. Durkheim was thus a giant of the
   sociological past because, not in spite of, his errors. He erred because
   he dared to think seriously about the moral issues of his time. Hence,
   the ironic fate of Durkheim's sociology-it led in two different
   directions. From Rules and Suicide came modern empirical sociology. From
   Elementary Forms came all the antimodernists-beginning with
   Levi-Strauss, and from him, Derrida and the others-who became, among
   other things, the most articulate critics of the sociology Durkheim
   helped invent. Such is the genius of classic, if not canonical, authors

   classifier systems.  The first major accomplishments of artificial
   social intelligence (ASI) have been in the realm of theory, where these
   techniques have inspired new theories as well as helping to render
   existing theories more rigorous.  Two application areas for which ASI
   holds great promise are the sociological analysis of written texts and
   data retrieval from the forthcoming Global Information Infrastructure. 
   ASI has already been applied to some kinds of statistical analysis, but
   how competitive it will be with more conventional techniques remains
   unclear.  To take advantage of the opportunities offered by ASI,
   sociologists will have to become more computer literate and will have to
   reconsider the place of programming and computer science in the
   sociological curriculum.  ASI may be a revolutionary approach with the
   potential to rescue sociology from the doldrums into which some
   observers believe it has fallen.</td>

   the master's house.'' In this paper, however we encourage women to seize
   computer tools for their own educational purposes in order to counteract
   the ''null environment'' they experience in the traditional classroom.
   We argue for a proactive feminist pedagogy that enhances women's
   computer learning by demystifying the computer and promoting
   technological equity in the classroom. To accomplish these goals, we
   introduce a quantitative and a qualitative software program which help
   to create a proactive environment that enhances women's computerized
   learning when used in conjunction with feminist pedagogical techniques.
   We also discuss the implications of introducing feminist proactive
   computer learning into the sociology curriculum and, more specifically,
   into the women's studies classroom.</td>

   regular classroom testing in introductory sociology. With computer-based
   testing, each student takes course examinations directly on a computer
   outside the classroom. We present information on how to develop and
   implement such a system, and report results of an evaluation of
   computer-based testing at one university. Practical and pedagogical
   benefits as well as problems of this testing procedure are discussed.
   Faculty members see many practical benefits of using computer-based
   testing in the introductory course, while reporting that educationally
   it is at least as sound as in-class testing. Students generally like the
   flexibility of computer-based testing and find it easy to use. The
   biggest problem is that grades tend to be lower than on in-class tests.
   Alternative uses of computer-based testing also are presented.</td>

   media writers appropriate some frames but not others, and why some
   frames ''resonate '' with broad cultural beliefs. I analyze the rhetoric
   in media accounts from 1985 to 1990 of the dangers posed to children and
   society by heavy metal music and rap music. I also examine the images
   used to amplify each genre of music. Although both genres have lyrical
   and performance elements focusing on sex and defiance of authority
   strong enough to evoke a moral outcry, they evoke quite different
   reactions. I argue that the racial composition of the music's audiences
   and producers shape the way the two genres are perceived.</td>

   traditionally considered to determine or explain television
   usage-availability of free time, low income or class status, low
   education, emotional difficulties, and lack of structured social
   interactions-are not generalizable across the adult life span. The
   television viewing of people over the age of 30 has been understudied-a
   research bias that mirrors society's youth orientation and essentially
   excludes older adults from this model. The author analyzed data
   collected in the National Opinion Research Center's 1988 General Social
   Survey to assess the determinants of television viewing for adults of
   all ages. Results indicate that as persons perceive themselves to be in
   different stages of life and take on age-appropriate roles, tasks, and
   perspectives, they have distinctively different reasons for viewing.
   Second, the factors considered to determine TV viewing in the
   ''traditional'' model fit the pattern of younger adults' viewing best
   while predicting the behavior of the elderly least. The author proposes
   an interpretation of the findings, and discusses future research avenues
   including the development of age-sensitive models and theories.</td>

   lifelong concern with the question of meaning and moral order in modern
   society. This emphasis naturally leads to a consideration of wider
   themes informing Durkheim's sociology of religion than are usually found
   in analyses focusing exclusively on his treatment of primitive religion
   in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1964). Durkheim wes as the
   distinguishing feature of modernity the progressive emancipation of the
   individual from traditional sources of influence. The evolution toward
   greater individuation, culminating in the ''cult of the individual'' or
   ''religion of humanity,'' is set by Durkheim within the context of the
   role of collective ideals in promoting social change and in the
   maintenance of moral order. Religion, the major symbolic expression of
   societal wide ideals, is identified as the key variable which enables
   Durkheim to reconcile the competing demands of individuals for freedom
   with the interests of society in collective welfare.</td>

   This article attempts to address that issue by suggesting that the
   experience of writing is fundamentally sociological. Using Mills'
   concept of the sociological imagination, I suggest that the act of
   composing any written work is a movement from the very personal and
   private to the larger social context of considering one's audience, the
   conventions of writing, and other structural (or public) issues and back
   again to the private and personal. The article concludes with
   implications for instructors who require students to write and who seek
   to help students become more effective writers.</td>

   with teaching sociological theories and concepts to nonsociology majors
   in an interdisciplinary technology and society course and suggests that
   literature encourages these students to exercise the sociological
   imagination. A review of students' weekly response papers and
   examinations showed that they began to learn and understand basic
   sociological concepts and theories while discovering a new technological
   culture through their readings of the autobiographical novels Zen and
   the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance and Rivethead. Tales from the Assembly
   Line, and the more overtly sociological The Electronic Sweatshop.</td>

   other social sciences and other majors, using schools as the unit of
   analysis. I found that study in depth is not very deep overall and that
   sociology majors experience less study in depth than do other majors.
   Sociology majors do, however perceive greater intellectual connections

   connections with personally significant questions and more exploration

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the difficulties of integrating environmental variables into
   sociological analyses is that societies have a dualistic relationship
   with the biophysical environment. Humans are like other species in
   depending on the environment, yet humans are also unique among all
   species in the potential for altering and sometimes evading
   environmental constraints. A second and related difficulty results from
   the degree to which humans incorporate the environment into their
   everyday views of reality; the process often seems so automatic that the
   biophysical realities can be forgotten, taken for granted, or ignored,
   both by residents and by those who study them. This problem is
   particularly significant for studies that fail to be sufficiently
   comparative to be able to observe significant variations in
   environmental and technological factors. The problem is illustrated with
   a study that deals with a relatively traditional social-psychological
   dependent variable-attitudes toward a proposed development. The focus is
   on the apparent paradox of a form of industrial development that has
   been welcomed with open arms in one area of the country while virtually
   opening armed warfare in another, namely drilling for offshore oil. To
   explain the marked differences across regions, it is necessary to
   understand the influence of biophysical and technological variables, as
   well as the social and historical differences across the regions.
   Implications for further research are discussed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Perspectives in sociology are currently being.reassessed in light of
   postmodernism, which has been associated with the abandonment of faith
   in the social self and scientific inquiry. As an emergent problematic,
   postmodernism stands in sharp contrast to a modernist pragmatic (and
   innocent) conception of symbolic interactionism-which is centered in the
   Meadian conception of prosocial selves. However, this article identifies
   some ''late-modem'' interactionists-Goffman, Stone, Becker, Lemert, and
   Mills-who, in providing a corrective for an innocent pragmatic inquiry
   into the self, created a foundation for contemporary inquiry into the
   social. This corrective entailed a reconceptualization of the self as
   the focal point of the situated act and, specifically, its changing
   definition from cooperative and reflective to strategic and imaginary.
   While we suggest that their work represented a loss of innocence in
   interactionism, it did not create a loss of faith in scientific inquiry
   into the self and social action. Rather, the work of the late modernists
   has inspired a reconstruction of scientific inquiry into the social that
   encompasses, but is not encompassed by, postmodernism.</td>

   versus production, choice versus life chances, class similarities versus
   distinctions, and self-control versus conformity in shaping health
   lifestyles and the reality of their operationalization in the postmodern

   law-abiding alternative religion. Conversely, the antisocial and
   criminal aspects of Satanism have been the focus of most lay writing and
   media exposure. Such academic and popular portrayals are reflecting
   different facets of Satanism's heterogeneous nature. Through reexamining
   the literature, this article provides a conceptual framework for
   analyzing the differences between sociological and lay depictions. The
   term ''Satanic Establishment'' is used to refer to the respectable forms
   of Satanism, whereas the ''Satanic Underground'' denotes the
   reputed-criminal elements of Satanism. With the Satanic Establishment
   and Underground at opposite positions, a Satanic continuum of social
   acceptability is proposed.</td>

   pedagogical setting, that draws on the Vietnam War, and I provide a
   synopsis of its content. My purpose is to suggest a strategy for using
   the war as a case study for two topics central to the concerns of
   sociologists-inequality and ideology. Data about the war are marshaled
   to address two questions: ''Were the burdens of war equally
   distributed?'' and ''Was the American military handicapped in Vietnam by
   political constraints?'' To address the first question, I use
   information about the draft, draft policy, and American casualties to
   suggest that policy reproduced institutionalized inequalities of race
   and class. To the second question I bring to bear measures of American
   operations-expenditures and destructive force-and total casualties to
   argue that conservative apologies invoking self-defeating limits ignore
   the magnitude and consequences of our efforts in Vietnam. Within the
   synopsis, I incorporate sources for data, note some problems in the data
   available, make suggestions about interpretation, and address some
   pedagogical issues.</td>

   underpinnings of racial and ethnic relations textbooks. It applies those
   criteria to 10 recent books and summarizes the findings. With few
   exceptions, the textbooks favor assimilationist, cultural pluralist, or
   eclectic approaches. The compilation of social histories is emphasized
   over theory review and evaluation. The debate on the declining
   significance of race receives little attention. Comparative analysis
   reveals a number of problems in these books; for example, eclectic
   approaches are constructed from a set of contradictory assumptions. The
   paper argues that these problems are rooted in the troubled relationship
   between American liberalism and the sociology of racial and ethnic
   relations. It concludes by briefly suggesting how these problems can be

   explaining how different scientific specialties change over time. Such
   specialties are viewed here as organizations in which workers deal with
   various degrees of task uncertainty and mutual dependence. The
   sociological theory of change suggests that scientific change is
   generally triggered by competition, but that various types of change
   depend on the social organization and status of scientific groups. Some
   fields change through permanent discoveries, some through specialization
   and cumulation, yet others change through cognitive fragmentation. This
   argument can synthesize the various independent branches of contemporary
   science studies. The proposed theory has wider significance for some
   core problems in sociology, such as the relationship between the natural
   and social sciences, the prospects for a science of society, and the
   possibility of cumulative progress.</td>

   made substantial contributions to sociological teaching and research.
   Building on his experiences as a student, he holds dear the ideals of a
   liberal education and continues to search for new ways of transmitting
   those ideals in the face of changing social patterns. A prolific writer,
   Francis' books and papers often examine the proper relations between
   theory and research and explore the potential of symbolic interactionism
   as an epistemological framework. He has been active in sociology's
   professional affairs, especially in promoting visual sociology as a
   teaching and learning medium. His roles as a student, professor,
   administrator, and president of the Midwest Sociological Society round
   out a career that has encompassed all facets of modem scholarship. In
   each of these roles, Francis stresses the moral dimensions of the
   academic life, and he instills in his students the sense of intellectual
   obligation to their scholarly forebears that he feels toward his own.</td>

   putting the onus on the critical element within sport sociology to
   confront poststructuralist and postmodernist theorizing, such as

   The present study utilizes an auditory elicitation approach. That is,
   respondents wrote the subjective meanings they associated with the

   social ''embeddedness'' provides a suitable theoretical umbrella,

   place of Durkheim's ''cult of the individual'' in Erving Goffman's
   sociology.1 I have reviewed the most pertinent aspects of Durkheim's
   sociology of religion. This article discusses and/or analyzes the
   development of the cult of the individual primarily within the context
   of Durkheim's (1951) monograph on suicide; Durkheim's notions of sacred,
   profane, and ritual; Goffman's two-pronged intellectual heritage; and
   Goffman's ''Communication Conduct in an Island Community'' (1953) with
   respect to several key Durkheimian concepts. Also discussed are several
   important secondary analyses-primarily those of Jurgen Habermas and
   Stanford Lyman-which help to further delineate the conditions of the
   Durkheim-Goffman link. The final section applies Goffman's sociology to
   the case of Evangelicalism and ''political civility.''</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>One of the central goals of teaching sociology is the development in
   students of sociological perspective, which encourages them to reflect
   on their own society from a distance. The concept of ethnocentrism is
   often introduced in sociology courses to sensitize students to the ways
   in which their perceptions of social life are shaped by the fact that
   they are ''insiders'' to their own society and ''outsiders'' to others.
   Here we discuss a series of instructional techniques built around the
   use of Horace Miner's classic, ''Body Ritual among the Nacirema,'' which
   we have developed and implemented to assist students in developing an
   awareness of social influences on their perceptions and judgments. The
   techniques are based on the observation that ethnocentrism involves two
   forms of distortion, termed ''insider's bias'' and ''outsider's bias.''
   Students must confront both of these in order to develop a full
   appreciation of the subtle impact of culture on perceptions.</td>

   the computer-assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences,
   ''event-structure analysis,'' that infuses narrative with greater rigor

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Refugees are individuals forced to flee from their homelands because of
   categorical persecution or because they are bystanders caught in the
   crossfire of war or civil strife. Such involuntary exile often leads to
   alienation in the most literal sense of the term. Whether expellees,
   escapees, or displaced persons, refugees share a common fate and, often,
   a common destiny: those who are dispossessed are dependent on others to
   provide care, succor, protection, and assistance. Yet responses to their
   plight are almost invariably highly selective, the quality of mercy
   being strained by considerations other than pure altruism. This paper, a
   commentary on the sociology of exile, attempts to convey the sense and
   significance of estrangement and responses to it in both historical and
   contemporary contexts. Early sections deal with concepts and concerns;
   later ones examine United States refugee policies and practices relating
   to exile, ethnicity, and the politics of rescue.</td>

   studies scholarship as a series of identifiable stages, for both
   individuals and disciplines. Literature on the revolutionary and
   paradigm-shift potential of women's studies scholarship suggests
   important disciplinary differences in its construction, adoption, and
   diffusion. We reformulate feminist phase theory in paradigm shift terms,
   then operationalize and contrast two versions of it. Our analysis and
   review indicate that the missing variable in women's studies
   transformation projects is the participants' discipline. Data from our
   integration project show faculty in interpretive disciplines scoring
   higher on degree of integration of women's studies scholarship but not
   changing as a result of the project itself, while those in positivist
   disciplines do change but have lower absolute scores. These findings
   indicate a need for different integration strategies based on
   discipline. Empirical support for one sequential ordering in feminist
   phase theory argues for the importance and centrality of women-focused
   scholarship.</td>

   special reference to their applicability to macrosociology and to other
   branches of sociological inquiry that employ conceptions of social and
   cultural totality. The appropriation is premised on the thesis that
   theories of culture, such as postmodernism, can contribute to sociology
   by their analyses of cultural form, providing sociology with general
   descriptions of what social processes must mediate and with guidance on
   how to grasp its own cultural form(s). Three notions of cultural
   totality, ''bricolage'' (Claude Levi-Strauss), ''discursive formation''
   (Michel Foucault), and ''deconstruction'' (Jacques Derrida), are
   considered. All have in common a description of cultural form that
   stresses nonsystematic order. They are contrasted to Talcott Parsons'
   modernist and systematizing macrotheoretic reflection on culture and
   society. A deconstruction of Parsons yields the alternative of a
   less-than-systematic, postmodernized (macro)-sociology.</td>

   focus on how macrocomparative sociologists address the threats to
   validity which surround sample selection, research design, and data and
   measurement. Nearly all the studies we investigate have explanation as a
   goal. A major threat to many studies (almost a third) is the failure to
   apply any method of control. Most authors wish to draw general
   conclusions, but problems of sampling raise questions about their
   ability to do so. Researchers agree that measurement is problematic.
   However, issues surrounding measurement are largely neglected. We

   consequences. Both population-based and individual models of transitions
   have become more complex, focusing on the ways that social and
   historical contexts shape life transitions. At the individual level,
   progress has also been made in identifying the mechanisms by which
   transitions affect outcomes. Research on life transitions continues to
   grapple with two major issues-the challenges raised by heterogeneity,
   and the need to better link macro and micro perspectives-although
   advances have been made in both cases. One of the most promising

   nutrition can be taught in several settings, including in sociology
   departments as an entire course, in lectures in other courses, or in
   continuing and occasional examples. Sociologists also teach in nutrition
   and food science departments and other applied settings. Three
   approaches to teaching in this area are described: 1) sociology of food
   and nutrition. 2) food and society, and 3) nutritional sociology.
   Practical instructional issues in teaching the sociology of food and
   nutrition include combining the fields of sociology and nutrition, the
   diversity of students, experiential learning, and team teaching.
   Teaching resources include reading materials, audiovisuals, syllabi,
   organizations, and publications. Incorporating food, eating, and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Although the writing-across-the-curriculum movement is nearly 20 years
   old, information about the deliberate use of writing for learning in the
   content areas still is relatively scarce. Most instructors in
   postsecondary social science courses who use writing continue to stress
   the improvement of students' writing skills while neglecting the power
   of writing as a teaching and learning tool in a student-centered
   (collaborative) classroom. Social and cognitive rationales for
   purposeful writing-for-learning assignments are provided, not only to
   enhance communication skills but also to change students' knowledge
   structures through written dialogue and metacognitive questioning. We
   describe the extensive use of a variation of the traditional affective
   classroom journal in an introductory human services course and recommend
   the teaming of a writing instructor with the instructor in the
   discipline.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper explores the possibility of developing a general and formal
   social-action theory of labeling emotions. The theory is based upon the
   assumption that there is an underlying formal structural social-action
   system of expectations and sanctions that significantly influence how
   actors label their emotions. Some permutations of the four basic
   expectation-sanction states are elaborated, hypothetically labeled, and
   tested over a 14-year period.  The ''constructionist'' view of the
   necessity of a cultural context in labeling emotions is challenged by
   removing the ''moral'' content from the survey instrument. The findings
   indicate that the formal model, devoid of content, is effective in
   differentiating emotion labels. The tests yielded promising results for
   developing a comprehensive and formal mapping of emotions. Taxonomical
   extrapolations of the theory are suggested and some further applications
   and needed research are discussed.</td>

   the economic actions undertaken by large firms, while the differences in
   manager or owner or bank control and the presence of bank interlocks do
   not. A sociology of markets is therefore more likely to account for the

   development, but societal relationships with environment and technology
   have changed so fundamentally that extractive industries today appear
   more likely to lead rural regions to economic addiction. Key
   characteristics of addictive activities include rising costs of
   operation at most extractive facilities, combined with downward trends
   in world commodity prices. Key characteristics of vulnerable communities
   and regions include increasing geographic isolation, imbalances of scale
   and power with respect to extractive industries, and the absence of
   realistic alternatives for diversified development. Key pressures toward
   addiction are created by ambiguities that mask the addictive tendencies,
   including ambiguities of price signals, of employment and development
   possibilities for remote regions, and of resource exhaustion. The net
   result is that, while the encouragement to develop extractive industries
   is often coupled with advice to avoid developing an excessive dependency
   on a single economic sector, the very regions and nations having the
   greatest need to hear such advice may also have the lowest realistic
   ability to respond to it.</td>

   observations about the linkages of sociology to its specialties by
   reviewing the changing relationship of sociology and criminology. In the
   United States, the development of criminology as a field of study has
   been closely linked to the development of sociology as a discipline, and
   sociology has given American criminology its distinctive cast.
   Criminology has benefited from theoretical and methodological
   developments in sociology and in tum has contributed to sociology as one
   of its central specialties. In the past two decades, the dominance of
   sociology in criminology has diminished, and criminology has gravitated
   somewhat away from the cen ter of sociology. However, sociology remains
   very much the intellectual 'center of gravity" in criminology, and
   criminology remains an important part of sociology. Both criminology and
   sociology will benefit by a continuation and reinvigoration of their
   prior relationship.</td>

   reproduction of inequality within the sociocultural world of clerical
   workers. A model of a semiotic square is used to analyze the experiences
   of bored and busy work. Through this analysis of bored and busy work,
   the author discovered clerical workers' perceptions and activities which
   were both subordinating and empowering. Clerical workers participate in
   the process of subordination through bored/busy work. However, they also
   participate in empowering strategies through not-bored/not-busy work.
   This sociology of knowledge approach shows that people are not
   automatons and strengthens our understanding of the social reproduction
   of inequality as a multi-faceted phenomenon.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Drawing on a 3-year ethnography and participant observation study of a
   ghetto gym in Chicago, this article purports to (a) de-exoticize the
   subproletarian bodily craft of boxing by uncovering its embedded social
   logic and meaning, and (b) contribute to a theory of practice that
   escapes the false antinomies associated with rational choice and
   normative models of action. The first part explores the peculiar
   relation of symbiotic opposition that ties the boxing gym to its
   proximate social matrix of the black ghetto and to the masculine street
   culture from which it draws its sustenance and shelters its members. The
   second part treats boxing as a Durkheimian "social art" whose mastery
   involves an intensive, ascetic, and strictly regulated manipulation of
   the body designed to inculcate through direct embodiment the set of
   corporeal, visual, and mental schemata immanent to pugilistic practice.
   The social production of the pugilistic habitus as embodied practical
   reason thus suggests the need to place the socialized lived body at the
   center of the analysis of social action.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Previous research contends that when Talcott Parsons developed the
   substantive argument of The Structure of Social Action, he turned away
   from the theoretical emptiness of American social science and drew on
   the ideas of four European social thinkers- Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and
   Marshall. Such research exemplifies the "content-fit model" of
   predecessor selection, which assumes that intellectual predecessors are
   chosen on the basis of a fit between their ideas and the project of the
   thinker who engages them. This model fails to explain Parsons's
   exclusion of the American institutionalists, most notably his Amherst
   teachers Walton Hamilton and Clarence Ayres, whose work fit directly
   with the argument of The Structure of Social Action. Institutionalist
   work was also characterized, however, by its negative reputation,
   particularly at, Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where
   Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber were thinkers of growing
   reputational standing. Examination of Parsons's involvement in the local
   Harvard network indicates that contemporary reputational judgments
   decisively affected his choice of intellectual predecessors. This
   analysis also brings to light the organizational and institutional
   conditions under which a "reputational model" is required to understand
   the process of predecessor selection.</td>

   that foreign investment harms poor nations. These studies have focused
   on the coefficient for foreign capital stock, controlling for "flow"
   (new investment), and-defying logic-have inferred that a negative
   coefficient for stock reflects "dependency effects" that retard economic
   growth. Since capital stock is the denominator for investment rate, the
   greater the stock, the lower the investment rate, for a given level of
   new investment. Hence the negative coefficient for capital stock found
   in dependency studies indicates a beneficial investment effect, not a
   harmful effect. This point is demonstrated by reanalysis of the data
   used in dependency studies. In these data, foreign investment spurs
   growth. Earlier analysts have concluded otherwise only because their
   conclusions have belied their findings.</td>

   science degree programs. At the same time, concern about liability
   issues has intensified in American society as a whole, especially in
   fields such as education, where the possibility of litigation poses a
   greater threat than in the past. This article reviews a variety of
   conditions and situations bearing on the legal responsibilities and
   liabilities of internship courses. Special attention is given to the
   need to carefully screen and prepare students, to acquaint them with the
   variety of placements available, and to take into account any special
   needs they may have. Site visits and seminars are also discussed as a
   means of ensuring quality supervision and sensitizing students to
   potential problems they may encounter in the placement site. The article
   stresses the importance of carefully crafted and legally sound contracts
   and emphasizes the need to consult risk management specialists to ensure
   appropriate and complete insurance coverage.</td>

   tend to provide an ethnocentric portrayal of education by placing the
   United States and other northern industrialized nations at the center of
   the educational universe while virtually ignoring educational issues in
   relation to the three-quarters of the world's population, those who live

   clarification, there has been little hard evidence that small-scale

   community problem variety, in his research. His research employed a
   social systems analysis frequently focused on the rural context and had
   a strong applied orientation with the result that his findings have been
   widely used as the basis for the formulation of important national and
   international program and policy decisions. Bertrand's work has
   attracted wide attention abroad as well as in the United States. Because
   of his many contributions to the discipline of sociology, he has
   received numerous awards and recognitions and has also been elected to
   various offices in professional societies and associations, including
   the presidency of five such groups.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Historical sociologists have criticized their discipline for a tendency
   to ignore the temporal dimensions of social life, either by studying the
   correlates of outcomes rather than the character of temporally connected
   events or by treating events as surface manifestations of large-scale
   and long-term processes of change. These critiques have led to a
   reassessment of the value of narratives and to new methods for mapping
   historical sequences of events. Yet there has been relatively little
   discussion of the concepts needed to create a more event-centered
   historical sociology. This article explores the way in which four
   different concepts of time - duration, pace, trajectory, and cycle -
   have been used in recent historical social science. These concepts allow
   one to analyze the temporal characteristics of connected events that
   constitute long-term historical processes as well as the way in which
   actors understand and experience the temporal flow of events. They are
   most useful, the author argues when employed in a manner that is
   attentive to the understandings of social actors and the problematic
   reconstruction of the past. These concepts constitute building blocks
   for the construction of a more event-centered historical sociology.</td>

   inquiry has come a renewed interest in more general methodological,
   theoretical, and epistemological issues that have long occupied debates
   about the relationship between history and theory. A recently published
   article by Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter brings to the fore several
   core themes in these debates. Kiser and Hechter claim that comparative
   historical sociologists not only have turned against general theory but
   theories in general. The authors argue that these conclusions are based
   on a narrow definition of the enterprise of historical sociology and on
   an attempt to confine the definition of theory to general laws. In this
   article, they first demonstrate that historical sociologists have not
   forsaken theory. Next, they articulate the dilemmas that general
   theories defined as general laws pose for historical analysis, and
   finally, they delineate what methodologically self-conscious historical
   sociologists have identified as the core elements of a temporally
   grounded historical sociology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We examine the structure of sociology using data on overlapping
   memberships in the discipline's "visible colleges," the specialty
   sections of the American Sociological Association. Hypotheses about the
   structure of joint specialization in sociology are derived from four
   general theories of professional and scientific specialization: 
   ideational theory, political-economic theory, professional power theory,
   and intellectual circle/network theory.  We analyze joint specialty
   section memberships using multidimensional scaling techniques and
   produce a spatial model of the discipline's specialty structure.  The
   tightest clusters of specialties arise from the confluence of ideational
   aspects (like shared concepts or subject matter), professional power
   interests, and social characteristics of members.  Although a major
   division in the discipline is embedded in the political-economic
   environment of sociology, three cross-cutting dimensions are required to
   adequately  represent the discipline's structure. The main dimensions of
   differentiation are:  (1) "conflict" versus "applied" perspectives, (2)
   micro versus macro units of analysis, and (3) ascriptive characteristics
   of members. These three dimensions support the validity of
   political-economic, ideational, and professional power theories,
   respectively.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Chances of realizing a legal rationality that does not fit society are
   limited. Referring to Weber's "Sociology of Law," to related themes in
   the sociology of polity, organizations, and occupations, and to recent
   debates on technocratization, juridification, delegalization, and
   responsive law, this article presents a theoretical discussion of this
   thesis. An empirical case, using the neoclassical concept of sentencing
   guidelines, exemplified by the federal and Minnesota cases, supports the
   argument. The neoclassical movement, aiming to reverse the
   substantivation of law and to correct lack of due process, functional
   failures, disparities, and discrimination, faces considerable
   impediments and may result in counterproductive effects. The article
   demonstrates that (1) societal conditions that caused substantivation
   hamper reformalization in the political process; organizational and
   occupational consequences of substantivation also impede (2) political
   and (3) implementation chances of neoclassical instruments; and (4)
   impediments to reformalization derive from the method of central
   guidance used to reestablish sociologically formal rationality.</td>

   Based on an ethnographic study of an English exurban village, I argue
   that the continuum remains an important source of identity for country
   residents, one from which they derive social-psychological and material
   benefits. They root this conception of themselves as country people in
   nature, making this identity a particularly secure one. These real
   social consequences suggest that sociology should no longer doubt the
   reality of the rural-urban continuum, at least at the level of the
   definition of the situation. It, therefore, should remain an important

   rarely formulated explicitly, the first three approaches are implicit in
   the existing literature on proliferation.  All three see proliferation
   as the result of rational decision making, although they differ as to
   the locus of these decisions, with strategic-functional theories
   focusing on the nation-state, factional theories on subnational
   interests, and geopolitical theories on global superpowers.  In
   contrast, the institutional approach disputes the rationality of
   procurement, arguing instead that weapons purchases are structured and
   driven by institutionalized normative structures that link advanced
   weaponry with modernization and soverignty.  The policy implications of
   this perspective are discussed, and parallels to recent developments in
   organizational theory are highlighted.</td>

   sociology: total segregation, as in all-male faculties; appointments of
   women in token or solo positions; variations in the departmental faculty
   sex ratio; and the "ghettoization" of women in lower academic ranks and
   positions with heavy committee assignments. These outcomes are analyzed
   at the organizational level as the product of the operation of internal
   and external labor markets in academia. Drawing on a representative 1984
   national survey of sociology departments (N = 230), multivariate
   analyses indicate that a large proportion of the variation in gender
   integration from one department to the next can be predicted from the
   organizational context. Several organizational factors appear to
   militate against total segregation (all-male faculties) while promoting
   balance in the faculty sex ratio and in the distribution of academic
   rank. These include demand for labor in the form of job opportunities,
   especially those created through turnover; women in the institutional
   power structure, including a separate women's studies program; and a
   state legislative climate favoring women's legal and political rights.</td>

   social structure affects intergroup relations.  This relationship
   depends upon the opportunity for intergroup contact.  Previous tests of
   Blau's theory, however, treat opportunity as an unmeasured construct. 
   P*, as a measure of opportunity for intergroup contact, not only enables
   a test of that assumption, but also merges general sociological
   principles with specific middle-range ones like those urban sociology
   develops.Findings here modestly support Blau's opportunity for contact
   assumption.  Serendipitously, the analysis demonstrates that
   heterogeneity asymmetrically influences opportunities for intergroup
   contact between groups of varying size.  Because increasing
   heterogeneity presupposes an increase in the minority proportion and a
   decrease in the majority, it enhances majority and suppresses minority
   opportunities for intergroup contact.  This suggests that Blau's
   heterogeneity theorem, which assumes a symmetrical effect on contact,
   needs some qualification.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>It is relatively easy to determine if evidence supports or does not
   support a given theory or conclusion, but a central problem in sociology
   is our inability to go beyond this and develop truly convincing evidence
   about a theory.  Several changes in current practices are vital,
   including the cessation of nonproductive assaults between sociologists
   on the evidence used in the discipline.  More fundamentally, theory
   should not be viewed as one pole of a continuum with research on the
   other end.  A probabilistic view of theory is proposed such that a
   theory may be correct even if there is negative evidence.  This leads to
   a different way of evaluating evidence, a different view of the role of
   examples, a distinction between explanations of particular events as
   opposed to evaluations of theories, skepticism about the possibility of
   developing theories that account for long complex chains of events, and
   a sharp differentiation between the evidence used in applied as opposed
   to basic research.  A new sociological specialty should concern itself
   with epistemological issues that arise in determining the verifiable
   propositions that are the basic building blocks to sociological
   knowledge.</td>

   differences between organizations of different tax status (nonprofit vs.
   forprofit). These findings directly contradict economic theories of
   nonprofit organization, as well as third-party government theory from
   political science. Since ecological theory in sociology proposes a
   useful explanation for organizational similarities, the authors search
   for differences between nonprofit and forprofit organizations among
   generalists and specialists. They find that specialists are quite
   similar, regardless of tax status, but generalists are different, a
   disparity that seems to contradict ecological analysis. Since
   institutional theory also explains isomorphism, the authors search for
   differences between organizations that do and do not belong to chains.
   Chains are more similar than nonchains. The discussion of the results
   centers on changes in the institutional context of home health care over
   the last decade, especially cascade effects of prospective payment
   schemes and the advent of new organizational forms. The authors conclude
   that the idea of accommodative isomorphism helps account for
   similarities among nonprofit and for-profit chains.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Educators have long recognized the importance of teaching critical
   thinking skills in the college classroom.  A core group of sociology
   faculty members at a midwestern university introduced critical thinking
   into their introductory sociology courses as a specific instructional
   component.  In this paper we review the objectives of four instructional
   programs and the specific strategies these faculty members used in
   nurturing critical reasoning skills.  We developed a four-page
   questionnaire to assess the students' perceptions of these programs. 
   Overall the programs appear effective in the eyes of the students; 70
   percent believed they had adequate opportunities to develop their
   critical reasoning skills, and 62 percent reported an increase in those
   skills.  We discuss the findings from this project in terms of the
   relevance of critical thinking to the sociology curriculum.</td>

   ratings of each major regarding the development of basic employment
   skills.  We found that, in relation to other social science majors, the
   sociology major received mediocre ratings in developing such skills.  We
   note improvement of this rating, however.  The highest ratings were
   given by nonwhite males and the lowest by nonwhite females.  We also
   found a substantial income gap between the genders among CSU social
   science alumni regardless of race, parents' educational level, GPA, or

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As a result of environmental and agrarian activism and of academic
   critique, a substantial amount of space is available now for moving
   agricultural technoscience onto new trajectories. A critical rural
   sociology has played a key role in pushing forward the deconstructive
   project that has been instrumental in creating this space. And rural
   sociologists can be active agents in the reconstruction of the
   alternative science that must emerge from "actually existing" science
   and that must be developed if there is to be a truly alternative
   agriculture. But to be effective in this effort we need to enlarge not
   only the canon of our colleagues in the natural sciences, but our own
   canon as well. This article suggests that the theoretical resources for
   such reconstruction are available in contemporary sociological and
   feminist interpretations of science. Material resources for the
   reconstruction of a "successor science" are to be found in the "local
   knowledge" that is continually produced and reproduced by farmers and
   agricultural workers. Articulations and complementarities between
   theoretical resources are suggested and potentially productive research
   areas are outlined.</td>

   preference for academic achievement "on schedule." Unlike most other
   societies with formalized education, however, we also tolerate
   educational late blooming. The preference for blooming "on time" may be
   explained by the positive social functions of scheduling educational
   success. Such rigidity in the American experience, however, would run
   counter to the value we place on higher education as a medium for
   equality of opportunity and would threaten the existence of many
   institutions of higher learning that serve specialized markets. While
   the American tolerance for educational late blooming has created
   opportunities not found in other societies, late blooming may also have
   the latent dysfunction of encouraging "temporal loafing. "</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper situates metatheorizing in a postpositivist approach to
   social science.  Postpositivism contends that social science is
   organized around competing traditions, which are comprised of
   generalized discourse and research programs.  Following an examination
   of the relations between discourse and programs, the dynamics fueling
   social scientific competition are outlined.  Because that competition is
   subject to recurrent distortions and therefore cannot insure that the
   best arguments win, it is proposed that metatheorizing assume an
   adjudicative posture and evaluate the conflicting claims of rival
   schools.  This suggestion is elaborated in the context of Ritzer's
   pioneering work on metatheorizing.</td>

   fact that metatheorizing, as a distinct intellectual activity, is
   unequally distributed throughout the sciences.  As a reflexive and
   critical subspecialty, metatheory and metasociology are more likely to
   routinely accompany work in loosely coupled and highly controversial
   disciplines.  The theory of scientific organizations explains the
   propensity for metatheorizing as the outcome of weak and conversational
   fields that rely mostly on texts to support their discourse.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>When Parsons derived action theory from Durkheim's sociology, he also
   argued with Durkheim, disputed his claims, and expressly rejected some
   of his fundamental principles.  Accordingly, American functionalism
   contained a hidden "negative image" of Durkheim.  Parsons's student,
   Harold Garfinkel, addressed functionalism at its weak points, eventually
   overthrowing most of what Parsons had to say about society.  Some of
   these weak points were predicated on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim,
   including explicit rejection of Durkheim's equivalences between society,
   morality, and objective reality.  Garfinkel's ethnomethodology therefore
   rejected what had been premised on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim.  In
   so doing, it reversed the negative image of Durkheim back to its
   positive classical form and empirically demonstrated some of Durkheim's
   most troubling principles.  Since Garfinkel did not deliberately recover
   Durkheim in this manner, the dynamics of this case make it an
   interesting study of how theorists read other theorists.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Karl Polanyi remains one of the most trenchant critics of neoclassical
   economics. His "embeddedness" thesis, which holds that all economic
   activities and institutions are enmeshed in social relations and
   institutions, offers a sound theoretical basis for economic sociology.
   Nonetheless, he fails to embed the market concept. This theoretical
   lacuna manifests itself in his classic account of the rise of market
   society in England, The Great Transformation ([1944] 1957), where he
   neglects to consider institutional diversity and discontinuities in
   English commercial development. Polanyi's embeddedness thesis can be
   taken to its logical conclusion; that is, even the market can be
   embedded. "Markets" can be treated as social networks or organizations
   constituted by traders. I offer as an empirical illustration a brief
   case study of the rise of "market society" in England.</td>
