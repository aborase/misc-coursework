   Council/Association, first authorship of articles in the Human Biology

   authors was determined for 1,616 articles published in Human Biology or
   the American Journal of Human Biology from 1975 to 2001. Each journal
   article was also coded as to the first author's country and whether the
   subjects of the research were only females, only males, or both males
   and females. From the late 1970s to the late 1990s, the percent of women
   members of the Human Biology Council/Association increased from under
   25% to over 40%. Women were the first authors of fewer than 20% of
   articles in the organization's journal in the late 1970s; by the late
   1990s over 30% of articles had a female first author. The clearest
   increase in female authorship through time is seen for articles with a
   first author from the U.S. Even when women were not well represented as
   human biologists, a substantial proportion of human biology research
   published in the organization's journal dealt with females, and over the
   last 15 years there have been more research articles having only females
   as research subjects than articles having only males as research

AB Obesity related to over-nutrition is investigated in a sample of 219
   Mexican children from affluent families, ages 6-12 years. Defined as
   weight-for-age at or above the 95(th) percentile, obesity rates in
   middle childhood are very high in this population, being 24.2% of
   children (29.4% of boys and 19.1% of girls). Binary logistic regression
   shows that children are more likely to be obese if they are boys, from
   small households with few or no other children, and have more
   permissive, less authoritarian parents. Diet at school and activity
   patterns, including television viewing, are not different for boys and
   girls and so do not explain this gender variation. The value placed on
   children, especially sons, in smaller middle-class families, can result
   in indulgent feeding because food treats are a cultural index of
   parental caring. Parents also value child fatness as a sign of health.
   These obese Mexican children have no greater social problems (peer
   rejection or stigma) or psychological problems (anxiety, depression, or
   low self esteem) than their non-obese peers. More study specifically
   focused on feeding practices in the home environment is required to
   explain very high rates of child obesity. The differences in obesity
   risk related to specific aspects of children's developmental microniche
   emphasize the importance of including a focus on gender as a
   socio-ecological construct in human biological studies of child growth,
   development, and nutrition. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Using stories of citizens' resistance to legalized authority, the
   authors propose that the act of storytelling extends temporally and
   socially what might otherwise be an individual, discrete, and ephemeral
   transaction. Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a
   social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant,
   institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized
   authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including
   symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although
   such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional
   change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific
   social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending
   the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of
   resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of
   the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance
   can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of
   power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories,
   they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social
   structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.

AB Motivated by neuropsychological investigations of category-specific
   impairments, many functional brain imaging studies have found distinct
   patterns of neural activity associated with different object categories.
   However, the extent to which these category-related activation patterns
   reflect differences in conceptual representation remains controversial.
   To investigate this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   was used to record changes in neural activity while subjects interpreted
   animated vignettes composed of simple geometric shapes in motion.
   Vignettes interpreted as conveying social interactions elicited a
   distinct and distributed pattern of neural activity, relative to
   vignettes interpreted as mechanical actions. This neural system included
   regions in posterior temporal cortex associated with identifying human
   faces and other biological objects. In contrast, vignettes interpreted
   as conveying mechanical actions resulted in activity in posterior
   temporal lobe sites associated with identifying manipulable objects such
   as tools. Moreover, social, but not mechanical, interpretations elicited
   activity in regions implicated in the perception and modulation of
   emotion (right amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex). Perceiving
   and understanding social and mechanical concepts depends, in part, on
   activity in distinct neural networks. Within the social domain, the
   network includes regions involved in processing and storing information
   about the form and motion of biological objects, and in perceiving,
   expressing, and regulating affective responses.

AB BACKGROUND: A growing number of donor insemination (DI) programmes offer
   'open-identity' sperm donors, who are willing to have their identity
   released to adult offspring. We report findings from parents who chose
   such donors and whose children are now adolescents. METHODS: Using
   mail-back questionnaires, parents from 45 households (40% headed by
   lesbian couples, 38% by single women, 22% by heterosexual couples)
   reported their experience with using an open-identity donor and
   disclosure about it, as well as their child's plans for donor
   identity-release(sm). RESULTS: Almost no parents regretted using an
   open-identity donor. Almost all parents had told their child about his
   or her DI conception early on and reported a neutral to moderately
   positive impact. Finally, of those who had told, almost all expected
   their child to obtain the donor's identity. We also discuss differences
   found between birth mothers and co-parents and among single women,
   lesbian couples, and heterosexual couples. CONCLUSIONS: Families were
   relatively open and positive about their use of DI and that their child
   could obtain the donor's identity. Disclosure did not appear to have a
   negative impact on the families, regardless of parental sexual
   orientation and relationship status.

   from Shenzhen, PRC. Individually interviewed Chinese adolescents
   reported disagreements with parents over everyday issues, primarily
   choice of activities, schoolwork, interpersonal relationships, and
   chores. Conflicts were relatively few in number, moderate in frequency,
   and mild in intensity, and across contexts, conflicts were more intense
   in early adolescence (5th and 7th grades) than in late adolescence (12th
   grade). There were more conflicts over chores and interpersonal
   relationships in Hong Kong than in Shenzhen and more conflicts over
   schoolwork in Shenzhen than in Hong Kong, particularly among 7th and
   12th graders. As expected, adolescents primarily justified conflicts,
   particularly conflicts over choice of activities and homework, by
   appealing to personal jurisdiction, and across contexts, personal
   reasoning increased with age. Conflicts were resolved primarily by
   giving in to parents, although adolescents desired more autonomy in
   decision making than they reported having. Although adolescent-parent
   conflict among Chinese youth appears to reflect the development of
   adolescent autonomy, culturally specific processes influence its
   expression.

AB Ethnographic literature indicates that in many cultural communities
   around the world, children have extensive opportunities to learn through
   observing and participating in their community's work and other mature
   activities. We argue that in communities in which children are often
   segregated from adult work (as in middle-class European American
   communities), young children instead are often involved in specialised
   child-focused activities such as lessons, adult-child play (and
   scholastic play), and conversation with adults on child-related topics.
   We examine this argument with systematic time-sampled observations of
   the extent of 2- to 3-year-old children's access to adult work compared
   to their involvement in specialised child-focused activities.
   Observations focused on 12 children in each of four communities: two
   middle-class European American communities (West Newton, Massachusetts
   and Sugarhouse, Utah), Efe foragers of the Democratic Republic of Congo,
   and indigenous Maya of San Pedro, Guatemala. West Newton and Sugarhouse
   children had less frequent access to work and were involved more often
   in specialised child-focused activities than Efe and San Pedro children.
   The results support the idea that the middle-class European American
   children's frequent involvement in specialised child-focused activities
   may relate to their more limited opportunities to learn through
   observing work activities of their communities, It may be less necessary
   for the Efe and San Pedro children to be involved in specialised
   child-focused activities to prepare them for involvement in mature
   community practices, because they are already a regular part of them.

AB Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically improved

   realized for all communities, however. We characterize the association
   of socioeconomic status (SES) with survival after AIDS diagnosis in San
   Francisco in the period before (1980-1995) and after (1996 - 2001) the
   wider use of HAART. Using citywide surveillance data, we examined
   differences in survival after AIDS diagnosis by neighborhood household
   income using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards
   analysis to adjust for significant covariates. Residing in higher SES
   neighborhoods significantly predicted better survival after AIDS from
   1996 to 2001 (hazard ratio = 0.92 per $10,000 increase in neighborhood
   household income, 95% CI: 0.85-0.99) after adjusting for CD4 count at
   diagnosis, age, and injection drug user status. Persons living in poorer
   neighborhoods were less likely to use HAART at any time in the past
   compared with persons in wealthier neighborhoods. Moreover, no
   association between survival and neighborhood SES was evident in the era
   prior to the wide use of HAART. Finally, the difference in survival by
   neighborhood income level disappeared after controlling for the use of
   HAART, suggesting that use of or access to treatment explained the
   association. From 1996 to 2001, survival with AIDS was worse for people
   living in poorer neighborhoods compared with those living in wealthier
   neighborhoods of San Francisco as a result of unequal access to or use
   of HAART.

AB This paper provides a framework in which to consider social benefits of
   urban and community forestry projects. The framework clarifies who gets
   the benefits-An individual? An organization? A community? Further, the
   benefits can be derived from passive and/or active experience of the
   urban forest. Examples of social benefits in each category are reviewed.
   The paper also presents findings from a research project that
   investigated practitioner claims for social benefits of urban greening
   projects. Practitioner assessments of the benefits received modest
   support in the research findings, but their assessments were not
   entirely accurate, leading to some true and some false claims of social
   benefits. Empowerment theory structured the investigation and analysis
   and provided insight for implementation of projects that aim for
   providing social benefits. The concepts of empowering versus empowered
   people were particularly helpful. Specifically, the empowering nature of
   each site's project organizer, the openness of the project process, and
   the overall organizing history of the block were important to achieving
   empowerment outcomes. The paper concludes with recommendations for
   practitioners interested in fostering empowerment through urban and

PY 2003
AB In urban communities, arboriculture clearly contributes to the health of
   the biological ecosystem; does it contribute to the health of the social
   ecosystem as well? Evidence from studies in inner-city Chicago suggests
   so. In a series of studies involving over 1,300 person-space
   observations, 400 interviews, housing authority records, and 2 years of
   police crime reports, tree and grass cover were systematically linked to
   a wide range of social ecosystem indicators. These indicators included
   stronger ties among neighbors, greater sense of safety and adjustment,
   more supervision of children in outdoor spaces, healthier patterns of
   children's play, more use of neighborhood common spaces, fewer
   incivilities, fewer property crimes, and fewer violent crimes. The link
   between arboriculture and a healthier social ecosystem turns out to be
   surprisingly simple to explain. In residential areas, barren, treeless
   spaces often become "no man's lands," which discourage resident
   interaction and invite crime. The presence of trees and well-maintained
   grass can transform these no man's lands into pleasant, welcoming,
   well-used spaces. Vital, well-used neighborhood common spaces serve to
   both strengthen ties among residents and deter crime, thereby creating
   healthier, safer neighborhoods.

   unvaccinated.
   Goal: The goal of this study was to identify attitudes and beliefs
   associated with vaccination against HBV among black MSM.
   Study Design: The Birmingham Vaccine Acceptance Questionnaire was used
   to collect data from gay bar patrons.
   Results: Of the 143 participants, nearly 42% reported at least one dose
   of HBV vaccine. In multivariable analysis, characteristics associated
   with vaccination were a decreased perception of barriers to HBV
   vaccination (odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   0.22-0.61; P = 0.001); increased perceived medical severity (OR, 5.34;

AB New forms of work organization have spread throughout much of the
   corporate world. Critics warn that team systems may encourage workers to
   internalize managerial definitions of their work situations, and-as a
   result-strengthen management's hegemony over them. This article presents
   an ethnographic analysis of four manufacturing plants in which team
   initiatives have been introduced. The findings cast doubt on the
   hegemony thesis. Analyzing data bearing on the degree of managerial
   legitimacy, the salience of class boundaries, and instances of worker
   defiance in both traditional- and team-based production areas, I find
   only occasional evidence of increased worker integration or
   incorporation within a nascent managerial regime. Indeed, by drawing
   attention to the limited authority that workers were actually allowed,
   team systems tended to heighten worker suspicion and distrust and to
   foster patterns of solidarity that were difficult for managers to
   control. The most significant feature of the new production concepts may
   not be their siren-like appeal, but rather the tensions and
   contradictions they introduce into work organizations. In fact, such
   concepts provide workers with subtle yet strategic resources with which
   to renegotiate the boundaries of managerial authority.

AB Kin-recognition systems have been hypothesized to exist in humans, and
   adaptively to regulate altruism and incest avoidance among close genetic
   kin. This latter function allows the architecture of the kin recognition
   system to be mapped by quantitatively matching individual variation in
   opposition to incest to individual variation in developmental
   parameters, such as family structure and co-residence patterns.
   Methodological difficulties that appear when subjects are asked to
   disclose incestuous inclinations can be circumvented by measuring their
   opposition to incest in third parties, i.e. morality. This method allows
   a direct test of Westermarck's original hypothesis that childhood
   co-residence with an opposite-sex individual predicts the strength of
   moral sentiments regarding third-party sibling incest. Results support
   Westermarck's hypothesis and the model of kin recognition that it
   implies. Co-residence duration objectively predicts genetic relatedness,
   making it a reliable cue to kinship. Co-residence duration predicts the
   strength of opposition to incest, even after controlling for relatedness
   and even when co-residing individuals are genetically unrelated. This
   undercuts kin-recognition models requiring matching to self (through,
   for example, major histocompatibility complex or phenotypic markers).
   Subjects' beliefs about relatedness had no effect after controlling for
   co-residence, indicating that systems regulating kin-relevant behaviours
   are non-conscious, and calibrated by co-residence, not belief.

AB The goal of this project was to develop educational materials to
   communicate genetic health information in a culturally sensitive manner.
   These materials were designed to communicate information about cancer
   risk, genetic testing options, and health management options in an
   African American kindred with a known BRCA1 mutation. Educational
   materials were pilot-tested in four African American focus groups
   varying in socioeconomic status and gender. The audiotaped focus groups
   consisted of presentation of the educational materials, followed by a
   feedback session led by an African American facilitator. Qualitative
   analysis of the focus group transcripts identified important themes and
   the educational materials were revised in response to the participants'
   suggestions. The products included a booklet and a flip chart for use in
   educational sessions. Focus group participants recommended a substantial
   reduction in technical detail, and recommended that information be
   personalized and made relevant to the lives of the target population.
   Other critical themes included the importance of building trust in the
   medical system and avoiding words and images that have strong negative
   associations in the African American community. Strategies that were
   successful included nontechnical images to explain genetic concepts,
   clip art images to energize and personalize word slides, vibrant color,
   identifiably African American figures, and the development of themes
   relevant to many African Americans. The use of these materials in an
   ongoing study offering BRCA1 counseling and testing to a large, rural
   Louisiana-based kindred will provide additional feedback about the
   effectiveness of the culturally tailored genetic education and
   counseling materials. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB This paper presents 2,000 years of settlement and land use within the
   Lake Patzcuaro Basin, Mexico. Three findings challenge the conclusions
   of previous research. We show (i) that initial land degradation was
   caused by settlement, not by agriculture; (it) that population density
   inversely correlates with erosion; and (M) that land degradation was
   associated with European Conquest but not from the introduction of the
   Euro-agro suite. Instead, demographic collapse caused by
   European-introduced disease prevented human-generated landscapes from
   being maintained, resulting in widespread degradation. These findings
   support the use of indigenous landscape technology for modern
   conservation if past failings can be resolved.

AB The inadequate supply of affordable housing for low-income families and
   the increasing spatial segregation of some households by income, race,
   ethnicity, or social class into unsafe neighborhoods are among the most
   prevalent community health concerns related to family housing. When
   affordable housing is not available to low-income households, family
   resources needed for food, medical or dental care, and other necessities
   are diverted to housing costs. Two housing programs intended to provide
   affordable housing and, concurrently, reduce the residential segregation
   of low-income families into unsafe neighborhoods of concentrated
   poverty, are reviewed: the creation of mixed-income housing developments
   and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Section 8
   Rental Voucher Program. The effectiveness of mixed-income housing
   developments could not be ascertained by this systematic review because
   of a lack of comparative research. Scientific evidence was sufficient to
   conclude that rental voucher programs improve household safety as
   measured by reduced exposure to crimes against person and property and
   decreased neighborhood social disorder. Effectiveness of rental voucher
   programs on youth health risk behaviors, mental health status, and
   physical health status could not be determined because too few studies
   of adequate design and execution reported these outcomes.

AB Culturally competent healthcare systems-those that provide culturally
   and linguistically appropriate services-have the potential to reduce
   racial and ethnic health disparities. When clients do not understand
   what their healthcare providers are telling them, and providers either
   do not speak the client's language or are insensitive to cultural
   differences, the quality of health care can be compromised. We reviewed
   five interventions to improve cultural competence in healthcare
   systems-programs to recruit and retain staff members who reflect the
   cultural diversity of the community served, use of interpreter services
   or bilingual providers for clients with limited English proficiency,
   cultural competency training for healthcare providers, use of
   linguistically and culturally appropriate health education materials,
   and culturally specific healthcare settings. We could not determine the
   effectiveness of any of these interventions, because there were either
   too few comparative studies, or studies did not examine the outcome
   measures evaluated in this review: client satisfaction with care,
   improvements in health status, and inappropriate racial or ethnic
   differences in use of health services or in received and recommended
   treatment.

   = 439) were included in this study. All Japanese breast-feeding women in
   the study introduced formula at some point in time. Cox multivariate
   regression analysis was conducted in two separate models of Japanese and
   Caucasian women, respectively. Higher maternal age and working part-time
   among Japanese women, and multiparity, college education, rural island
   and long-term Hawaii residence among Caucasian women were protective
   against early weaning. Introduction of formula was strongly associated
   with early weaning for both groups, the association being stronger for
   Japanese women. The early practice of partial breast-feeding may play an
   important role for early weaning among Japanese women in Hawaii.

   naturalists tend to obscure the diversity and complexity of respondents'
   interpretations. The constructionist alternative is to make storytelling
   paramount by treating equality and inequality as situated narrative
   accomplishments. A constructionist approach focuses on respondents' own
   ethnographic skills while still fitting "the data" into a larger

AB Many individuals and societies are no longer connected to the
   more-than-human world in such a way as to ensure a sustainable future.
   As such connection has diminished, environmental challenges have
   multiplied and influences for estrangement intensified. I review the
   importance of direct, intimate encounter with places and organisms on
   the attitudes of the young, as well as the significance of biophilia.
   The result of the loss of contact and subsequent alienation is the
   Extinction of Experience: an inexorable cycle of disconnection, apathy,
   and progressive depletion. I describe an effort to demonstrate this
   effect. Small, humble habitats, especially in urban settings, can be as
   important as big reserves in awakening biophilia. Biophobia, abetted by
   the loss of such habitats, the rise of the virtual in place of actual
   experience, economic inequalities, and overpopulation, further feeds the
   downward spiral of extinction and disaffection. The climate of global
   corporate growth that now prevails is inimical to sustainability, as is
   the current state of ecological illiteracy. Radical change is therefore
   necessary to address both economic disparity, in the direction of
   minimal ownership rather than maximum consumerism, and educational
   reform that places nature at the centre rather than the margin of the
   curriculum. I present a six-point programme, called Nature Matrix, for
   an alternative social and ethical paradigm. Rather than a pragmatic plan
   for the near future, Nature Matrix is a model for essential, incremental
   change, a dream whose eventual adoption may enhance chances for
   reconnection and for ecological survival itself: at present, a deeply
   uncertain prospect.

   Consideration of the knowledge currently available and the knowledge

   considerable opportunity for sociologists to contribute to STL within
   faculty assessment. Contributions can be made in understanding what
   constitutes STL and methods for assessing contributions in this area of

   incomplete and outdated. Additionally, the inclusion of material from

   arise in course development, including course content similarity,

   if we must teach delinquency in addition to criminology and deviance?
   Sociology majors interested in crime and deviance are likely to take
   more than one of these sociology courses, and non-majors often take
   these courses as electives. In this paper, I offer ideas for developing
   distinct deviance, delinquency, and criminology courses, and discuss how
   to reduce theoretical and other content overlap, paper assignments,
   course readings, and departmental issues.

AB Efforts to prepare graduate students for the multiple responsibilities
   they will face as faculty members have led to an emphasis on the
   development of teaching credentials as evidence of teaching
   effectiveness. Teaching credentials refer to teaching experience,
   syllabi, teaching evaluations, a teaching philosophy, and a teaching
   portfolio. Although these indicators have gained popularity among some
   graduate education programs in sociology, to what extent are they
   requested of job applicants? Our content analysis of the academic
   positions advertised in the 1999 Employment Bulletin suggests that the
   majority of departments prefer applicants with teaching experience, but
   few request specific evidence of teaching effectiveness in their job
   advertisements. Moreover, we find that research-oriented institutions
   are less likely to request teaching credentials. Recommendations for
   future research are proposed.

AB In the past, it was common practice for museum professionals and private
   collectors to apply a variety of pesticide agents to objects in their
   collections to preserve them from depredations by microorganisms, fungi,
   and other pests. The Native American Graves Repatriation and Protection
   Act allows federally recognized tribes to request that museums return
   objects taken from their ancestors. Given that poor records were kept on
   the treatment of individual objects, it is unknown whether specific
   objects are contaminated with these pesticide agents. Although chemical
   analysis represents the only reliable means to determine the types and
   levels of pesticides on these objects, surprisingly few publications
   document the extent of this contamination in museum collections. This
   paper reports on the determination of arsenic, mercury, and several
   organic pesticides on 17 objects that were recently repatriated to the
   Hupa tribe in northern California. Four samples were taken from each
   object: two for arsenic and mercury analysis via flame atomic absorption
   spectrophotometry and two for organic pesticide analysis via gas
   chromatography/mass spectrometry. Percent levels (wt/wt) of mercury were
   detected on many samples, and 0.001 to 0.183% (wt/wt) levels of
   p-dichlorobenzene, naphthalene, thymol, lindane, and/or DDT were
   detected on many of the samples. These results indicate that Hupa tribal
   members,should not wear these objects in religious ceremonies, proper
   precautions should be followed when dealing with potentially
   contaminated objects, and that more serious consideration should be
   given to this issue at a national level.

AB Results from a longitudinal study of 2402 low-income families during the
   recent unprecedented era of welfare reform suggest that mothers'
   transitions off welfare and into employment are not associated with
   negative outcomes for preschoolers (ages 2 to 4 years) or young
   adolescents (ages 10 to 14 years). Indeed, no significant associations
   with mothers' welfare and employment transitions were found for
   preschoolers, and the dominant pattern was also of few statistically
   significant associations for adolescents. The associations that did
   occur provided slight evidence that mothers' entry into the labor force
   was related to improvements in adolescents' mental health, whereas exits
   from employment were linked with teenagers' increased behavior problems.

AB In 2001, Bacillus anthracis spores were delivered through the United
   States postal system in a series of bioterrorist acts. Controls proposed
   for this threat included sanitization with high-energy electrons. Solid
   phase microextraction was used with gas chromatography/ mass
   spectrometry for field sampling and analysis of volatile compounds
   apparently produced from polymeric materials such as cellulose and
   plastics, immediately following processing of mail at a commercial
   irradiation facility. Solid phase microextraction and direct sampling of
   air into a cryogenically cooled temperature programmable inlet were used
   in the laboratory for gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of
   air in contact with irradiated mail, envelopes only (packaged
   identically to mail), and air inside irradiated plastic mail packaging
   bags (with neither mail nor envelopes). Irradiated mail or envelope
   systems produced hydrocarbons such as propane, butane, pentane, hexane,
   heptane, methylpentanes, and benzene; and oxygen-containing compounds
   such as acetaldehyde, acrolein, propionaldehyde, furan, 2-methylfuran,
   methanol, acetone, 2-butanone, and ethanol. In addition to hydrocarbons,
   methyl and ethyl nitrate were detected in irradiated bags that contained
   only air, suggesting reactive nitrogen species formed from air
   irradiation reacted with hydroxy-containing compounds to give nitro
   esters. The similarities of volatile compounds in irradiated systems
   containing paper to those observed by researchers studying cellulose
   pyrolysis suggests common depolymerization and degradation mechanisms in
   each case. These similarities should guide additional work to examine
   irradiated mail for chemical compounds not detectable by methods used
   here.

AB I argue that there has been inadequate attention to and questioning of
   the dominance and normativity of whiteness in the cultural construction
   of bioethics in the United States. Therefore we risk reproducing white
   privilege and white supremacy in its theory, method, and practices. To
   make my argument, I define whiteness and trace its broader social and
   legal history in the United States. I then begin to mark whiteness in U.
   S. bioethics, recasting Renee Fox's sociological marking of its
   American-ness as an important initial marking of its whiteness/WASP
   ethos. Furthermore, I consider the attempts of social scientists to
   highlight sociocultural diversity as a corrective in U. S. bioethics. I
   argue that because they fail to problematize white dominance and
   normativity and the white-other dualism when they describe the
   standpoints of African-American, Asian-American, and Native-American
   others, their work merely inoculates difference and creates or maintains
   minoritized spaces. Accordingly, the dominant white center of mainstream
   U. S. bioethics must be problematized and displaced for diversity
   research to make a difference. In conclusion, I give several examples of
   how we might advance the recommended endeavor of exploring our own
   ethnicity, class, and other social positioning and norms operating in U.
   S. bioethics, briefly highlighting "white talk" as one challenge.

AB This article seeks to partially fill a paucity of available data on
   physical performance in hunter-gatherer societies. Quantitative data are
   presented on various physical performance measures conducted on the Ache
   of eastern Paraguay, hunter-gatherers up to the 1970s and now part-time
   foragers and horticulturists. The performance battery was conducted on
   most individuals over 10 years of age, allowing for cross-sectional
   examination of growth and senescence patterns across the lifespan for
   both sexes. These measures tend to display steep ascents and peak in the
   early 20s with slight declines thereafter with age for males, whereas
   females demonstrate peaks in performance earlier in life, with lower or
   no senescence rates thereafter. The result is a convergence in physical
   performance between men and women at later ages. We suggest that the
   female physiology faces reproductive constraints to performance early in
   life but shifts allocation to increased work output later in life during
   the long human postmenopausal stage. In contrast, the male physiology
   maximizes work output in early adult life. These schedules of physical
   performance are contrasted with schedules of food production ability,
   which tend to occur later in life, and therefore imply that skill rather
   than strength alone is an important component of the human foraging
   niche. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether the availability and
   accessibility of physical activity resources differed by neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) in a small U.S. city (population = 133,046).
   U.S. census tracts (N = 32) were used to represent neighborhoods and
   categorized into high, medium, or low SES on the basis of the percentage
   of unemployed individuals, per capita income, and percentage of the
   population below the poverty threshold. We developed a geographic
   information system to generate a comprehensive list of physical activity
   resources available within each census tract in the city., We identified
   112 parks, 33 sport facilities, 15 fitness clubs, 11 community centers,
   and 5 walking/biking trails. The total number of physical activity
   resources varied by neighborhood SES (p <.05); low-SES (M = 4.5 +/- 2.3)
   and medium-SES (M = 4.9 +/- 2.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer
   resources than high-SES (M = 8.4 +/- 3.5) neighborhoods. Low-, medium-,
   and high-SES neighborhoods did not differ on the number of pay-for-use
   facilities; however, low-SES (M = 3.1 +/- 1.5) and medium-SES (M = 3.8
   +/- 1.6) neighborhoods had significantly fewer free-for-use resources
   than high- (M = 6.1 +/- 2.4) SES neighborhoods (p <.01). Data suggest
   that individuals from lower SES neighborhoods may have limited ability
   to control their physical activity in the face of inaccessible
   environments. Community research and promotion efforts should include
   assessment and targeting of available and accessible physical activity
   resources.

   of 64 Blacks (M age = 22.69 years, SD = 6.60), systolic blood pressure
   (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were assessed before and during
   a standardized serial subtraction task. Perceptions of racism and the
   quantity and quality of social support were measured by self-report.
   Separate multiple regression analyses revealed that perceived racism and
   social support (neither quantity nor quality) were not independent
   predictors. of SBP or DBP changes. (ps >.05). These analyses did
   indicate that perceived racism interacted with the quantity of social
   support (p <.002, partial R-2 = .175) and with the quality of social
   support (p <. 0007, partial R2 =. 195) to predict DBP changes. Perceived
   racism also interacted with the quantity of social support to predict
   changes in SBP (p <.02, partial R-2 = .11). In general; whereas high
   social support was related to less marked blood pressure changes under
   conditions of low perceived racism, high social support was associated
   with exaggerated blood pressure changes under conditions of high
   perceived racism. These significant interaction effects persisted after
   statistically controlling for potential confounders. The findings
   highlight the importance of examining the joint contribution of
   real-world experiences and coping resources to blood pressure reactivity
   in Blacks.

AB Many development projects intended to alleviate poverty end up
   increasing poverty by displacing large numbers of people without
   reestablishing them viably. Projects entailing resettlement will
   continue into the future, requiring ever-deeper examination of the
   nature of displacement. This paper appreciates the contribution of
   economic science to matters of compensation but critiques its limitation
   to compensation of losses and the inadequate methodology economists
   often employ in projects with resettlement. The paper argues that the
   magnitude of the combined material and non-material impoverishment
   experienced by those displaced far exceeds the redeeming powers of
   narrow compensation-centred solutions offered by conventional economics.
   The impoverishment risks embedded in forced displacement are outlined.
   The paper signals a mismatch between goals and means in resettlement
   policies and criticises current methods for the economic and financial
   appraisal of resettlement operations. A shift is proposed toward an
   economics centred on the reconstruction of resettlers' livelihood, for
   which - in addition to compensation for losses - development investments
   are necessary. Sociology, anthropology, and economics must integrate
   their knowledge of impoverishment by displacement, its causes, outcomes,
   and its remedies.

   Methods: We developed a survey that elicited testing motivators,
   barriers, and preferences for new strategies among 460 participants at a
   needle exchange, three sex venues for riten who have sex with men, and a
   sexually transmitted disease clinic.
   Results: Barriers to testing included factors influenced by individual
   concern (fear and discrimination); by programs, policies, and laws
   (named reporting and inability to afford treatment); and by counseling
   and testing strategies (dislike of counseling. anxiety waiting for
   results, and venipuncture). The largest proportions of participants
   preferred rapid testing strategies, including clinic-based testing (27%)
   and home self-testing (20%); roughly equal proportions preferred oral
   fluid testing (18%), urine testing (17%), and standard blood testing
   (17%). One percent preferred home specimen collection. Participants who
   had never tested before were significantly more likely to prefer home
   self-testing compared with other strategies. Blacks were significantly
   more likely to prefer urine testing.
   Conclusions: Strategies for improving acceptance of HIV counseling and
   testing include information about access to anonymous testing and early
   treatment. Expanding options for rapid testing, urine testing, and home
   self-testing; providing alternatives to venipuncture; making pretest
   counseling, optional; and allowing telephone results disclosure may
   encourage more persons to learn their HIV status.

AB Clergy have an undeniable ability to shape the political beliefs and
   attitudes of their congregations and thus revealing how the framing
   activities of clergy affect behavior and influence mobilization is vital
   for political sociology. This ethnographic work delineates how, in 1972,
   the Second Baptist Church of Evanston's new pastor initiated a rapid
   change from social conservatism to become one of the most politically
   and socially active African-American Baptist churches in the Midwest.
   Second Baptist's radical change confirms the power of religious elites
   in shaping politics in spiritual institutions, and also demonstrates the
   vital impact of professional socialization on the theological and
   political orientations of clergy.

AB This paper reviews the question of why the presentation of evolution in
   class frequently does not achieve acceptance of the evolutionary theory.
   In general, problems are twofold. Firstly, students may come to this
   particular topic with strong preconceptions, often based on specific
   religious teachings. Secondly, teachers may or may not bring an informed
   and/or dedicated approach to the teaching of evolution, relating to what
   they themselves were taught. Additional to our review of this topic and
   its problems, we suggest the use of a simple 'test' formulated, not on
   trying to impose knowledge and belief of evolution on the student, but
   on directing students towards the application of information on
   evolution to material already familiar to them. In this process, it is
   hoped that students will naturally incorporate at least some of the
   ideas of evolution into their own belief systems. Students are thus
   encouraged to assess or reassess evolution in terms of what they already
   consider to be true from their own experiences. Preliminary results (two
   trial runs) using this questionnaire indicate that students readily
   apply information with which they are familiar to Darwinian principles,
   and vice versa. These results, including verbal and written comments,
   also suggest that this 'test' may be meaningful as a first step towards
   acceptance of evolutionary theory. Teachers may find our questionnaire
   useful in determining a student's ability to understand evolutionary
   theory, and in exploring connections between understanding of and belief
   in evolution.

AB Substantial research attention has focused on the psychosocial
   adjustment problems of children and adolescents residing in
   disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, less attention has been directed
   to neighborhood factors within disadvantaged neighborhoods that may
   facilitate child psychosocial adjustment. An expanded model, assessing
   how social capital, neighborhood dangerousness, and positive parenting
   relate to child psychosocial adjustment difficulties, was estimated
   using structural equation modeling (Lisrel 8.3). Participants included
   130 African American mothers and their children (mean age = 12.9 years)
   residing in inner city New Orleans, LA. The model examined 3 avenues
   through which social capital (e.g., support, neighborhood cohesion) may
   relate to fewer child psychosocial adjustment difficulties: a direct
   relation; through its relation to positive parenting; and through its
   relation to neighborhood dangerousness. Results indicate that social
   capital related to child psychosocial adjustment difficulties through
   positive parenting and neighborhood dangerousness, but not directly.
   Overall, the proposed model fit the observed data reasonably well. The
   results suggest that social capital in disadvantaged neighborhoods is
   important in indirectly facilitating child psychosocial adjustment and
   should be incorporated into assessment and intervention practices.

AB OBJECTIVE: To elucidate overseas Japanese women's preferences on whether
   to use a curtain to separate themselves from the provider during pelvic
   examinations in the United States, as practiced in Japan.
   STUDY DESIGN: We qualitatively interviewed 19 overseas Japanese women
   who presented to a clinic serving Japanese people living in southeastern
   Michigan. We synthesized this interview data into a cohesive overview of
   the content and used illustrative quotes generated by the participants
   to provide a context.
   RESULTS: Most participants (n = 12) approved of the U.S. style of
   examination, including the use of private rooms and a sheet to cover the
   perineum. A minority of women (n = 4) said they were neutral to the
   approach, 2 preferred the Japanese examination style, and 1 did not like
   pelvic examinations. Some participants strongly disliked the use of the
   curtain and the structure of examination rooms in Japan.
   CONCLUSION: Most participating women did not support using a curtain
   during pelvic examinations in the U.S., as practiced in Japan, and some
   were critical of the Japanese practice. Clinicians may help place their
   Japanese patients at ease by acknowledging nonuse of a curtain in the
   U.S., and explaining the intentional use of a private room and sheet to
   protect patient privacy.

   Despite the greater number of life problems among women than men, women
   had lower three-year recidivism rates and rates of post-release drug use

AB Objective: To pilot-test a school mental health program for Latino
   immigrant students who have been exposed to community violence. Method:
   In this quasi-experimental study conducted from January through June
   2000, 198 students in third through eighth grade with trauma-related
   depression and/or posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were compared
   after receiving an intervention or being on a waitlist. The intervention
   consisted of a manual-based, eight-session, group cognitive-behavioral
   therapy (CBT) delivered in Spanish by bilingual, bicultural school
   social workers. Parents and teachers were eligible to receive
   psychoeducation and support services. Results: Students in the
   intervention group (n = 152) had significantly greater improvement in
   posttraumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms compared with
   those on the waitlist (n = 47) at 3-month follow-up, adjusting for
   relevant covariates. Conclusions: A collaborative research team of
   school clinicians, educators, and researchers developed this
   trauma-focused CBT program for Latino immigrant students and their
   families. This pilot test demonstrated that this program for traumatized
   youths, designed for delivery on school campuses by school clinicians,
   can be implemented and evaluated in the school setting and is associated
   with a modest decline in trauma-related mental health problems.

   rate. Specifically, analyses examined the association of work-related
   social support to the following measures: 1) baseline blood pressure and
   heart rate at the start of the workday, 2) blood pressure and heart rate
   during high stress periods, 3) blood pressure and heart rate levels
   throughout the workday. Methods: Participants included male (N = 36) and
   female (N = 34) New York City Traffic Enforcement Agents. Mixed-model
   regression analyses were used to assess the effects of self-reported
   measures of workplace social support on workday ambulatory blood
   pressure. Results: Workplace support was associated with workday
   ambulatory blood pressure levels, with the effects depending on the
   source of support and the gender of the participant. For women,
   immediate supervisor support was negatively associated with workday
   systolic blood pressure level, and a similar negative trend was found
   for workday diastolic blood pressure level. For men, coworker support
   was negatively associated with workday systolic blood pressure level. We
   found an interaction of social support with stress level (ie, baseline
   vs. high stress) such that immediate supervisor support was negatively
   associated with systolic blood pressure during high-stress conditions,
   but no effects were found under resting conditions. Conclusions: These
   findings suggest that workplace social support is associated with
   workday ambulatory blood pressure, especially during stressful work
   periods.

AB Primate homologues, especially from the African great apes, can usually
   be successfully utilized to form comparisons with the human condition.
   However, the man(to)child pair-bond is not paralleled by any terrestrial
   primate nor even many mammals. Hence, knowledge of primate behavior
   would not be predictive of the pan-human social father. It is suggested
   that female choices of mating partners shifted in the direction of a
   canid analogue in that men's motivations to share resources with the
   female and to exhibit paternalistic behaviors were positively selected.
   Accordingly, it is argued that, for humans, convergent evolution
   occurred which trended toward the canid template. Consequently, it would
   be predicted that, compared to other terrestrial primates, the
   neuro-hormonal basis for the mother-child affiliative bond would be
   similar, but the basis for man(to)child affiliative bond would be
   dissimilar.

PD SPR-SUM 2003

AB Most prior research on the adverse consequences of parental divorce has
   analyzed only one child per family. As a result, it is not known whether
   the same divorce affects siblings differently. We address this issue by
   analyzing paired sibling data from the 1994 General Social Survey (GSS)
   and 1994 Survey of American Families (SAF). Both seemingly unrelated
   regressions and random effects models are used to study the effect of
   family background on offspring's educational attainment and marital
   stability. Parental divorce adversely affects the educational attainment
   and the probability of divorce of both children within a sibship; in
   other words, siblings tend to experience the same divorce the same way.
   However, family structure of origin only accounts for a trivial portion
   of the shared variance in offspring's educational attainment and marital
   stability, so parental divorce is only one of many factors determining
   how offspring fare. These findings were unchanged when controlling for a
   number of differences both between and within sibships. Also, the
   negative effects of parental divorce largely do not vary according to
   respondent characteristics.

AB The mortality disadvantage of African Americans is well documented, but
   previous studies have not considered its implications for population
   theory in the general case of industrialized nation states with high
   levels of income inequality. This paper examines the relevance of
   classic epidemiological theory to the extremes of income and mortality
   observed in Chicago, one of America's most racially divided cities. We
   analyze cause-specific death rates for black and non-black male
   populations residing in Chicago's community areas by using linked data
   from the 1990 Census and from 1989-1991 individual death certificates.
   The same cause-of-death patterns explain much of the mortality of black
   and non-black men. These two major structures include one, degenerative
   diseases, the other, "tough-living" causes (accidents, homicides, and
   liver disease). Community socioeconomic status is strongly related to
   tough-living deaths within each racial group, and to degenerative deaths
   for African Americans. Black men's tough-living mortality is much
   greater than non-blacks', but their younger age structure suppresses
   their degenerative death rates. Aggregate unemployment and social
   disorganization account for the most salient disparities in mortality
   across racial groups. This patterning of mortality along a socioeconomic
   continuum supports epidemiological theory and extends its applicability
   to highly unequal populations within industrialized countries.

AB Despite serious methodological problems, quantitative studies of poverty
   by U.S. sociologists predominantly rely on the official U.S. measure.
   After reviewing the shortcomings of the U.S. measure, this article
   examines several theoretical and methodological advances in poverty
   measurement. After synthesizing literature on poverty measurement, I
   argue that ideal measures of poverty should: (1) measure comparative
   historical variation effectively; (2) be relative rather than absolute;
   (3) conceptualize poverty as social exclusion; (4) assess the impact of
   taxes, transfers, and state benefits, and (5) integrate the depth of
   poverty and the inequality among the poor. Next, this article evaluates
   sociological studies published since 1990 for their consideration of
   these criteria. Due to sociology's neglect of these criteria, this
   article advocates for three alternative poverty indices: the interval
   measure, the ordinal measure, and the sum of ordinals measure. Finally,
   using the Luxembourg Income Study, I examine the empirical patterns with
   these three measures, across advanced capitalist democracies from 1967
   to 1997. Estimates of these poverty indices are made available for
   future research.

   has contributed substantially to the sociology of organizations and
   labor markets, it has not developed a rich understanding of how career
   trajectories are influenced by the firm's competitive position in its
   product market. Our central claim is that a firm's implicit bargaining
   power over its employees depends on its product market position and its
   sensitivity to environmental change. The greater the firm's bargaining
   power, the less the firm will be compelled to use promotions as a device
   to induce productivity. Firms occupying robust competitive positions
   should have greater bargaining power in the labor market and be less
   likely to fill vacancies through internal promotions. Analyses of
   promotion rates among top managers in a longitudinal sample of

AB While it is clear that cultural boundaries shape the ways we think and
   act, the processes by which some emerge as dominant while others
   languish is less well understood. Drawing on a case study of a conflict
   among climbers, I show how an innovation's evolution from heresy to
   orthodoxy was shaped by the relationship between borders enacted by
   players on different sides of the issue. I argue that because boundaries
   emerge in an interactional nexus, the nature of the boundaries that
   prevail can only be understood in the context of prior boundaries
   through and against which they are created.

AB This article examines the work narratives of midwives practicing in the
   United States, specifically in the State of Florida. We focus analytic
   attention on how the discourse of medicine is used as a resource in
   constructing a sense of legitimation for midwifery. Data are drawn from
   in-depth interviews with 26 direct-entry, licensed midwives and
   certified nurse-midwives.
   Historically, social scientific literature on midwifery has placed a
   midwifery, or a holistic, model of childbirth in polar opposition to a
   technocratic or medical model. In practical work, however, midwives
   demonstrate knowledge of, and make use of, a discourse of medicine to
   serve their purpose-at-hand. In these 'narratives of legitimation', the
   medical model does not emerge as an entity definable as separate and
   necessarily at odds with the midwifery model. Rather, the medical model
   is a resource through which midwives work narratively to construct the
   validity of their profession.
   The midwives interviewed use the discourse of medicine in three specific
   ways. First, they draw upon it as a contrast device, setting themselves
   and their work apart from the medical establishment. Second, midwives
   use the medical model to communicate necessary daily aspects of their
   work. Finally, they construct a story of medical collaboration to equate
   their work with that of physicians.

   suicide attitudes might be softened by extenuating circumstances such as
   terminal illness, 192 African American and European American women
   imagined themselves in one of four externuating circumstances, then
   completed measures of suicide acceptability and religiosity. Both ethnic
   groups reported a greater likelihood of suicide when imagining
   depression, regardless of religiosity. Religiosity, but not extenuating
   circumstances, corresponded with negative attitudes toward suicide and
   physician assisted suicide. These African American and European American

AB After a series of eight harvest treatments were completed at Hanus Bay,
   Alaska, on the Tongass National Forest in 1998, 27 respondents
   representing nine interest groups were interviewed to understand their
   reactions to the various harvest patterns in the eight treatment areas.
   Harvests patterns included three stands with 25 percent retention of
   basal area; three stands with 75 percent retention of basal area; a
   clear-cut; and a full retention, or no-harvest, option. A special poster
   board that displayed estimates of consequences of the harvests in six
   areas (fish productivity, deer productivity, timber yield, appearance,
   biodiversity, and residual stand damage) was provided to assist
   respondents in articulating their evaluations. There were no significant
   differences in preferred treatments among the nine interest groups
   sampled, although responses identified specific preferences based on
   individual interests. Analysis of narrative responses identifies that
   the basis for acceptance follows three major elements of emerging social
   acceptability theory: (1) treatments achieve a balance of positive
   effects, (2) natural conditions are sustained, and (3) contextual
   attributes are thoroughly considered. Sustaining benefits to rural
   communities and subsistence lifestyles also emerge as important
   considerations in judging the acceptability of harvest treatments.

AB The Brazilian Amazon is an area of both serious environmental
   degradation and social instability. Despite billions of dollars spent on
   economic development and the rapid pace of urbanization, deforestation
   is extreme and violent land conflict is intense. Although episodes of
   conflict over land are common in Brazilian history, this paper focuses
   on agrarian issues that arose with the opening of the Amazon frontier in
   the 1970s. The paper argues that the nature of land conflict in the
   eastern Brazilian Amazon is dynamic, and proposes a two-stage model to
   illustrate how the struggle has evolved from an agrarian phenomenon to
   an organized resistance that is urban-based. Recognizing the interaction
   between cities and rural areas in the frontier reaches of the Brazilian
   Amazon is key to understanding the land struggle in the face of
   urbanization. The analytical framework deployed considers the
   transformation of the region from an agrarian frontier to an urbanized
   frontier, assessing the dynamic nature of the land struggle and
   examining the implications for land cover change.

   input to county planners and wildlife managers regarding value
   orientations toward land use and wildlife as part of a long-range
   planning process to address concerns over recent growth increases in La
   Plata County, Colorado. We collected data using a mail-back
   questionnaire. Cluster analysis classified respondents into similar
   groupings based on their responses to items that assessed government
   regulation of land use, importance of natural environment, rural
   lifestyle, wildlife considerations in planning, zoning, and individual
   versus societal responsibility for human-wildlife conflicts. Results
   indicated the existence of 3 stakeholder groups; each held positive
   value orientations toward land use and wildlife in the county, but all
   differed on support for government regulation of land use and support
   for zoning. Most respondents within each stakeholder type supported the
   importance of a rural lifestyle and individual over societal
   responsibility for human-wildlife conflicts. Our findings provided input
   to La Plata County's land-use planning process and could assist wildlife
   managers in making better-informed decisions regarding wildlife and

AB Because women are more likely than men to use social status as a

   hypothesis that higher proportions of males will be born to parents of
   high social status than to parents of low status. To date, the research
   that has tested this deduction has not provided consistent support. This
   could be partly due to the small sample size in several of the studies.
   The present study tested the hypothesis using 6 different social status
   measures provided by more than 11,000 United States and Canadian college
   students. The offspring sex ratio was measured by asking the students
   their own sex plus that of each of their siblings. No evidence was found
   to support the hypothesis that parental social status has any
   significant effect on the sex ratio of offspring.

AB An internal norm is a pattern of behavior enforced in part by internal
   sanctions, such as shame, guilt and loss of self-esteem, as opposed to
   purely external sanctions, such as material rewards and punishment. The
   ability to internalize norms is widespread among humans, although in
   some so-called "sociopaths", this capacity is diminished or lacking.
   Suppose there is one genetic locus that controls the capacity to
   internalize norms. This model shows that if an internal norm is fitness
   enhancing, then for plausible patterns of socialization, the allele for
   internalization of norms is evolutionarily stable. This framework can be
   used to model Herbert Simon's (1990) explanation of altruism, showing
   that altruistic norms can "hitchhike" on the general tendency of
   internal norms to be personally fitness-enhancing. A multi-level
   selection, gene-culture coevolution argument then explains why
   individually fitness-reducing internal norms are likely to be prosocial
   as opposed to socially harmful. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB The outcomes of conflicts in many human societies generate reputation
   effects that influence the nature of later conflicts. Those willing to
   escalate over even trivial offenses are considered honorable whereas
   those who do not are considered dishonorable (Nisbett & Cohen, 1996).
   Here I extend Maynard Smith's hawk-dove model of animal conflict to
   explore the logic of a strategy which uses reputation about its
   opponents to regulate its behavior. I show that a reputation-based
   strategy does well when (1) the value of the resource is large relative
   to the cost of losing a fight, (2) communities are stable, and (3)
   reputations are well known but subject to some amount of error.
   Reputation-based strategies may thus result in greater willingness to
   fight, but less fighting at equilibrium, depending upon the nature of
   the contests and the local socioecology. Additionally, this strategy is
   robust in the presence of poor knowledge about reputation. (C) 2003

   However, the extant research does not adequately address whether and how

   joblessness on emotional well-being according to race and sex. The
   impact of racism on general health outcomes also is considered,
   particularly racism in the specific form of wage discrimination.
   Perceptions of racism and measured exposures to racism may be distinct
   triggers for adverse health outcomes. Whether the effects of racism are
   best evaluated on the basis of self-classification or social
   classification of racial identity is unclear.
   Some research sorts between the effects of race and socioeconomic status
   on health. The development of a new longitudinal database will
   facilitate more accurate identification of connections between racism
   and negative health effects.

   on coping processes involved in dealing with perceived racial
   discrimination.
   Cross-sectional data derived from personal interviews with Korean
   immigrants residing in Toronto were analyzed. Among the respondents,
   active, problem-focused coping styles were more effective in reducing
   the impacts on depression of perceived discrimination, while frequent
   use of passive, emotion-focused coping had debilitating mental health
   effects.
   The present findings lend greater support to a social contextual
   explanation than to a cultural maintenance explanation of coping
   processes. They also suggest that, when empowered with sufficient social
   resources, racial minority individuals of diverse cultural heritages are
   more likely to confront than to accept racial bias.

   pressure levels are associated with the tendency not to recall or report
   occurrences identified as racist and discriminatory.
   Investigators have reported that physiological arousal is associated
   with laboratory analogues of ethnic discrimination and mistreatment.
   Evidence from survey and laboratory studies suggests that personality
   variables and cultural orientation moderate the impact of racial
   discrimination. The neural pathways that mediate these physiological

AB In the field of social sciences, there has been a renewed interest in
   studying prejudice and discrimination as stressors and assessing their
   impact on various health outcomes. This raises a need for theoretically
   based and psychometrically sound measures of prejudice.
   As researchers approach this task, there are several conceptual issues
   that need to be addressed. The author describes 3 such issues related to
   (1) individual versus structural measures of the impact of prejudice,
   (2) objective versus subjective assessments of stress, and (3) measures
   of major events versus everyday discrimination.
   How researchers approach the problem of measurement depends on the
   specific study aims, but they must consider these conceptual issues and
   understand the advantages and limitations of various approaches to the
   study of prejudice as stress.

AB Soil sampling and analysis of hydromorphic meadow soils were combined
   with semi-structured interviews to discern the multiple forms of local
   agricultural practices and knowledge in a community located in SW
   Hungary. Particular attention was extended to the role of gender in
   affecting soil management and knowledge and thereby soil reaction and
   fertility. The findings suggest that gender-specific forms of soil
   management directly alter soil status with lowered pH and macronutrient
   values in male-controlled cash-crop plots and excessive amounts of P2O5
   on female-controlled subsistence plots. General soil classification
   likewise varied according to gender. To determine soil productivity
   potential, women mostly relied on a conventional economic index (the
   Gold Crown system) and general descriptive terminology, while men tended
   to be sensitised to soil texture. As the study is not based on an
   extensive survey, the results presented here should be considered
   preliminary and further expansion of interviews and soil sampling will
   be attempted in the future. These results nevertheless indicate that
   examining variability within local soil management systems is crucial to
   understanding anthropogenic impacts on soil dynamics.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess the roles of socioeconomic status, social
   stability, social stress, health beliefs, and illicit drug use with
   nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
   SETTING: Urban hospital clinic.
   PARTICIPANTS: One hundred ninety-six consecutive HIV-infected patients
   taking at least 1 antiretroviral medication, awaiting a visit with their
   primary care provider.
   METHODS: Patients were interviewed while waiting for a clinic
   appointment and were asked to fill out a 4-part survey with questions
   regarding antiretroviral adherence, illicit drug use, health beliefs,
   and social situation. Adherence was defined as the percentage of doses
   taken, i.e., the number of doses taken divided by the number of doses
   prescribed over a 2-week interval. Univariate and multivariate logistic
   regressions were performed to identify factors associated with
   nonadherence in different patient subgroups.
   MAIN RESULTS: Nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy was associated with
   active illicit drug use (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.31; 95% confidence
   interval [95% CI], 1.17 to 4.58), eating fewer than 2 meals per day
   (AOR, 3.31; 95% CI, 1.11 to 9.92), and feeling as though pressures
   outside of the clinic affected patient's ability to take antiretroviral
   medications as prescribed (AOR, 2.22; 95% CI, 0.99 to 4.97). In patients
   with a history of injection drug use, nonadherence to antiretroviral
   therapy was independently associated with eating fewer than 2 meals per
   day (AOR, 17.54; 95% CI, 1.92 to 160.4) and active illicit drug use
   (AOR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.68 to 10.75). In patients without any injection
   drug use, nonadherence was only associated with feeling as though
   pressures outside of clinic affected patient's ability to take
   antiretroviral medications as prescribed (AOR, 3.55; 95% CI, 1.07 to
   11.76). Male-to-male sexual contact was associated with lower
   nonadherence in patients with an HIV risk factor other than injection
   drug use (AOR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.95). A history of drug use but no
   illicit drug use within 6 months of the interview was not associated
   with an increased rate of nonadherence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size was limited and variables that are
   not significant in subgroup analysis may still be associated with
   adherence, our results suggest that correlates of nonadherence are HIV
   risk factor specific. Strategies to increase antiretroviral adherence in
   HIV-infected patients should include social support interventions
   targeted at different risk factors for different patient groups.

   at lower rates than do whites. Racial bias and patient preferences
   contribute to disparities, but their effects appear small. Communication
   during the medical interaction plays a central role in decision making
   about subsequent interventions and health behaviors. Research has shown
   that doctors have poorer communication with minority patients than with
   others, but problems in doctor-patient communication have received
   little attention as a potential cause, a remediable one, of health
   disparities. We evaluate the evidence that poor communication is a cause
   of disparities and propose some remedies drawn from the communication
   sciences.

   different theoretical perspectives-biology, sociology, and
   selection-this paper examines the engagement, availability,

   parent, unmarried biological parent, married stepparent, and cohabiting
   father families. The data come from 2,531 children and their parents who
   were interviewed during the 1997 wave of the Child Development

   of father involvement than anticipated once differences between fathers
   are controlled. Marriage continues to differentiate paternal investment

AB Over the last decade, new information has been developed and collected
   to measure the extent of food insecurity and hunger in the United
   States. Common measurement of the phenomenon of hunger and food
   insecurity has become possible through efforts of the U.S. Department of
   Agriculture (USDA) to develop a set of survey questions that can be used
   to obtain estimates of the prevalence and severity of food insecurity.
   We evaluated the measurement of food insecurity and the effect of
   household variables on measured food insecurity. The effects of
   demographic and survey-specific variables on the food insecurity/ hunger
   scale were evaluated using a generalized linear model with mixed
   effects. Data came from the 1995, 1997 and 1999 Food Security Module of
   the Current Population Survey. The results generally validated the model
   currently used by the USDA. In addition, our approach made it possible
   to consider the effect of demographics and several survey design
   variables on food security among measurably food-insecure households, as
   well as interactions between these factors and the food security
   questions. The analysis of the expanded model with the 1995 data found
   results similar to those reported based on the Rasch model used by the
   USDA. Even though the sample size was reduced and a number of screening
   and questionnaire changes were introduced in 1997 and 1999, the results
   for those years appear mostly unchanged and confirm the robustness of
   the scale in measuring food insecurity. There is some evidence that
   interpretation of questions may vary among different demographic groups.

   resistance (Cip(r)) in Yersinia pestis. Two groups of fluorogenic probes
   were developed. The first group included a probe homologous to the wild
   type Y. pestis gyrA sequence with two corresponding probes that were
   homologous with two different mis-sense mutations in codon 81 of GyrA.
   The second group of probes included a wild type probe and two
   corresponding probes that recognized mis-sense mutations in codon 83 or
   gyrA. These probes specifically reacted only with the homologous DNA
   sequences. The 5' nuclease assay was sensitive to 1 pg (similar to 1
   colony forming unit) of starting template and could be used on
   semi-purified DNA. We tested our optimized assay against a group of 38
   Cip(r) Y. pestis isolates and demonstrated that it was accurate at
   determining the gyrA allele encoded by these strains. The 5' nuclease
   assay performed on the LightCycler proved to be sensitive, rapid and
   accurate at identification of Cip(r) Y. pestis and thus should be useful
   in characterization of this organism in the event of a future act of

AB Background: Social capital has been related to a number of important
   public health variables such as child welfare, mortality, and health
   status. However, the relation of social capital to infectious diseases
   has received relatively little attention. The relation of social capital
   to health measures is often posited to be related to the key societal
   variables of poverty and income inequality. Therefore, any exploration
   of the correlation between social capital and infectious diseases should
   also include examination of the association with poverty and income
   inequality.
   Objective: This study examined the state level association between
   social capital, poverty, income inequality, and four infectious diseases
   that have important public health implications given their long term
   sequelae gonorrhoea syphilis, chlamydia and AIDS.
   Method: A state level correlational analysis (including bivariate linear
   correlational analysis and multivariate linear stepwise regression
   analysis) was carried out 1999 state level rates of gonorrhoea,
   syphilis, chlamydia, and AIDS were the main outcome measures.
   Results: In bivariate analyses, poverty was significantly correlated
   with chlamydia and AIDS case rates and social capital was significantly
   correlated with all outcome measures. In stepwise multiple regression
   analyses, social capital was always the strongest predictor variable.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that social capital is highly
   predictive of at least some infectious diseases. The results indicate
   the need for further research into this relation, and suggest the
   potential need for structural interventions designed to increase social
   capital in communities.

AB In the analysis of cross-classified data, sociologists often focus on
   building flexible models for the marginal distributions of a selected
   set of variables. One strategy for achieving flexible modeling is to
   design models for telescoping marginal distributions. As an illustration
   of telescoping distributions, consider a joint distribution of four
   cross-classifying variables: occupational attainment, education level,
   race, and gender A set Of telescoping distributions would be the
   univariate occupation distribution, the bivariate occupation by
   education, the trivariate occupation by education by race, and the
   entire joint distribution. A methodology that enables the telescoping
   modeling strategy is mixed parameterization, which has its roots in the
   statistics and sociology literatures. In this article, the authors
   develop a scheme of multilevel mixed parameterization that can be
   applied to a hierarchy of marginal distributions of reducing dimension.
   An example from the General Social Survey illustrates mixed parameters
   for telescoping models.

   analogy: that Duchamp and the sociology of knowledge both have the same
   conception of and attitude toward their objects (respectively, art and
   knowledge/truth), and that they both mount similar critiques of the
   institutions they occupy (respectively, the art world and social
   science). A set of similar practices leads both to adopt an attitude of
   reflexivity which courts self-refutation by changing the ontological
   status of their objects and the epistemological status of their own
   practices. The analogy implies some new ways of thinking about the
   institutional role of the sociology of knowledge, the practice and
   epistemology of sociology, and perhaps the epistemic character of
   modernism.

AB Improved understanding of the relationships between human communities

   management policies and practices can affect different communities. This
   knowledge also enhances our ability to formulate plans that are
   responsive to the needs and concerns of local communities, thus reducing
   polarization and related social and economic costs. In December 1997, an
   interdisciplinary panel representing academic backgrounds in sociology,
   anthropology, geography, psychology, economics, and recreation gathered
   in Oregon to discuss relationships between human communities and
   forests. This collection of papers is a product of the dialogue and

AB Bekoff [J. Consci. Stud. 8 (2001) 811 argued that mammalian social play
   is a useful behavioral phenotype on which to concentrate in order to
   learn more about the evolution of fairness. Here, we build a game
   theoretical model designed to formalize some of the ideas laid out by
   Bekoff, and to examine whether 'fair' strategies can in fact be
   evolutionarily stable. The models we present examine fairness at two
   different developmental stages during an individual's ontogeny, and
   hence we create four strategies-fair at time 1/fair at time 2, not fair
   at time 1/not fair at time 2, fair at time 1/not fair at time 2, not
   fair at time 1/fair at time 2. Our results suggest that when considering
   species where fairness can be expressed during two different
   developmental stages, acting fairly should be more common than never
   acting fairly. In addition, when no one strategy was evolutionarily
   stable, we found that all four strategies we model can coexist at
   evolutionary equilibrium. Even in the absence of an overwhelming
   database from which to test our model, the general predictions we make
   have significant implications for the evolution of fairness. (C) 2002

AB The social networks of substance-using women consist of people who
   provide constructive social support, individuals who enable their drug
   use, and those who do both. Women's success in recovery may be
   attenuated because some of the people who are most likely to provide
   them with social support after drug treatment previously enabled their
   drug use. This article examines the social support systems of women
   offenders (N = 100) who were mandated to four therapeutic communities in
   New York City. The women had an average of nine supporters (four males
   and five females). Although most of the women had partners who provided
   them with constructive social support, many of their partners also
   enabled their drug use. Some of the women indicated that their partners
   did not provide constructive support but were among their main enablers,
   while half of the women said that their partners actually encouraged
   them to stop using drugs. The majority of the women also received
   support from their parents, siblings, other kin, and friends. Some of
   these supporters also enabled their drug use while others encouraged
   them to stop using drugs and enter drug treatment. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   often theorizes culture as "collective representations"-vocabularies,

   Missing is an account of how groups use collective representations in
   everyday interaction. The authors use two ethnographic cases to develop
   a concept of "groupstyle," showing how implicit, culturally patterned
   styles of membership filter collective representations. The result is "
   culture in interaction," which complements research in the sociology of
   emotion, neoinstitutionalism, the reproduction of inequality, and other

   RESULTS: In situ and local breast tumors in African American and
   non-Hispanic white women were less likely to be detected during periods
   of high unemployment.
   CONCLUSIONS: Contracting labor markets may impede women with symptoms
   from getting proper medical attention or distract women from discovering

AB Over the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest and
   research into the connections between associations and democracy. This
   article divides the question of associative contributions to democracy
   into four component parts: What (a) contributions do (b) different kinds
   of associations make: to advance (c) contesting ideals of democratic
   governance in various (d) political contexts? Associations enhance
   democracy in at least six ways: through the intrinsic value of
   associative life, fostering civic virtues and teaching political skills,
   offering resistance to power and checking government, improving the
   quality and equality of representation, facilitating public
   deliberation, and creating opportunities for citizens and groups to
   participate directly in governance. These contributions are not all
   mutually consonant with one another, and different forms of associations
   are better suited to advance some contributions than others.
   Further-more, those who propose bolstering associations as a strategy
   for revitalizing democracy frequently have quite different ideals of
   democracy in mind. The forms and contributions of associations
   appropriate to three contesting notions of democratic governance-liberal
   minimalism, conventional representation-cum-administration, and
   participatory democracy-are also discussed. Finally, the democratic
   priority of associative contributions depends crucially on contextual
   features of particular societies. Under tyrannical regimes, for example,
   associations that resist government authority are more crucial than
   those that foster compliance and respect for political institutions.

AB Background: In the United States, infant-parent bed sharing is a
   controversial and poorly understood practice. Proponents site potential
   advantages such as increases in bonding and facilitation of
   breastfeeding, whereas opponents site potential increases in risks of
   suffocation and sudden infant death syndrome, particularly among mothers
   who smoke. Few studies have examined normative practices in low-income
   populations.
   Objectives: To describe sleep practices in a cohort of infants born to
   predominantly low-income, inner-city mothers, to examine stability
   in-sleep practices during the first 7 to 12 months of life, and to
   identify factors associated with bed sharing.
   Design and Setting: Prospective birth cohort study in the District of
   Columbia, with recruitment taking place between August 1995 and
   September 1996 and follow-up from November 1995 to September 1997.
   Participants: Maternal-infant pairs were systematically selected from 3
   hospitals. We interviewed 394 mothers shortly after delivery and at 3 to
   7 months post partum. Of these, 369 were interviewed again at 7 to 12
   months post partum.
   Main Outcome Measure: Usual bed sharing.
   Results: At age 3 to 7 months (mean age, 129 days), 201 infants (51%)
   usually slept alone and 191 (48%) usually slept in a bed with a parent
   or other adult. Similarly, at age 7 to 12 months (mean age, 262 days),
   190 infants (51%) usually slept alone and 175 (47%) usually slept in a
   bed with a parent or other adult. Of the infants who slept with a parent
   or other adult at age 3 to 7 months 75% continued to do so at age 7 to
   12 months. Similarly, of infants who usually slept alone at age 3 to 7
   months, only 22% were reported to be usual bed sharers at age 7 to 12
   months. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with bed sharing at
   both follow-up interviews included single marital status of the mother
   (first interview: odds ratio [OR] = 1.90; 95% confidence interval [ CI
   1, 1.11-3.27; second interview: OR= 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.25) and I or
   more moves since the birth of the infant (first interview: OR= 1.82; 95%
   CI, 1.10-3.01; second interview: OR= 1.73; 950% CI, 1.05-2.86).
   Breastfeeding and household crowding were not significantly associated
   with bed sharing.
   Conclusions: Bed sharing was common in this inner-city population, and
   sleep practices were relatively stable during the first 7 to 12 months
   of life. These findings underscore the need for additional research
   clarifying, the benefits and risks of bed sharing.

AB Hunting, particularly when it involves large game that is extensively
   shared, has been suggested to serve as a form of costly signaling by
   hunters, serving to attract mates and allies or to deter competitors.
   Empirical evidence presented elsewhere on turtle hunting practiced by
   Meriam people of Torres Strait, Australia, supports several key
   predictions of the costly signaling account. Here we present evidence
   from the same study bearing on another key prediction, that signalers
   (hunters) gain social and reproductive benefits. Specifically, we find
   that successful hunters gain social recognition, have an earlier onset
   of reproduction, achieve higher age-specific reproductive success, and
   gain higher quality mates, who also achieve above-average reproductive
   success. Meriam hunters also average more mates (women who bear their
   offspring) and more co-resident sexual partners than other men, and
   these partners (but not mates) are significantly younger. Several lines
   of evidence thus support the idea that hunting is a form of costly
   signaling ill this population. Alternative hypotheses involving
   reciprocity (from grateful recipients of meat) and direct offspring
   provisioning by hunters are not consistent with available evidence, but
   in the absence of experimental manipulation we cannot rule out a role
   for phenotypic correlation.

   records from local hospitals were reviewed for the years of 1997 and

   September 1998 through September 1999. A case-control study was
   conducted with 2 matched control subjects per case patient. The mean
   annual incidence was 98 cases per 100,000 persons. Children had an
   incidence 3 times higher than that for adults and were more likely to
   have LS lesions on the face and neck. Identified risk factors included
   owning a cat, playing in crop fields, having a dirt floor in the house,
   working mainly outdoors, and having a ceiling made of raw wood or
   conditions associated with a lower socioeconomic status. Decreased
   environmental exposure, such wearing protective clothing during
   construction activities for adults or limiting contact with cats and
   soil for children, and improvements in living spaces may decrease the
   incidence of LS.

AB Urban dengue is common in most countries of the Americas, but has been
   rare in the United States for more than half a century. In 1999 we
   investigated an outbreak of the disease that affected Nuevo Laredo,
   Tamaulipas, Mexico, and Laredo, Texas, United States, contiguous cities
   that straddle the international border. The incidence of recent cases,
   indicated by immunoglobulin M antibody serosurvey, was higher in Nuevo
   Laredo, although the vector, Aedes aegypti, was more abundant in Laredo.
   Environmental factors that affect contact with mosquitoes, such as
   air-conditioning and human behavior, appear to account for this paradox.
   We conclude that the low prevalence of dengue in the United States is
   primarily due to economic, rather than climatic, factors.

   grounding human studies on the premise that humans are rational egoists

   the conceptual foundation of orthodox economic theory, it has been

AB Mother-blame, the propensity to explain negative outcomes for children
   by focusing on the failures of mothers, has a long history in the
   social-scientific study of adolescent deviance. We examine trends in
   mother-blaming over time by performing a textual analysis of scholarly
   accounts of the etiology of anorexia nervosa. Our reading of these
   expert accounts suggests that mother-blaming for child pathology is
   interconnected with changing ideas about proper social roles for women.
   Deficient mothering, that is, was often linked to a woman's
   ambitiousness, willingness to abandon familial duties in favor of
   careers, or, conversely, her embracement of patriarchal proscriptions
   for what a woman should be. Poor maternal parenting was a consistent and
   dominant theme through much of the period we analyzed, however, the
   structural and cultural explanations appeared to change substance and
   form in synchrony with prevailing ideas about a woman's rightful
   relationship to the paid labor market. Other social explanations for
   changing rhetoric, including the gender composition of published
   accounts, are also explored.

AB The study examined the role of coparenting for predicting children's
   classroom problems after controlling for parent rejection during family
   interactions. Fathers, mothers, and their children (52 families) were
   observed in their homes the summer before the child entered third grade.
   The parents' rejection of their child's efforts and supportive
   coparenting were coded as the parents helped their child with three
   difficult problem-solving tasks. Children's adjustment in their
   third-grade classrooms was assessed the following school year using
   year-long observations and teacher report. Parents' rejection of their
   children's efforts when problem solving predicted children's social
   problems, attention problems, and grades the next year in third grade.
   After controlling for child gender and parents' rejection, supportive
   coparenting predicted children's later attention problems,
   passivity/dependence, and grades. There were significant interactions
   between parents' rejection and supportive coparenting for predicting
   children's attention, passivity/dependence, and grades. Parents'
   rejection played a particularly important role for predicting children's
   attention, passivity/ dependence, and grades when supportive coparenting
   was low.

   (eta = 817, grades 2-6), Los Angeles (eta = 657), and West Berlin (n =
   517). Although these samples have been utilised in other comparative
   studies we have conducted, the role and function of intellective skill,
   as measured by the Raven Progressive Matrices, has not before been
   examined. The results of our analyses predicting school performance from
   the action-control beliefs and the Raven scores were quite revealing.
   The amount of variance in actual school performance that was shared with
   (1) the children's action-control beliefs and (2) their Raven scores was
   very high in West Berlin (86%) and Tokyo (73%), but very low in Los
   Angeles (37%). These outcomes strengthen arguments that the
   comparatively high levels of personal agency, but low correlations with
   performance, are distinctive characteristics of US socioeducational
   contexts.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine peer aggression,
   victimisation, and social relationships in children and adolescents in
   semi-rural India. Aggression and victimisation were expected to be
   related to concurrent social problems such as peer rejection, perceived
   lack of social support, and perceived conflict in significant
   relationships. These findings were expected to be qualified by gender
   and developmental differences. Data were collected from 229 fourth-,
   sixth-, eighth-, and tenth-graders in a small semi-rural northwestern
   town in India. Aggressors and victims were more likely to be rejected
   than their nonaggressive nonvictimised peers. Victims and aggressors
   were more likely to report lack of social support but not more conflict
   from significant others than nonvictims. Gender differences were
   observed in that males were more likely to be aggressors or victims than
   females. No significant developmental differences emerged with regard to
   peer aggression and victimisation. Theoretical implications for both the
   cultural specificity and the universality of social and behavioural
   development are discussed.

AB Despite the usefulness of advance directives, most dialysis patients do
   not complete them. Current views of the advance care planning process
   emphasize that development of a specific written advance directive is
   only one small part of the process. Patients and families use advance
   care planning discussions to plan for death, achieve control over their
   health care, and strengthen relationships. Studies of chronic dialysis
   patients have shown that discussions about end-of-life care occur within
   the patient-family and not the patient-physician relationship.
   Successful advance care planning requires that dialysis care providers
   incorporate end-of-life care wishes and palliative care into the overall
   health care plans for their patients. This review focuses on the past
   impediments to achieving useful advance directives among dialysis
   patients and their families and provides some suggestions to improving
   this important aspect of dialysis patient care.

AB To determine correlates of early shooting gallery (SG) attendance and
   HIV prevalence and incidence among new injection drug users (IDUs),
   baseline data from a prospective cohort study of street-recruited IDUs
   aged 15 to 30 years and injecting less than or equal to5 years were used
   to identify early high-risk practices and salient social circumstances
   associated with early SG attendance to help in the design of innovative
   intervention strategies. Of 226 IDUs, 10.6% were HIV-seropositive, and
   HIV incidence was 6.6 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.2-13.3). Median
   age was 25 years, and most participants were African American (64%) and
   female (61%). Using multiple logistic regression, early SG attendees
   were three times as likely to be HIV-seropositive and twice as likely to
   be initiated by an older IDU. Early SG attendees were also five times
   more likely to share injection equipment and over three times more
   likely to report a high-risk injecting network soon after initiating
   injection. These data suggest that young new IDUs who attend SGs early
   tend to be initiated by older high-risk IDUs and to share and inject
   within a high-risk social setting early on as well. Hence, older IDUs
   may serve as a bridge group to SGs, transmitting HIV from older to
   younger IDUs.

AB This study conducted a quantitative ethnographic analysis of the
   influence of demographic factors and early experience (childhood
   exposure to dogs) on Taiwanese dog-keeping practices and behavior. A
   telephone survey of a randomly selected sample of 2,001 Taiwan residents
   determined their dog ownership histories, current patterns of dog
   ownership and disposal, and other dog-related activities. The results
   suggest that low rates of neutering, easy availability of low- or
   no-cost puppies, a tendency to allow owned dogs free access to the
   outdoors, unrealistic expectations of dog ownership, canine behavioral
   problems, and religious and cultural taboos against euthanasia and
   shelter relinquishment have contributed to the recent increase in the
   numbers of free-roaming dogs in Taiwan. Logistic regression analyses
   determined that a relatively small number of demographic and
   experiential variables predicted dog ownership and disposal patterns.
   The most important of these was childhood experience of living with
   household dogs. In light of these findings, future efforts to reduce the
   stray dog problem should focus on enforcing registration fees,
   particularly for unsterilized animals; low-cost neutering schemes; and
   educational programs designed to promote neutering, improve knowledge of
   canine behavior and behavior problems, and develop more realistic
   expectations and attitudes toward dog ownership. Marked Taiwanese
   resistance to canine euthanasia and shelter relinquishment suggests a
   need for alternative methods of managing the existing free-roaming dog
   population.

AB In the Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., metropolitan area, community associations
   with legally binding covenants, codes, and restrictions (CC&Rs) impose
   limitations on landscaping activities in many new neighborhood
   residential communities. Studies were conducted in the Phoenix area to
   develop an understanding of residential homeowner landscape preferences
   and practices and how they might be impacted by CC&Rs. Residential yards
   in communities with CC&Rs controlling landscape activity had fewer
   trees, more shrubs and groundcovers, and less turf coverage than did
   landscapes in communities without CC&Rs. More homeowners identified
   their front yard landscapes as being a desert design type rather than an
   oasis or mesic design, with the percentage higher for homeowners living
   in neighborhoods with CC&Rs than for those in neighborhoods without
   CC&Rs. More homeowners preferred an oasis landscape design type to
   either desert or mesic designs, and roughly 70% of homeowners preferred
   a landscape design type that had at least some lawn area. More Arizona
   natives preferred mesic landscapes than did domestic migrants.
   Homeowners cited ease of maintenance and landscape aesthetics as the two
   most important traits for their landscape. These findings reflect the
   increasing influence and importance of desert landscape design in the
   U.S. Southwest as a contemporary landscape design style in urban areas
   bridled by an arid climate and suggests that the emergent popularity of
   desert landscaping in Phoenix is predominately a top-down social
   phenomenon directed by public and private interest groups for
   residential homeowner use.

AB This paper examines the impact of rural-urban migration on under-two
   mortality in India, using data from the 1992/93 Indian National Family
   Health Survey. Multilevel logistic models are fitted for mortality in
   three age groups: neonatal, early post-neonatal, and late post-neonatal
   and toddler. Migration status was not a significant determinant of
   mortality in any of the three age groups. Further analysis shows that a
   relationship between migration status and mortality exists when
   socioeconomic and health utilization variables are omitted from the
   models. The relationship between migration and mortality is thus
   explained by differences in socioeconomic status and use of health
   services between rural-urban migrant and non-migrant groups. The
   selectivity of rural-urban migrants on socioeconomic characteristics
   creates mortality differentials between rural urban migrants and rural
   non-migrants. Problems faced by migrants in assimilating into urban
   societies create mortality differentials between rural-urban migrants
   and urban non-migrants. These results highlight the need to target
   migrants in the provision of health services, and demonstrate that rural
   areas continue to have the highest levels of infant-child mortality.
   Further research is needed to understand the health care needs of
   rural-urban migrants in order to inform the provision of appropriate
   health care.

   One group of adolescents terminated their pregnancies (n = 95), a second
   became pregnant and carried their pregnancies to term but considered
   abortion (n = 68), and the third also carried their pregnancies to term
   but did not consider abortion (n = 204). The study was carried out
   between 1995 and 1998 in Fortaleza, Brazil. Adolescents were interviewed
   at the time of their hospitalization or their first prenatal visit and
   again at 6 weeks and 1 year post-abortion or postpartum. Friends and
   family recommended abortion to at least half of the teenagers in each
   group. Teenagers who aborted were more accepting of abortion than those
   who did not abort, while those who considered abortion found the
   practice more justified than those who did not consider abortion.
   Teenagers who aborted became less accepting a year later, while those
   who did not consider abortion became more accepting. A better
   understanding of adolescent attitudes towards abortion, and their
   decision-making process should help adults and professionals meet the
   needs of adolescents for support in the process and in the reduction of
   the number of unintended pregnancies in the future.

AB CONTEXT: Primarily because of immigration, Asian Americans are one of
   the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse minority groups in the
   United States. However, little is known about their perspectives on
   health care quality.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine factors contributing to quality of care from the
   perspective of Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients with limited
   English language skills.
   DESIGN: Qualitative study using focus groups and content analysis to
   determine domains of quality of care.
   SETTING: Four community health centers in Massachusetts.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 122 Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients
   were interviewed in focus groups by bilingual interviewers using a
   standardized, translated moderator guide.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Domains of quality of care mentioned by patients
   in verbatim transcripts.
   RESULTS: In addition to dimensions of health care quality commonly
   expressed by Caucasian, English-speaking patients in the United States,
   Chinese- and Vietnamese-American patients with limited English
   proficiency wanted to discuss the use of non-Western medical practices
   with their providers, but encountered significant barriers. They viewed
   providers' knowledge, inquiry, and nonjudgmental acceptance of
   traditional Asian medical beliefs and practices as part of quality care.
   Patients also considered the quality of interpreter services to be very
   important. They preferred using professional interpreters rather than
   family members, and preferred gender-concordant translators.
   Furthermore, they expressed the need for help in navigating health care
   systems and obtaining support services.
   CONCLUSIONS: Cultural and linguistically appropriate health care
   services may lead to improved health care quality for Asian-American
   patients who have limited English language skills. Important aspects of
   quality include providers' respect for traditional health beliefs and
   practices, access to professional interpreters, and assistance in
   obtaining social services.

AB Objective: Relations among young adult alcohol use disorders (AUDs),
   preadulthood variables (gender, family history of alcoholism, childhood
   stressors, high-school class rank, religious involvement, neuroticism,
   extraversion, psychoticism) and young adult developmental tasks
   (baccalaureate degree completion, full-time employment, marriage) were
   evaluated. Method: Participants were 424 first-time college students
   (228 women) who were 18-20 years old; approximately half had a history
   of paternal alcoholism. Participants were assessed on five occasions
   over 7 years (Years 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7). Results: Structural equation
   modeling results suggest preadulthood variables were more salient
   predictors of developmental tasks than AUD diagnoses, with the majority
   of effects due to apparent selection processes. In addition, marriage
   protected against later AUD diagnosis at Year 7. Conclusions: Findings
   highlight the importance of prospective multivariate models that specify
   potential selection, causation, socialization and reciprocal effects in
   order to fully examine complex relations among variables, including
   alcohol involvement, during major life-transition periods. (J. Stud.

   unfolding of progressive pathology. Proposes that this fragmented
   concept of aging precludes operationalizing and understanding the
   cultural markers that affect longevity. These cultural milestones, or
   biocultural portals include middle age markers, retirement markers,
   perceived wisdom, sexuality, status in the community, transcendental
   beliefs, sense of empowerment vs helplessness and any other biocultural
   phase in human development. Suggests that the biocultural portals define

   a culture, strongly influence the cognitive and biological expectations
   for the second half of life.

   the public sphere. Research on civic engagement has identified new types
   of associations and new forms of organization that have transformed the
   voluntary sector While some of these changes suppress engagement, others
   encourage participation. Research on the public sphere has helped to map
   out a discourse of civil society, which identifies utopian images of
   civic purity as well as anti-utopian images of civic pollution. This
   discourse circulates in multiple publics, and, increasingly, in
   mass-mediated forums. In both areas, sociologists have contributed a
   level of analytical precision and empirical detail that had previously
   been missing from the more theoretical and normative debates about

AB For twelve years as a legislator in the North Carolina General Assembly,
   I have observed and participated in widespread political debate. Key
   subjects have included the state's budget and tax policies, as well as
   cultural issues such as the death penalty, guns, and the public display
   of religion. During this same period, with time out for legislative
   leaves, I have taught sociology, including a seminar in political
   sociology, at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
   This article focuses on the roles played by progressive activists (both
   outsiders and insiders) and progressive Democratic politicians in trying
   to win legislative battles against more entrenched conservative forces.
   It finds that the progressive coalition can sometimes persuade moderate
   Democrats to adopt more progressive public policy. The specific steps
   taken are discussed in detail. The article also provides examples of the
   progressive coalition's losses.

AB Comparative-historical political sociology stands at a crossroads. One
   direction leads toward history, with a stress oil the uniqueness and
   complexity of particular times, places and events, contingency and
   chance in determining outcomes, and the dismissal of general theory and
   systematic testing of propositions. The other direction leads toward
   social science, with an emphasis on general causal models, theoretical
   progress through the resolution of anomalies, and transportable
   propositions with abstractly defined scope conditions. Many contemporary
   historical sociologists chose to reject general theory in favor of more
   descriptive analyses of particular times and places, contributing much
   more to substantive knowledge than to theory We argue that this is now
   beginning to change. Inspite of sharp theoretical polemics from
   historicist and positivist camps, comparative-historical research in
   political sociology is moving toward an increasingly productive middle
   ground. Much new historical work in political sociology is becoming less
   inductive and descriptive and more theoretical by paying attention to
   causal mechanisms, the theoretical resolution of anomalies, and the
   transportability of theoretical arguments across spatially and
   temporally defined contexts. Evaluating contemporary research on the
   making, unmaking and remaking of states, we contend that this new
   historical work is providing political sociology with enhanced
   substantive/empirical knowledge and new methods, and advancing theory.

   Sociologists' inability to differentiate them from terrorists, i.e.,
   Arabization. Subsequently, based upon the definition of political
   terrorism as organized violence, Shultz developed a typology of
   political terrorism to fill the void. That typology includes three
   categories and four variables germane to terrorist acts. Such efforts to

AB Proportional hazards models are powerful methods for the analysis of
   dynamic social processes and are widely used in sociology to estimate
   the effects of covariates on event timing (e.g., time to arrest, birth,
   marriage). The proper statistical modeling of failure time data is an
   important analytical issue in sociology, but to date the field has
   largely neglected the application of these models to multiple failure
   time data in which the conventional assumption of the independence of
   failure times is not tenable. This paper critically describes a class of
   models known as variance-corrected proportional hazards models that have
   been developed by statisticians to take into account a lack of
   independence among failure times. The purpose is to provide an
   exposition and comparison for sociologists of several such models and
   associated methods,for handling multiple failure time data that can be
   readily estimated in commonly available statistical software packages.
   We pay special attention to the data requirements necessary for
   estimation of the models. The paper concludes with an illustrative
   application of the models to analyze the arrest patterns of a sample of
   California Youth Authority parolees.

AB In this address I focus on sociological relativity and our discipline's
   ineffectiveness in dealing with the anomie associated with high
   modernity. I attempt to make the case for a sociology that can
   empirically distinguish between tolerance and license and can posit
   conceptions of "social justice" and "morality" as empirically
   demonstrable phenomena. After briefly discussing relevant ideas
   associated with classical sociology and recent theoretical approaches to
   the question of sociocultural relativity, I suggest that any attempt to
   deal with the issue of social justice must involve an empirically
   grounded view of universal human nature as an emergent process that
   reveals itself time and time again within the seemingly infinite
   diversity of a socially constructed world. I further suggest that the
   path to understanding emergent human nature might include an integration
   of linguistic analysis, contemporary brain research, and the quest for
   human universals. After considering the practical (and impractical)
   implications of a successful search for emergent human nature for the
   discipline of sociology, I conclude the address with a real life example
   that illustrates the essence of human species powers even in the face of
   authoritarian oppression.

   Bureau's 1990 Census of Population and Housing: Summary Tape File 3A and
   the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1990 Cumulative Exposure
   Project. Findings from OLS and WLS regression suggest that air lead
   concentrations are associated with county racial composition. Counties
   with the largest proportion of Black youth under 16 years of age (10th
   decile = 0.09) have nearly 7.9 percent more lead in the air than
   counties with no Black youth (1st decile = 0.00). Counties with the
   largest proportion of White youth under 16 years of age (10th decile =
   0.25) have nearly 10.0 percent less lead. in the air than counties with
   the smallest proportion of White youth (1st decile = 0.13). These
   findings persist despite adjustments for urbanization, income, and
   housing values. This work proposes that the distribution of air lead
   levels has important implications for the field of sociology and the
   study of racial inequality.

AB Graduate department ratings help to shape the power and privilege of a
   graduate department at its home university, as well as with respect to
   other departments in its discipline. Ideally, such ratings would reflect
   the perceived quality of a department. Yet frequent critiques suggest
   that the ratings fall far short of this ideal. The authors analyzed
   subjective ratings in three related disciplines-sociology, political
   science, and economics-and from two rating sources: the National
   Research Council and U.S. News and World Report. They hypothesized three
   major components to the ratings: (1) perceived departmental quality, (2)
   systematic error owing to the method of data collection, and (3) random
   measurement error. Using structural equation modeling, they found that
   20 percent to 30 percent of the variation in ratings derives from
   systematic error, most of the rest comes from perceived quality, and the
   smallest component is random measurement error. The authors also found
   that variables, such as citations per capita, departmental size,
   public/private status, and geographic location, influence ratings
   through their impact on perceived quality and/or the systematic errors
   that enter the ratings.

AB In this article, we review 25 years of sociological scholarship

   divide the literature into three theoretical perspectives: technological
   determinism views medical technology as a political force to shape
   social relationships, social essentialism emphasizes how medical
   technologies are neutral tools to be interpreted in social interactions,
   and technology-in-practice highlights the dialectic relationship between
   technology and its users in health care. While the
   technology-in-practice orientation allows social scientists to critique
   the high hopes and dire warnings embedded in medical technologies, we
   argue that the logical next step of this paradigm is to move beyond
   criticism and influence the creation and implementation of medical
   technologies.

AB This is a comparison of the emotions we have in watching a movie with
   those we have in everyday life. Everyday emotion is loose in frame or
   context but rather controlled and regulated in content. Movie emotion,
   in contrast, is tightly framed and boundaried but permissive and
   uncontrolled in content. Movie emotion is therefore quite safe and
   inconsequential but can still be unusually satisfying and pleasurable. I
   think of the movie emotions as modeling clay that can symbolize all
   sorts of human troubles. A major function of movies then is catharsis, a
   term I use more inclusively than usual.
   Throughout I use a pragmatist approach to film theory. This position
   gives the optimal distance to the study of ordinary, middle-level
   emotion. In contrast psychoanalysis is too close and cognitive theory
   too distant. This middle position is similar to Arlie Hochschild's
   symbolic interactionist approach to the sociology of emotions, which
   also mediates between psychoanalysis and cognitive theories.

   it important? What is the proper attitude for this form of thinking?
   What are the most important dimensions and types of higher-level
   thinking, particularly in sociology? How should we teach higher-level
   thinking? These are some of the most important questions that will

   despite many criticisms about the contradictory manner in which it has
   been defined and applied. One particular problem concerns the untenable
   distinction often made by sociologists between subcultures and
   countercultures; another is the implicit characterization of subcultures
   as either deviant, marginalized groups or heroic resisters against the
   hegemonic culture of global capitalism. In this paper, we attempt to
   demonstrate a method of teaching the concept of subculture to
   undergraduate sociology students that would remedy these two
   difficulties. We do this by offering working definitions of several
   terms, including common culture, subculture, idioculture, and social
   world. We conclude the paper by developing a classroom exercise to help
   students grasp the main differences between these various terms.

AB Because adequate nutrient controls were not established when there were
   past opportunities to do so, nutrient pollution of estuaries and coastal
   waters has resulted in the impairment of ecosystems and major reductions
   or collapse of fisheries at numerous sites around the world, resulting
   in major economical and societal impacts. The root of the problem is
   that the political policies and processes have permitted municipalities,
   developers, industries and farmers to expand and operate without paying
   the full cost of their activities, and this has been done at the expense
   of those who rely on the productivity and recreational value of our
   estuarine and coastal waters. Some governments have developed remedial
   nutrient control programs, but most of them have been under funded and
   inadequately enforced, resulting in small increments of progress that
   tend to be lost because of inadequate land use and immigration controls.
   It is believed that nutrient recovery and controlled reuse can provide a
   major tool for the control of nutrient pollution and should be widely
   implemented. Plans are currently being developed to promote widespread
   use of nutrient recovery and reuse in the Chesapeake Bay region of the
   USA. An example of phosphorus reuse is presented.

   techniques of spatial analysis and data for two geographies: late
   nineteenth-century French departments, and late twentieth-century U.S.
   counties. Results of the French analysis contradict Durkheim's claim
   that "imitation" plays no role in shaping the geographic patterning of
   suicide. Suicide rates for northern and southern French departments
   cluster geographically even when the clustering of multiple dimensions
   of social integration is controlled. These findings are replicated in a
   contemporary analysis of nonwestern U.S. counties. Results for the
   American West, however support the Durkheimian view that suicide
   clusters in geographic space only because important structural
   predictors of suicide, including measures,of social integration, do so
   as. well. These discrepant findings are reconciled and it is concluded
   that the geographic patterning of suicide is shaped by both social
   integration and imitation.

AB The formation of early modern states-combining increases in taxation,
   warfare, and administrative centralization-was often violently opposed
   by subjects. A game theoretic model of strategic interactions between
   rulers and subjects is developed to more fully specify the relationship
   between state-making and revolt in France between 1515 and 1789.
   Quantitative analyses of revolts throughout France are combined with a
   brief case study of revolts in Guyenne (the most quarrelsome French
   province) to test propositions derived from the model. Offensive war
   (but not war in general) and administrative centralization increased the
   likelihood of revolt, while the presence of the Estates General (the
   national legislative assembly) decreased it. The effect of taxation on
   revolt depended on the historical context-high taxes and offensive wars
   tended to incite revolts prior to the Fronde (a cluster of revolts in
   1648-1653), but had no effect afterwards. It is argued that the outcomes
   of significant revolts, like the Fronde, often serve as important
   turning points in the history of state-making. Potentially similar
   events in medieval England and early modern Spain are also discussed.

   Biofeedback and neurofeedback training can facilitate relaxation, mental
   stillness, and the emergence of spiritual experiences. A growing body of
   empirical studies documents largely positive effects of religious
   involvement on health. The effects of religion and spirituality on
   health are diverse, ranging from such tangible and easily understood
   phenomena as a reduction of health-risk behaviors in church-goers, to
   more elusive phenomena such as the distant effects of prayer on health
   and physiology. Psychophysiological methods may prove useful in
   identifying specific physiological mechanisms mediating such effects.
   Spirituality is also a dimension in much of complementary and
   alternative medicine (CAM), and the CAM arena may offer a window of
   opportunity for biofeedback practice.

AB Background: Previous studies have suggested an association between
   depression and low socioeconomic status, but few have empirically
   examined the effect of depressive symptoms on income and employment over
   time.
   Objective: To determine whether depressive symptoms are associated with
   subsequent unemployment or loss of family income.
   Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study of 5115 adults aged 18
   to 30 years. These participants included approximately equal numbers of
   African Americans and whites and men and women from 4 cities in the
   United States who completed the 1990-1991 examination of the Coronary
   Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. For this
   analysis, we included 2334 participants who were employed full or part
   time and who reported an annual family income of $25000 or more.
   Participants completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale and were considered to have depressive symptoms if they scored 16
   or higher on the 60-point scale. We evaluated self-reported unemployment
   and annual family income during 5 years of follow-up.
   Results: Thirty-three percent (118/354) of participants with depressive
   symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score
   greater than or equal to16) in 1990-1991 and 21% (335/1581) of
   participants without substantial depressive symptoms (Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score <16) reported new
   unemployment during the subsequent 5 years (odds ratio, 1.9; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.4-2.4; P<.001). This association remained strong
   after adjusting for potential confounding variables, including marital
   status, education, history of unemployment, current part-time (vs
   full-time) employment, and cigarette smoking (odds ratio, 1.6; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.2-2.0; P=.001). Seventeen percent (62/371) of
   participants with depressive symptoms and 7% (113/1631) of participants
   without substantial depressive symptoms in 1990-1991 reported that their
   family income had decreased below $25 000 by 19951996 (odds ratio, 2.7;
   95% confidence interval, 1.9-3.8; P<.001). This association also
   remained strong after adjusting for potential confounding variables
   (odds ratio, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.7; P<.001).
   Conclusions: Depressive symptoms are associated with subsequent
   unemployment and loss of family income among working young adults.
   Socioeconomic indicators, such as income and employment, should be
   considered in evaluating the potential benefits of treatment for
   patients with depressive symptoms.

AB Introduction: Although the seasonality of human births has been known
   for nearly 175 years, it has not been adequately explained. Societal and
   environmental reasons have often been cited as the reasons for
   seasonality. Since increased light is known to initiate reproduction in
   many animals, photoperiod, light intensity and melatonin are likely
   variables related to this phenomenon. This retrospective study
   demonstrates a logical connection between these factors and human
   conceptions.
   Methodology: Seasonality data were extracted from previous studies.
   Daily cloud cover amounts were utilized as indices for environmental
   light intensity. Variables were evaluated by Pearsonian r.
   Discussion: Results were evaluated and discussed in a series of 11
   sub-studies involving environmental light intensity and the seasonality
   of human births.
   Conclusion: Human birth seasonality may be primarily influenced by
   environmental light intensity with photoperiod in a secondary role. This
   result is supported by significant r-values for US and Europe, a logical
   link between US, Canadian, Indian, European, and Hong Kong conceptions
   as well as the concurrent transition of conceptions and cloud cover:
   Israeli conceptions, however, contradict US and European patterns.

AB Hepatitis A and hepatitis B are 2 common sexually transmitted diseases
   that are preventable by vaccination. Men who have sex with men (MSM) are
   at increased risk of acquiring hepatitis A virus and hepatitis B virus
   through sexual exposure. Current guidelines from the Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention recommend that MSM receive immunizations against
   hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Many health care providers and most MSM are
   unaware of the risks and the potentially dangerous consequences posed by
   hepatitis A and B virus infection, and the MSM thus remain unvaccinated
   and unprotected from exposure to these viruses. It is important for
   health care providers to educate and vaccinate their at-risk male
   patients against hepatitis A and hepatitis B virus infections.

AB The lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens) is a species of cultural
   significance to the Menominee Nation, a Native American tribe indigenous
   to northeast Wisconsin. Lake sturgeon in the Lake Winnebago system
   historically migrated up the Wolf River to spawn at Keshena Falls,
   within the current boundaries of the Menominee Reservation where, each
   spring, the Menominee people gathered at Keshena Falls to harvest lake
   sturgeon. The construction of two dams on the Wolf River downstream of
   Keshena Falls in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
   contributed to extirpation of this species on the Menominee Reservation.
   The general public has had the opportunity to harvest lake sturgeon from
   Lake Winnebago during a winter spear fishery since 1932. Those who
   participate in this fishery feel as strongly about the lake sturgeon
   resource as do the Menominee people. Cooperation among multiple resource
   management agencies and the public was necessary to address the
   interests of both groups and at the same time ensure protection of the
   Winnebago system lake sturgeon population. In 1993, tribal, state, and
   federal representatives developed a plan to reintroduce lake sturgeon to
   the Menominee Reservation. The planning process was designed to involve
   all the various, often competing, tribal and non-tribal interests in a
   constructive effort to develop and implement a Menominee Reservation
   sturgeon rehabilitation plan that all parties could accept and endorse.
   The core planning group was the Menominee Reservation Lake Sturgeon
   Enhancement Committee which worked with the various sturgeon 'publics'
   to identify common sturgeon restoration goals, objectives and management
   strategies, and which has worked together since that time in the effort
   to re-establish viable lake sturgeon populations in Menominee
   Reservation waters. Since 1994, over 30 000 hatchery-raised lake
   sturgeon have been stocked in reservation lakes, and 87 Wolf River lake
   sturgeon have been radio-tagged and relocated upstream to reservation
   waters of the river. Enough mature lake sturgeon were present in this
   river reach in 2001 to permit spawning there for the first time in 50
   years. The success of the co-management effort has been encouraging and
   participants are committed to the goal of establishing self-sustaining
   lake sturgeon populations in reservation waters.

AB This paper examines the political sociology of composing by looking at
   the life and work of six classical composers: Bach, Haydn, Mozart,
   Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Schoenberg. We find that composing entails
   distinct social, political, cultural, religious, and familial
   dimensions. We conclude that the much touted purity and insularity of
   classical music are but myths. We note that the fact of composing
   presumes at least a partial synthesis of the humanities and the social
   sciences.

AB Objective: To examine racial differences in the age at which
   Medicaid-eligible children first receive an autistic disorder (AD)
   diagnosis and to examine time in mental health treatment until an AD
   diagnosis was received.
   Method: Philadelphia Medicaid specialty mental health claims identified
   406 children who received services in 1999 for AD. Claims from 1993-1999
   were used to identify the date of first mental health visit, first
   receipt of AD diagnosis, and number of visits occurring between those
   dates. Linear regression was used to examine the relationship among
   race, age at first diagnosis of AD, time in mental health treatment, and
   number of visits until the diagnosis was made.
   Results: On average, white children received the AD diagnosis at 6.3
   years of age, compared with 7.9 years for black children (p <.001).
   White children entered the mental health system at an earlier age (6.0
   versus 7.1 years, p =.005); however, after adjusting for age, sex, and
   time eligible for Medicaid, black children required more time in
   treatment before receiving the diagnosis. Conclusions: Important
   disparities exist in the early detection and treatment of autism. These
   disparities may be the result of differences in help-seeking, advocacy
   and support, and clinician behaviors. J. Am. Acad. Child Addlesc.

AB Leprosy is a highly stigmatized disease that apart from the physical
   ailments and the deformities causes psycho-socio-economic problems to
   the people affected. As a result of social rejection, leprosy colonies
   were formed inhabited by the leprosy-affected families. With inadequate
   socioeconomic support and help, these people often have resorted to
   beggary as a way to earn their living. This study is an attempt to look
   into the lives of the leprosy-affected people living in the leprosy
   colony in Ambala City, Haryana, north-west State of India and who have
   accepted beggary as their source of income. The psychosocial impact of
   leprosy and the subjects' attitude towards beggary has been studied. The
   study comprised 21 families, including, 22 men, 21 women and 40
   children. Seventy-one percent of the families came from Southern India,
   All the men and nine of the women were leprosy-affected, The proportion
   of people with deformity was 89%. Prior to contracting leprosy, all of
   the men were employed, mainly in agriculture and physical tabour, At
   present, all are beggars. Of the 20 who were interviewed, 65% of those
   who beg and 83% of other adults were illiterate. Fifty percent of the
   children were in need of education. Due to leprosy, the social
   interaction of 85% of the interviewees was limited to within the colony
   and of 88% to only other leprosy-affected people. Through their own
   organized efforts, they raised welfare services and housing for
   themselves. None of them liked begging to start with but have accepted
   it as a source of income, If given a chance and support, 80% said they
   were ready to quit begging. They were concerned about the education of
   their children. The study highlighted the need to develop alternate
   avenues of income generation utilizing the existing desires and
   potential of the inhabitants.

PD DEC 2002

AB Leprosy is one of the most socially stigmatized diseases known today.
   Social stigma is associated mainly due to the prevalent myths like its
   hereditary and contagious nature, divine curse along with the physical
   deformities caused. The affected people not only face physical
   impairments but also suffer psychosocial repercussions due to the
   community's attitude. The long-term physical and psychosocial
   restrictions slowly push the leprosy-affected person out of the society.
   With lack of social support and self-confidence, some dehabilitated
   leprosy-affected persons end up as beggars. The present study focuses on
   the long-term consequences of leprosy. It is based on case studies of
   leprosy-affected beggars in Delhi. The process of dehabilitation in each
   case has been studied. It has been found that dehabilitation is a
   continuous process. The combination of leprosy, physical impairments and
   social stigma causing further participation restriction, lead to
   dehabilitation of people affected by leprosy, and ending in a state of
   beggary for some. There is a need to develop a holistic approach
   including both prevention of dehabilitation and rehabilitation of those
   dehabilitated to overcome both the disease and its consequences.
   Measures to prevent such dehabilitation in future along with the
   rehabilitation of leprosy-affected beggars have been suggested. Both
   these measures should take place simultaneously.

   this study was to examine 30 CIs from across the United States and the
   "active participants " involved with the CIs. Using a mail survey, 647
   stakeholders were queried about the CI including mission, size,
   membership, duration, motives for participation in the Cl, and keys to
   successful collaboration. Reasons for stakeholder involvement included
   responsibility, concern over natural resource issues, and developing
   better partnerships. Keys to successful collaboration included six
   areas: development, information exchange, organizational support,
   personal communication, relationships/team building, and
   accomplishments. Practical information of results for stakeholders as
   well as resource managers involved in collaboration include:
   understanding participant motives, agreeing on mission, thorough and
   accurate communications, and developing support and relationships.
   Suggestions are given for future research on measuring success and
   including numerous perspectives on collaboration.

   these bronze doors for the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Florence is due
   not only to Ghiberti's artistic merits, but also to the science that was

   examine the impact of cultural factors on psychiatric illness, including
   on symptom presentation and help-seeking behavior. In order to render an

   plans acceptable to the patient, clinicians need a systematic method for
   eliciting and evaluating cultural information in the clinical encounter.
   This article describes one such method, the Cultural Formulation model,
   expanding on the guidelines published in DSM-IV. It consists of five
   components, assessing cultural identity, cultural explanations of the
   illness, cultural factors related to the psychosocial environment and
   levels of functioning, cultural elements of the clinician-patient
   relationship, and the overall impact of culture on diagnosis and care.
   We present a brief historical overview of the model and use a case

AB Racial differences in homeownership have long been a topic of

   differences in levels of homeownership between nonmarried black and
   white women in the context of place. Accordingly this paper focuses on
   the interaction between place, race, and gender and its impact on
   homeownership for nonmarried persons. The study employs the Integrated
   Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) and logistic regression analysis to
   address the following questions: Has the racial differential in
   homeownership for nonmarried women changed from 1970 to 1990? How do
   place, race, and gender interact to determine the levels of
   homeownership for nonmarried women? The findings reveal that, although
   black women were less likely than white women to own homes, the racial
   differential declined dramatically in rural areas over the two-decade
   period. The overall trend of decline was opposite to that for urban
   areas.

AB Background: The Russian Federation is experiencing epidemics of
   drug-injection-associated HIV infection and high rates of syphilis and
   other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).
   Goal: The goal of the study was to present the results of a rapid
   assessment focusing on sex workers (SWs) and drug users that was
   conducted in the Saratov Oblast in May 2000.
   Study Design: We used four data-collection techniques during this rapid
   assessment: review of available literature; in-depth interviews;
   naturalistic observations; and focus group discussions.
   Results: Sex work in Saratov/Engels is more differentiated, with more
   categories of SWs, pimps with well-defined functions, and clearly formed
   escort services. In Balakovo, sex work is confined to individual women
   who are working as freelancers, most of whom are drug users. In the past
   2 years, the drug of choice has shifted to heroin. The potential
   epidemiologic impact of sex work on the general population is defined in
   terms of the number of SW contacts per 100,000 population per year,
   which ranges from 32,800 to 730,000. Further elaboration of this simple
   measure is discussed.
   Conclusion: Our understanding of core group structure and
   characteristics, core-periphery contacts, and the impact of these on the
   spread of STI needs to be enhanced; comparative empirical data on such
   parameters need to be collected across societies.

AB This article considers the direct impact of political parties, interest
   groups, and social movement organizations (SMOs) on policy, providing
   evidence for a "core" hypothesis and three others that refine or qualify
   it. The core hypothesis: all three types of organizations have
   substantial impacts on policy. The other three: (1) when public opinion
   is taken into account, the political organizations do not have such an
   impact; (2) parties have a greater impact than interest groups and SMOs;
   and (3) interest groups and SMOs will affect policy only to the extent
   that their activities provide elected officials with information and
   resources relevant to their election campaigns. The source of data is
   articles published in major sociology and political science journals
   from 1990 to 2000, systematically coded to record the impact of
   organizations on policy. The major findings include. political
   organizations affect policy no more than half the time; parties and
   nonparty organizations affect policy about equally often; there is some
   evidence that organizational activities that respond to the electoral
   concerns of elected officials are especially likely to have an impact.

AB Foreign direct investment (FDI) is considered a powerful catalyst in
   market transition. However, FDI flows vary greatly across Central and
   East European transition countries. I compare and contrast current
   approaches, which consider country characteristics as determinants of
   FDI, with a relational approach that emphasizes institutional,
   political, economic, and cultural connections between investor and host
   countries. Regression analyses of FDI flows,in country dyads provide
   little evidence for the effects of country characteristics. Political,
   migration, trade, and cultural relations between investors and hosts
   have strong positive effects on FDI flows, and they add considerably to
   the proportion of the explained cross-national variance. These findings
   highlight the utility of a relational understanding of macroeconomic
   processes, as well as the importance of examining how substantively
   different social relations shape economic exchange.

AB This paper critically examines the interdisciplinary research of
   neighborhood effects. Neighborhood effects are community influences on
   individual social or economic outcomes. Examples include labor force
   activity, child outcomes, criminal behavior, and other socioeconomic
   phenomena. The existing theoretical and empirical literature is
   reviewed. Conceptual definitions from sociology are linked and
   contrasted with economic models. Early studies are criticized for
   failing to account for a number of endogeneity concerns. Recent
   empirical studies are also explored. The results of these papers
   demonstrate that although neighborhood characteristics are important,
   their influences are much smaller than suggested by previous research.
   An additional emphasis is dedicated to linking the neighborhood effects
   literature to other research of local or spatial activity within
   economics, sociology, and geography. In particular, the potential
   employment of local interaction game theory and spatial econometrics in
   neighborhood effects research is discussed. Additionally, a catalogue of
   existing empirical research is assembled. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

AB Max Weber has typically been regarded as a central thinker in the
   liberal tradition of social analysis. At the same time, critics have
   long noted how his democratic commitments were compromised by his
   nationalism. Drawing on existing criticism, I discuss the importance of
   charismatic leadership in Weber's thought and its implications for his
   understanding of the process of democratization. Reconstructing core
   concepts in Weber's political thought, I analyze how Weber's concept of
   plebiscitarian leadership unites charismatic domination with nationalism
   and skepticism concerning effective democratic politics. I show how
   Weber's concept of plebiscitarian rule grew from deeply held political
   values and his engagement with German politics. I then generate
   propositions regarding the problem of democratization in regime
   transitions and apply them to contemporary charismatic leaders and
   ethno-nationalist mobilization in post-Communist transitions. T argue
   that as much as it anticipates the central dilemma of charismatic
   solutions to political crisis, Weber's thought favors nationalist and
   plebiscitarian responses to democratization that have been largely
   discredited by historical experience.

AB For the St. Louis meeting of the Midwest Sociological Society, the
   author organized a special session to reflect on the particular
   sociological tradition associated with Washington University, with a
   particular focus on Alvin Gouldner's work. From that session came this
   symposium. for which various papers presented were developed into
   articles. The session and these articles raise important issues for what
   they tell us both about Gouldner's work and about where sociology is as
   a discipline today. Among these issues are (1) the optimistic quest for
   objective value-free knowledge positivism entailed in the past versus a
   self-reflexive quest for knowledge that entails a tragic acceptance of
   its limits at present. (2) the effort to distinguish social theory from
   sociology, ideology. and politics, with all of whom it overlaps as they
   strive to be both social diagnosis and social therapy. (3) the
   production of knowledge as dependent both on the lived experiences that
   shape our biographies and on the intellectual influences available in
   the local settings where we work, (4) the effort to warn us against the
   various excesses to which our disciplinary and personal commitments give
   way, and (5) the role social theory can play as a search light that
   illuminates our way in the darkness of the empirical world in which we
   live, while it simultaneously casts a shadow.

AB Classical literature, specifically ancient Greek philosophy and
   especially the study of Greek tragedy, is helpful in tracing out and
   understanding the transitions Alvin Gouldner made during his career as a
   sociologist. This article argues that a latent tragic orientation or
   vision existed during Gouldner's early career as a standout in the field
   of industrial sociology and that this tragic vision became manifest
   around 1962 as Gouldner was developing more and more strident
   denunciations of establishment sociology. This case study of Gouldner's
   career teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the tragic
   vision in helping sociologists to understand the limitations of the
   scientific quest for knowledge.

   contributions ever made to the sociology of ideas. Overshadowed soon
   after its publication. however, by Gouldner's more controversial work,
   The coming crisis of Western Sociology. the earlier book has suffered
   neglect. In an effort to correct this situation, we situate Enter Plato
   against the backdrop of other mid-twentieth-century works in the
   sociology of knowledge and related areas, arguing that Gouldner's study
   was one of the first sustained responses to Robert K, Merton's call for
   a sociology of knowledge that would steer a middle course between the
   abstract, speculative tendencies of the field's European founders and
   the relatively atheoretical contributions of their American
   counterparts. We build on this interpretation to offer a contemporary
   sociological appraisal of Enter Plato, considering its positive and
   negative lessons for sociologists of knowledge and ideas at the present
   time.

AB As China opens its door to the world, suicide research is making rapid
   progress using methods and instruments developed in the West. This is a
   feasibility study of the psychological autopsy methodology applied in
   China, with its emphasis on the social and cultural environments. With
   samples of 66 completed suicides and 66 community normal living
   controls, the authors found that it is feasible to interview at least
   two informants for each suicide case and each control, between 2 and 6
   months after the suicide. With the Chinese-cultivated contacting method
   of recruiting cases, the refusal rate is nearly zero. The
   Western-developed methodology per se proved to be valid in the Chinese
   culture. Ethical considerations in the context of Chinese culture are as
   important as in the West. Psychological autopsy technique is shown to be
   an equally applicable method for the study of completed suicides in
   Chinese culture as it is in the West. Future epidemiological research on
   Chinese suicide should use the psychological autopsy method to collect
   data from larger samples in order to increase our understanding of the
   risk factors for Chinese suicides.

AB Background: Investigators have voiced concerns that distrust of research
   and the medical community impedes successful recruitment of African
   Americans into clinical research.
   Objectives: To examine possible differences in distrust by race and to
   determine to what extent other sociodemographic factors explain any
   racial differences in distrust.
   Methods: We analyzed data from 527 African American and 382 white
   respondents of a national telephone survey on participation in clinical
   research. Our main outcome measure was a 7-item index of distrust.
   Results: African American respondents were more likely than white
   respondents not to trust that their physicians would fully explain
   research participation (41.7% vs 23.4%, P<.01) and to state that they
   believed their physicians exposed them to unnecessary risks (45.5% vs
   34.8%, P<.01). African American respondents had a significantly higher
   mean distrust index score than white respondents (3.1 vs 1.8, P<.01).
   After controlling for other sociodemographic variables in a logistic
   regression model, race remained strongly associated with a higher
   distrust score (prevalence odds ratio, 4.7; 95% confidence interval,
   2.9-7.7).
   Conclusions: Even after controlling for markers of social class, African
   Americans were less trusting than white Americans. Racial differences in
   distrust have important implications for investigators as they engage
   African Americans in research.

   Participants Primarily households including elderly people or children
   and households that are in housing rented from the borough council.
   Intervention 20 050 smoke alarms, fittings, and educational brochures
   distributed free and installed on request.
   Main outcome measures Rates of fires and related injuries during two
   years after the distribution; alarm ownership, installation, and

   Results Giving out free smoke alarms did not reduce injuries related to
   fire (rate ratio 1.3; 95% confidence interval 0.9 to 1.9), admissions to
   hospital and deaths (1.3; 0.7 to 2.3), or fires attended by the fire

   (19/118 (16%) v 18/108 (17%); 0.9; 0.4 to 1.8).
   Conclusions Giving out free smoke alarms in a deprived, multiethnic,
   urban community did not reduce injuries related to fire, mostly because

   IPV prevalence by type (physical, sexual, and psychological) and
   associated physical and mental health. consequences among women and men.
   Methods: The study analyzed data from the National Violence Against
   Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18 to 65. This
   random-digit-dial telephone survey included questions about violent
   victimization and health status indicators.
   Results: A total of 28.9% of 6790 women and 22.9% of 7122 men had
   experienced physical, sexual, or psychological IPV during their
   lifetime. Women were significantly more likely than men to experience
   physical or sexual IPV (relative risk [RR] =2.2, 95% confidence interval
   [CI] =2.1, 2.4) and abuse of power and control (RR=1.1, 95% CI=1.0,
   1.2), but less likely than men to report verbal abuse alone (RR=0.8, 95%
   CI=0.7, 0.9). For both men and women, physical IPV victimization was
   associated with increased risk of current poor health; depressive
   symptoms; substance use; and developing a chronic disease, chronic
   mental illness, and injury. In general, abuse of power and control was
   more strongly associated with these health outcomes than was verbal
   abuse. When physical and psychological IPV scores were both included in
   logistic regression models, higher psychological IPV scores were more
   strongly associated with these health outcomes than were physical IPV
   scores.
   Conclusions: Both physical and psychological IPV are associated with
   significant physical and mental health consequences for both male and

AB This report empirically examines multiple explanations for the high
   rates of psychiatric comorbidity seen with posttraumatic stress disorder
   (PTSD). One hundred sixty-two St. Louis area survivors of the 1993 Great
   Midwest Floods were interviewed a few months after the flood subsided
   using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) and its Disaster
   Supplement to assess psychiatric history relative to PTSD and five other
   psychiatric disorders. Thirty-five subjects (23%) met criteria for PTSD
   related to the flood. PTSD was frequently comorbid with other disorders.
   Seventeen subjects (10%) developed a new, non-PTSD psychiatric disorder
   after the flood. New non-PTSD disorders were rare in the absence of PTSD
   symptoms. Though prior psychiatric history was predictive of developing
   PTSD, no support was found that prior psychiatric history contributed to
   PTSD through social vulnerability. Thus, support was found for a model
   in which PTSD contributes to the development of other disorders
   following trauma, whereas no evidence was found to suggest that comorbid
   disorders develop independently of PTSD following trauma, or that
   comorbidity was due to symptom overlap among disorders. The lack of
   support for models in which psychosocial resources mediate the effect of
   psychiatric history on the development of PTSD indirectly confirms
   models of physiological vulnerability to PTSD development.

AB Many of our models of female behavior are the legacy of a 'two cultures'
   perspective on moral development and have investigated children's
   reasoning about moral situations rather than moral action itself. By
   examining the practices that make up the life world of a particular
   social group we can investigate how morality is lodged within the
   actions and stances that children take up in interaction with their
   peers. Forms of social exclusion in girls' groups call into question the
   notion that girls are fundamentally interested in cooperative
   interaction and a morality based on principles of relatedness, care, and
   equity. The argument is based on ethnographic study of a girls' peer
   group of mixed ethnicities and social classes in an elementary school in
   Southern California carried out over a three-year period. Copyright (C)

AB The emotional investment required to construct a caring doctor-patient
   relationship can be justified on humane grounds. Can it also be
   justified as a direct physiologic intervention? Two lines of evidence
   point in this direction. People in an empathic relationship exhibit a
   correlation of indicators of autonomic activity. This occurs between
   speakers and responsive listeners, members of a coherent group, and
   bonded pairs of higher social animals. Furthermore, the experience of
   feeling cared about in a relationship reduces the secretion of stress
   hormones and shifts the neuroendocrine system toward homeostasis.
   Because the social engagement of emotions is simultaneously the social
   engagement of the physiologic substrate of those emotions, the process
   has been labeled sociophysiology. This process can influence the health
   of both parties in the doctor-patient relationship, and may be relevant
   to third parties.

AB Objectives: To describe nutritional status in a population-based sample
   of children with moderate or severe cerebral palsy (CP) and to explore
   the relationships between nutritional status and health and functional
   outcomes.
   Study design: A population-based strategy was used to enroll children
   with CP at 6 geographic sites. Research assistants performed
   anthropometric assessment, determined severity of motor impairment, and
   interviewed care-givers with the Child Health Questionnaire and a
   questionnaire designed specifically for this study. Anthropometric
   measures were converted to Z scores and the relationship between health
   and nutritional status vas assessed using regression models,
   Results: Among the 235 participants, indicators of malnutrition were
   common. Poor nutritional status correlated with increased health care
   utilization (hospitalizations, doctor visits) and decreased
   participation in usual activities by the child and parent.
   Conclusions: Malnutrition is common in children with moderate or severe
   CP and associated with poorer health status and limitations in societal
   participation. Further studies are needed to determine the nature of
   these associations and how to manage nutrition in children with CP to
   optimize growth and health outcomes.

   an area of high global coral diversity. Coral reef health surrounding
   four island case studies in the Cook Islands and Fiji have been assessed
   in areas that have not been previously surveyed. This study compares
   four islands with barrier and fringing reefs that have different levels
   of economic development, population pressure, land-use practices, and
   marine management practices. This interdisciplinary research methodology
   includes both ecological and social data collection to further
   understanding of human environment interactions. In comparing the reefs
   with different socio-economic factors, this research shows that reefs
   with traditional systems of resources management are healthier,
   population pressure is not the main factor causing the demise of the
   reefs and agro-industry is the main industry causing the degradation of
   the reef in these four South Pacific Islands. In addition, researchers
   need to use a whole reef perspective to examine coral reef health. (C)

   this century. Although findings are preliminary, it appears that a
   significant number of maize varieties are no longer grown, as determined
   from comparisons with data collected earlier in this century. The
   authors believe that this decline is related to the recently concluded
   (1996) Guatemalan civil war and the associated poor socioeconomic
   conditions in which most rural Guatemalans exist. We present the case
   for the direct link between the maintenance of crop diversity and the
   political and economic atmosphere or security in peasant farming

AB Behavioral studies have suggested some intriguing differences across
   cultures in cognitive processes such as attention to context, the use of
   categorization, stereotypes about aging, and metarnemory judgments.
   Moreover, there is behavioral evidence to suggest that, with age,
   cultural differences in. cognition become less pronounced, likely due to
   decreased cognitive resources that may result in more similarity across
   cultures in cognition. The study of the neuroscience of aging, culture
   and cognition, although in its infancy, potentially provides insight
   into the contributions of experience, and neurobiology to cognitive
   function. We review initial findings of cross-cultural behavioral aging
   research in light of cognitive neuroscience of aging research and
   consider the methodological challenges and benefits of adding a

AB Background: Prevention program designers need information on sexual
   behaviors to plan and evaluate their activities. Questions on sexual
   behavior have been added to a number of nationally representative
   interview surveys.
   Goal. The goal was to measure the percentage of adult men who have
   engaged in male-to-male sex in the past year and since age 18 years and
   to observe and interpret changes over time in these measurements.
   Study Design: Data are from the General Social Survey, a nationally
   representative, household-based survey of adults conducted in 1988,
   1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000. Questions on sexual
   behavior were part of a self-administered questionnaire completed by
   respondents. Estimates of male-to-male sex in the past year and since
   age 18 years were computed.
   Results: Estimates of male-to-male sex in the past year were higher for
   surveys conducted beginning in 1996 (3.1%-3.7% compared with 1.7%-2.0%
   for earlier surveys), a difference that remains statistically
   significant when controlling for background factors associated with
   nonresponse. These estimates are also higher than observed from other
   similar surveys. The estimates are affected by high level of missing
   data and an unknown level of underreporting.
   Conclusion: Previous estimates of the size of this population subgroup
   based on survey research may be too low. Methods that increase survey
   respondents' sense of privacy and improve completeness of data
   collection are needed to improve quality of measurement of sensitive
   sexual behaviors.

AB Background: Only a limited number of studies have examined the effects
   of social networks on sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), although the
   findings of such studies would be helpful in designing more effective
   prevention strategies.
   Goal: This study attempts (1) to determine whether there are any social
   network effects on STD transmission after controlling for other risk
   factors and (2) to explore the possible mechanisms by which social
   networks exert their effects.
   Study Design: Logistic regressions examine the effects of friendship
   networks on STD transmission using data drawn from the Chicago Health
   and Social Life Survey (CHSLS). Additional logistic regressions probe
   the possible mechanisms (social control versus information and dyadic
   versus third party) that account for how the observed effects of
   networks might arise.
   Results and Conclusion: Among people who had fewer than 13 lifetime sex
   partners, those with no social friends were only 0.4 times as likely to
   be infected as those with one or more social friends. Among people who
   had 13 or more lifetime partners, those with many friends (5 or 6) but
   weak ties to them (talking less than once a day with them) were only 0.2
   times as likely to be infected as those with either fewer friends or
   stronger ties to their friends. Additional regressions suggest that
   network effects resting on dyadic control prevail among those with fewer
   than 13 lifetime sex partners. In contrast, network effects resting on
   information exchange among third parties prevail among those with 13 or
   more lifetime partners.

   theoretical understandings from the sociology of law to study sexual
   harassment complaints, We examine 267 sexual harassment complaints
   against corporate respondents or employing organizations handled by the
   Canadian Human Rights Commission between 1978-1993 to see what factors
   influence whether a complaint will be dismissed or settled. Our results
   show that legal, extra-legal, and case processing factors matter for the
   resolution of complaints. We also find that the development of sexual
   harassment as a legal concept is central to understanding the settlement
   of complaints over time, Finally, we conclude that research on civil and
   human rights processes should incorporate insights from research on
   criminal justice processes.

   (workers must be free to provide "authentic" emotional labor) and

   narrowly focuses on the service labor process and, thus, cannot fully

   first, specifying the structural changes in the American gambling

   labor system; and second, elucidating the functions for management of
   ceding to workers a degree of freedom: lower labor costs and customized

AB Economics should be built upon a sociological foundation, believed John
   R. Commons. While pursuing this conviction his chair in sociology was
   terminated in 1899. From then until 1904, exited from academia, he
   investigated afield for the U.S. industrial Commission and the U.S.
   Bureau of Labor and participated in the National Civic Federation,
   amassing first-hand knowledge of conflict resolution arranged by
   capitalists' "combinations" and by labor unions' bargaining with
   employers. These experiences inspired ideas concerning sociology and
   economics and beliefs that public policy should turn away from antitrust
   law and instead attempt to create counterbalancing power in the economic
   system. He published his ideas in various journals and magazines, and in
   nearly three dozen unsigned editorials in The Independent. This essay
   critically examines his thought during this period that he brought with
   him when he began the work based in Wisconsin that would carry him to
   fame.

AB Adolph Lowe and his mentor Franz Oppenheimer were founding members of
   the Editorial Board of the The American Journal of Economics and
   Sociology in 1941. Both this journal's name and its mission were
   inspired by Lowe's greatly underappreciated 1935 book, Economics and
   Sociology. There, Lowe issued his "plea for cooperation" and
   "constructive synthesis" in the social sciences. Lowe was committed to
   interdisciplinary teaching and research for the entirety of his long and
   interesting career. When celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
   journal, it is worthwhile to recall Lowe's enduring contributions. His
   expression "constructive synthesis" still remains part of the mission of

AB OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to examine the associations between
   demographics and reproductive characteristics on the occurrence of
   intimate partner violence (IPV) in young women.
   STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous questionnaire was completed by 727 women
   between 14 and 26 years old who were seen in the family planning clinics
   in southeast Texas between March 1997 and February 1998 and who reported
   a current spouse or partner. Subjects completed a standardized measure
   of violence perpetrated by a partner and provided information on
   demographics and reproductive characteristics. Separate logistic
   regression analyses were used to analyze factors associated with
   physical and verbal violence.
   RESULTS: Significant and positive associations with physical violence
   were found for race, employment, and parity (greater than or equal to
   1); risk of verbal abuse included employment, history of sexual abuse,
   and inconsistent condom and prescription contraceptive use. Protective
   factors for physical violence included education level. use of hormonal
   methods of contraception or condoms at last intercourse, and older age
   at first intercourse and at first childbirth; protection from verbal
   assault included dual contraceptive use, as well as barrier and hormonal
   contraception at last intercourse.
   CONCLUSION: Different patterns of risk emerge between physical and
   verbal assault among young women seen in a publicly funded family
   planning clinic. Minority parous women with limited education, early
   onset of sexual activity, and who report no contraception use at last
   intercourse appear to be at highest risk for reporting physical
   violence, whereas history of sexual victimization, early sexual
   activity, and younger age at first child birth elevates risk for verbal
   abuse.

AB There is currently no standard method for analyzing claims of
   environmental inequity. Neither is there a database of statistics on the
   extent of relationship between regional indicators of environmental
   quality, likely sources of pollution, and the demographic
   characteristics of affected populations. The resolution of environmental
   disputes is often hampered by inadequate communication between
   stakeholder groups about their perceptions and prioritization of the
   issues in dispute and by differential access to information about the
   issues by each stakeholder group. This paper describes a web-based tool,
   ICEP, that uses multi-layered GIS maps to establish a standard method
   for analyzing claims of environmental inequity and establish a database
   of correlation coefficients between environmental indicators, industry
   type by SIC code, and demographic characteristics of the population in
   proximity to noxious facilities. The maps are generated from stakeholder
   reports of environmental quality and are designed to be accessible via
   the Internet. This provides stakeholders with direct access to graphical
   displays of the perceptions of their co-stakeholders and provides all
   groups with links to relevant information sources about the issues in
   dispute. ICEP enhances existing community environmental websites like
   Scorecard and Envirofacts by providing displays of median household
   income as a measure of the distribution of benefits accrued within an

   predict a compounded annual growth in HIV of between 2.4% and 16.5%
   among low-income residents of Houston's inner city. These results
   suggest that forecasts are most sensitive to the nature of the
   sociological model used. A random mixing model showed about a threefold
   overestimate of 20-year projected seroprevalence compared with the
   empiric network data. Thus, the collection of additional social network
   data is probably the most important requirement for more accurate
   projections.

AB Three studies examined the effects of relative group size on the
   development of children's intergroup attitudes. The studies employed a
   novel group paradigm in which elementary school children attending a
   summer school program were assigned to larger (i.e., majority) or
   smaller (i.e., minority) novel groups in their classroom (denoted by
   colored tee-shirts). In each study, relative group size was situated
   within a different classroom context. Study I examined the effects of
   relative group size when teachers made functional use of the novel
   groups and were themselves members of the novel groups. Study 2 examined
   the effects of relative group size in the absence of functional use.
   Study 3 examined the effects of relative group size when the classroom
   environment contained implicit messages about group status. In each
   study, children's intergroup attitudes (e.g., trait ratings, group
   evaluations) were assessed following several weeks in the classroom. The
   effect of relative group size on in-group bias was complex, varying as a
   function of (a) the relative size and salience of groups, (b) the
   measure used to assess intergroup attitudes, (c) group status (higher or
   lower), and (d) children's age. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All

   and significant others (FSOs) of illicit drug users in order to gain
   insight into the impact of drug use upon those close to the user. Using
   the Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report (SAS-SR), we examined the social
   adjustment self-ratings (overall and in seven specific role areas) of 41
   female partners and 24 mothers of drug users. We compared these ratings
   to the ratings they reported for their drug-using partners or children,
   to each other, and to self-ratings drawn from community comparison
   samples. As expected, results showed that the female FSOs reported
   significantly better social adjustment than the drug users in most role
   areas. However, their social adjustment was compromised relative to the
   community samples. Partners of drug users reported poorer adjustment
   than parents of drug users overall and in the specific areas of marital
   and economic functioning. Further inquiry is needed to improve our
   understanding of the impact of drug use on the users' family members.

   substance abusers (57 men, 43 women) residing in Oxford Houses.
   Significant relationships between treatment and sociodemographic
   variables were observed on measures of abstinence social support and
   abstinence self-efficacy. Residence time in an Oxford House and 12-step
   participation were related to increased levels of abstinence social
   support and abstinence self-efficacy. However, residents who reported
   that their veteran status or prior incarceration experiences were issues
   they perceived as making identification with other recovering peers
   difficult reported lower levels of abstinence social support. In
   addition, residents who reported having at least one identification
   issue (57%) and residents who reported being a parent (73%) also
   reported lower levels of abstinence self-efficacy. Results of this study
   have important treatment implications for our understanding of social

   months having not "shared needles or works" (zero sharing risk) with
   those who reported recent equipment sharing. 187 AUDIT-positive (> 8),
   active IDUs were recruited between February 1998 and October 1999 from a
   needle exchange program in Providence, RI. The sample was 64% male and
   87% white, with a mean age of 36 years, and 32% of subjects reported
   zero sharing risk in the prior 6 months. Variables having significant (P
   < .05) associations with zero sharing risk included: older age, lower
   heroin use frequency, lower cocaine use, and increased frequency of
   needle exchange visits. As social support from friends increased, the
   likelihood of sharing decreased. Subjects with.. substance-using friends
   or partners were significantly more likely to share than those without
   such associations (OR = 9.4; P < .05). Social support and social network
   composition influenced sharing behaviors in active, out-of-treatment
   drug injectors. Interventions that mobilize social support may increase
   the possibility of zero sharing, an important public health goal. (C)

AB Objectives: To determine the association between stigma and shame about
   having a sexually transmitted disease and adolescents' past STD related
   care seeking; between stigma, shame, and perceptions about disclosure of
   sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse; and whether the association of
   stigma, shame, and care seeking was moderated by perceptions about
   disclosure.
   Methods: A household sample of 142 sexually active African-American
   youths, 13-19 years old, was questioned about STD related stigma (alpha
   = 0.89), STD related shame (alpha = 0.90), and perceptions about
   disclosure of sexual behaviours to a doctor or nurse (alpha = 0.81).
   Results: Among females, stigma was associated with increased
   anticipation of negative reactions to disclosure of sexual behaviours to
   a doctor or nurse (odds ratio (OR) = 0.3 19; 95% confidence interval (0)
   =0.12 to 0.85) while shame was not. Stigma was also independently
   associated with STD related care seeking in the past year (OR = 0.296;
   95% Cl = 0.09 to 0.94) while shame was not. There was no association
   between stigma and shame with perceptions about disclosure or post care
   seeking in males. Perceived outcomes of disclosing sexual behaviours did
   not moderate the association of stigma, shame, and post STD related care
   seeking.
   Conclusions: Stigma about STDs may influence how female adolescents
   perceive reactions to disclosure of their sexual behaviour to healthcare
   providers. It may also be an important factor in their decision seek to
   STD related care. Perceptions about disclosure of sexual behaviour to a
   doctor or nurse do not change the relation of stigma or shame to past
   STD related care seeking.

AB Background and rationale: The availability of urine based testing for
   Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) provides a
   unique opportunity to screen for these pathogens outside traditional
   clinical settings. The researchers investigated the feasibility of
   street based CT/GC screening in the context of an outreach programme
   among street/homeless adolescents in Denver.
   Objectives: To describe the integration of urine based CT/GC screening
   into an existing outreach programme among street/homeless youths and the
   yield of CT/GC testing in this setting.
   Methods: The Denver Department of Public Health (DPH) collaborated with
   outreach staff from Urban Peak (a community based organisation serving
   street/homeless youths in Denver) to offer urine based CT/GC testing to
   males and females in street settings. Tests were conducted on the street
   in areas where street/homeless youths congregate.
   Results: Urban Peak outreach staff were trained by DPH staff to conduct
   CT testing, process urine specimens, and provide test results to
   participating youths. DPH remained responsible for treatment of people
   with CT or GC infection as well as CT/GC case reporting. CT testing
   started in January 2000; GC testing was added in July 2000. Throughout
   April 2002 a total of 414 CT and 302 GC tests were conducted,
   respectively 11.6% and 2.7% of which were positive. Among first testers,
   13.0% were positive for CT and 3.7% for GC.
   Conclusions: CT/GC urine testing can be incorporated into existing
   outreach programmes without considerable extra effort. Overall CT rates
   were high and suggest the need for ongoing screening in this manner.
   Learning objective: To understand the role of CT/GC screening in the
   context of services provided to street/homeless youths in outreach
   settings.

AB The movement to assess student learning more comprehensively and more
   systematically began in earnest in the mid-1980s, and today is
   entrenched throughout higher education. However, commentary about
   assessment continues to be dominated by anecdotal reports and analyses
   of the strengths and weaknesses of particular programs. In order to
   obtain a broad-based picture of the development of assessment programs
   within sociology, 150 sociology departments were randomly selected and
   sent a self-administered questionnaire regarding the level of
   development of their departmental statement of purpose, departmental
   goals and objectives, the use of and experience with particular
   assessment mechanisms, and a summative judgment about the amount of work
   invested in assessment to date and the effects of that work.
   Almost two-thirds of the 70 responding departments have a departmental
   statement of purpose, but only about half of the departments have
   articulated specific learning objectives for students. Departments in
   public institutions are much more likely than departments in private
   institutions to have a statement of purpose and are somewhat more likely
   to have learning objectives. The most common assessment mechanisms being
   used are evaluations of specific assignments in required major courses,
   student surveys, alumni surveys, external reviewers, and evaluations of
   research projects. However, the most beneficial mechanisms are perceived
   to be reviews by external evaluators, work in a capstone course,
   in-house comprehensive exams, and in-house exams given early and late
   during a student's progression through the sociology major. Responding
   institutions reported that they have dedicated only a moderate effort to
   their student learning assessments and that the information received
   from those assessments has provided only moderate value. The
   implications of these assessment patterns found in sociology departments
   are discussed.

   sociologists regarding usage and impact of various outcomes assessment
   strategies. The data are broken down by school type-public and
   private-as well as by school size. Alumni and senior surveys and
   capstone products are used most often, while commercial exams, external
   review of student work, and oral exams are used least often. Few
   differences exist for school type and size. Impact on the curriculum and
   teaching is modest at best, with faculty members at private and smaller
   schools reporting greater impact. The implications of outcomes

AB Assessment within higher education is emerging as a highly contested
   issue. Arguments often center on assessment methodology, but the real
   source of disagreement is usually the underlying model of learning
   informing the methodology. This article describes a program for
   assessing student learning at a community college using critical
   theories of knowledge and the learning process. The faculty-designed
   assessment program includes an annotated bibliography assignment
   required in all introductory sociology sections. Faculty identified
   three types of literacy that students were expected to understand and
   practice as a result of the assignment: resource, social structural, and
   social scientific. Student learning in these areas was tracked across
   semesters using a survey, faculty observations, and sampled evaluations
   of completed bibliographies. All measures of learning indicate
   significant improvement in learning outcomes. The article records and
   discusses the program methodology within the framework of critical
   pedagogical theory.

AB In this paper, we present a strategy for the curricular design and
   assessment of one multidisciplinary program goal (understanding human
   behavior). We show how assessing a desired outcome requires attention to
   four specific areas: organizational context, the articulation of a
   learning model, program design and implementation, and outcomes
   assessment. Our findings, based on multiple indicators gathered over
   time and including both summative and formative measures, suggest that
   our graduates are generally achieving the outcomes established for them.
   We discuss how our results are used to inform decision-makers, and how
   inconsistencies discovered between the program's desired outcomes and
   students' actual achievements are managed within the framework of the
   program. Finally, we highlight several lessons learned as a result of
   this intensive process, linking its benefits to programs within
   sociology and other disciplines.

AB In this paper, we provide not a "best practices" model of curriculum
   assessment, but rather a "sociology of assessment" describing how we
   implemented a less-than-ideal design, under numerous constraints, with
   mixed results. We describe different assessment designs available for
   different types of curricula and report results from a
   quasi-experimental design comparing the level of critical sociological
   reasoning skills between students near the beginning and those finishing
   their studies. Those students finishing their program, organized as a
   loosely-spiraling curriculum with a capstone course, displayed stronger
   sociological reasoning skills even when controlling for each student's
   overall GPA. An analysis of course syllabi revealed an academic
   environment with variable standards inconsistently associated with
   course level. Several recommendations are offered for the "real world"
   implementation of sociology curriculum assessment. We think the
   multi-dimensional diversity within sociology presents the greatest
   obstacle to both designing and assessing sociology curricula.

   where social aggression was employed, whereas a dyadic structure was
   reported in conflicts involving-physical aggression. Girls tended to use
   social aggression against girls, whereas boys tended to use physical
   aggression against boys. Children and, adolescents who were central in
   peer social networks were more likely to. employ social aggression than
   those who were peripheral in the networks. Social aggression was not

   aggression, however, was not related to network but was linked to
   concurrent and future maladjustment (e.g., low academic competence and

   robust and detected gradients that were unobserved using measures of
   only education and wealth.

   behavior by individuals with severe mental illness.
   Methods. Participants (N = 802) were adults with psychotic or major mood
   disorders receiving inpatient or outpatient services in public mental
   health systems in 4 states.
   Results. The 1-year prevalence of serious assaultive behavior was 13%.
   Three variables-past violent victimization, violence in the surrounding
   environment, and substance abuse-showed a cumulative association with
   risk of violent behavior.
   Conclusions. Violence among individuals with severe mental illness is
   related to multiple variables with compounded effects over the life
   span. Interventions to reduce the risk of violence need to be targeted
   to specific subgroups with different clusters of problems related to
   violent behavior.

   dynamics, that is, why do countermovement activists select a particular
   organizational form in which to mobilize? Contrary to the standard
   assumption that selection is a simple function of challenging movement
   characteristics, this study suggests that selection is a matter of
   organizational correspondence: the extent to which a particular
   organizational model fits (a) the counterframed threat of the
   challenging movement, (b) the broader field of counterframed
   cultural-political threats, (c) the characteristics of those embedded in
   countermobilizing networks, and (d) openings in the political structure.
   This argument is illustrated with primary data and secondary sources
   that allow a historical reconstruction of independent capitalist militia
   formations in Cleveland, Ohio, at the dawn of the Gilded Age.

   characteristics and early family environment to the incidence of
   emotional and behavioral problems for low birth weight children. Data
   were collected from ethnically diverse families of 110 children who had
   a birth weight of less than 2500 grams. Results of stepwise regression
   analysis indicated that inadequate family income, troubles with family
   cohesion and adaptability, and an infant's insecure attachment to the
   mother accounted for 48% of the variance in the incidence of
   emotional-behavioral problems for children. None of the infants'
   characteristics, including birth weight, perinatal morbidity, cognitive
   ability and social competence, entered the regression model. Findings
   suggest that family environment is a key factor in the low birth weight
   child's risk for early mental health problems.

AB Do children come to the language-learning situation with a predetermined
   set of ideas about motion events that they want to communicate? If so,
   is the expression of these ideas modified by exposure to a language
   model within a particular cultural context? We explored these questions
   by comparing the gestures produced by Chinese and American deaf children
   who had not been exposed to a usable conventional language model with
   the speech of hearing children learning Mandarin or English. We found
   that, even in the absence of any conventional language model, deaf
   children conveyed the central elements of a motion event in their
   communications. More surprisingly, deaf children growing up in an
   American culture used their gestures to express motion events in
   precisely the same ways as deaf children growing up in a Chinese
   culture. In contrast, hearing children in the two cultures expressed
   motion events differently, in accordance with the languages they were
   learning. The American children obeyed the patterns of English and
   rarely omitted words for figures or agents. The Chinese children had
   more flexibility as Mandarin permits (but does not demand) deletion.
   Interestingly, the Chinese hearing children's descriptions of motion
   events resembled the deaf children's descriptions more closely than did
   the American hearing children's. The thoughts that deaf children convey
   in their gestures thus may serve as the starting point and perhaps a
   default for all children as they begin the process of grammaticization -
   thoughts that have not yet been filtered through a language model. (C)

AB Phytoremediation comprises a suite of promising cleanup technologies
   that use plants to remove or contain contaminants in soil and water. To
   be deployed, phytoremediation must be both technically and socially
   acceptable. This article explores the potential social acceptability of
   phytoremediation options proposed for use at specific sites and
   describes the conceptual framework that guides our exploration. The
   framework, called PACT (Public Acceptability of Controversial
   Technologies), consists of Dialog, Technology, Constituent, and Context
   dimensions. It posits that remediation. decision making is a social
   process informed by scientific and technical information, rather than a
   science- or technology-driven process. Although empirical data are
   scarce, applying PACT shows that a number of issues have the potential
   to impose conditions on the social acceptability of phytoremediation,
   and that some issues could lead to outright rejection. Further, because
   many of these issues concern values and goals, they cannot be resolved
   simply by providing better or more detailed technical information about
   phytoremediation. PACT is instructive in showing how even seemingly
   benign or desirable technologies such as phytoremediation have the
   potential to generate public controversy, delineating issues in ways
   that can help lead to their resolution.

   rated an individual who had either no relative in prison (control), or a
   cousin, brother or identical twin brother serving a prison sentence for
   burglary and armed robbery. The target person had no criminal
   background. Ratings of the target were lower in the three "relative in

   target decreased as kinship with the criminal increased, with the
   exception of the "identical twin" condition, which was approximately
   equal to ratings provided by participants in the control condition. The

AB The concept of positive deviance is marginalized in deviance literature
   by the focus on negative deviance and the absence of comprehensive
   conceptions of deviance. Current conceptions of positive deviance simply
   parallel definitions of negative deviance, namely normative and
   reactivist conceptions. Normative definitions posit positive deviance as
   behaviors and attributes that exceed normative expectations (e.g.,
   overconformity), such as overachieving students. Reactivist definitions
   view positive deviance as positively evaluated behaviors and attributes,
   such as athletic talent. We propose a new typology, which
   cross-classifies reactivist and normative definitions of deviance and
   more precisely distinguishes positive deviance, along with three other
   categories of deviance. Negative deviance, the traditional focus of the
   sociology of deviance, refers to behaviors that involve underconformity
   or nonconformity to norms and negative evaluations. Rate-busting refers
   to overconformity that is negatively evaluated. Deviance admiration
   refers to underconformity that is positively evaluated. Positive
   deviance refers to overconformity that is positively evaluated. This
   typology compensates for deficiencies in the separate conceptions of
   deviance by highlighting their contradictions (e.g., reactivists fail to
   consider rate-busting; normative theorists ignore deviance admiration).
   Current and historical examples in each category illustrate the utility
   of the new typology. The typology also accommodates the contextual
   nature of deviance, accentuates the role of power in defining deviance,
   and suggests the value of general theories of behavior as opposed to
   specific theories of "deviant behavior.".

AB Researchers have used the amount of leisure as a yardstick to proxy for
   quality of life, but so far they have paid scant attention to the
   quality of leisure. Here I use spousal leisure sharing to proxy for
   quality of leisure and, by implication, for quality of life. I draw on
   life-cycle perspective, price theory, and on human ecology to frame
   hypotheses about the determinants of spousal leisure sharing. Drawing on
   longitudinal information collected over 2 years from 32 households in
   two villages of Tawahka Amerindians, a horticultural and foraging
   society in the tropical rain forest of eastern Honduras, I estimate the
   simultaneous effects of age and age squared, cash income, and
   climatic/seasonal variables on the amount of time spouses spend together
   in leisure. Analysis using different random and fixed-effect
   multivariate logit models suggests that (1) life-cycle determinants play
   a strong role in spousal leisure sharing and (2) neither
   climate/seasonal variables nor income correlate with spousal leisure
   sharing. As is true among couples in the United States, among Tawahka
   couples a change in the income of either spouse has a small effect on
   the amount of leisure shared by spouses. I find no evidence that
   economic development erodes spousal leisure sharing or that couples
   exhibit fissure in their pursuit of a common goal of leisure sharing.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess whether the reduction
   in alcohol involvement typically associated with the transition to
   marriage differs for blacks, compared with whites. Method: Couples (n =
   248, white; n = 100, black) in which both partners were entering into
   their first marriage were assessed at the time of marriage, their first
   anniversary and their second anniversary. At each wave, husbands and
   wives were each given an identical questionnaire packet to complete
   independently at home and a postage-paid envelope for packet return. A
   broad range of constructs was assessed, including personality
   characteristics, relationship functioning, drinking behaviors and social
   network characteristics. Alcohol involvement measures included average
   daily volume of consumption, frequency of heavy drinking,
   alcohol-related problems and alcohol dependence. Results: Whites
   decreased their frequency of heavy drinking and alcohol dependence over
   the early marital years, whereas blacks remained relatively stable.
   Alcohol problem trajectories were similar for wives of both races. White
   men reported a decline in alcohol problems, whereas black men reported
   an increase in problems over the first 2 years of marriage. Racial
   differences in the alcohol involvement trajectories could not be
   attributable to racial differences in family formation or demographic
   factors. Conclusions: Findings suggest limited generalizability of
   previous research, indicating a reduction in alcohol involvement
   associated with the transition to marriage. Individuals who continue to
   drink heavily after this transition may be at an especially high risk
   for the subsequent development of serious alcohol and marital problems.

AB The sociobiology debate, in the final quarter of the twentieth century,
   featured many of the same issues disputed in the culture war in the
   humanities during this same time period. This is evident from a study of
   the writings of Edward O. Wilson, the best known of the sociobiologists,
   and from an examination of both the minutes of the meetings of the
   Sociobiology Study Group (SSG) and the writings of Stephen Jay Gould,
   the SSG's most prominent member. Many critics of sociobiology,
   frequently radical scientists who were attached to the lineage of the
   New Left, argued for the same multicultural values promoted by radical
   humanities professors in this period. Conversely, liberal
   sociobiologists defended the universalist values of the liberals in the
   humanities.
   Those scholars whose work was important before the cultural revolution
   in the 1960s were usually committed to a liberal universalism that
   emphasized the similarity between people. Younger scholars, who took
   faculty positions in the 1970s and after, were more likely to owe an
   allegiance to an ethnos-centered social vision that valued identity
   politics. The struggle between these two agendas, more intellectual than
   generational, was at the core of the culture wars both in the humanities
   and in the sciences. The sociobiology debate should be viewed in this
   light.

AB Cigarette smoking continues to be a major international health problem
   that affects adolescents. Most adult smokers report their first contact
   with smoking occurring before the age of 18 years. Research has
   established figures of initiation rates to be as low as 5% and as high
   as 31%, with the male samples consistently smoking at a slightly higher
   rate than the female samples. This was a prospective study using a
   questionnaire to sample 397 preprofessional dance students. Participants
   averages 16 years of age, and 90% were female. Nearly one third of the
   dancers who responded identified that they were occasional or regular
   smokers. Dancers who smoked even occasionally had a higher injury rate
   and lower overall health. They displayed a higher rate of comorbid
   behaviors associated with eating disorders, such as laxative,use, diet
   pill use and vomiting. Their rates of alcohol and illegal drug use were
   statistically higher than those of their non-smoking cohorts. Finally,
   nearly two thirds of the smokers reported that they trained with a
   teacher who was also a smoker. This study suggests that smoking has
   adverse effects on dancers, including increased injury rate, increased
   comorbid behaviors, and other health issues. In the world of dance, the
   teacher, choreographer, or director acts as a role model to students
   and, as such, has a particularly sensitive position in the choices the
   adolescent dancer makes. Effective prevention must go beyond informing
   dancers of health risks and must include the experience of a healthy
   role model.

AB The health goals of persons with serious mental illness are greatly
   improved when their personal power is advanced. Two targets of
   empowerment are discussed in this paper: treatment partnerships and
   community opportunities. Strategies that enhance treatment partnerships
   include provider endorsement of recovery rather than promoting an
   approach that suggests poor prognoses, treatment plans that are
   collaborative rather than unilateral decision making that is perceived
   as coercive, and treatment services provided in the person's community
   rather than geographically or psychological distant institutions.
   Approaches that focus on the person and treatment relationship are not
   sufficient however. Stigma and discrimination are significant barriers
   to the kind of community opportunities that are necessary to help people
   attain life goals. Communities that substitute stigmatizing attitudes
   and discriminatory behaviors with realistic views of mental illness are
   more likely to provide the kind of reasonable accommodations that some
   people need for work and independent living opportunities.

AB On the basis of the literature reviewed in Part I of this two-part
   series (Norris, Friedman, Watson, Byrne, Diaz, and Kaniasty, this
   volume), the authors recommend early intervention following disasters,
   especially when the disaster is associated with extreme and widespread
   damage to property, ongoing financial problems for the stricken
   community, violence that resulted from human intent, and a high
   prevalence of trauma in the form of injuries, threat to life, and loss
   of life. Meeting the mental health needs of children, women, and
   survivors in developing countries is particularly critical. The family
   context is central to understanding and meeting those needs. Because of
   the complexity of disasters and responses to them, inter-agency
   cooperation and coordination are extremely important elements of the
   mental health response. Altogether, the research demands that we think
   ecologically and design and test societal- and community-level
   interventions for the population at large and conserve scarce clinical
   resources for those most in need.

   itself into two blind alleys: rural-urban differences and attempts to
   define the rural-urban fringe. Although these conceptual problems
   eventually were exhausted, recent developments in California raise the
   possibility of a phoenix-like revival, although in new form. Three
   cases-the success of Napa Valley winemaking and the urban crowding that
   has accompanied it, the explosion of wine grape acreage in neighboring
   Sonoma County as demand for premium wine grapes, has increased
   dramatically, and an antibody-manufacturing goat "farm" in Santa Cruz
   Country-have spurred community controversies and are now generating
   debates over the definition of "agriculture," whether agriculture is
   rural, and "When is rural rural?"

AB Building on Helen MacGill Hughes's News and the Human Interest Story, we
   examine how human interest stories create collective attention,
   essential for the establishment of a public or demos, and the
   limitations of that process. Although human interest stories are not
   unique in this regard, such stories encourage shared identification,
   important for social cohesion and the maintenance of a public sphere.
   However, since the embedded story is presented as one that is not
   perceived as having lasting societal impact, it directs attention away
   from political action. We present four processes through which human
   interest stories operate. (1) media placement - how media structure and
   occupational interests produce stories that capture reader loyalty, (2)
   identification potential - the creation of scenes and personae that
   audiences feel they "know" and with which they can identify, (3)
   narrative arc - the process by which a story maintains reader interest,
   exposing conflicts and changes in likely outcomes, and (4) discursive
   space - the role of moral issues, provoking discussion and the
   possibility of active involvement of audiences. To explore these
   processes we analyze the case of Floyd Collins, the Kentucky caver
   trapped for seventeen days in 1925, and detail the associated media
   frenzy.

AB At century's end, a combination of telecommunications and computer
   technologies has resulted in the creation of the Internet, a global
   network of computers that has been growing at an exponential rate.
   Although the Internet/World Wide Web combination is widely hailed as a
   new, powerful engine of global social and economic change, there has
   been very little sociological theorizing and even less sociological
   research on the globalization of the Internet. Using classical
   macrosocial theories of development as a springboard, we hypothesize
   that the level of development, political openness/democracy, mass
   education, the presence of a sizeable tertiary/services sector, and
   interactions between some of these variables will drive the Internet's
   growth and spread around the globe. In our cross-national analysis of
   approximately 74 developed and developing countries, we find that
   Internet capacity is not in fact a simple linear function of economic
   and political development, but rather has been driven by complex
   interactions that could aptly be termed "post-industrialism." Uncovering
   some of these structural preconditions and determinants of Internet
   diffusion provides a first step toward providing a theoretical and
   empirical sociology of this "third technological revolution." (C) 2002

AB Postmodern social theory is often seen as entirely distinct from and
   even antagonistic to modem sociological thought. This article endeavors
   to challenge this framing by tracing the emergence of postmodernist
   social thought to a historical development in Western societies
   intimately tied to the conditions of emergence of modern sociology, that
   is, to the crisis of the loss of the sacred for the modern intellectual
   class. Postmodern theory is linked to two Purportedly opposed schools of
   modern social thought, Durkheimianism ami Bergsonianism by demonstrating
   the careful concern in each of these strands for a renovation of the
   sacred in the wake of the devastating effects Enlightenment and
   materialist thought had on traditional modes of the sacred for
   intellectuals (if not for larger segments of Western societies).
   Explicit textual evidence of this influence is also examined.

   cumulative association with risk of violent behavior. Conclusions:
   Violence among individuals with severe mental illness is related to
   multiple variables with compounded effects over the life span.
   Interventions to reduce the risk of violence need to be targeted to

AB On the basis of evolutionary game theory, it was hypothesized that
   humans have an evolved cognitive specialization for reasoning about
   social exchange, including a subroutine for detecting cheaters. This
   hypothesis led to a specific prediction: Although humans are known to be
   poor at detecting potential violations of conditional rules in general,
   they should nevertheless detect them easily when the rule involves
   social exchange and looking for violations corresponds to looking for
   cheaters. This prediction was subsequently confirmed by numerous tests.
   Evolutionary analyses further predict that: (i) in humans, complex
   adaptations will be distributed in a species-typical fashion; and (it)
   aspects of cognitive organization relevant to performing the evolved
   function of an adaptation should be more buffered against environmental
   and cultural variation than function-irrelevant aspects. Here we report
   experiments testing whether social exchange reasoning exhibits these
   properties of adaptations. Existing tests of conditional reasoning were
   adapted for nonliterate experimental subjects and were administered to
   Shiwiar hunter-horticulturalists of the Ecuadorian Amazon. As predicted,
   Shiwiar subjects were as highly proficient at cheater detection as
   subjects from developed nations. Indeed, the frequency of
   cheater-relevant choices among Shiwiar hunter-horticulturalists was
   indistinguishable from that of Harvard undergraduates. Also as
   predicted, cultural variation was confined to those aspects of reasoning
   that are irrelevant to social exchange algorithms functioning as an
   evolutionarily stable strategy. Finally, Shiwiar subjects displayed the
   same low performance on descriptive conditionals as subjects from
   developed nations. Taken together, these findings support the hypotheses
   that social exchange algorithms are species-typical and that their
   evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS)-relevant subroutines are
   developmentally buffered against cultural variation.

AB BACKGROUND, The modulation of immunologic activities relevant to cancer
   by behavioral factors, such as stress, depression, and social support,
   is well documented. However, associations of behavioral factors with
   cytokines involved in tumor angiogenesis have not been studied. Vascular
   endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key cytokine that is capable of
   stimulating tumor angiogenesis, and it has been associated with poorer
   survival in patients with ovarian carcinoma. VEGF is modulated by a
   variety of behaviorally sensitive factors, including sympathetic
   activation. This study examined relationships of social support and
   depressive symptoms with VEGF levels in preoperative patients with
   ovarian carcinoma.
   METHODS. Twenty-four women with ovarian carcinoma and 5 women with
   benign pelvic masses were recruited at the presurgical clinic visit,
   received psychosocial surveys, including the Functional Assessment of
   Cancer Therapy (Quality of Life) survey and the Profile of Mood States,
   and a blood draw. Serum VEGF levels were assessed by enzyme-linked
   immunosorbent assay. Analyses controlled for disease stage.
   RESULTS. Women with ovarian carcinoma who reported higher levels of
   social well being had lower levels of VFGF (P = 0.005). Greater support
   from friends and neighbors (P = 0.005) and less distance from friends (P
   = 0.04) were facets of social well being that were associated with lower
   VEGF levels. Individuals who reported greater helplessness (P = 0.03) or
   worthlessness (P = 0.08) had higher VEGF levels, but depression as a
   whole (P > 0.50) was not related to VEGF levels.
   CONCLUSIONS. Higher levels of social well being were correlated with
   lower VEGF levels in presurgical patients with ovarian carcinoma. These
   findings suggest a possible mechanism by which poor social support may
   be associated with disease progression. Further study of these relations
   may demonstrate novel pathways relating biobehavioral factors to tumor
   growth and disease progression. (C) 2002 American Cancer Society.

   Atherosclerosis Risk In Communities Study were used to investigate
   differences in the incidence of hypertension and in aging-related
   changes in blood pressure by neighborhood and individual socioeconomic
   factors over a 9-year follow-up. Disadvantage in multiple socioeconomic
   dimensions was associated with the greatest risk of developing
   hypertension (age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI: HR
   1.95, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.75 in whites and HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.13 in
   blacks). Aging-related increases in systolic blood pressure were
   inversely associated with socioeconomic position in whites (mean (SEM)
   5-year increase in systolic blood pressure 7 (0.7) mm Hg in the most
   disadvantaged category and 5.4 (0.4) mm Hg in the most advantaged
   category). In whites, low socioeconomic position was also associated
   with more rapid declines in diastolic blood pressure after 50 years of
   age. Socioeconomic differences in hypertension incidence and changes in
   systolic blood pressure were reduced after adjustment for baseline blood
   pressure. Conclusion-The change in blood pressure associated with aging
   varies by social groups within the United States.

AB There are large differences in health outcomes by socioeconomic status
   (SES) that cannot be explained fully by traditional arguments, such as
   access to care or poor health behaviors. We consider a different
   explanation-better self-management of disease by the more educated. We
   examine differences by education in treatment adherence among patients
   with two illnesses, diabetes and HIV, and then assess the subsequent
   impact of differential adherence on health status. One unique component
   of this research is that for diabetes we combine two different
   surveys-one cohort study and one randomized clinical trial-that are
   usually used exclusively by either biomedical or/and social scientists
   separately. For both illnesses, we find significant effects of adherence
   that are much stronger among patients with high SES. After controlling
   for other factors, more educated HIV+ patients are more likely to adhere
   to therapy, and this adherence made them experience improvements in
   their self-reported general health. Similarly, among diabetics, the less
   educated were much more likely to switch treatment, which led to
   worsening general health. In the randomized trial setting, intensive
   treatment regimens that compensated for poor adherence led to better
   improvements in glycemic control for the less educated. Among two
   distinct chronic illnesses, the ability to maintain a better health
   regimen is an important independent determinant of subsequent health
   outcomes. This finding is robust across clinical trial and
   population-based settings. Because this ability varies by schooling,
   self-maintenance is an important reason for the steep SES gradient in
   health outcomes.

   reported on their drug use, sexual behavior, and relationships within
   three types of social networks: hang out (i.e., friendship); drug use;
   and sexual networks. Most respondents were homeless and had experienced
   numerous life stressors. Females' social networks consisted more
   predominantly of drug injectors, and members more frequently appeared in
   multiple networks. Females reported needle sharing more frequently than
   males, but also reported more protective behaviors such as needle
   exchange use and carrying clean syringes. Young female IDUs may compound
   their risk by having sex and injecting with higher risk partners.
   However, their propensity to practice protective behaviors may provide

AB In spite of its common use as a tool for examining cooperation, the
   prisoner's dilemma game does not conform to the reality of many
   socio-ecological contexts. Situations in which people engage in joint
   activities and maintain agreement in their preferences for outcomes are
   called "coordination games" by game theorists and "mutualism" by
   biologists. Coordination games are common, but cooperative outcomes are
   not always as easy to achieve as is generally believed. Data are
   presented from the village of Lamalera, Indonesia, where the economy
   revolves around traditional subsistence sperm-whale hunting, that
   indicate a situation consistent with a coordination game. Return rates
   from cooperative whale hunting are greater per capita than those from
   solitary fishing. Coordination is maintained through complex norms that
   reduce transaction costs and provide assurances of satisfactory payoffs
   to participants. We speculate that cultural transmission of norms
   provides the "pregame" communication shown to be crucial for actors
   whose preference is to cooperate and achieve the synergistic payoffs
   common to coordination games such as big-game hunting.

AB Sports are part of the sociocultural fabric of all countries. Although
   different sports have their origins in different countries, many sports
   are now played worldwide. International sporting events bring athletes
   of many cultures together and provide the opportunity not only for
   athletic competition but also for sociocultural exchange and
   understanding among people. This article reviews five major sports with
   international appeal and participation: cricket, martial arts, field
   hockey, soccer, and tennis. For each sport, the major aspects of
   physiological and biomechanical demands, injuries, and prevention
   strategies are reviewed.

AB Objectives: To investigate the effect of community characteristics on
   HIV prevalence and incidence.
   Methods: Data from an open cohort study with demographic surveillance,
   epidemiological surveys, and qualitative research were used to examine
   the association between individual and community risk factors with HIV
   prevalence in 1994-5 and incidence between 1994-5 and 1996-7 among men
   (n=2271) and women (n=2752) living in a rural area in northwest
   Tanzania. Using subvillages as the unit of analysis, community factors
   investigated were level of social and economic activity, ratio of bar
   workers per male population aged 18-59, level of community mobility, and
   distance to the nearest town. Logistic and Cox regression models were
   estimated to assess community effects, controlling for multiple
   individual factors.
   Results: All four community factors had strong effects on HIV
   transmission. Men who lived in subvillages with the highest level of
   social and economic activity had an odds of being HIV positive that was
   about five times higher (OR=4.71, 95% CI=2.89 to 6.71) than those in
   places with low levels of activity; women in these subvillages had an
   odds that was twice as high (OR=1.92, 95% CI=1.27 to 2.92). After
   controlling for community effects, the effects of some individual
   factors on the risk of HIV-education, male circumcision, type of work,
   and number of household assets-changed notably. The association between
   HIV incidence and community factors was in the expected direction, but
   did not reach statistical significance (RR=2.07, p=0.10).
   Conclusions: Results suggest that community characteristics play an
   important part in the spread of HIV in rural Tanzania. Community effects
   need both to be considered in individual risk factor analyses and be
   given more attention in intervention programmes.

AB The association between state actions on the one hand and the production
   of scholarly knowledge about crime and crime control on the other is
   examined. This article provides an empirical examination on how the
   polity affects scholarly work. This can occur directly through research
   funding or indirectly as academic institutions change their internal
   organization in response to government-induced demand for training
   (e.g., by creating specialized criminology or criminal justice
   programs). Multivariate analyses of a sample of 697 scholarly journal
   articles published between 1951 and 1993 yield several findings. First,
   authors affiliated with criminology and criminal justice programs focus
   more strongly on topics and theories suggested by the state than authors
   from sociology programs (program effect). Second, articles based on
   funding provided by political agencies are more likely to relate to
   substantive and theoretical concerns articulated by the state (funding
   effect), but this effect is less pronounced than the program effect.
   Third, the relationship between a changing ideological climate and
   criminological knowledge is almost fully explained through funding and
   program effects. Finally, scholarly findings, that is conclusions drawn
   from data and their analysis regarding the validity of theories, are not
   associated with the institutional variables examined, indicating
   significant autonomy of the research process proper. Further research on
   causal links between state actions and scholarly production is
   warranted.

AB Cooperation based on reciprocal altruism has evolved in only a small
   number of species, yet it constitutes the core behavioral principle of
   human social life. The iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game has been used to
   model this form of cooperation. We used fMRI to scan 36 women as they
   played an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game with another woman to
   investigate the neurobiological basis of cooperative social behavior.
   Mutual cooperation was associated with consistent activation in brain
   areas that have been linked with reward processing: nucleus accumbens,
   the caudate nucleus, ventromedial frontal/orbitofrontal cortex, and
   rostral anterior cingulate cortex. We propose that activation of this
   neural network positively reinforces reciprocal altruism, thereby
   motivating subjects to resist the temptation to selfishly accept but not
   reciprocate favors.

AB BACKGROUND: Agriculturalists in less-developed countries (LDC) have
   lower progesterone levels than urban industrialized populations.
   However, it is unknown if urban LDC populations are also relatively
   lower. We tested whether urban Bolivia samples-poorer (Bol-p) and
   better-off (Bol-b)-have lower progesterone than a Chicago (USA) sample,
   and whether progesterone and rate of ovulation are lower in Bol-p than
   in Bol-b. METHODS: Serial salivary samples collected from Bolivians,
   screened according to strict exclusion criteria during two complete
   menstrual cycles, were radioimmunoassayed for progesterone;
   anthropometrics were collected at mid-follicular and mid-luteal phases.
   RESULTS: Progesterone levels are lower in the Bolivia samples, and
   higher in the Bol-b than Bol-p; ovulation rate is greater in Bol-b than
   Bol-p. For only ovulatory cycles, mean-follicular-P (pmol/l),
   mean-luteal-P (pmol/l), and mean-peak-P (pmol/l) are respectively 65,
   142 and 208 in Bol-p; 76, 167 and 232 in Bol-b; and 96, 240 and 330 in
   Chicago. Principal components representing body-size and progesterone
   level are positively correlated (r = 0.404, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS:
   Progesterone levels appear to be influenced by chronic and acute
   ecological conditions, evidenced by the association with body-size and
   the probability of ovulation respectively. These findings have
   implications for understanding cancer aetiology, developing
   population-appropriate hormonal contraceptives, and modelling the
   evolution and functioning of the reproductive system.

   sample of 455 Parisian mothers and fathers and principal components
   analysis was used to identify three reliable components of parenting
   beliefs that constituted cultural models: "Awakening and exposing child
   to diverse stimuli'', "Ensuring proper presentation of child'', and
   "Responding to and bonding with child''. Four sociodemographic variables
   predicted variation in mean importance scores associated with each of
   the three cultural models: parent's age, gender, education level, and
   religiosity, although the magnitudes of these associations were small.
   The discussion highlights the strengths and limitations of this method

AB Background: After markedly decreasing for 3 years, HIV/AIDS mortality
   declined only slightly in 1999.
   Methods: The authors conducted a case-control study in four Florida
   urban public health HIV clinics to evaluate modifiable factors
   associated with HIV/AIDS mortality in a non-research setting. Structured
   chart review was conducted for 120 case-patients who died in 1999 and
   for 240 randomly selected control-patients, Risk factors associated with
   death in univariate analysis were entered into three conceptually
   related, matched logistic regression models.
   Results: In the final multivariate model, homelessness (adjusted odds
   ratio [AOR], 9.98; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-42.5), Medicaid
   insurance (AOR, 3.10; 95% CI, 1.43-6.74), having a documented adherence
   problem (AOR, 3.50; 95% Cl, 1.64-7.47), injection drug use (AOR, 2.46;
   95% CI, 1.11-5.43), non-specific liver failure (AOR 76.9; 95% CI,
   6.79-870.9), interrupted highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
   secondary to side effects (AOR, 4.00; 95% Cl, 1.46-10.9), and not
   receiving HAART (AOR, 2,62: 95% Cl, 1.03-6.68) were independent
   predictors of mortality.
   Conclusions: In addition to medical and clinical indicators, several
   sociobehavioral-demographic factors remained important throughout the
   multivariate analysis. Improvement in care should include a focus on
   social circumstances of infected people. Special attention to the
   homeless, those with adherence problems, and those with liver disease is
   clearly indicated.

AB In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many governments and
   nongovernmental organizations have supported numerous HIV prevention
   intervention studies in both the United States and in other countries.
   To understand which intervention approaches have worked outside the
   United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended
   the scope of its HIV/AIDS Prevention Research Synthesis (PRS) project to
   include non-U.S.-based studies. We describe briefly the PRS experience
   with the challenges of acquiring and reviewing those studies, and some
   of the specialized efforts to find them. The ultimate goals of the PRS
   project related to international prevention research are to include all
   available reports of non-U.S.-based studies in the PRS database and to
   provide comprehensive reviews of those studies. The findings of the
   reviews would not only highlight common themes of effectiveness or
   research gaps in the international arena but could also be useful for
   improving prevention research and programs in the United States.

   interventions that measured prespecified behavioral and biologic
   outcomes and aimed to reduce risk for HIV infection. Studies identified
   through June 1998 by the HIV/AlDS Prevention Research Synthesis project
   were grouped into 4 risk behavior areas: drug-related (k [number of
   studies] = 48), heterosexual youth (k = 24), heterosexual adult (k =
   17), and same-sex (k = 10). We compared the studies in the 4 areas by
   variables key to the development, evaluation, and transfer of
   interventions. Participants comprised injection drug users (43% of
   studies), drug users out of treatment (29%), African Americans (18%),
   clinic patients (18%), youth in schools (10%), and drug users in
   treatment (10%). Most studies were randomized (85%). provided another
   intervention to the control or comparison groups (71%), and evaluated
   behavioral interventions (92%). On average, interventions were conducted
   in 5 sessions (total, 8 hours) during 3 months. The theoretical basis of
   the intervention was not noted in 57% of the reports. At least one
   variable from each of the 3 Outcome classifications was measured in 8%
   of the studies: behavioral, biologic, and psychosocial. Distinct
   profiles exist for the 4 risk areas. Addressing gaps in research and
   reporting would be helpful for analytical and program activities. This
   sizable portfolio of evaluated interventions contributes to
   effectiveness reviews and to considerations of transfer to program
   practice.

   National Sample Survey on Fertility and Contraception conducted in 1988
   by the State Family Planning Commission of China, the hazard of having a
   second birth among 62+ thousand married women who have had a first
   birth, and the hazard of having a third birth among 43+ thousand married
   women who have had two births was examined. These two hazards (i.e. the
   hazard of moving from the first to the second birth, and the hazard of
   moving from the second to the third birth) were analysed by estimating
   Cox proportional hazard models. The major covariate in the first
   analysis is whether or not the first-born was a daughter. In the second
   analysis the main covariate is whether both of the first two children
   were girls. In both models seven covariates known to have independent
   effects on the transition to a second (or third) birth are controlled
   for, namely, whether the woman is a Han, whether she is a farmer, her
   age at the birth of the first (or second) child, whether she had her
   first (or second) birth prior to the initiation in 1979 of the one-child
   policy, and three dummy variables reflecting her level of education. The
   results show the important influence of son preference on the hazard of
   having another birth.

AB This study explores the association between type of female circumcision
   and infertility and fertility in Sudan using the 1989-90 Demographic and
   Health Survey. It is hypothesized that women with either Pharaonic or
   Intermediate circumcision would have higher infertility and lower
   fertility compared with women with Surma circumcision, and that
   uncircumcised women would have the lowest infertility and highest
   fertility of the three groups. This hypothesis, a widely held
   assumption, proved to be largely incorrect. Though women with Pharaonic
   or Intermediate circumcision did have a higher prevalence of primary
   infertility than uncircumcised women, women with Surma circumcision had
   even lower rates of primary infertility compared with uncircumcised
   women. This pattern prevailed in multivariate models controlling for
   confounding variables, where women with Pharaonic or Intermediate
   circumcision had significantly higher primary infertility. Moreover,
   though women with Pharaonic or Intermediate circumcision also had the
   highest prevalence of secondary infertility, once confounding covariates
   were controlled in multivariate models, there was no significant
   difference among the three groups of women. With respect to fertility,
   the total fertility rate was 7(.)6 for women with Pharaonic or
   Intermediate circumcision, 8(.)1 for women with Sunna circumcision and
   8(.)3 for uncircumcised women. Differences in fertility were found to be
   insignificant when covariates were controlled. The multivariate models
   were estimated using logistic regression. In conclusion, Pharaonic or
   Intermediate circumcision may be associated with higher primary
   infertility while there was no evidence suggesting that either secondary
   infertility or fertility was associated with a woman's circumcision
   status.

AB Objective: To assess claims that genes are a major determinant of social
   class.
   Design: Using genetic epidemiological principles, five claims on the
   role of genes in determining. social c lass are examined: (1) traits
   that run in families are usually inherited; (2) complex traits can be
   explained by alleles at a single gene locus; (3) complex traits are
   transmitted intact from one generation to the next; (4) natural
   selection explains social advantage. (5) Heritability estimates provide
   a valid estimate of the importance of genes in explaining complex human
   traits or behaviour.
   Results: (1) Traits that run in families can result from environmental
   exposures that differ by social class. (2) The protein encoded by any
   single gene has too narrow a range of biological activity to explain
   traits as complex as social status. (3) Because alleles at different
   gene loci are transmitted independently, genetic inheritance cannot
   explain why offspring display the same complex traits as their parents.
   (4) The propagation of mutations that might result in a selective
   advantage takes much longer than the time for which any social class has
   achieved or maintained dominance. (5) Heritability measures are accurate
   only when environment is maintained constant. This is impossible in
   evaluating human traits.
   Conclusions: The roots of social class differences do not lie in our
   genes. Consequently, genetics cannot be used as a justification for
   maintaining a ruling class, limiting procreation among the poor, or
   minimising social support programmes.

AB Objectives: To determine the psychosocial correlates of recurrent
   pediatric pain and its relationship to health service use and medical
   presentations for "unexplained" symptoms in primary care.
   Study design: Children 4 to 15 years of age who complained frequently of
   aches and pains to parents were compared with those with infrequent or
   no pain on measures of demographics, psychopathology, school attendance
   and performance, perceived health, and service use. Univariate analysis
   was followed by logistic regression.
   Results: Children who complained often of aches and pains used more
   health services, had more psychosocial problems, missed more school, and
   did worse academically. After controlling for health service use and
   demographics, recurrent pain was significantly associated with negative
   parental perceptions of child health and the presence of internalizing
   psychiatric symptoms. Higher levels of ambulatory health service use
   were associated with negative perceptions of child health, recurrent
   pain, visits for "unexplained" symptoms, and internalizing psychiatric
   symptoms.
   Conclusions: Pediatric recurrent pain challenges traditional service
   delivery models characterized by segregated systems of care for physical
   and mental disorders. Longitudinal and psychobiological studies of the
   relationship between recurrent pain, internalizing psychopathology, and
   health beliefs are warranted to direct future treatment efforts. (J

AB Ideal free distribution theory predicts that foragers will form groups
   proportional in number to the resources available in alternative
   resource sites or patches, a phenomenon termed habitat matching. Three
   experiments tested this prediction with college students in
   discrete-trial simulations and a free-operant simulation. Sensitivity to
   differences in programmed reinforcement rates was quantified by using
   the sensitivity parameter of the generalized matching law (s). The first
   experiment, replicating prior published experiments, produced a greater
   degree of undermatching for the initial choice (s = 0.59) compared to
   final choices (s = 0.86). The second experiment, which extended prior
   findings by allowing only one choice per trial, produced comparable
   undermatching (s = 0.82). The third experiment used free-operant
   procedures more typical of laboratory studies of habitat matching with
   other species and produced the most undermatching (s = 0.71). The
   results of these experiments replicated previous results with human
   groups, supported predictions of the ideal free distribution, and
   suggested that undermatching represents a systematic deviation from the
   ideal free distribution. These results are consistent with a melioration
   account of individual behavior as the basis for group choice.

   sociological accomplishments of this group of scholars are relatively
   absent from the existing sociological literature. Data collected for
   this investigation indicate that the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory has
   been rendered sociologically invisible because of race prejudice, the
   perception that the school's findings were ungeneralizable, that their
   methods of research unsophisticated and of low quality, and that they
   omitted theory from their analyses. The findings of this investigation
   indicate that the Atlanta Sociological Laboratory utilized a
   sophisticated methodology to produce generalizable findings that
   included theory despite the race prejudice that existed during that
   period in American history.

   management to teaching methods, considering ways that teachers can
   structure the course to best manage and utilize emotions in the
   classroom. A collection of emotion management strategies and exercises,
   which can be employed selectively, is also included. We believe that by

AB High school sociology has historically been and largely continues to be
   neglected by the discipline's professional organizations and by academic
   sociologists. The few past reforms of high school sociology-such as the
   SRSS project during the 1960s and early 1970s-were aimed at course
   content and instructional materials, they have failed. I argue that a
   new approach is necessary, one that focuses on improving high school
   sociology teacher training. Professional associations and academic
   departments must both contribute to efforts to improve the formal
   sociological education and professionalization of high school teachers
   of the discipline. Improving teacher training is the best way to enhance
   the quality of secondary sociology courses, and may also help rectify
   the discipline's distorted public image as high school students gain a
   more accurate appreciation and understanding of fundamental sociological
   insights from their better trained teachers.

AB A crucial task of introductory sociology courses is to teach students
   the meaning and value of the sociological imagination. While this task
   is daunting under typical circumstances, it is more difficult when
   instructors are committed to raising students' critical awareness of
   social conventions that maintain systems of racial oppression. In this
   paper, we discuss our experiences with teaching this aspect of the
   sociological imagination to a group of ethnically and economically
   privileged students. Based upon our experiences and existing research,
   we propose that a rise in students' political conservatism and their
   adoption of color-blind racism may explain our students' recalcitrance
   and the increasing reports of resistance from those who teach race and
   inequality courses. We provide details of an assignment that eased
   students' recalcitrance by enabling them to demonstrate to themselves
   the fallacies of scientific racism. The assignment, a critical
   assessment of Rushton's scathing review of "Gould's Mismeasure of Man, "
   required students to exercise their sociological imagination to
   successfully unmask the agendas, fallacies, and consequences of
   "scientific racism." Quotes from the students' assignments and the
   course evaluations show that the assignment conveys to recalcitrant
   students the utility of sociological analysis.

AB Afghanistan is in the midst of a profound humanitarian crisis resulting

   massive population migration. The economy, government, and health care
   system are in shambles. Currently, as many as 5 million Afghans are in
   camps either as refugees in neighboring countries or as internally
   displaced persons within Afghanistan. Much of the rest of the population
   is in dire need of basic essentials such as food, water, shelter, and
   basic medical care. Those attempting to carry out humanitarian relief
   face many daunting challenges, such as reaching remote locations, coping
   with a dangerous security situation, and working with limited resources.
   However, there are opportunities in the short run to save many lives and
   substantially improve the plight of Afghans by carrying out appropriate
   and effective emergency relief programs. Over the long term, effective
   medical and public health relief efforts will be an essential part of
   rehabilitating and rebuilding this devastated country.

AB HIV transmission risk behaviours are related to perceived infectiousness
   and HIV-positive men who have undetectable blood viral loads may
   practise less protective behaviours. The current study extends previous
   research by reporting the association between perceived HIV transmission
   risks, risk behaviours and viral load in semen. Results showed
   significant associations between perceived risks for transmitting HIV,
   unprotected intercourse and viral load in semen. Further analyses showed
   that men with greater concentrations of HIV in their semen were
   practising higher rates of transmission risk behaviours while perceiving
   less risk for potentially transmitting HIV. We conclude that behavioural
   interventions are needed for HIV-positive men to inform them that HIV
   infectiousness cannot be inferred from peripheral blood viral loads and
   to support maintenance of HIV risk reduction behaviours.

   semi-structured interviews and network analysis to collect data from 106
   peer educators and 526 of their contacts. These evaluation activities
   were conducted at three sites in Ghana during April 1998, in peri-urban
   and rural locations, and in in-school and out-of-school targeted
   settings. It was found that in their peer counselling and peer promotion
   activities peer educators tend to reach people who are like themselves
   (53% within 2 years of age, 59% same sex, 70% same ethnicity, and 65%
   same school status) however, this trend is not uniform among all youth
   and varies by demographic characteristics and their cultural
   environment. By examining the social networks of peer educators, it is
   possible to gain a better understanding of the process of peer education
   counselling in the context in which it occurs. The study also shows that
   controlling for other factors, contacts of peer educators who are highly
   similar regarding age, sex, ethnicity, and school status, are 1.74 times
   more likely (95% CI: 1.18, 2.56) to have done something to protect
   themselves from AIDS in the past three months. The results have

   participants at public venues. Data were collected via anonymous,
   structured interviews from December 1999 to February 2001. Lifetime
   testing rates were high (76%), but only 45% had been tested in the last
   12 months. Results indicate that men at highest risk-those who were MSM,
   had more partners and had STDs-were more likely to have been tested, and
   to have been tested recently, than men with lower risk. Being MSM and
   having been previously tested predicted future testing intentions.
   Inconsistent condom users with more than five partners were less likely
   to intend to be tested than men with more than five partners who used
   condoms consistently. Studying men who have successfully routinized HIV
   prevention practices (including testing) will assist in the development
   of interventions for those who remain at risk.

   fieldwork and research in Brazil. I used participant observation and
   informal interviewing both with children living with HIV/AIDS and
   uninfected street children to obtain qualitative data. Brazil is known
   as a country leader in social responses towards the AIDS epidemic. Not
   only has access to antiretroviral medications been assured, but also a
   series of help networks guarantee that the human rights of HIV-infected
   people be respected. Children and adolescents benefit equally from these
   social gains. As such, many children born to HIV-positive women have
   reached adolescence and have 'normal' lives. This article explores the
   life experiences of children and adolescents infected by HIV and
   compares them to the life experiences of street children. Even though
   the AIDS epidemic is linked to death, infected children and adolescents
   dream about their lives and futures. Contradictorily, street children,
   who have not acquired the virus and are considered healthy from a
   biological stand point, have no prospective plans and answer without
   hope to questions about the future.

   suggest that the way people perceive sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy may

AB Over the past century, genetics has experienced a tension between the
   view that racial and ethnic categories are biologically meaningful and
   the view that these social classifications have little or no biological
   significance. That tension continues to inform genomics and is evident
   in the assembly of biological collections and sequence databases that
   seek to approximate the genetic variation found in human populations.
   Although social identities can be useful and convenient proxies of some
   biological features, for example, in ensuring that genomic resources
   capture a range of genetic variants found in most human populations, the
   ways in which geneticists Conceptualize the relationship between racial
   and ethnic identities and genetic variation can be problematic.
   Inclusion of racial and ethnic identifiers in genomic resources can
   create risks for all members of those identified Populations and
   influence lay perceptions of the nature of racial and ethnic groups.
   Thus, the burden of showing the Scientific utility Of racial and ethic
   identities in the construction and analysis of genomic resources falls
   oil researchers. This requires that genetic researchers pay as Much
   attention to the social constitution of human populations as presently
   is paid to their genetic composition.

AB Background Previous studies analysing Karachi ambulance data from 1993
   to 1995 identified neighbourhoods in Karachi disproportionately affected
   by homicide. As a step toward developing intervention programmes to curb
   violence, we conducted a study to identify risk factors for becoming a
   homicide victim in a high violence area of Karachi.
   Methods We interviewed families of 35 cases, individuals intentionally
   killed through acts of violence between January 1994 and January 1997,
   and 85 community-based controls frequency matched by sex, from Orangi, a
   high violence area of Karachi.
   Results Most of our cases and controls were male (97% and 92%,
   respectively) and had similar socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds. All
   the victims were killed by firearms; 4 (11%) had been tortured prior to
   death. Most of the victims were killed in the streets (n = 25, 71%). Of
   these, 7 (36%) had been killed by law-enforcement officers, while 6
   (24%) died from indiscriminate firing. People who were killed were 34
   times more likely to have attended all political processions (29% versus
   1%, odds ratio [OR] = 34; 95% CI: 4-749, P < 0.001), 19 times more
   likely to have attended political meetings (31% versus 2%, OR = 19; 95%
   CI: 4-136, P < 0.001), and 17 times more likely to have held an
   important position in a political party (29% versus 2%, OR = 17; 95% CI:
   3-120, P < 0.001) than controls.
   Conclusions Homicide in Orangi was political. Efforts to improve trust
   between ethnic groups and to build legitimacy for non-violent forms of
   conflict resolution are important steps to limit future violence.

AB Background This study examined the extent to which areal socio-economic
   gradients in all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among
   US men and women aged 25-64 years increased between 1969 and 1998.
   Methods Using factor analysis 17 census tract variables were used to
   develop an areal index of socio-economic status that was used to
   stratify all US counties into five socio-economic categories. By linking
   the index to county-level mortality data from 1969 to 1998, we
   calculated annual age-adjusted mortality rates for each area
   socio-economic group. Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate
   areal socio-economic gradients in mortality over time.
   Results Areal socio-economic gradients in all-cause and cardiovascular
   mortality have increased substantially over the past three decades.
   Compared to men in the highest area socio-economic group, rates of
   all-cause and CVD mortality among men in the lowest area socio-economic
   group were 42% and 30% greater in 1969-1970 and 73% and 79% greater in
   1997-1998, respectively. The gradients in mortality among women were
   steeper for CVD than for all causes. Compared to women in the highest
   area socio-economic group, rates of all-cause and CVD mortality among
   women in the lowest area socio-economic group were 29% and 49% greater
   in 1969-1970 and 53% and 94% greater in 1997-1998, respectively.
   Conclusions Although US all-cause and cardiovascular mortality declined
   for all area socio-economic groups during 1969-1998, the gradient
   increased because of significantly larger mortality declines in the
   higher socio-economic groups. Increasing areal inequalities in mortality
   shown here may be related to increasing temporal differences in the
   material and social living conditions between areas.

AB This article draws on the preceding seven histories of national
   associations to examine commonalities and differences among them. The
   histories portray different strategies of organizing associations and
   adapting themselves to state control, societal conditions and members'
   interests. A disciplinary model was the most prevalent organizing
   strategy, but its viability ebbed and flowed with political oppression,
   the state of sociology as a discipline and internal associational
   conditions such as disciplinary composition and dissension. Two of the
   seven associations have survived continuously since being founded, while
   the other five have perished and been reborn from one to five times.
   Political oppression and internal associational dissension are what are
   mainly responsible for these associational deaths; for the state of
   sociology and its place in the academy for rebirths; and for the
   organizational cooptation of member interests for associational survival
   and growth.

AB There is no definitive answer to the question of how long one must wait,
   after a person's heart stops beating, before concluding that the person
   meets the heart-lung criteria for death. This question has assumed new
   importance with attempts to remove transplantable organs from people
   declared dead using those criteria. An examination of the legal
   definition of death suggests that organs are indeed being procured from
   some of these people prior to their being legally dead. Moreover, the
   fact that the donors have consented to these procedures does not
   eliminate reason for concern regarding this state of affairs, since
   patient autonomy must at times be overridden in pursuance of important

AB In the present study, 340 college subjects evaluated the job performance

   that workers with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are more negatively
   perceived than other workers (paraplegic, healthy) despite equivalence
   in age, sex, education, job history, and time off from work for medical
   reasons. Results indicated that workers with RA are perceived as having
   significantly poorer interpersonal job skills and are deserving of
   significantly poorer scores for overall job performance, although no
   differences were obtained in the ratings of their job commitment or job
   expertise. The suggestion is made that an unfavorable social reaction to
   RA patients in the workplace is one factor that impairs the development
   of social support for these patients at work and contributes to their
   inflated disability rate.

   longitudinal influence of exposure to their deviant peers. Using a
   national data set on alcohol use (N = 188), a growth mixture model
   capturing growth trajectories in adolescent alcohol use from ages 14 to
   18 years was first examined. This was followed by an investigation of
   age-varying influences of peers on adolescent alcohol use and the
   co-development of peer influence and adolescent alcohol use. Results of
   growth mixture modeling of repeated-measures data on adolescent alcohol
   use showed two distinct latent classes of developmental trajectory with
   significant differences in levels of use. Analyses of exposure to
   deviant peer and adolescent alcohol use variables indicated differential
   effects of peers across trajectory classes. Stronger prospective
   influences for the trajectory group having a low initial status of use
   were found. Findings from this study suggest the need to consider
   heterogeneity in the study of peer influence on alcohol use during
   adolescence to facilitate more refined targeting of
   prevention/intervention programs.

AB Drawing on Durkheim's theory of social integration, this discussion
   reports on findings from a pooled time-series analysis of states'
   spending for public welfare and their suicide rates, controlling for
   states' divorce rates, population change rates, population density,
   unemployment rates, sex ratio, and racial composition. The analysis
   spans a 35-year period, 1960 to 1995, at six different data points:
   1960, 1970, 1980, 1985, 1990, and 1995. The major hypothesis was that
   states' suicide rates would increase with decreases in per capita
   spending for public welfare, controlling for the variables listed above
   in three different models and using OLS to analyze the data. In the
   basic model, states' spending for public welfare showed no relationship
   to states' suicide rates; in the second model that controlled for data
   year and in the third model that controlled for both data year and
   state, its relationship was significant, but in a negative direction.
   Suicide rates increased in states that reduced their per capita
   expenditures for public welfare during the observational period. Of all
   the variables, the influence of divorce on suicide was the most
   persistent and pronounced, followed by the percentage of whites in
   states' populations. Whether the findings reflect an increase in the
   unendurable psychological pain associated with suicide, or the weakening
   of ties that bind individuals to each other and to the larger society
   (as measured by states' divorce rates and per capita expenditures for
   public welfare), or the vulnerabilities associated with race, states can
   help counter suicide trends and such negative influences as divorce as
   evidenced by states that spend more for public welfare and have lower
   suicide rates. Given that clinicians work with people experiencing the
   unendurable psychological pain associated with suicide, the findings
   from these analyses have relevance for their practice.

PD SUM 2002

AB Academic interest in U.S. Army recruiting was sparked by the
   implementation of an all-volunteer force in 1974. Across the decades
   since, Moskos's (1977) Institution/Occupation (I/O) thesis has dominated
   the literature on military sociology regarding recruiting. Moskos held
   that the U.S. Army was becoming less an institution and more of an
   occupation. He warned that it was dangerous to offer monetary incentives
   for enlistment since, he believed, this threatened to transform a
   patriotic duty into a mere job. The research reported here examines
   recruiting theme trends through an analysis of recruitment materials
   (posters, ads, and the like) from 1954 to 1990. Findings indicate that
   military changes (including the emergence of a unique elite military
   culture) influenced recruitment. Moreover, the Army attempted to
   interest potential recruits using themes other than economic incentives
   to a greater extent than it used economic lures.

AB The past 30 years have seen a focus on substance abuse research in
   association with the creation of federal agencies specifically mandated
   to guide that effort. While research has been well supported and largely
   productive, there has been increasing concern with the slow pace of
   adoption of the findings from that research. The history of those
   efforts suggests a long-standing concern with knowledge development, and
   a continuing reliance on print media to achieve knowledge application.
   Nonetheless, evidence from other human service fields, and increasingly
   from the Substance abuse field, indicates interpersonal strategies are
   dramatically more effective in achieving the individual and
   organizational behavior change needed to achieve technology transfer.
   Argument is made that the federal government remains the best, if not
   the only resource for promoting technology transfer. A paradigm is
   described to further federal efforts in this area, and Structural
   elements suggested for the achievement of technology transfer goals. (C)

   1973? Second, aside from age, are the homeless veterans of the era of
   the All-Volunteer Force different from homeless veterans who served
   during the era of the military draft? The results replicate many
   findings from research in the 1980s showing that even homeless veterans
   with psychiatric disorders tend to have more personal resources compared
   to homeless men who did not serve in the Armed Forces. Although veterans
   from the era of the All-Volunteer Force are different from veterans from
   the era of the draft, the introduction of the All-Volunteer Force per se
   does not appear to have changed the composition of the adult male
   homeless population.

TI Rationality, choice and the religious economy: The problem of belief
SO REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
VL 43

BP 311
EP 325
PD JUN 2002
PY 2002
AB The concept of the religious economy has been one of the most useful
   contributions Of rational choice theories to the sociology of religion.
   However, this study argues that religious belief presents a problem for
   rational choice theories, since it is difficult to see how one can
   freely choose what one believes to be trite in the sense that one can
   freely choose what consumer products one wishes to pill-chase. After
   examining the problem, the study suggests that it may be addressed by
   thinking of belief as a socially, collaboratively produced good. Given
   demand for a particular belief potential religious consumers choose to
   involve themselves with those who are collectively producing it through
   interactions of faith. The involvement turns potential religious
   consumers into actual consumers by enabling them to participate in
   networks that establish beliefs as trite.

PY 2002
AB This paper explores how a multiclass sample of white rural women in an
   economically depressed, overwhelmingly nonfarm community explain both
   their own families' economic circumstances and those of the most
   disadvantaged families in their community. All women in the sample-even
   those with a history of economic instability and welfare
   receipt-articulate an ethic of family self-sufficiency. They uniformly
   believe that anyone who can work should work, although they vary in
   their definition of who "can work." In general, the lower the social
   class, the greater the understanding of the social processes that
   precipitate and perpetuate poverty. Both working-class and poor women
   clearly recognize the limitations of the local market for labor. Sample
   women are ambivalent about welfare receipt and welfare reform. Although
   they believe that families should be self-supporting, many recognize the
   necessity of welfare for the survival of some families in the community.

   assumption here is that Latinas/os, like other ethnic groups, have made
   their mark shaping religious practices. The article builds on notions
   that gender, ethnic, and race foci in our research expand our knowledge
   of the nuances in the mosaic of religious practice. The sociology of
   religion would be left behind if it did not challenge the restrictive
   ways the field has looked at religious practice and expression. What
   methodological approaches and what questions we ask are important to
   enriching research on religion in the United States and elsewhere. Here
   the author suggests that both questionnaire and focus group interviewing
   are particularly useful in studying a multiethnic and multilingual
   community, because the two-pronged approach brings out the complexity of
   religious beliefs and practice.

AB Reputational change can occur both posthumously and within a person's
   lifetime. Championed by reputational entrepreneurs, reputations emerge
   from competitive fields of interpretive possibilities. The purification
   of Pete Seeger's image, from vilified Communist to national hero, lets
   us study both reputational change and the relationship between art and
   politics. An objectivist model suggests that reputations simply reflect
   truth. An ideological model claims that Seeger's redemption is shaped by
   a biased media. Neither sufficiently explains the competitive nature of
   reputational politics. Our constructionist model takes into account both
   the role of reputational entrepreneurs and the structural constraints
   they face. We chart Seeger's reputation through four historical periods:
   recognition among his peers on the Left (1940s), ruin in the McCarthy
   period (1950-62), renown among sympathetic subcultures (1960s), and
   institutionalization as a cultural icon. While it has clear advantages,
   institutionalization can also have a dampening effect on an artist's
   oppositional potency.

AB Within the sociology of science, there exists a substantial literature
   showing that males, on average, publish more than females. This
   literature directs our attention toward organizational contexts and the
   timing of publication as promising factors bearing on cumulative
   scholarship outcomes. In this inquiry, based on 2,910 persons who
   received doctorates in sociology between 1972 and 1976, we isolate the
   importance of organizational context to explain the emergent and
   cumulative sex differences in publication outcomes. Our findings reveal
   that existing scholarship differences between males and females in this
   cohort occur within the first six years of the doctorate and continue
   throughout the career as a result of different employment patterns and
   publication trajectories. Notably, we find support for Robert Merton's
   contention that context structures the display of individual merit.

AB American immigration has long been characterized by spatial
   concentration within major urban areas. Los Angeles and New York City
   are two of the most important immigrant meccas today. Recent studies of
   immigrant adaptation within these cities have emphasized material
   factors at the expense of cultural considerations. This paper adopts a
   comparative perspective to demonstrate extreme differences in the
   symbolic construction of identity vis-a-vis immigrants in these two
   urban areas. Using The Los Angeles Times and The New York Times as
   indicators of elite cultural orientations, a content analysis is
   performed. The results demonstrate the social construction of an
   exclusive "threat" narrative in Southern California, and an inclusive
   "immigrant as victim" narrative in the New York metropolitan area. I
   argue that this extreme variation in cultural orientations must be
   understood as the result of divergent material and symbolic contexts. In
   order to demonstrate the importance of cultural factors, this paper
   focuses on symbolic differences between these areas and the influence
   these differences have on the political process of inclusion/exclusion.

AB The specialized field of disaster studies seems to be moving farther
   away from mainstream sociology, to the detriment of both. For
   sociologists working in this field, application of Max Weber's political
   sociology is proposed as one way to reconnect their research with
   longstanding concerns of the discipline. Weber's political sociology
   contains a conflict model focusing on structured inequalities of class,
   status, and power. Its relevance to both contemporary sociology and
   sociological disaster studies is illustrated through a reexamination of
   one of the early classic studies of disaster. The paper concludes with
   an overview of Weber's thoughts about the role of values in research and
   a brief comparison of Weber's political sociology with alternative
   theories.

   cent. B.C. This is the period that witnesses major changes in the
   structure of the settlement, in its social complexity and in its
   economic processes leading to formation of the state and urbanisation.
   Building upon recent work analysing the relationship between the
   emergence of social complexity and crop processing (as seen through the
   macroremains), possible evidence for structural changes in Roman archaic
   society are investigated, with particular attention to issues such as
   the centralisation of food storage and processing or the organisation of
   redistribution. Studies of this kind may well offer a different
   perspective on the beginnings of Rome, counterbalancing the traditional
   emphasis on textual evidence and burial analysis.

AB This paper reports an analysis of support for wolves (Canis spp.)
   reported in 38 quantitative surveys conducted between 1972 and 2000. Of
   109 records reported in these surveys, a majority (51%) showed positive
   attitudes toward wolves and 60% supported wolf restoration. Attitudes
   toward wolves had a negative correlation with age, rural residence, and
   ranching and farming occupations, and positive correlation with
   education and income. Thirty-five percent of ranchers and farmers
   surveyed had positive attitudes toward wolves. Among surveys of the
   general population samples, 61% expressed positive attitudes. Surveys of
   environmental and wildlife groups showed an average of 69% support.
   Surveys in the lower 48 states showed higher proportions of positive
   attitudes than surveys in Scandinavia and Western Europe, where a
   majority did not support wolves. Among all surveys, 25% of respondents
   had neutral attitudes toward wolves. Positive attitudes toward wolves
   did not appear to be increasing over time. Because attitudes toward
   wolves are often not strong among the general public, they have the
   potential to change rapidly if linked to other, stronger attitudes and
   beliefs. We expect that progress in education and urbanization will lead
   to increasingly positive attitudes over time. Negative attitudes
   associated with age are probably a cohort effect, and we should not
   expect the aging populations in the United States and Europe to lead to
   more negative wolf attitudes. Paradoxically, successful wolf
   reintroductions are likely to reduce general positive sentiment, since
   the presence of wolves gives people a more balanced experience with the
   animals. Traditionally, people with the most positive attitudes toward
   wolves have been those with the least experience.

AB The extraordinary diversity and ecological success of the social insects
   has been attributed to their ability to cope with the rich and often
   infectious microbial community inhabiting their nests and feeding sites.
   Mechanisms of disease control used by eusocial species include
   antibiotic glandular secretions, mutual grooming, removal of diseased
   individuals from the nest, and the innate and adaptive immune responses
   of colony members. Here we demonstrate that after a challenge exposure
   to the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, dampwood termites
   Zootermopsis angusticollis have higher survivorship when individuals
   develop immunity as group members. Furthermore, termites significantly
   improve their ability to resist infection when they are placed in
   contact with previously immunized nestmates. This "social transfer" of
   infection resistance, a previously unrecognized mechanism of disease
   control in the social insects, could explain how group living may
   improve the survivorship of colony members despite the increased risks
   of pathogen transmission that can accompany sociality.

AB Agent-based models are an increasingly powerful tool for simulating
   social systems because they can represent important phenomenon difficult
   to capture in other mathematical formalisms. But, agent-based models
   have provided only limited support for policy-making because their
   distinctive abilities are often most useful in situations where the
   future is unpredictable. In such situations, the traditional analytic
   methods for applying simulation models to support decision-making are
   least effective. Fortunately, new analytic approaches for
   decision-making under conditions of deep uncertainty-emphasizing large
   ensembles of model-created scenarios and adaptive policies evaluated
   with the criteria of robustness, rather than with optimality or
   efficiency-can unleash the full potential of agent-based policy
   simulators.

   beginning with present-day Internet trends suggesting that agents will
   charge one another for information goods and services. Then, to
   establish that agents can be competent price setters, I describe some
   laboratory experiments pitting software bidding agents against human
   bidders. The agents' superior performance suggests they will be used on
   a broad scale, which in turn suggests that interactions among agents
   will become frequent and significant. How will this affect macroscopic
   economic behavior? I describe some interesting phenomena that my
   colleagues and I have observed in simulations of large populations of
   automated buyers and sellers, such as price war cycles. I conclude by
   discussing fundamental scientific challenges that remain to be addressed
   as we journey toward the information economy.

AB Compared with the U.S., Japan is believed to have a collectivist culture
   that nurtures high trust. Results from laboratory and survey research,
   however, show that Americans are more likely to trust strangers than are
   Japanese. Why would trust be lower in a collectivist culture? We use an
   agent-based computational model to explore the evolutionary origin of
   this puzzling empirical finding. Computer simulations suggest that
   higher social mobility in the U.S. may be the explanation. With low
   mobility, agents rarely encounter strangers and thus remain highly
   parochial, trusting only their neighbors and avoiding open-market
   transactions with outsiders. With moderate mobility, agents learn to
   read telltale signs of character so that they can take advantage of
   better opportunities outside the neighborhood. However, if mobility is
   too great, there is too little trustworthiness to make the effort to
   discriminate worthwhile. This finding suggests that higher mobility in
   the U.S. may explain why Americans are more trusting than Japanese, but
   if mobility becomes too high, the self-reinforcing high-trust
   equilibrium could collapse.

AB The Nash equilibrium, the main solution concept in analytical game
   theory, cannot make precise predictions about the outcome of repeated
   mixed-motive games. Nor can it tell us much about the dynamics by which
   a population of players moves from one equilibrium to another. These
   limitations, along with concerns about the cognitive demands of
   forward-looking rationality, have motivated efforts to explore
   backward-looking alternatives to analytical game theory. Most of the
   effort has been invested in evolutionary models of population dynamics.
   We shift attention to a learning-theoretic alternative. Computational
   experiments with adaptive agents identify a fundamental solution concept
   for social dilemmas--stochastic collusion--based on a random walk from a
   self-limiting noncooperative equilibrium into a self-reinforcing
   cooperative equilibrium. However, we show that this solution is viable
   only within a narrow range of aspiration levels. Below the lower
   threshold, agents are pulled into a deficient equilibrium that is a
   stronger attractor than mutual cooperation, Above the upper threshold,
   agents are dissatisfied with mutual cooperation. Aspirations that adapt
   with experience (producing habituation to stimuli) do not gravitate into
   the window of viability; rather, they are the worst of both worlds.
   Habituation destabilizes cooperation and stabilizes defection. Results
   from the two-person problem suggest that applications to multiplex and
   embedded relationships will yield unexpected insights into the global
   dynamics of cooperation in social dilemmas.

AB The repeated pattern of emergent human organization at a societal level
   going from small-scale, egalitarian decentralized societies to complex,
   stratified, and centralized societies is well-documented in the
   archaeological record of past societies. In this paper, I outline a
   multitrajectory model that relates to the broad features of this
   sequence of societal change. Competition is shown to play a critical
   role in the way interaction-among decision making, demographic
   parameters, and social units that organize resource ownership and
   procurement-either promotes or inhibits change in social organization.
   Multiagent simulation is discussed as a way to link culturally embedded
   decision making to emergent properties in the multitrajectory model.

AB Synthetic adaptation is the process whereby any entity composed of
   intelligent, adaptive, and computational agents is also an intelligent,
   adaptive, and computational agent. Because of synthetic adaptation,
   organizations, like the agents of which they are composed, are
   inherently computational. We can gain insight into the behavior of
   groups, organizations, and societies by using multiagent computational
   models composed of collections of intelligent adaptive artificial
   agents. CONSTRUCT-O and ORGAHEAD are examples of such models whose value
   for social, organizational, and policy analysis lies in the fact that
   they combine a network (social and knowledge approach) with a multiagent
   approach to effect more realistic behavior. The results from a series of
   virtual experiments using these models are examined to illustrate the
   power of this approach for social, organizational, and policy analysis.

AB Agent-based models (ABM) are examples of complex adaptive systems, which
   can be characterized as those systems for which no model less complex
   than the system itself can accurately predict in detail how the system
   will behave at future times. Consequently, the standard tools of policy
   analysis, based as they are on devising policies that perform well on
   some best estimate model of the system, cannot be reliably used for ABM.
   This paper argues that policy analysis by using ABM requires an
   alternative approach to decision theory. The general characteristics of
   such an approach are described, and examples are provided of its
   application to policy analysis.

AB Long House Valley in the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona (U.S.)
   was inhabited by the Kayenta Anasazi from about 1800 before Christ to
   about anno Domini 1300. These people were prehistoric ancestors of the
   modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental
   research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and
   dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual
   fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per
   hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno
   Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural
   stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent
   computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main
   features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow,
   changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The
   agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to
   situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements.
   Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to
   model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity
   of the model.

AB Since the death of positivism in the 1970s, philosophers have turned
   their attention to scientific realism, evolutionary epistemology, and
   the Semantic Conception of Theories. Building on these trends,
   Campbellian Realism allows social scientists to accept real-world
   phenomena as criterion variables against which theories may be tested
   without denying the reality of individual interpretation and social
   construction. The Semantic Conception reduces the importance of axioms,
   but reaffirms the role of models and experiments. Philosophers now see
   models as "autonomous agents" that exert independent influence on the
   development of a science, in addition to theory and data. The
   inappropriate molding effects of math models on social behavior modeling
   are noted. Complexity science offers a "new" normal science epistemology
   focusing on order creation by self-organizing heterogeneous agents and
   agent-based models. The more responsible core of postmodernism builds on
   the idea that agents operate in a constantly changing web of
   interconnections among other agents. The connectionist agent-based
   models of complexity science draw on the same conception of social
   ontology as do postmodernists. These recent developments combine to
   provide foundations for a "new" social science centered on formal
   modeling not requiring the mathematical assumptions of agent homogeneity
   and equilibrium conditions. They give this "new" social science
   legitimacy in scientific circles that current social science approaches
   lack.

AB Agent-based modeling promises to overcome the reification of actors.
   Whereas this common, but limiting, assumption makes a lot of sense
   during periods characterized by stable actor boundaries, other
   historical junctures, such as the end of the Cold War, exhibit
   far-reaching and swift transformations of actors' spatial and
   organizational existence. Moreover, because actors cannot be assumed to
   remain constant in the long run, analysis of macrohistorical processes
   virtually always requires "sociational" endogenization. This paper
   presents a series of computational models, implemented with the software
   package REPAST, which trace complex macrohistorical transformations of
   actors be they hierarchically organized as relational networks or as
   collections of symbolic categories. With respect to the former, dynamic
   networks featuring emergent compound actors with agent compartments
   represented in a spatial grid capture organizational domination of the
   territorial state. In addition, models of "tagged" social processes
   allows the analyst to show how democratic states predicate their
   behavior on categorical traits. Finally, categorical schemata that
   select out politically relevant cultural traits in ethnic landscapes
   formalize a constructivist notion of national identity in conformance
   with the qualitative literature on nationalism. This "finite-agent
   method", representing both states and nations as higher-level structures
   superimposed on a lower-level grid of primitive agents or cultural
   traits, avoids reification of agency. Furthermore, it opens the door to
   explicit analysis of entity processes, such as the integration and
   disintegration of actors as well as boundary transformations.

   injured patients were more likely to report drug use during the last
   year, and those with violence-related injuries were more likely to
   report drug use during both time periods compared to those with other
   injuries. Drug use was associated with ethnicity, with whites more
   likely than blacks or Hispanics to report use. Among Hispanics,
   acculturation was related to drug use. with those high on acculturation
   as likely or more likely than whites to report use, Among those
   reporting alcohol consumption within 6 hr prior to the event and those
   meeting criteria for alcohol dependence, differences across
   ethnic/acculturation subgroups for drug use in the same 6-hr period were
   not significant, and a higher prevalence of both 6-hr and 12-month
   substance use was found compared to those not reporting drinking during
   the 6 hr and those not alcohol dependent.
   Conclusions: Data suggest that ethnic differences in substance use
   becomes less important among those alcohol involved, and future research
   should focus on the interaction of alcohol and other substances on
   injury occurrence. Data also suggest that substance use associated with
   increasing acculturation among U.S. Hispanics may have a strong impact
   on health services utilization, and research is needed by gender,
   othnicity, and acculturation to determine the burden that substance use
   places, on the ER.

AB It has long been assumed in sociology that gender differences in
   religiousness are a product of differential socialization. Yet, there is
   little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the
   literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the
   relationship between differential socialization and differential
   religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World
   Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between
   traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs
   and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the
   two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model
   involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new
   approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being
   irreligious constitutes risk-taking behavior. This model is able to
   predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and
   cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB Many psychological studies of categorization and reasoning use
   undergraduates to make claims about human conceptualization.
   Generalizability of findings to other populations is often assumed but
   rarely tested. Even when comparative studies are conducted, it may be
   challenging to interpret differences. As a partial remedy, in the
   present studies we adopt a 'triangulation strategy' to evaluate the ways
   expertise and culturally different belief systems can lead to different
   ways of conceptualizing the biological world. We use three groups (US
   bird experts, US undergraduates, and ordinary Itza' Maya) and two sets
   of birds (North American and Central American). Categorization tasks
   show considerable similarity among the three groups' taxonomic sorts,
   but also systematic differences. Notably, US expert categorization is
   more similar to ltza' than to US novice categorization. The differences
   are magnified on inductive reasoning tasks where only undergraduates
   show patterns of judgment that are largely consistent with current
   models of category-based taxonomic inference. The Maya commonly employ
   causal and ecological reasoning rather than taxonomic reasoning. Experts
   use a mixture of strategies (including causal and ecological reasoning),
   only some of which current models explain. US and Itza' informants
   differed markedly when reasoning about passerines (songbirds),
   reflecting the somewhat different role that songbirds play in the two
   cultures. The results call into question the importance of
   similarity-based notions of typicality and central tendency in natural
   categorization and reasoning. These findings also show that relative
   expertise leads to a convergence of thought that transcends cultural
   boundaries and shared experiences. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All

AB Studies among injection drug users (IDUs) find a higher prevalence of
   HIV infection among black and Puerto Rican IDUs than among white IDUs.
   Risk behaviors seldom explain these differences. We examine how risk
   networks contribute to racial/ethnic variations in HIV prevalence. Six
   hundred sixty-two IDUs were recruited on the street in Bushwick (New
   York City), interviewed, and tested for HIV. Risk behaviors and networks
   were analyzed to explain racial/ethnic variations in HIV. Forty percent
   of IDUs were infected with HIV. HIV prevalence was greater for Puerto
   Ricans (45%) and blacks (44%) than for whites (32%). Egocentric sexual
   and drug risk networks were predominantly racially/ethnically
   homogeneous. After multivariate adjustments for risk behaviors and risk
   networks, black-white differences in HIV prevalence were no longer
   significant. Although differences between Puerto Ricans and whites
   persisted, post hoc analyses suggested that network partner
   characteristics might explain these differences. In Bushwick,
   racially/ethnically discordant risk partnerships involving black IDUs
   may function as potential bridges of transmission between groups.

AB Study objective: To review existing data on social class gradients in
   adolescent health and to examine whether such gradients exist in new
   data concerning US adolescents.
   Design: Review of relevant publications and unpublished data; regression
   analyses using adolescent self reported health status data to determine
   whether there are gradients by social class, using three classes
   categorised by adolescent reported parental work status and education.
   Participants: Adolescents of ages 11-17.
   Main results: Findings from the literature indicate the presence of
   social class gradients in some but not all aspects of adolescent health.
   Results from new data showed social class gradients in several domains
   of health and in profiles of health. The likelihood of being satisfied
   with one's health, of being more resilient (better family involvement,
   better problem solving, more physical activity, better home safety),
   having higher school achievement, and of being in the best health
   profiles were significantly and progressively greater as social class
   rose. Moreover, the probability of being in the poorest health profile
   type group was progressively higher as social class declined.
   Conclusions: The review of existing data and the new findings support
   the existence of social class gradients in satisfaction with one's
   health, in resilience to health threats, in school achievement, and in
   being in the best health overall (as manifested by the health profiles
   composed of four major domains of health). The study had two especially
   notable findings: (1) the paucity of studies using the same or similar
   indicators, and (2) the consistent existence of social class gradients
   in characteristics related to subsequent health, particularly intake of
   nutritional foods and physical activity. The sparseness of existing data
   and the different aspects of health investigated in the relatively few
   studies underscore the need for (1) the development of conceptual models
   specifically focused on adolescent health and social class; (2)
   additional inquiry into the measurement of social class and adolescent
   perceptions of class; (3) inclusion of contextual variables in study
   design; and (4) longitudinal cohort studies to better understand the
   specific determinants of health during adolescence.

AB Objectives: To investigate the relationship between fathers' substance
   use and maternal and paternal background characteristics, infant outcome
   measures, and fathers' frequency of caregiving at 6 months postpartum in
   a cohort of cocaine-exposed and unexposed infants. Methods: Secondary
   analysis was completed on data collected through interviews and medical
   records obtained from 252 mothers participating in an ongoing
   longitudinal study of cocaine-exposed and unexposed mothers and infants.
   Results: By maternal report, 22% of the mothers reported that the father
   of the baby had a history of a drug and/or alcohol problem. Mothers who
   were classified as heavier cocaine users were 1.6 times more likely than
   lighter cocaine users and 2.6 times more likely than nonusers to report
   that the father of the baby had a history of a drug and/or alcohol
   problem. There was a significant relationship between the father's
   reported history of a drug and/ or alcohol problem and the mother's
   history of mental and physical abuse during pregnancy; P=.03, P=.001,
   respectively). Fathers with a history of a drug and/or alcohol problem
   were more likely to have been in jail (P=.001) and to be unemployed at
   the time of delivery (P=.04) than fathers without a history of a drug
   and/or alcohol problem. On bivariate analysis, newborns of fathers with
   a history by mother's report of a drug or alcohol problem had
   significantly lower mean birthweights (3003 vs. 3213 g, P=.005) and
   lengths (47.5 vs. 48.6 cm, P=.01) than newborns of fathers with no such
   history. However after control for mothers' prenatal use of cocaine,
   marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol and for infant gender and gestational
   age, the differences were not statistically significant (P=.15 for both
   measurements). Head circumference did not differ significantly between
   groups in either bivariate or multivariate analyses. Fathers with a
   reported history of drug and/or alcohol problems were more likely to
   care for the baby at least once a week than fathers without such a
   history of a drug and/or alcohol problem at 6 months postpartum.
   Conclusions: Childhood cognitive and behavioral outcomes currently
   attributed to maternal substance abuse may also reflect the genetic,
   teratogenic, and social influence of fathers. Within an urban, at-risk
   population, it is important to inquire about the father's participation
   in the day-to-day life of the infant and to address the father's as well
   as the mother's possible need for substance abuse treatment and support
   in parenting. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This study argues that, in the US, key forms of studying music as a
   social and cultural phenomenon emerged during the nineteenth
   century--particularliy salient were the social dimensions that
   surrounded the music making of slaves in the decades that encompassed
   the Civil War. Critical reflection on slave music was rooted in the
   religious debates that coincided with the abolitionist movement. This
   critical reflection yielded, first, a hermeneutical approach to the
   music making of slaves and, later, a formalistic approach to slave songs
   (i.e., spirituals). From religious crisis and critical reflection, then,
   came the first fully modern sociology of music in the US.

AB Since Simmel's early work on forms of association, the processes guiding
   group composition have commanded considerable attention in structural
   sociology, but have not led to a general methodology for examining
   compositional properties. By introducing a structural event approach,
   this study offers a new technique that is not restricted to analysis of
   dyads or triads nor post hoc analysis of those structural arrangements
   that are observed in a given sample. The approach is illustrated using
   data on 745 organizational founding teams. Structural event analysis
   separates choice behavior guiding team composition (with respect to
   ascribed and achieved characteristics of members) from
   structurally-induced behavior based on contact opportunities. Results
   suggest that the strong impact of ascriptive homophily may be tempered
   where functional considerations of group composition are addressed.
   However, many of the other arrangements that ostensibly pass as
   'functional' are in fact induced by opportunity structures. (C) 2002

AB The origin of large but rare cascades that are triggered by small

   cultural fads, collective action, the diffusion of norms and
   innovations, and cascading failures in infrastructure and organizational
   networks. This paper presents a possible explanation of this phenomenon
   in terms of a sparse, random network of interacting agents whose
   decisions are determined by the actions of their neighbors according to
   a simple threshold rule. Two regimes are identified in which the network
   is susceptible to very large cascades-herein called global cascades-that
   occur very rarely. When cascade propagation is limited by the
   connectivity of the network, a power law distribution of cascade sizes
   is observed, analogous to the cluster size distribution in standard
   percolation theory and avalanches in self-organized criticality. But
   when the network is highly connected, cascade propagation is limited
   instead by the local stability of the nodes themselves, and the size
   distribution of cascades is bimodal, implying a more extreme kind of
   instability that is correspondingly harder to anticipate. In the first
   regime, where the distribution of network neighbors is highly skewed, it
   is found that the most connected nodes are far more likely than average
   nodes to trigger cascades, but not in the second regime. Finally, it is
   shown that heterogeneity plays an ambiguous role in determining a
   system's stability: increasingly heterogeneous thresholds make the
   system more vulnerable to global cascades; but an increasingly
   heterogeneous degree distribution makes it less vulnerable.

   complications, direct and indirect costs, and the patient's physical and

   patients with thalassemia major was conducted in ten countries: Cyprus.,
   Egypt, Greece, Hong Kong, India, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Taiwan, and the
   United States. Results: 1,888 questionnaires (65%) were returned. The
   responses suggest that nowadays patients begin blood transfusions, and
   most use desferrioxamine (84.8%), but iron-related complications,
   including life-threatening ones such as heart disease, are still common.
   Conclusions: There remains a need to improve the management of
   thalassemia, as many patients with iron-related complications experience

AB Objective: Family functioning and peer influences are theoretically
   linked to child psychopathology. This study quantified the functional
   status of families with fathers with substance dependence with or
   without comorbid antisocial personality disorder and evaluated the peer
   environments of preadolescent offspring. The authors examined
   associations between the child's psychopathology, paternal substance
   dependence/antisocial personality disorder status, and measures of
   family and peer environments.
   Method: Families with the presence or absence of paternal substance
   dependence were subdivided into those with and without paternal
   antisocial personality disorder, Grouped families were contrasted on
   measures of family functioning, the child's peer affiliation, and the
   child's problem behaviors. Regression analysis determined the influence
   of these factors on the child's psychopathology.
   Results: Families with paternal substance dependence functioned worse
   than normal comparison families, However, families with paternal
   substance dependence and antisocial personality disorder (N=34) did not
   differ markedly from those with substance dependence without antisocial
   personality disorder (N=84). The children of fathers with both substance
   dependence and antisocial personality disorder had greater affiliation
   with deviant peers than those with substance dependence without
   antisocial personality disorder and comparison families (N=104).
   Conclusions: Children of fathers with substance dependence and
   antisocial personality disorder demonstrated higher externalizing and
   internalizing psychopathology than those with substance dependence but
   not antisocial personality disorder and those without either condition.
   Paternal substance dependence/antisocial personality disorder status and
   the child's affiliation with deviant peers were most robustly associated
   with the child's psychopathology. Research is needed to develop
   interventions that effectively address parental risk and healthy peer
   relations.

AB One of the most widely debated issues in contemporary sociology has been
   how to interpret patterns of family change in the United States during
   the past four decades. Much of these debates focus on a thesis advanced
   by a number of scholars and political activists-that such features of
   family structure as high divorce rates and an increasing proportion of
   single-parent families have led to the decline of the family. Although
   past research has examined the causes and historical trends involved in
   family change, scholars have neglected important questions about family
   attitudes that have been raised in recent debates. Have levels of public
   concerti with family decline increased over time? If so, what are the
   sources of these attitudes? And have changing levels of public concerti
   with family decline led to the emergence of a new political cleavage?
   This study applies a theory of religious influence to answer these
   questions. Results show that public concern with family decline
   increased steadily after 1980, leading to a new and increasingly large
   cleavage in presidential elections. The analyses also find that high
   levels of concern with family decline are concentrated among evangelical
   Protestants who attend church regularly. In addition to extending
   sociological research on family change in new and fruitful directions,
   these results bear productively on theory and research in political
   sociology and the sociology of religion. I discuss their relevance to
   long-standing debates over political trends among evangelical
   Protestants and the influence of Christian Right movement organizations.

AB The recent literature on immigrant transnationalism points to an
   alternative form of economic adaptation of foreign minorities in
   advanced societies that is based on the mobilization of their
   cross-country social networks, Case studies have noted the phenomenon's
   potential significance for immigrant integration into receiving
   countries and for the economic development in countries of origin.
   Despite their suggestive character, these studies consistently sample on
   the dependent variable (transnationalism), failing to establish the
   empirical existence of these activities beyond a few descriptive
   examples and their possible determinants. These issues are addressed
   using a survey designed explicitly for this purpose and conducted among
   selected Latin immigrant groups in the United States. Although immigrant
   transnationalism has received little attention in the mainstream
   sociological literature so far, it has the potential of altering the
   character of the new ethnic Communities spawned by contemporary
   immigration. The empirical existence of transnationalism is examined on
   the basis of discriminant functions of migrant characteristics, and the
   relative probabilities of engaging in these kinds of activities is
   established based on hypotheses drawn from the literature. Implications
   for the sociology of immigration as well as for broader sociological
   theories of the economy are discussed.

   expectancies are related to drinking behaviors. The purpose of this
   study was to examine the relationship among drinking behaviors and
   alcohol expectancies in treatment-seeking individuals diagnosed with
   social anxiety disorder or dysthymia, as well as normal controls. No
   significant differences were found across the 3 groups in alcohol
   consumption. As expected, socially anxious participants had higher
   social assertiveness expectancies than both participants with dysthymia
   and normal controls. Participants with social anxiety disorder had
   greater tension reduction and global positive change expectancies than
   the normal controls, but did not differ from participants with
   dysthymia. Additionally, the increased social assertiveness, tension
   reduction, and positive change expectancies were found to predict amount
   of drinking per month for socially anxious participants. Implications
   for understanding the relationship between social anxiety disorder and
   alcoholism are discussed.

AB Historically, the no-man's land created by human warfare often protected
   wildlife and habitats by limiting human incursions and human population
   densities within disputed territories. Relatively few examples of this
   phenomenon have been identified in conjunction with recent and ongoing
   wars in developing countries, however. Modern wars and civil strife are
   typically associated with detrimental effects on wildlife and wildlife
   habitats. Most cited instances of contemporary war-zone refuges refer to
   military security areas that are functionally and geographically
   distinct from actual battlefields or areas subject to armed civil
   conflicts. The disappearance of the war-zone refuge effect is
   attributable to modern trends in the scale, intensity, or technologies
   associated with military conflicts and violent civil strife. Munitions
   and chemical agents exert both immediate and residual effects, direct
   and indirect, on wildlife and habitats. Overharvesting of wildlife and
   vegetation in conflict zones exacerbates existing constraints on the
   access to natural resources, threatening both the resource base and the
   livelihoods of local communities dependent on these resources.
   Socioeconomic studies have identified causative linkages between
   environmental degradation and violent civil strife, with the scarcity of
   natural resources fostering the emergence of war and civil conflicts in
   developing countries. Wars and civil strife create positive feedback
   that reinforces and amplifies interactions between and among ecosystem
   vulnerability, resource availability, and violent conflict. Strong and
   flexible partnerships between local communities, nongovernmental
   organizations, and international institutions may be a critical factor
   in mitigating the effects of war on wildlife by helping to maintain
   continuity in conservation efforts during periods of political
   instability.

AB While the macro-level association between poverty and child malnutrition
   is well-established, the concept of 'poverty' and its operationalization
   in terms of measures of socioeconomic status shed little or no light on
   the mechanisms through which malnutrition is created and/or prevented.
   This paper investigates a woman's social power, one such mechanism that
   may mediate the impact of poverty on childhood nutrition. This
   micro-level factor is examined using survey data on 402 children 5 years
   of age and younger and their 261 Fulbe mothers in rural Mali. A
   conceptual model of social power is developed and used to test the
   hypothesis that a mother's social power can predict her child's
   nutritional status.

AB Food insufficiency has been shown to be associated with poor health,
   academic and psychosocial outcomes in American children, but the
   relationship between food insufficiency and depressive disorders in U.S.
   adolescents has not been studied. Further, there are no national
   estimates of the prevalence of depressive disorders for U.S.
   adolescents, nor investigation of associations with sociodemographic
   characteristics using national data. Therefore, we analyzed data for 15-
   and 16-y-old adolescents from the Third National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES III). Depressive disorders and suicidal
   symptoms were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.
   Adolescents were classified as "food insufficient" if a family
   respondent reported that the family sometimes or often did not have
   enough to eat. The prevalence of depression outcomes is reported by
   sociodemographic characteristics. Odds ratios for associations with food
   insufficiency are reported, adjusted for sociodemographic factors.
   Overall, lifetime prevalence of major depressive disorder was 6.3% and
   of dysthymia, 5.4%. Almost 5% of 15- to 16-y-old adolescents reported
   that they had ever attempted suicide and 38.8% reported at least one
   suicidal symptom. Female adolescents were significantly more likely than
   males to have had dysthymia, any depressive disorder and all symptoms of
   suicide. Low income adolescents were less likely to report suicide
   ideation than high income adolescents, but there were no other
   differences by family income. Food-insufficient adolescents were
   significantly more likely to have had dysthymia, thoughts of death, a
   desire to die and have attempted suicide. There is a strong association
   between food insufficiency and depressive disorder and suicidal symptoms
   in U.S. adolescents.

AB dThe difficulties of managing therapy in minority children with type 2

   support for patients in adhering to their therapy schedules and
   requirements is emphasized. The results of a study comparing the
   efficacy of family involvement in managing treatment for children with
   type 2 DM are discussed. The study compared two groups of
   African-American children: group 1 (7 children), direct family
   supervision, with the care-giver actively participating in diabetes
   management; and group 2 (5 children), without direct supervision by a
   family caregiver, who randomly and inconsistently participated in
   management. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(lc)) was measured at baseline
   and 1 year later by high performance liquid chromatography. Results of
   the study indicate that direct supervision of children with DM has a
   positive effect on glycemic control, resulting in a statistically
   significant decrease of MAI, as compared to the group of unsupervised
   children. Despite some adolescents' demands for greater autonomy, or
   cultural pressures to assume greater personal responsibilities during
   teenage years, continuing family involvement in the management of
   adolescent patients with DM is strongly advised for optimum therapeutic
   results.

AB OBJECTIVE: To more precisely understand the changes in triplet births in
   recent years.
   STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of recent government and medical publications
   pertaining to triplets.
   RESULTS: Triplet births are at much greater risk than singletons of poor
   birth outcomes. More than 9 of 10 triplet births are born preterm (<37
   completed weeks of gestation) as compared with <1 of 10 singleton
   infants. The average weight of a triplet newborn (1,698 g) is one-half
   that of a singleton newborn (3,358 g). The infant death rate for triplet
   and other higher-order multiple births is 12 times higher than that for
   singletons (93.7 as compared with 7.8 infant deaths per 1,000 live
   births).
   CONCLUSION: Based on their frequency of preterm birth, low birth weight
   and infant death rate, it is appropriate to characterize all triplet
   pregnancies as high risk.

AB Determinants of evolving epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases
   (STD) are equally influenced by the evolution of the STD epidemics
   themselves and by the evolution of human societies. A temporal approach
   to STD transmission dynamics suggests the need to monitor infectivity,
   rate of exposure between infected and susceptible individuals, and
   duration of infectiousness in societies. Different indicators may be
   used to monitor rate of exposure in the general population and in core
   groups. In addition, underlying determinants of STD epidemics such as
   poverty, inequality, racial/ethnic discrimination, unemployment, sex
   ratio, volume of migration, and health care coverage and quality are
   important variables to monitor through a surveillance system focused on
   social context. Ongoing large scale societal changes including
   urbanisation, globalisation, increasing inequality, and increasing
   volume of migrant populations may affect the evolution of STD epidemics.
   Globalised STD epidemics could pose a major challenge to local public
   health systems.

AB This analysis focuses on how sociocultural and economic characteristics
   of a poor semi-urban and rural population (Kisesa word) in north west

   other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Poverty and sociocultural
   changes may contribute to the observed high levels of marital
   instability and high levels of short and long term migration in Kisesa,
   especially among younger adults. Marriage and migration patterns are
   important underlying factors affecting the spread of HIV. The most
   cost-effective intervention strategy may be to focus on the trading
   centre in which mobility is higher, bars were more common, and HIV
   prevalence and incidence were considerably higher than in the nearby
   rural villages. If resources suffice, additional work can be undertaken
   in the rural villages although it is not clear to what extent the rural

   project. The questions are relevant to most CBL projects, ranging from
   internships to research projects and field trips, The questions include:
   Among the goals of the project, are there primary and secondary goals or
   are the goals given equal weight? Is participation in the project
   mandatory or voluntary? Should the CBL component of a course be
   concentrated in one site or dispersed across many sites? How similar or
   different should each student's individual participation in the project
   be? How central should direct client/community interaction be to
   students' activities? Based on a review of the CBL literature in
   Sociology and feedback from the students and partner organization in our
   own CBL project, we discuss each question and outline some of the
   advantages and disadvantages of various decisions, focusing on the
   competing interests of students, instructors, and partner organizations.
   The aim is not to advocate one kind of project or design over another
   but rather to help other project planners anticipate and avoid pitfalls

   application of specific techniques necessary to implement a service
   learning component in an introductory sociology class. It also
   systematically compares the outcomes from two groups of students, one of
   which was involved in relatively unstructured community work and the
   other in a structured service learning assignment and examines the
   benefits experienced from this transformation. Although adding the
   structure necessary to accomplish effective service learning involved
   careful preliminary reflection, planning, and coordination, the study
   suggests that the service learning approach enhances students'
   development of a sociological orientation and understanding of
   structural linkages to poverty. It also indicates that students involved
   in structured service learning may better master course materials than
   students involved In less-structured community work, as measured by
   objective examination. Finally, the study supports earlier claims
   reported in the literature that service learning might be a particularly
   effective way of improving the efficacy of introductory sociology
   courses.

AB The aging of the US population and the evidence that only about 5% of
   individuals in the United States donate blood each year raise concerns
   about the assurance of an adequate, safe supply of blood in the future.
   Blood donation decision making has been investigated worldwide for
   decades to understand the process better to increase donation
   efficiency, safety, retention, collection numbers, and diversity of the
   donor pool. This review focuses on the characteristics of allogeneic
   blood donors, the motivational sources in donor decision making, and the
   research concepts and techniques used to examine these factors. Some
   historic studies considered pivotal, as well as more recent surveys, may
   not be pertinent to or representative of the current national donor
   pool. Interpretation of data related to donor characteristics should
   examine whether demographics mirror the donor pool to assist in targeted
   recruitment or if targeted recruitment actually leads to the reported
   demographics. Few recent studies of donor motivation have been
   published. Modern sources of positive and negative motivation are worth
   exploring through scientifically sound investigations involving
   representative cohorts using multifactorial approaches. Strategies that
   focus on retaining return donors and transforming first-time donors into
   repeaters would be beneficial. Investigations are needed also to assess
   research questions and to develop well-designed interventions to test
   hypotheses and to produce generalizable findings appilcable to future
   donor decision making. Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA). All

AB This paper examines the environmental experiences of middle and working
   class whites and people of color in the United States during the 19th
   and 20th centuries. It examines their activism and how their
   environmental experiences influenced the kinds of discourses they
   developed. The paper posits that race, class, and gender had profound
   effects on peoples environmental experiences, and consequently their
   activism and environmental discourses. Historical data show that while
   some middle class whites fled the cities and their urban ills to focus
   attention on outdoor explorations, wilderness and wildlife issues, some
   of their social contemporaries stayed in the cities to develop urban
   parks and help improve urban environmental conditions. Though there were
   conflicts between white middle and working class activists over the use
   of open space, the white working class collaborated with white
   middle-class urban environmental activists to improve public health and
   worker health and safety, whereas, people of color, driven off their
   land, corralled onto reservations, enslaved, and used as low-wage
   laborers, developed activist agendas and environmental discourses that
   linked racism and oppression to worker health and safety issues, limited
   access to resources, loss of or denial of land ownership, and
   infringement on human rights.

   services exist; however, much less is known about racial disparities in
   the quality of care.
   Objective To assess racial disparities in the quality of care for
   enrollees in Medicare managed care health plans.
   Design and Setting Observational study, using the 1998 Health Plan
   Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS), which summarized performance
   in calendar year 1997 for 4 measures of quality of care (breast cancer
   screening, eye examinations for patients with diabetes, beta-blocker use
   after myocardial infarction, and follow-up after hospitalization for
   mental illness).
   Participants A total of 305574 (7.7%) beneficiaries who were enrolled in
   Medicare managed care health plans had data for at least 1 of the 4
   HEDIS measures and were aged 65 years or older.
   Main Outcome Measures Rates of breast cancer screening, eye examinations
   for patients with diabetes, beta-blocker use after myocardial
   infarction, and follow-up after hospitalization for mental illness.
   Results Blacks were less likely than whites to receive breast cancer
   screening (62.9% vs 70.9%; P<.001), eye examinations for patients with
   diabetes (43.6% vs 50.4%; P=.02), &beta;-blocker medication after
   myocardial infarction (64.1% vs 73.8%; P<.005), and follow-up after
   hospitalization for mental illness (33.2 vs 54.0%; P<.001). After
   adjustment for potential confounding factors, racial disparities were
   still statistically significant for eye examinations for patients with
   diabetes, &beta;-blocker use after myocardial infarction, and follow-up
   after hospitalization for mental illness.
   Conclusion Among Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in managed care health
   plans, blacks received poorer quality of care than whites.

   'barebacking' as a sociocultural phenomenon in a sample of HIV-positive
   and -negative men who have sex with men (MSM), and to assess the reasons
   for barebacking and venues for meeting partners.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey of MSM recruited in the San Francisco
   Bay Area from July 2000 to February 2001.
   Methods: Barebacking, defined as 'intentional anal sex without a condom
   with someone other than a primary partner', was assessed among men who
   had heard of the term. Participants were recruited outside multiple
   venues and interviewed later at community locations. Chi-square and
   multivariate logistic regression were used for analysis.
   Results: The sample in = 554) of MSM were African-American (28%), Latino
   (27%), white (31%) and other race/ethnicity (14%); 35% reported being
   HIV-positive. Seventy per cent of the men had heard of barebacking.
   Among men aware of the term, 14% had barebacked in the past 2 years (22%
   of HIV-positive versus 10% of HIV-negative men, P < 0.001); 10% of the
   full sample did so. The prevalence of barebacking did not differ by
   race/ethnicity or sexual orientation identification. Men tended to
   report bareback partners who had the same HIV serostatus; however, a
   sizeable proportion of men had partners of different or unknown
   serostatus. Increased physical stimulation and emotional connectedness
   were the primary reasons for barebacking.
   Conclusion: New approaches are needed to reduce bareback behavior and
   the risk of HIV transmission, including innovative health-promoting
   behavioral and biomedical interventions. (C) 2002 Lippincott Williams

AB Previous studies have used population data to demonstrate an inverse
   association between suicide rates and religious commitment. This report
   examines Utah suicide rates for young men aged 15-34 years, stratified
   by their membership in and commitment to the Church of Jesus Christ of
   Latter-day Saints (LDS), the predominant religion in Utah. All state
   death records for males from 1991 to 1995 were obtained and linked to
   LDS church deceased membership records to obtain a measure of religious
   commitment that is not self-reported. Religious commitment for LDS
   church members was determined by age-appropriate priesthood off ice, Of
   the 27,738 male deaths reported, 15,555 (56%) linked to an LDS church
   record using a probabilistic linking program. Using active (high
   religious commitment) LDS as the reference group, the less-active (low
   religious commitment) LDS group had relative risks of suicide ranging
   from 3.28 (ages 15-19 years) to 7.64 (ages 25-29 years); nonmembers of
   the LDS church had relative risks ranging from 3.43 (ages 15-19 years)
   to 6.27 (ages 20-24 years). Although the mechanism of the association is
   unclear, higher levels of religiosity appear to be inversely associated
   with suicide.

AB Life history theory postulates tradeoffs of current versus future
   reproduction; today women face evolutionarily novel versions of these
   tradeoffs. Optimal age at first birth is the result of tradeoffs in
   fertility and mortality; ceteris paribus, early reproduction is
   advantageous. Yet modern women in developed nations experience
   relatively late first births; they appear to be trading off
   socioeconomic status and the paths to raised SES, education and work,
   against early fertility. Here, [1] using delineating parameter values
   drawn from data in the literature, we model these tradeoffs to determine
   how much socioeconomic advantage will compensate for delayed first
   births and lower lifetime fertility; and [2] we examine the effects of
   work, and education on women's lifetime and age specific fertility using
   data from seven cohorts in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID).

AB Child survival is probabilistic, but the unpredictability in family
   formation and completed family size has been neglected in the fertility
   literature. In many societies, ending the family cycle with too few or
   too many surviving offspring entails serious social, economic, or
   fitness consequences. A model of risk- (or variance-) sensitive adaptive
   behavior that addresses long-term fertility outcomes is presented. The
   model shows that under conditions likely to be common, optimal,
   risk-sensitive reproductive strategies deviate systematically from the
   completed family size that would be expected if reproductive outcome is
   were predictable. This is termed the "variance compensation hypothesis."
   Variance compensation may be either positive or negative, resulting in
   augmented or diminished fertility. Which outcome obtained is a function
   of identifiable social, economic, and environmental factors. Through its
   effect on fertility behavior, variance compensation has a direct bearing
   on birth spacing and completed fertility, and thereby on problems in
   demography and human population biology ranging from demographic
   transitions to maternal depletion and child health. Risk-sensitive
   models will be a necessary component of a general theory of fertility.

AB Background: Since they are a healthy and well-nourished isolate with
   strong religious proscriptions against birth control, the fertility
   patterns of the Old Order Amish have long been studied by demographers,
   particularly those with an interest in natural fertility.
   Aim: The present report describes population growth, population
   structure, and fertility patterns in a little-studied Amish settlement
   located in northeastern Ohio, USA (Geauga Settlement).
   Subjects and methods: A directory prepared by the Geauga Settlement
   provides data on the dates of birth of the mother, father, and all
   children for 1337 families for the period up to 1 January 1993. This
   information was used to assess population size, population structure,
   fertility rates, age at marriage, age of mothers at first and last
   birth, and birth intervals. Estimates of total settlement size were also
   derived from an older directory covering the period up to 1 January 1988
   and a recently published directory which covers the period up to 1
   January 1998.
   Results: The settlement consisted of 7546 individuals in 1988, 8345
   individuals in 1993, and 9572 individuals in 1998. The completed marital
   fertility rate was 7.7 (SD 3.6) births per woman. Total fertility rate
   decreased by about one birth between 1909 and 1967, in association with
   a change in fertility patterns, with women born in more recent cohorts
   tending to have more of their offspring at an earlier age, both of which
   suggest the existence of behaviours to control fertility. On the other
   hand, the age at the birth of the last child remained fairly constant
   over this time period.
   Conclusions: There is some suggestion of fertility control by Amish
   families. However, this control appears to be independent of parity,
   suggesting that there is no intention to limit family size. It is
   therefore reasonable to conclude that the Amish in the Geauga Settlement
   are a natural fertility population.

AB In a sample of married couples, approximately half of which included a
   wife with major depression, we evaluated whether mood reactivity (i.e.,
   pre- to post-interaction changes in mood) to marital conflict resolution
   interactions was associated with marital dissatisfaction, depression, or
   both. In support of the marital discord model of depression, results
   indicated that greater marital dissatisfaction was associated with
   greater increases in depressed mood for both wives and husbands;
   depressed wives also reported greater increases in depressed mood than
   nondepressed wives. In comparison, husbands of depressed wives did not
   differ in their mood reactivity from husbands of nondepressed wives,
   which failed to support Coyne's (1976b) interpersonal theory of
   depression. Results suggest that the mood-reactivity paradigm may
   provide an important framework for evaluating partners' experiences of
   changes in moods following intimate interactions.

AB The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11,
   2001 as well as domestic terrorism in the United States and elsewhere in
   the world has prompted an analysis of the psychology of the terrorist.
   The perpetrators' profound sense of being wronged - their values
   undermined by foreign powers or a corrupt domestic power structure - has
   cried out for revolution and revenge. The fanatic ideology of the
   perpetrators has provided the matrix for a progressively more malevolent
   representation of the oppressors: the Image of the Enemy. Retribution
   against the Enemy in the form of mass murder of anonymous civilians
   becomes an imperative.
   The counterpart of the image of the Enemy is the idealized collective
   self-image of members of the movement, faction, or cult. The group
   narcissism of the white supremacists in the United States, the Aum
   Shinrikyo in Japan, and the Islamic extremists enhance their collective
   self-image as pure, righteous, and united. While the foot soldiers, as
   in any war, gain glory through martyrdom, the instigators and leaders
   have their own personal narcissistic goals (power and prestige) and
   plan. For the extremist Islamists the ultimate goal has been overthrow
   of the moderate Islamic governments; for the domestic terrorists,
   destabilization of the national government and reinstitution of the
   traditional values. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

   studying the cross-cultural communication of emotion using forced-choice
   experimental designs. American, Indian, and Japanese participants judged
   facial expressions from all 3 cultures. A factorial experimental design
   is used, balanced n x n across cultures, to separate "absolute" cultural
   differences from "relational" effects characterizing the relationship
   between the emotion expressor and perceiver. Use of a response bias
   correction is illustrated for the tendency to endorse particular
   multiple-choice categories more often than others. Treating response
   bias also as an opportunity to gain insight into attributional style,
   the authors examined similarities and differences in response patterns
   across cultural groups. Finally, the authors examined patterns in the
   errors or confusions that participants make during emotion recognition
   and documented strong similarity across cultures.

AB Background: African-American adolescent females are disproportionately
   affected by the HIV epidemic in the United States. One important
   potential, yet understudied, protective influence that may reduce
   African-American adolescents' HIV risk behavior is their involvement in
   social organizations. Objective: To examine the association between
   high-risk African-American adolescent females' activity in social
   organizations and their recent HIV-associated sexual risk behavior.
   Methods: Sexually active, African-American females (N=522) were
   recruited from schools and adolescent medicine clinics in low-income
   neighborhoods of Birmingham, Alabama. Adolescents completed a
   self-administered survey and face-to-face interview. Adolescents'
   participation in Black social organizations was assessed. Measures of
   HIV protective behavior were also assessed. Bivariate analysis was
   followed by logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AOR)
   for the outcomes. Results: Adolescents not belonging to social
   organizations were about 1.6 times more likely to report recent
   acquiescence to unwanted sex without a condom, 1.9 times more likely to
   report that their current steady sex partner had other partners, and 1.9
   times more likely to score low on the measure of sex-related
   communication with parents. Discussion: Findings from controlled
   analyses suggest that community-based Black social organizations may be
   an important venue for protecting African-American adolescent females
   from having sex with a partner who has concurrent partners, and from
   having unwanted sex without a condom. Participation in Black social
   organizations was also associated with more frequent interaction between
   adolescents and their parents about sex-related issues such as HIV
   prevention. Models of HIV prevention that promote community involvement
   may be an under-utilized intervention modality with high potential
   impact.

AB Objective: Iron-deficiency anemia is high in refugee Hmong toddlers
   attending Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and
   Children (WIC) sites in St. Paul, Minnesota. We investigated social and
   cultural reasons for feeding practices of Hmong parents that result in
   excessive milk and inadequate food intake among infants and toddlers
   contributing to iron-deficiency anemia. Design: In-depth interviews with
   community members. Focus-group interviews with caregivers. Discussions
   of results with a professional healthcare group. Setting: St. Paul,
   Minnesota in 1997-1998. Participants: Eight Hmong and 7 non-Hmong
   community members. Thirty-two Hmong parents in focus groups. Thirteen
   Hmong and 11 non-Hmong healthcare professionals. Main Outcome Measures:
   Qualitative analysis identified themes from community and focus-group
   interviews. Professional group discussed meaning of results. Results: To
   successfully adjust to American lifestyle demands, Hmong refugee
   families bottle-feed, rather than breast-feed, their infants. In the
   traditional demand pattern, bottle-feeding can cause infants to be given
   too much milk at the expense of solid food, and can teach them to prefer
   milk to food. As these infants become toddlers, caregivers have
   difficulty weaning them due to a child-raising philosophy of "hlu" that
   caters to children's desires. Conclusion: Hmong caregivers'
   child-raising philosophy of "hlu" coupled with feeding practices chosen
   to adjust to American society contribute to the high rate of
   iron-deficiency anemia in Hmong toddlers.

AB Genetics has the potential not only to find cures for diseases, but to
   possess the mechanisms to change the bio-social make-up of populations.
   A specific question that has arisen on this issue is how developments in
   genetic technology may intersect with existing race and ethnic
   relations. Evidence of the racialization of some genetic disorders has
   been demonstrated elsewhere. The purpose of this study is to compare and
   contrast African-American and European-American attitudes on the
   benefits of genetics research for society. Findings show that
   African-Americans were more likely to say genetics research is harmful
   for society. This relationship remained statistically significant after
   controls were introduced in a regression model. Demographic
   characteristics and self-rated knowledge of genetics had no effect on
   attitudes among African-Americans. A willingness to use genetic services
   correlated with favorable attitudes. Differences in social position may
   lead some groups to opposing interpretations and symbolic meanings of
   genetics. This may be true in the context of this study because the
   social meanings of genetics may be tainted by racialization, historical
   attempts at eugenics, and the potential abuse of genetics targeting
   groups partially defined by superficial genetic characteristics.

AB Migration of young Latinos and Latinas has increased in many towns in

   a new cultural environment. We focus on the interface between families
   of Latino origin and the Midwest health-care system, particularly in the
   care of the pregnant woman or couple and in the care of the infant.
   Issues of culture are central in the perinatal period, and often the
   staff in health-care centers is not aware of the importance of several
   traditional and "folk" health-care beliefs in this period. These beliefs
   impact the care of the pregnant woman, the baby, and the couple's
   conception of health and illness, as well as the remedies to solve
   problems. We review, from the mother and infant mental and physical
   health point of view, the main culturally based health beliefs and

AB Family systems exert substantial influence on the demographic processes
   of populations. The Moso in Southwest China feature an institutionalized
   visiting sexual system, which differs from marriage, and a grand
   household system without conjugal units. Moso women enjoy virtually
   unlimited reproductive autonomy. On the basis of surveys of 12 Moso
   households conducted in 1988 and 1989, this paper analyzes the fertility
   experience of Moso women during the twentieth century and the mortality
   rates of the Moso population in the PRC era. Moso fertility patterns are
   characterized by a late age at first birth (median 23 years), long
   interbirth intervals (median 3 years), and a high rate of childlessness
   (16%). We conclude that this pattern of low fertility is an outcome of
   the unique Moso cultural practices. For the cohorts of Moso women born
   between 1905 and 1929, pathological sterility caused by STD is likely to
   have depressed fertility as well.

AB This study was designed to investigate the predictors of social
   dominance, the strategies children use to control resources (prosocial
   and coercive), and the associations between these strategies and
   measures of personality, social skills, and peer regard. A total of 30
   preschoolers (ages 3-6) were rated by their teachers on social
   dominance. Based on these ratings, dominant children were paired with
   multiple subordinate children (i.e., block design; Kenny, 1990) and
   observed in a play situation designed to elicit resource control
   behaviour. As hypothesised, age and the surgency facet of extraversion
   predicted social dominance (but openness to experience did not).
   Furthermore, also as expected, both prosocial behaviour and coercive
   behaviour were related to resource control in the play situation. Last,
   both resource control strategies were associated with parent-rated
   social competence, but only coercive control was associated with
   positive peer regard (i.e., Likeability). Factors of personality (e.g.
   agreeableness, hostility) were not associated with either of the
   strategies. The utility of an evolutionary perspective to resource
   control and social competence is discussed.

AB Euthanasia has been legally sanctioned in the Netherlands by a series of

   cultural and historical factors that may have contributed to this
   development. In the past decade, studies sactioned by the Dutch
   government reveal that guidelines established for the regulation of
   euthanasia-a voluntary, well-considered, persistent request, intolerable
   suffering that cannot be relieved, consultation with a colleague, and
   reporting of cases-are consistently violated. Of greatest concern is the
   number of patients who are put to death without their consent-there are
   more involuntary than voluntary cases. Euthanasia intended originally
   for the exceptional case has become an accepted way of dealing with the
   physical and mental distress of serious or terminal illness. In the
   process palliative care has become one of the casualties while hospice
   care lags behind that of other countries. Case examples are given.

AB Lowering state blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits to 0.08, though
   controversial, has been supported by most evaluation studies to date.
   The Illinois .08 BAC law implemented in 1997 provided a unique
   opportunity to evaluate the effect of the law without the simultaneous
   passage of an administrative license revocation (ALR) law, which has
   clouded some previous evaluations of the .08 laws. The proportion of all
   drinking drivers in fatal crashes was compared before versus after
   implementing the .08 law using time-series analysis to evaluate 12 years
   of fatal crash data for Illinois and five bordering states. The results
   showed that the proportion of drinking drivers in fatal crashes
   decreased by 14% in Illinois and increased by 3% in bordering states.
   The proportion of drinking drivers in fatal crashes in Illinois, though
   increasing since 1995, was sharply reduced after passage of the .08 law
   in 1997, saving more than 100 lives in 1998 and 1999 than it would have
   without the .08 law. (C) 2002 National Safety Council and Elsevier

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine whether premenopausal social subordination in
   female monkeys predicts postmenopausal atherosclerosis, and whether any
   such effect is altered by chronic exposure to contraceptive steroids or
   postmenopausal hormone replacement.
   METHODS: One hundred seventy-seven (177) premenopausal cynomolgus
   monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) housed in social groups of five or six
   were fed an atherogenic diet that, for half of the animals, also
   contained an oral contraceptive (OC). Individuals were judged socially
   dominant or subordinate based on behavioral observations. After 26
   months animals were oophorectomized, biopsied for iliac atherosclerosis,
   and for the next 36 months were fed one of three atherogenic diets
   containing soy protein: 1) phytoestrogen-free; 2) phytoestrogens intact;
   and 3) phytoestrogen-free plus conjugated equine estrogens. Plasma
   lipids and menstrual cyclicity were also assessed. Finally, all animals
   were necropsied and the extent of atherosclerosis measured in the
   coronary and iliac arteries.
   RESULTS: The interaction of premenopausal social status and OC exposure
   predicted postmenopausal coronary artery atherosclerosis (P = .02).
   Subordinate animals not receiving OCs developed twice the coronary
   atherosclerosis of similarly untreated dominants (P < .01), an outcome
   mitigated by premenopausal OC exposure (P < .01). These effects occurred
   across postmenopausal treatment groups and independent of variation in
   plasma lipids. The same associations were observed in the iliac
   arteries, and, to a similar extent, both pre- and postmenopausally.
   Hormone data suggest that untreated premenopausal subordinates may have
   been estrogen deficient.
   CONCLUSION: Premenopausal social subordination exacerbates
   postmenopausal atherosclerosis, an effect possibly mediated by estrogen
   deficiency and shown here to be prevented by premenopausal OC exposure.
   These results occur irrespective of postmenopausal treatment. &COPY;

AB This article explores the tension between the population genetics and
   sociobiological approaches to the study of evolution. Whereas population
   geneticists. like Stanford's Marc Feldman, insist that the genetic
   complexities of organisms cannot be overlooked, sociobiologists (many of
   whom now prefer to call themselves "behavioral ecologists") rely on
   optimization models that are based on the simplest possible genetics.
   These optimization approaches have their roots in the classical result
   known as the fundamental theorem of natural selection, formulated by R.
   A. Fisher in 1930. From the start there was great uncertainty over the
   proper interpretation of Fisher's theorem, which became confused with
   Sewall Wrights immensely influential adaptive landscape concept. In the
   1960s, a new generation of mathematical biologists proved that Fisher's
   theorem did not hold when fitness depended on more than one locus.
   Similar reasoning was used to attack W D. Hamilton's inclusive fitness
   theory. A new theory, known as the theory of long-term evolution,
   attempts to reconcile the rigorous population genetics approach with the
   long-standing sociobiological view that natural selection acts to
   increase the fitness of organisms.

   Results: More education was associated with higher income (p <.001), and
   higher income was associated with better physical health (p <.001) and
   psychological outcomes (P <.001). The effects of income on both mental
   and physical health were mediated by sleep quality (p values <.01), and
   sleep quantity was related to both measures of health (p values <.01)

   from the annual frequencies of publications in various disciplines that
   use the concept of sustainable development as well as from a content
   analysis of documents. The article concludes that the surge was
   characterized by the use by scientists of established concepts in a new
   way, a form of cultural emergence; a prevailing locus of interaction
   revolving around a professional ideology; the prevalence of the emotions
   of fear and hope of deliverance from the threat; and an international
   arena of discourse occurring over a period of years and bounded by
   class-professional identities. The article demonstrates that a newer
   understanding of fads as collective surges in the sociology specialty
   area of collective behavior helps describe the use in the sciences of
   the concept of sustainable development during the late 1980s and 1990s.
   The surge is relatively short-lived, coterminous with the use of
   different meanings and practices of sustainable development. It cannot
   be understood as a superficial, odd, inconsequential, or frivolous
   event. Rather, it had important, lasting consequences in a number of
   areas, from economic and social development to professions.

AB Academic debates can be entertaining and even useful, but they can also
   have drawbacks. The present debate has at least three of them. First,
   despite out ability to discern differing central tendencies between
   "environmental'' and "resource'' sociology, the excitement of a debate
   can cause such modest differences to be exaggerated, potentially being
   reified into a "divide." Second, only a limited number of social
   scientists are studying resource/environmental issues, even today, so
   any researcher attention that is focused on navel gazing-or worse, navel
   warfare-is being diverted away from the research topics themselves.
   Third and most disturbingly, as human impacts on the environment grow
   more pervasive, we are likely to see an increasing number of cases where
   problems involve both "resource'' and "environmental'' issues,
   simultaneously. The true need is thus not to argue about differences-or
   to create them-but instead to develop synergies across differing points
   of view.

AB Natural resource sociology and environmental sociology have different
   historical roots, organizational identities, institutional bases of
   support, and scholarly orientations, yet both share a common concern
   with understanding the environmental bases of human societies.
   Differences as well as similarities between the research foci of the two
   fields are illustrated by distinguishing between three fundamental
   functions that ecosystems serve for human societies: supply depot, waste
   repository, and living space. While natural resource sociologists pay
   relatively greater attention to the supply depot function (ecosystems as
   the source of natural resources), their work inevitably touches on the
   other two functions as well and therefore is not necessarily narrower in
   focus than that of environmental sociologists. Yet, despite their common
   concerns, the differing bases of support, orientations, and clienteles
   for the two fields suggest that there is good reason for both to retain
   their separate identities.

AB Eighteenth-century Japanese Samurai wisdom dictates that it is a bad
   thing when one thing becomes two. This wisdom is an organizing premise:
   The distinction between environmental sociology and sociology of natural
   resources is artificial and counterproductive. Distinctions between
   these subdisciplines are described as "trainedincapacities'' resulting
   from specialized training that narrows scientists' range of perception
   and reduces their effectiveness. The analysis uses the concept of
   postnormal science to illustrate that many modern environmental problems
   are too complex and ambiguous for science alone to solve. Specifically,
   the ordinary practice of science is unprepared to include significant
   uncertainties and cultural values in analyses. We argue for a merging of
   subdisciplines to create a new "lifescience'' that reaffirms a
   commitment to understanding how social forces interact with biological
   forces and the physical environment.

AB In the course of implementing plans for sustainable development,
   sociologists in developing countries use ideas from natural resource
   sociology rather than from environmental sociology. They draw upon these
   ideas as employees of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) who manage
   integrated conservation and development programs (ICDPs). Beginning in
   the 1980s, donors provided funds for ICDPs, so scientists created NGOs
   to carry out the projects and hired colleagues to do the work. Because
   ICDPs aim to help poor people acquire, manage, and conserve natural
   resources, their design and implementation require that NGO staff engage
   with the core issues in natural resource sociology. Donors have not
   supported projects in areas like environment justice that draw upon the
   expertise of environmental sociologists, so NGOs that practice
   environmental sociology have not emerged. Urbanization and increased
   local-level mobilization around pollution issues may increase the
   opportunities for doing environmental sociology in the developing world
   in the near future.

AB In response to the Field et al. (2001) and Buttel (2001) argument that
   there are distinct patterns that distinguish natural resource and

   multiparadigmatic social science and is occurring across other
   ecological social sciences. In this article I briefly review current
   debates among anthropologists and human geographers to illustrate the
   transdisciplinary relevance of the natural resource and environmental
   sociology division and to suggest approaches that integrate this divide
   and also provide bridges to other ecological social sciences. The
   "bridging'' areas I discuss include political ecology, community
   conservation, and sustainable livelihoods. Natural
   resource/environmental sociologists have much to learn from engaging the
   works of each other and from other social and natural scientists.

AB This paper examines how certain cultural arguments gain the authority
   necessary to explain the social problem of domestic violence. I begin by
   demonstrating the existence of competing explanations for the question
   of why abusive relationships continue. I find that a certain kind of
   explanation, multiple victimization arguments that emphasize the
   numerous ways battered women are victimized, are most common. Through an
   analysis of social science citations, news papers, and legislative and
   judicial decisions, I conclude that one multiple victimization argument
   in particular Lenore Walker's battered woman svndrome (Walker, 1979, The
   Battered Woman. New York: Harper Row; Walker, 1984, The Battered Woman
   Syndrome. New York: Springer), has become the most recognized
   explanation for why abusive relationships continue. The syndrome was
   best able to meet the criteria necessary, for gaining cultural
   authority, put forth by, Schudson (1989, Theory, and Society,
   18:153180): retrievability, rhetorical force, resonance, resolution, and
   institutional retention. In recent,ears, however this authority, has
   been threatened as social and cultural conditions have changed, leaving
   competing understandings of the domestic violence issue to challenge
   Walker's claims.

AB Are the politics of economic regulation contingent on institutions?
   Drawing on arguments about institutional mediation and the institutional
   bases of rational action, we explore how institutions shape the dynamics
   invoked in two theories of regulation. We argue that institutional
   arrangements affect both the clarity and the content of group interests
   in regulation. Event history analyses of U.S.. states' passage of fire
   insurance regulation from 1906 to 1930 support these arguments in
   several ways. Market-heterogeneity dynamics specified by cartel-capture
   theory affected the passage of regulation only under some
   conditions-namely, relatively depoliticized settings with little overt
   conflict or uncertainty about policy outcomes. In addition, interest
   group dynamics were conditioned by the consolidation of
   interorganizational fields around a particular model of market order,
   which allowed divergent interest groups to converge in support of
   regulation. The research suggests ways of thinking about theoretical
   generality and specificity, regulatory politics, and the relationship
   between institutional theory and rationality.

AB Can one explain both the resilience of the status quo and the
   possibility for resistance from a subordinate position? This paper aims
   to resolve these seemingly incompatible perspectives. By extending
   Randall Collins's interaction ritual theory, and synthesizing it with
   Norbert Wiley's model of the self this paper suggests how the emotional
   dynamics between people and within the self can explain social inertia
   as well as the possibility for resistance and change. Diverging from
   literature on the sociology of emotions that has been concerned with
   individual emotional processes, this paper considers the collective
   level in order to explore how movement action is motivated. The
   emotional dynamics of subordinate positioning that limit women's options
   in face-to-face interactions are examined, as are the social processes
   of developing feminist consciousness and a willingness to participate in
   resistance work. Pointing toward empirical applications, I conclude by
   suggesting conditions where resistance is likely.

AB Compelling epidemiological evidence showing a significant association
   between lack of male circumcision and HIV infection has prompted calls
   for consideration of male circumcision interventions as a strategy for
   reducing HIV prevalence in highly affected areas where circumcision is
   little practiced and transmission is predominantly heterosexual. Little
   is known about whether male circumcision interventions would be
   acceptable or feasible in traditionally non-circumcisng areas of Africa.
   This study assesses the acceptability of male circumcision in the Luo, a
   large, traditionally non-circumcising ethnic group in western Kenya.
   Separate focused group discussions with adult Luo men and women and
   semi-structured interviews with clinicians were conducted in Nyanza
   Province, Kenya. The primary barriers to acceptance of male circumcision
   were cultural identification, fear of pain and excessive bleeding and
   cost. The main facilitators were association of male circumcision with
   better hygiene and reduced risk of infection. Both men and women were
   eager for promotion of genital hygiene and male circumcision, and they
   desired availability of circumcision clinical services in the Province's
   health facilities. Clinicians lacked the knowledge and resources to
   offer safe circumcision counselling and services. If results from this
   study are valid for other areas of sub-Saharan Africa, acceptability of
   male circumcision as a means to reduce STDs and HIV is higher than
   previously suspected. Further studies are needed in other regions to
   assess the feasibility of introducing acceptable male circumcision
   information and services to reduce HIV transmission.

   Methods: The data for this paper were derived from sources including the
   US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute on
   Drug Abuse. Results: The number of individuals on public assistance has
   decreased in the years following implementation of welfare reform
   legislation. Factors relevant to transitioning welfare recipients into
   the workplace, such as transportation and childcare, have special
   ramifications for the drub using population, Additionally, these
   individuals require treatment for their addictions in order to become
   employable. The issue of concern is that recipients may be deterred from
   seeking benefits by various provisions of welfare reform legislation and
   turn instead to other sources (including illicit activities) for
   sustenance. Conclusions: Welfare caseloads have been dropping over the
   past two years. However, the number of substance abusers continues to
   rise. It is not known in what ways welfare reform will affect substance
   abusers who are welfare recipients. Important policy issues arise from
   this nexus; it is argued that these issues will require careful
   investigation.

AB The predictive validity of a treatment readiness measure designed for

   severity, perceived need for formal treatment, motivation for treatment,
   and negative attitudes toward treatment is examined using data from a
   National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)funded HIV outreach intervention
   in San Antonio, Texas. Logistic regression is used to predict use of
   substance abuse treatment services three months after program intake on
   the basis of readiness scores, controlling for demographic and drug
   history variables. Analyses of data from 673 drug users in an HIV
   outreach intervention indicated that treatment readiness dimensions
   accounted for a 12% increase in variation in "use of any modality" and
   14% for "use or attempted service use". Only Motivation to Quit was a
   significant predictor of "use of any modality" and both Perceived Need
   for Treatment and Motivation to Quit were significant predictors of "use
   or attempted use". Findings support the importance of the individual's
   perception of "readiness" to change their substance-abusing behavior and
   enter treatment.

   making the transition to more public-health-oriented, community-based

   Traditional, academically based, randomized clinical trials test an
   intervention against a placebo or alternate treatment control condition,
   focusing on a single, specific main outcome. Community-based
   intervention trials also test a treatment intervention but in the
   context of the community environment. These trials, in order to provide
   meaningful information for community clinical practice, must take into
   account many factors that are controlled or are not considered in
   traditional clinical trials.
   Investigators need to be clear about the goal of community-based
   interventions; they need to determine the social and cultural norms,
   expectations, and conflicts of the community and of the setting, and
   they need to work collaboratively with experts in both qualitative and

AB Despite the interest in the death penalty, no statistical studies have
   isolated the social and political forces that account for the legality
   of this punishment. Racial or ethnic threat theories suggest that the
   death penalty will more likely be legal in jurisdictions with relatively
   large black or Hispanic populations. Economic threat explanations
   suggest that this punishment will be present in unequal areas.
   Jurisdictions with a more conservative public or a stronger
   law-and-order Republican party should be more likely to legalize the
   death penalty as well. After controlling for social disorganization,
   region, period, and violent crime, panel analyses suggest that minority
   presence and economic inequality enhance the likelihood of a legal death
   penalty. Conservative values and Republican strength in the legislature
   have equivalent effects. A supplemental time-to-event analysis supports
   these conclusions. The results suggest that a political approach has
   explanatory power because threat effects expressed through politics and
   effects that are directly political invariably account for decisions
   about the legality of capital punishment.

AB Objective: To compare the utilization and outcomes of critical care
   services in a cohort of hospitals in the United States and Japan.
   Design: Prospective data collection on 5,107 patients and detailed
   organizational characteristics from each of the participating Japanese
   study hospitals between 1993 and 1995, with comparisons made to
   prospectively collected data on the 17,440 patients included in the US
   APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) III database.
   Setting: Twenty-two Japanese and 40 US hospitals.
   Patients: Consecutive, unselected patients from medical, surgical, and
   mixed medical/ surgical ICUs.
   Measurements: Severity of illness, predicted risk of in-hospital death,
   and ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) were assessed using APACHE
   III. Japanese ICU directors completed a detailed survey describing their
   units. Main results: US and Japanese ICUs have a similar array of
   modalities available for care. Only 1.0% (range, 0.56 to 2.7%) of beds
   in Japanese hospitals were designated as ICUs. The organization of the
   Japanese and US ICUs varied by hospital, but Japanese ICUs were more
   likely to be organized to care for heterogeneous diagnostic populations.
   Sample case-mix differences reflect different disease prevalence. ICU
   utilization for women is significantly lower (35.5% vs 44.8% of
   patients) and there were relatively fewer patients : 85 years old in the
   Japanese ICU cohort (1.2% vs 4.6%), despite a higher per capita rate of
   individuals : 85 years old in Japan. The utilization of ICUs for
   patients at low risk of death significantly less in Japan (10.2%) than
   in the United States (12.9%). The APACHE III score stratified patient
   risk. Overall mortality was similar in both national samples after
   accounting for differences in hospital LOS, utilizing a model that was
   highly discriminating (receiver operating characteristic, 0.87) when
   applied to the Japanese sample. The application of a US-based mortality
   model to a Japanese sample overpredicted mortality across all but the
   highest (>90%) deciles of risk. Significant variation in expected
   performance was noted between hospitals. Risk-adjusted ICU LOS was not
   significantly longer in Japan; however, total hospital stay was nearly
   twice that found in the US hospitals, reflecting differences in hospital
   utilization philosophies.
   Conclusions: Similar high-technology critical care is available in both
   countries. Variations in ICU utilization reflect differences in case-mix
   and bed availability. Japanese ICU utilization by gender reflects
   differences in disease prevalence, whereas differences in utilization by
   age may reflect differences in cultural norms regarding the limits of
   care. Such differences provide context from which to assess die delivery
   of care across international borders. Miscalibration of predictive
   models applied to international data samples highlight the impact that
   differences in resource use and local practice cultures have on
   outcomes. Models may require modification in order to account for these
   differences. Nevertheless, with large databases, it is possible to
   assess critical care delivery systems between countries accounting for
   differences in case-mix, severity of illness, and cultural normative
   standards facilitating the design and management such systems.

AB BACKGROUND: To reduce the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in
   the community, physicians must optimize their use of antibiotics.
   However, optimal use from the perspective of the community (reserving
   newer agents for future use) is not always consistent with optimal use
   from the perspective of the individual patient (prescribing newer,
   broader agents).
   OBJECTIVES: To identify preferred patterns of antibiotic prescribing for
   patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), measure explicit
   attitudes toward antibiotics and antibiotic resistance, and determine
   the relationship between these prescribing patterns and attitudes.
   DESIGN. Cross-sectional anonymous mail survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: National random sample of 400 generalist physicians
   (general internal medicine and family practice) and 429 Infectious
   diseases specialists.
   MEASUREMENTS: Rank ordering of antibiotic preferences for a hypothetical
   outpatient with CAP and reasons for antibiotic selection. Endorsement of
   attitudes regarding antibiotic prescribing decisions and resistance.
   RESULTS: Both generalists and infectious diseases specialists were more
   likely to prefer newer, broader drugs for the treatment of CAP compared
   to older agents still recommended by national guidelines. Physicians
   rated the issue of contributing to antibiotic resistance lowest among 7
   determinants of their choices.
   CONCLUSIONS: Despite national guidelines and increasing public
   awareness, the public health concern of contributing to the problem of
   antibiotic resistance does not exert a strong impact on physician
   prescribing decisions for CAP. Future efforts to optimize antibiotic
   prescribing decisions will need to consider options for increasing the
   impact of public health issues on the patient-oriented decisions of
   individual physicians.

AB BACKGROUND: African-American and low-income women have lower rates of
   cancer screening and higher rates of late-stage disease than do their
   counterparts. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of primary care, health
   insurance, and HMO participation on adherence to regular breast,
   cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN: Random-digit-dial and
   targeted household telephone survey of a population-based sample.
   SETTING: Washington, D.C. census tracts with gtoreq30% of households
   below 200% of federal poverty threshold. PARTICIPANTS: Included in the
   survey were 1,205 women over age 40, 82% of whom were African American.
   MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence was defined as reported receipt of the
   last 2 screening tests within recommended intervals for age. RESULTS:
   The survey completion rate was 85%. Overall, 75% of respondents were
   adherent to regular Pap smears, 66% to clinical breast exams, 65% to
   mammography, and 29% to fecal occult blood test recommendations.
   Continuity with a single primary care practitioner, comprehensive
   service delivery, and higher patient satisfaction with the relationships
   with primary care practitioners were associated with higher adherence
   across the 4 screening tests, after considering other factors.
   Coordination of care also was associated with screening adherence for
   women age 65 and over, but not for the younger women. Compared with
   counterparts in non-HMO plans, women enrolled in health maintenance
   organizations were also more likely to be adherent to regular screening
   (e.g., Pap, odds ratio (OR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11 to
   3.17; clinical breast exam, OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.21 to 3.44; mammogram, OR
   1.95, 95% CI 1.15 to 3.31; fecal occult blood test, OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.01
   to 2.83.). CONCLUSIONS: Organizing healthcare services to promote
   continuity with a specific primary care clinician, a comprehensive array
   of services available at the primary care delivery site, coordination
   among providers, and better patient-practitioner relationships are
   likely to improve innercity, low-income women's adherence to cancer
   screening recommendations.

AB The goal of this paper was to understand differences in the recreational
   fishing behavior of African-American, Mexican-American. and Anglo
   anglers in Texas. Hypotheses about different behaviors in recreational
   fishing were generated from documented differences in the cultural
   patterns of these groups as well as alternative theories of outdoor
   recreation behavior, Data from four Texas statewide angler surveys were
   used to test hypotheses. Twelve measures of participation were
   identified as subject to racial and ethnic differentiation. Except for
   the rate of licensed participation, only males were included in group
   comparisons because of the limited sample size of minority female
   anglers. Results indicated significant differences among racial and
   ethnic groups for 10 participation variables, all of which were
   generally consistent with what was expected from previous research.
   Anglo males were more likely than all other racial and gender groups
   (African-American males, African-American females. and the "Other" males
   and "Other" females groups) to participate in licensed recreational
   fishing. Additionally, Anglo males were more likely than
   African-American or Mexican-American males to have started fishing it an
   earlier age, to have more years of fishing experience, to live in a
   household with a powerboat, ill fish more days from a boat, to belong to
   a fishing club or organization, to fish in tournaments, and to have less
   varied species preferences, Differences in terms of with whom minority
   anglers fished most often were significant in two studies. Whereas all
   groups fished most often in group consisting of family and friends,
   African-American males fished alone to a greater extent than
   anticipated. For one of the years examined, there was a difference among
   groups in total annual days of fishing. the African-American males
   fished more days than expected that year. Wherever resources and
   programs are implemented. racial and ethnic adaptations will need to be
   considered by managers to every extent possible. More research that
   seeks to understand the extent of differences among various angler
   subpopulations in various regions of the United States is needed if
   managers expect to meet current and future angler needs.

AB Public opinion polls reliably find a disparity between people's views of
   the state of their own communities and of the nation in general. This
   discrepancy, frequently called the Optimism Gap, is often attributed to
   the fact that people have personal knowledge of things around them, but
   derive their larger world-view from media sources such as television,
   which tend to over emphasize the negative, risky aspects of life. This
   study explores this Premise, as well as the possibility that emotional
   factors such as depression, anxiety, and anger also play a role. Data
   from 171 participants were analysed. Overall, people rated problems in
   the nation in general as more severe than those in their own
   communities. Television exposure was predictive of ratings of problems
   nationwide, but not of problems in respondents' own communities, while
   attention paid to the television news was related to ratings of national
   and community problems. Depression, irrational beliefs, and anger
   arousal were all related to ratings of problems in the nation in
   general, while anger arousal and optimism were predictive of ratings of
   problems in respondents' own communities. These findings suggest that
   the links between television news exposure and mental health should be
   explored further. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

AB The sociology departments in the Nordic countries provide the
   institutional platform for Nordic Sociology and for the Nordic national
   sociological associations that form the Scandinavian Sociological
   Association. This paper focuses on journal articles produced by current
   (as of 1 January 2001) faculty of 16 of these Nordic Sociology
   departments in the period 1981-2000. First, we provide a brief overview
   of article productivity and citations to articles produced in this
   period by country and department. Second, we estimate a multilevel model
   of citation patterns by articles published, the academic position and
   productivity of each author, and the structure and productivity of each
   department as a whole. Third, we test the extent to which the effects of
   such factors differ between departments and individuals. In all
   departments, publications in high-impact journals increase the number of
   citations to any given article, to other work of the same author, and to
   the work of other faculty in the department. The effect of publishing in
   high-impact journals differs significantly between individual authors,
   and work in certain types of journals yields more citations than the
   journal impact factor would predict. We argue that departmental
   affiliations with outside faculty and departmental productivity can be
   seen as a form of social capital that benefits both individuals and
   departments as a whole. These findings strongly suggest that diversity
   is a defining characteristic of this sociological community, precluding
   monolithic definitions of Nordic sociology.

AB It was hypothesized that marriage duration affects physical and cultural
   homogamy and spousal concordance in Kuwaiti marriages. Westernization
   increased spousal correlations due to fewer arranged marriages and
   increased individual spousal choice. Spousal similarities for selected
   physical and cultural traits were also examined for couples married 15
   years or less, 16 to 30 years, and 31 years and more. Consanguineous
   couples belong to the al-Kandari, one of the largest and most important
   kindreds in Kuwait, who traditionally married kin and continue to do so.
   Six physical measurements and blood pressure were taken along with a
   sociocultural questionnaire to examine cultural preferences. In all, 242
   couples (484 people) participated; 62 couples were in non-consanguineous
   unions. It was hypotheised that in shorter-duration unions spouses would
   be more alike for physical and cultural traits. For physical traits,
   results for stature. weight, the body mass index, and hip circumference
   are congruent with the hypothesis, whereas results for the triceps and
   subscapular skinfolds, waist circumference, and systolic and diastolic
   blood pressure are not. Overall, for some traits spouses are more alike
   than in previous generations, and specific aspects of similarity among
   long-term spouses reflect historical and cultural phenomena. Am. J. Hum.

AB This article proposes an approach to studying the formal properties of
   the belief systems of groups. Belief systems may be quantified in terms
   of their degree of consensus (the degree to which all group members
   agree) and their degree of "tightness" (the degree to which holding some
   belief implies holding or not holding other beliefs). Two theoretical
   claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal
   properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to
   produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of
   authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The
   clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as
   an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order
   translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs.
   These claims are tested with data on 44 naturally occurring communities.

AB Primary objectives: The purposes of the study are to assess the growth
   status of urban Mexican children living in different geographic areas of
   the country, to estimate the prevalence of overweight and obesity, and
   to explore secular trends in body size. Design: Cross-sectional surveys
   of 293 children 6-11 years from Sonora in the north-west of the country
   (155 boys, 138 girls), and 356 children 7-12 years from Veracruz on the
   Gulf Coast (194 boys, 162 girls) were undertaken in 1992 and 1993,
   respectively. Procedures: Height and weight were measured; the body mass
   index (BMI, kg m-2) was calculated. Growth status was compared to USA
   reference data and to samples of Mexican children in 1926 and 1975. The
   prevalence of overweight (BMIgtoreq85th and <95th percentiles) and
   obesity (BMIgtoreq95th percentile) was estimated. Results: Girls and
   boys from Sonora and Veracruz do not differ in height, weight and the
   BMI. Mean heights are at (girls) or below (boys) the medians of USA
   growth charts, while mean weights are at (boys) or just below (girls)
   the 75th percentiles at most ages. As a result, mean BMIs are above
   (boys) and below (girls) the 75th percentiles over the age range
   studied. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is 40% in boys and 35%
   in girls, whereas the prevalence of obesity per se is 23% in boys and
   17% in girls. Compared to urban Mexican children in the Federal District
   surveyed in 1926, children in the present sample are taller and heavier,
   but the secular trend in body weight is more pronounced since the
   mid-1960s. Heights of the current samples are similar to those of
   well-off children in Mexico City in the early 1970s, but weights are
   heavier. Conclusions: The gap in height between well-off and lower
   socioeconomic status chidren in different regions of Mexico has been
   reduced, but there is an increase in the prevalence of overweight and
   obesity.

AB The standard for what passes as scientific sociology is derived from
   classical physics, a model of natural science that is totally
   inappropriate for sociology. As a consequence, we pursue goals and use
   criteria for success that are harmful and counterproductive. Even those
   dismissing such efforts use the standards of physics as grounds for
   their objection. Although recognizing that no natural science can serve
   as an automatic template for our work, we suggest that Darwin's work on
   evolution provides a far more applicable model for linking theory and
   research since he dealt with obstacles far more similar to our own. This
   includes drawing rigorous conclusions based on observational data rather
   than true experiments; an ability to absorb enormous amounts of diverse
   data into a relatively simple system that did not include a large number
   of what we think of as independent variables; the absence of prediction
   as a standard for evaluating the adequacy of a theory; and the ability
   to use a theory that is incomplete in both the evidence that supports it
   and in its development. Other sciences are briefly cited as well, but
   the main emphasis is on the lessons that Darwin provides for social
   sciences such as sociology that obtain their evidence primarily from
   non-experimental sources.

AB Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among
   variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as
   interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response
   to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how
   simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but
   enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information,
   emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in
   collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly
   and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in
   revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide
   theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than
   the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the
   emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical
   model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a
   brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in
   computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs
   fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We
   then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social
   structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology
   has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new
   methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the
   papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social
   networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs
   are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological
   theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology,
   social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with
   a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological
   potential of this approach.

   understanding of the impact of development and privatization on
   international environmental protection with the focus on balancing
   social and economic performance for the affected organizations and
   communities. More specifically, supported by a database of worldwide,
   regional, and country studies from 1991 to 2000, it is proposed that the
   role of development and privatization in environmental administration in
   the international context has negative as well as positive consequences.
   Moreover, the negative consequences are often masked or go undetected
   because the effectiveness of development and privatization is based
   primarily on economic performance. Thus, to obtain a more accurate and
   realistic determination of the effectiveness of development and
   privatization, measures of social as well as economic performance and
   the overall effect on the natural environment should be considered.

   younger, better educated, and had less time in their profession than
   white males, and they most often held public or private nonprofit
   positions. Minorities were older and less educated than women or white
   males. Compared to white males, there was a considerably higher
   proportion of minorities and a lower proportion of females in higher
   income categories (above USdollar sign50,000 per year). We describe the
   profession's demographics and discuss reasons for and implications of a
   relative lack of diversity in this profession.

AB Although generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common disorder
   associated with significant levels of morbidity, little is known of its
   long-term course and outcomes. During the first 5 years, GAD follows a
   chronic course with low rates of remission and moderate rates of
   relapse/recurrence following remission. Retrospective studies suggest
   that this chronic pattern may last up to 20 years. It is hoped that, as
   with depression, long-term prospective studies in GAD will provide
   insight into the course, nature, and outcomes of the disorder over time.
   The studies will also identify any changes in the duration and severity
   of episodes of GAD over time, enabling treatments to effectively reflect
   the course of the disorder. Studies of other anxiety disorders and
   depression suggest that the course and outcome of the disorder may be
   influenced by certain factors such as stressful life events, anxiety
   sensitivity/negative affect, gender, subsyndromal symptoms, and comorbid
   disorders. Currently, studies are underway to determine the effects of
   these factors on the risk of relapse/recurrence, maintenance of full
   symptoms, and development of subsyndromal symptoms in GAD. GAD is
   currently underrecognized and undertreated, but it is hoped that this
   will change with the ever-increasing awareness of anxiety disorders. As
   treatment for GAD becomes more common, future prospective studies will
   identify the effect of therapy on the course and nature of the disorder,
   leading to increased understanding of GAD and the development of
   effective treatment strategies tailored for individual patients.

AB Students of today need to be aware of the risks and benefits of
   biotechnology to make intelligent decisions regarding this science for
   themselves and future generations. The objectives of this research were
   to determine students' knowledge of biotechnology and their general
   attitudes and perceptions regarding different aspects of biotechnology,
   and to examine relationships between knowledge and attitudes regarding
   biotechnology. More than 3000 undergraduate students were surveyed from
   a variety of undergraduate courses at Texas A & M University in College
   Station, TX, during the 1997-1998 academic year on their knowledge,
   attitudes, and perceptions toward biotechnology. Information sought
   included students' knowledge regarding recent applications of
   biotechnology, agreement of disagreement with statements concerning
   different aspects and applications of biotechnology, and demographic
   information. Findings indicated that despite a low awareness or
   knowledge of biotechnology, students were accepting of specific
   applications or products of biotechnology. Those products viewed as
   beneficial without involving animals had the highest acceptance levels.
   Findings also indicated that a greater knowledge of biotechnology
   correlated with a more favorable attitude toward biotechnology.
   Demographic variables were studied to determine their impact on
   variables of interest. Females were found to be less accepting of
   biotechnology, while individuals identifying themselves as scientists
   were found to be more accepting than those self-perceived as
   nonscientists. Females majoring in education were found to be the least
   accepting of biotechnology than all other groups involved in the study.
   Overall, students had a low knowledge of biotechnology and more
   respondents tended to reject biotechnology than embrace it.

AB We analyzed forest clearing and regrowth over a 23-year time period for
   21 forest concession and management units within the Maya Biosphere
   Reserve (MBR), Guatemala. The study area as a whole experienced a
   clearing rate of 0.16%/year from 1974 through 1997. The overall clearing
   rate appears rather low when averaged over the entire study area over 23
   years because most of the reserve was inaccessible. However, despite the
   granting of legal protection to the MBR in 1990, clearing rates
   continued to rise, with the highest rates occurring in the most recent
   time period in the analysis, 1995 to 1997. Higher rates of clearing
   relative to regrowth occurred in newly established communities and in
   the Reserve's buffer zone, where the clearing of high forest was
   preferred for pasture development. Exploratory models were built and
   analyzed to examine the effects of various landscape variables on forest
   clearing. The different units in the analysis showed different
   relationships of forest clearing with variables such as forest cover
   type and distance to access (roads and river corridors). Where
   available, socio-economic household survey data helped to explain
   patterns and trends observed in the time series Landsat imagery. A
   strong relationship between forest clearing and distance to access was
   demonstrated. More clearing occurred further from roads during later
   time periods as farmers moved deeper into the forest to find land to
   clear. Communities inside the MBR that were less dependent on farming
   had forest clearing to regrowth ratios of one: one or less. These
   communities used fallow fields in greater proportions than communities
   in the Reserve's buffer zone. General trends in clearing by forest cover
   type suggest a preference for clearing high forest (bosque alto) types
   found on the higher elevation, better-drained soils, and fallow fields,
   and an avoidance of low-lying, seasonally flooded terrain (bajos).
   Satellite remote sensing observations of forest clearing and regrowth
   patterns can provide an objective source of information to complement
   socio-economic studies of the human driving forces in land cover and
   land use change.

   specific example the disease of AIDS; and as a specific analytic tool
   selections of fictional writing. An introductory rationale explores why
   literature may be well-suited to helping us understand value-laden
   issues such as relationship. Discussion then focuses on how the
   professional and personal Self is identified and defined in relation to
   the suffering Other, through the development of concepts such as threat
   and boundary work. The concluding section suggests alternative
   relational models derived from more fluid and permeable definitions of
   Self and Other. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier

AB The stability of home environment in families of children with severe
   disabilities was investigated. Sixty-four families were assessed at
   three time points regarding aspects of their home environment. Family
   environment scale, home quality rating scale (HQRS) and home observation
   for measurement of the environment scores were collected at 7 and 9
   years after the initial assessment. A remarkable degree of stability was
   observed, particularly for the FES. The median change score was zero for
   most subscales; no correlations differed significantly between the 7-
   and 9-year retests. A repeated measures MANOVA found a significant
   change in scores over time for only one subscale of the HQRS but none of
   the 10 FES subscales. Results suggest that, for the FES, administration
   of these measures every 2 years, perhaps less often, would be sufficient
   in longitudinal studies of this population. Internal consistency
   reliability of the FES was lower for these families than in the
   standardization samples, emphasizing the need to validate measures used
   with special populations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

AB Recent changes in the organizational culture of nonhuman animal
   sheltering, coupled with attitudes that are more progressive toward
   companion animals, have made shelters into resources rather than last
   resorts. Consequently, shelter workers need the "people skills" to
   communicate to a public that urgently needs accurate information about
   animal behavior and training. This poses a difficulty for workers drawn
   to working with animals but who find themselves working with people.
   Based on participant observation and informed by social psychology and
   the sociology of emotions, this study articulates three primary
   dimensions of shelter workers' interactions with clients: (a) Narrative
   Knowing, (b) Emotion Management, and (c) Deference. From the analysis of
   these dimensions, the paper then draws conclusions about the individual
   costs of shelter work and suggests practical steps that workers and
   animal care organizations could take to recognize and reduce these
   costs.

AB What does the rise of organic food as a social phenomenon mean
   politically? What political impact does this form of consumption have on
   society? Is it a small and unimportant "blip," in the overall march of
   globalized, industrialized food and rationalized consumption systems. Is
   it even, perhaps, complicit in this process? Or is it a radical break ?
   The array of answers to these questions forms the
   "production-consumption debate" currently taking place in the
   examination of agro-food systems. If agro-food networks are
   conceptualized as interactive, socio-ecological metabolic circuits
   linking agricultural nature, social labor, the corporeal and the
   symbolic, then this paper argues that analytical concern in agro-food
   studies has focused overwhelmingly on the production 'moment' in these
   circuits. Despite the lessons of numerous 'food scares', anti-GMO
   movements and the mad cow disease pandemic, an asymmetry now holds sway
   in agro-food studies between production and consumption even though in
   other fields, as Jackson (1999) notes, consumption has been "duly
   'acknowledged" (p. 95). As this asymmetry is addressed, a contemporary
   reformulation of the 'agrarian question' might investigate the potential
   for new forms of progressive food politics, ranging from 'weak'
   struggles over the modes of social orderings, such as knowledge systems,
   to more formal alliances between producers and consumers.

   Atlanta Sociological Laboratory and the findings indicate, per Bulmer's

AB Changes in U.S. environmental policy direction under the Bush
   Administration reflect two interdependent trends that have emerged over
   the past two decades: an increased capability among corporations to
   shape public policy to benefit their narrow interests, and a marked
   decline in the efficacy of democratic forces to defend progressive
   environmental policy. This article theorizes key aspects of
   antienvironmental thought and practice-facets include scientific
   production, civil-political societal relations, interclass coalition
   building, procorporate propaganda, and domination of opposition-to
   demonstrate the existence of a coordinated countermovement. The theory
   is guided by a political sociology adapted from the method of Antonio
   Gramsci that comprehends policymaking in terms of material interests
   without reducing human agency to structural imperative. Evidence
   marshaled to support the theory is gathered from the antienvironmental
   literature, public relations product, and information on political and
   economic affiliations between and among antienvironmentalists and their
   organizations.

AB Until recently, the emotional experiences of women in prison have been
   overlooked by symbolic interactionists and social scientists. Similarly,
   research relevant to the sociology of emotions has not been explored in
   the social context of a correctional institution for women. The purpose
   of this study is to investigate emotional experiences from the unique
   perspective of incarcerated women. This research examines how women in
   prison perceive and manage their emotional lives while confined and asks
   whether their chosen strategies have an impact on their interactions and
   thus affect the institutional environment. Data were collected through
   in-depth interviews with thirty-five women incarcerated in a
   correctional institution located in the midwestern United States. Using
   a semistructured interview schedule, respondents were asked about a
   range of topics, one of which involved their emotional lives while
   incarcerated, Findings indicate these women define their emotional
   experiences as being simultaneously provocative and constrained.
   Respondents suggest that their emotional resources are individually,
   contextually, and culturally grounded. They discuss employing various
   strategies to manage their emotional lives while incarcerated, including
   diversions, spiritual pursuits, blocking exercises, self-reflection, and
   humor. The majority of the techniques employed to control emotions are
   intrapersonal. Respondents describe personal efforts designed to manage
   their emotional experiences rather than share their feelings with
   others.
