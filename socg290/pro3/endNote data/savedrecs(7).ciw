AB Previous research on capstones in sociology and psychology has suggested
   that there is a typical capstone experience required by three quarters
   of all four-year colleges and universities in the United States. This
   article reports results from a national survey that confirm that
   sociology and psychology capstone courses conform generally to a common
   format. The findings further indicate that factors related to student
   limits and time limits predominate with respect to those variables that
   produce less successful course outcomes. A review of the social science
   capstone literature and the pedagogical best practices literature
   suggests that student limitations and time limitations can be attenuated
   by curricular, structural, and resource-allocation changes.

AB The increasing ubiquity of PowerPoint in the university classroom raises
   complex questions about pedagogy and the creation of dynamic and
   effective learning environments. Though much of the sociological
   teaching literature has focused on engagement and active learning, very
   little of this work has addressed the presence of PowerPoint in
   sociology classrooms. Teaching sociology requires discussion, critical
   thinking, and debate-characteristics many critics argue are at odds with
   PowerPoint's unique presentation style. Utilizing survey data from
   faculty and students at a private university, this research explores
   PowerPoint usage and the many ways it influences the learning
   environment of the sociology classroom.

AB The Atlanta Sociological Laboratory is the moniker bestowed on scholars
   engaged in sociological research at Atlanta University between 1895 and
   1924. Under the leadership of W. E. B. Du Bois, 1897-1914, this school
   made substantive yet marginalized contributions to the discipline. Its
   accomplishments include, but are not limited to, its establishment of
   the first American school of sociology, the first sociology program to
   institutionalize the use of the insider researcher, the first sociology
   program to institutionalize the practice of method triangulation, and
   the first sociology program to institutionalize the acknowledgment of
   limitations in its publications. Despite these accomplishments, the
   Atlanta Sociological Laboratory remains unknown to most professional
   sociologists. This article examines why the accomplishments of this
   school should be incorporated into the sociology curriculum, where this
   school should be incorporated into the sociology curriculum, and how
   this school can be incorporated into the sociology curriculum.

AB This article covers the importance of creating and developing agency in
   community partners when engaging in community-based learning. Often when
   faculty incorporate service- or community-based learning into their
   classes, we measure the "learning" part but not the "service" or
   "community." Focusing more on the latter involves working "with"
   community partners instead of working "for" community partners, and this
   focus creates a more effective experience for all stakeholders involved.
   Achieving this goal of working "with" partners not only requires
   collaboration but also requires an effort to create and develop a sense
   of agency among the community partners. In the current teaching note,
   collaborative projects between undergraduate sociology classes and a
   local senior center are discussed. These projects show enhanced learning
   for the college students as well as an enhanced experience for community
   partners due to the emphasis on establishing and nurturing agency among
   community partners.

AB Purpose: Adult bone mass depends on acquisition in childhood and decline
   in adulthood, and may be influenced by socioeconomic conditions over the
   entire life course.
   Methods: We examined associations of bone mineral density (BMD) in
   adulthood with life course socioeconomic status in 729 participants in
   the Midlife in the United States Biomarker Project, adjusting for age,
   menopausal transition stage, race, gender, body weight, smoking,
   physical activity in several life stages, and research site. Primary
   predictors were a) childhood socioeconomic advantage score (including
   parental education, self-rated financial status relative to others, not
   being on welfare), b) adult education level (no college vs. some college
   vs. college graduate), and c) adult current financial advantage score
   (including family-adjusted poverty to income ratio, self-assessed
   current financial situation, having enough money to meet needs, ease in
   paying bills).
   Results: Mean age was 56.9 (range 34-85) years. After adjustment for
   covariates, childhood socioeconomic advantage and adult education level
   were positively associated with lumbar spine BMD: 0.27 standard
   deviations (SD) higher at 90th compared to 10th percentile of childhood
   advantage score (P = 0.009), and 0.24 SD higher in college graduates
   compared to participants without college education (P = 0.01). Adult
   current financial advantage was not associated with lumbar spine BMD.
   None of the three socioeconomic indicators was significantly associated
   with femoral neck BMD.
   Conclusions: Childhood socioeconomic advantage and adult education level
   were associated with higher adult lumbar spine BMD. Current financial
   advantage was not associated with BMD. Childhood socioeconomic factors
   may influence acquisition of lumbar BMD. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

AB This study provides the first climatological synthesis of how
   urbanization augments warm-season convection among a range of cities in
   the southeastern U.S. By comparing the location of convection in these
   cities and adjacent control regions via high-resolution, radar
   reflectivity and lightning data, we illustrate that demographic and
   land-use changes feed back to local atmospheric processes that promote
   thunderstorm formation and persistence. Composite radar data for a
   10-year, June-August period are stratified according to specific
   "medium" and "high" reflectivity thresholds. As surrogates for
   potentially strong (medium reflectivity) and severe (high reflectivity)
   thunderstorms, these radar climatologies can be used to determine if
   cities are inducing more intense events. Results demonstrate positive
   urban amplification of thunderstorm frequency and intensity for major
   cities. Mid-sized cities investigated had more subtle urban effects,
   suggesting that the urban influences on thunderstorm development and
   strength are muted by land cover and climatological controls. By
   examining cities of various sizes, as well as rural counterparts, the
   investigation determined that the degree of urban thunderstorm
   augmentation corresponds to the geometry of the urban footprint. The
   research provides a methodological template for continued monitoring of
   anthropogenically forced and/or modified thunderstorms.

AB Diminished social motivation is one of the most striking features in
   autism. Yet, few studies have directly assessed the value people with an
   ASD place on social interactions, or how rewarding they report it to be.
   In the present study, we directly measure social motivation by looking
   at responses to a questionnaire assessing self-reported pleasure in
   social and non social situations. Twenty-nine adolescents with ASD and
   matched controls took part in the study. Our results reveal that
   children with an ASD differ from the controls with respect to social
   enjoyment, but not with respect to physical and other sources of
   hedonism. Further analyses demonstrate that the degree of social
   anhedonia correlates with autism severity.

AB Background Disparities in health among blacks and Hispanics compared to
   whites individuals exist for a number of health measures; however, the
   health profile of individuals who are both black and Hispanic is not
   well known. We sought to determine whether race and ethnicity have
   synchronous or independent effects on health-related outcomes.
   Methods We combined the National Health Interview Survey for 2000-2007
   to identify 896 black Hispanics. We selected health-related outcomes
   where white Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks significantly differed. We
   computed adjusted prevalence estimates for black Hispanics and compared
   them to determine whether their health-related outcomes more closely
   resemble white Hispanics or non-Hispanic blacks. All prevalence
   estimates were adjusted for age, sex, education, marital status, income
   and survey year.
   Results Black Hispanics' health behaviours resembled white Hispanics or
   were similar to both white Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. For health
   services outcomes, they resembled non-Hispanic blacks. However, their
   health status was influenced by both race and ethnicity, with black
   Hispanics resembling both white Hispanic and non-Hispanic black people.
   Conclusion We conclude that health behaviour interventions incorporating
   knowledge of Hispanic cultures may be sufficient to reach black
   Hispanics. However, health services or health status, interventions
   targeted broadly to Hispanic people may not be sufficient. In some
   respects black Hispanic people comprise a distinct subgroup that may
   require targeted attention in public health interventions.

AB This article develops the concept of experiential careers, drawing
   theoretical attention to the routinization and de-routinization of
   specific experiences as they unfold over social career trajectories.
   Based on interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in two religious
   communities, we compare the social-temporal patterning of religious
   experience among newly religious Orthodox Jews and converted Muslims in
   two cities in the United States. In both cases, we find that as newly
   religious people work to transform their previous bodily habits and take
   on newly prescribed religious acts, the beginning of their religious
   careers becomes marked by what practitioners describe as potent
   religious experiences in situations of religious practice. However, over
   time, these once novel practices become routinized and religious
   experiences in these situations diminish, thus provoking actors and
   institutions in both fields to work to re-enchant religious life.
   Through this ethnographic comparison, we demonstrate the utility of
   focusing on experiential careers as a sociological unit of analysis.
   Doing so allows sociologists to use a non-reductive phenomenological
   approach to chart the shifting manifestations of experiences people
   deeply care about, along with the patterned enchantments,
   disenchantments, and possible re-enchantments these social careers
   entail. As such, this approach contributes to the analysis of social
   careers and experiences of "becoming" across both religious and
   non-religious domains.

AB Recent studies suggest that obesity may be "contagious" between
   individuals in social networks. Social contagion (influence), however,
   may not be identifiable using traditional statistical approaches because
   they cannot distinguish contagion from homophily (the propensity for
   individuals to select friends who are similar to themselves) or from
   shared environmental influences. In this paper, we apply the stochastic
   actor-based model (SABM) framework developed by Snijders and colleagues
   to data on adolescent body mass index (BMI), screen time, and playing
   active sports. Our primary hypothesis was that social influences on
   adolescent body size and related behaviors are independent of friend
   selection. Employing the SABM, we simultaneously modeled network
   dynamics (friendship selection based on homophily and structural
   characteristics of the network) and social influence. We focused on the
   2 largest schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health (Add Health) and held the school environment constant by
   examining the 2 school networks separately (N = 624 and 1151). Results
   show support in both schools for homophily on BMI, but also for social
   influence on BMI. There was no evidence of homophily on screen time in
   either school, while only one of the schools showed homophily on playing
   active sports. There was, however, evidence of social influence on
   screen time in one of the schools, and playing active sports in both
   schools. These results suggest that both homophily and social influence
   are important in understanding patterns of adolescent obesity.
   Intervention efforts should take into consideration peers' influence on
   one another, rather than treating "high risk" adolescents in isolation.

AB Everyday goals and experiences are often shared with others who may hold
   different places within our social networks. We investigated whether the
   experience of sharing a reward differs with respect to social network.
   Twenty human participants played a card guessing game for shared
   monetary outcomes with three partners: a computer, a confederate (out of
   network), and a friend (in network). Participants subjectively rated the
   experience of sharing a reward more positively with their friends than
   the other partners. Neuroimaging results support participants'
   subjective reports, as ventral striatal BOLD responses were more robust
   when sharing monetary gains with a friend as compared to the confederate
   or computer, suggesting a higher value for sharing with an in-network
   partner. Interestingly, ratings of social closeness covaried with this
   activity, resulting in a significant partner x closeness interaction;
   exploratory analysis showed that only participants reporting higher
   levels of closeness demonstrated partner-related differences in striatal
   BOLD response. These results suggest that reward valuation in social
   contexts is sensitive to distinctions of social network, such that
   sharing positive experiences with in-network others may carry higher
   value.

AB Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel [Diamond J, (1997) Guns, Germs,
   and Steel (WW Norton, NY)] has provided a scientific foundation for
   answering basic questions, such as why Eurasians colonized the global
   South and not the other way around, and why there is so much variance in
   economic development across the globe. Diamond's explanatory variables
   are: (i) the susceptibility of local wild plants to be developed for
   self-sufficient agriculture; (ii) the domesticability of large wild
   animals for food, transport, and agricultural production; and (iii) the
   relative lengths of the axes of continents with implications for the
   spread of human populations and technologies. This third "continental
   axis" thesis is the most difficult of Diamond's several explanatory
   factors to test, given that the number of continents are too few for
   statistical analysis. This article provides a test of one observable
   implication of this thesis, namely that linguistic diversity should be
   more persistent to the degree that a geographic area is oriented more
   north-south than east-west. Using both modern states and artificial
   geographic entities as the units of analysis, the results provide
   significant confirmation of the relationship between geographic
   orientation and cultural homogenization. Beyond providing empirical
   support for one observable implication of the continental axis theory,
   these results have important implications for understanding the roots of
   cultural diversity, which is an important determinant of economic
   growth, public goods provision, local violence, and social trust.

AB The collapse of the Bronze Age Harappan, one of the earliest urban
   civilizations, remains an enigma. Urbanism flourished in the western
   region of the Indo-Gangetic Plain for approximately 600 y, but since
   approximately 3,900 y ago, the total settled area and settlement sizes
   declined, many sites were abandoned, and a significant shift in site
   numbers and density towards the east is recorded. We report morphologic
   and chronologic evidence indicating that fluvial landscapes in Harappan
   territory became remarkably stable during the late Holocene as
   aridification intensified in the region after approximately 5,000 BP.
   Upstream on the alluvial plain, the large Himalayan rivers in Punjab
   stopped incising, while downstream, sedimentation slowed on the
   distinctive mega-fluvial ridge, which the Indus built in Sindh. This
   fluvial quiescence suggests a gradual decrease in flood intensity that
   probably stimulated intensive agriculture initially and encouraged
   urbanization around 4,500 BP. However, further decline in monsoon
   precipitation led to conditions adverse to both inundation-and
   rain-based farming. Contrary to earlier assumptions that a large
   glacier-fed Himalayan river, identified by some with the mythical
   Sarasvati, watered the Harappan heartland on the interfluve between the
   Indus and Ganges basins, we show that only monsoonal-fed rivers were
   active there during the Holocene. As the monsoon weakened, monsoonal
   rivers gradually dried or became seasonal, affecting habitability along
   their courses. Hydroclimatic stress increased the vulnerability of
   agricultural production supporting Harappan urbanism, leading to
   settlement downsizing, diversification of crops, and a drastic increase
   in settlements in the moister monsoon regions of the upper Punjab,
   Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.

   and are related to lower HIV knowledge and worse health behaviors and
   outcomes. The extent of these associations is unknown in countries like
   Mozambique, where no rigorously validated literacy and numeracy measures
   exist.
   Methods: A validated measure of literacy and numeracy, the Wide Range
   Achievement Test, version 3 (WRAT-3) was translated into Portuguese,
   adapted for a Mozambican context, and administered to a cross-section of
   female heads-of-household during a provincially representative survey
   conducted from August 8 to September 25, 2010. Construct validity of
   each subscale was examined by testing associations with education,
   income, and possession of socioeconomic assets, stratified by Portuguese
   speaking ability. Multivariable regression models estimated the
   association among literacy/numeracy and HIV knowledge, self-reported HIV
   testing, and utilization of prenatal care.
   Results: Data from 3,557 women were analyzed; 1,110 (37.9%) reported
   speaking Portuguese. Respondents' mean age was 31.2; 44.6% lacked formal
   education, and 34.3% reported no income. Illiteracy was common (50.4% of
   Portuguese speakers, 93.7% of non-Portuguese speakers) and the mean
   numeracy score (10.4) corresponded to US kindergarten-level skills.
   Literacy or numeracy was associated (p<0.01) with education, income,
   age, and other socioeconomic assets. Literacy and numeracy skills were
   associated with HIV knowledge in adjusted models, but not with HIV
   testing or receipt of clinic-based prenatal care.
   Conclusion: The adapted literacy and numeracy subscales are valid for
   use with rural Mozambican women. Limited literacy and numeracy skills
   were common and associated with lower HIV knowledge. Further study is
   needed to determine the extent to which addressing literacy/numeracy
   will lead to improved health outcomes.

AB Despite its unprecedented growth in output per capita in the last two
   decades, China has essentially followed the life satisfaction trajectory
   of the central and eastern European transition countries-a U-shaped
   swing and a nil or declining trend. There is no evidence of an increase
   in life satisfaction of the magnitude that might have been expected to
   result from the fourfold improvement in the level of per capita
   consumption that has occurred. As in the European countries, in China
   the trend and U-shaped pattern appear to be related to a pronounced rise
   in unemployment followed by a mild decline, and an accompanying
   dissolution of the social safety net along with growing income
   inequality. The burden of worsening life satisfaction in China has
   fallen chiefly on the lowest socioeconomic groups. An initially highly
   egalitarian distribution of life satisfaction has been replaced by an
   increasingly unequal one, with decreasing life satisfaction in persons
   in the bottom third of the income distribution and increasing life
   satisfaction in those in the top third.

AB The sacred texts of five world religions (Buddhism, Christianity,
   Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism) use similar belief systems to set limits
   on sexual behavior. We propose that this similarity is a shared cultural
   solution to a biological problem: namely male uncertainty over the
   paternity of offspring. Furthermore, we propose the hypothesis that
   religious practices that more strongly regulate female sexuality should
   be more successful at promoting paternity certainty. Using genetic data
   on 1,706 father-son pairs, we tested this hypothesis in a traditional
   African population in which multiple religions (Islam, Christianity, and
   indigenous) coexist in the same families and villages. We show that the
   indigenous religion enables males to achieve a significantly (P = 0.019)
   lower probability of cuckoldry (1.3% versus 2.9%) by enforcing the
   honest signaling of menstruation, but that all three religions share
   tenets aimed at the avoidance of extrapair copulation. Our findings
   provide evidence for high paternity certainty in a traditional African
   population, and they shed light on the reproductive agendas that
   underlie religious patriarchy.

AB Though religion has been shown to have generally positive effects on
   normative 'prosocial' behavior, recent laboratory research suggests that
   these effects may be driven primarily by supernatural punishment.
   Supernatural benevolence, on the other hand, may actually be associated
   with less prosocial behavior. Here, we investigate these effects at the
   societal level, showing that the proportion of people who believe in
   hell negatively predicts national crime rates whereas belief in heaven
   predicts higher crime rates. These effects remain after accounting for a
   host of covariates, and ultimately prove stronger predictors of national
   crime rates than economic variables such as GDP and income inequality.
   Expanding on laboratory research on religious prosociality, this is the
   first study to tie religious beliefs to large-scale cross-national
   trends in pro- and anti-social behavior.

AB The increased concern about wildfire risk creates the need to better
   understand the factors affecting community preparedness. Social capital
   may be one key factor for facilitating risk reduction. We examined how
   place attachment and past experience with wildfires influences a
   community's social capital. which in turn affects the adoption of
   defensible space actions and improves wildfire awareness. A survey
   instrument was developed to identify variables affecting social capital,
   and measure self-reported change in attitudes and actions toward
   mitigation in six fire-prone communities across the USA. Findings
   indicate that place attachment and previous involvement in natural
   resource planning significantly affect social capital and community
   cohesion, encourage defensible space actions as well as build support
   for preparedness in the wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities by
   improving residents' awareness of wildfire risk. Results suggest that
   planners and resource managers can take advantage of these factors to
   increase citizen participation for shaping and improving collaborative
   hazard mitigation and resource management. By identifying and monitoring
   the variables that affect social capital and preparedness, planning and
   natural resource management agencies can better direct programs to
   reduce fire danger and ensure safety in wildland-urban interface
   communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   developed within the social and behavioral sciences before and outside
   of the ES approach. A selective review of work in landscape aesthetics,
   cultural heritage, outdoor recreation, and spiritual significance
   demonstrates opportunities for operationally defining cultural services
   in terms of socioecological models, consistent with the larger set of
   ES. Such models explicitly link ecological structures and functions with
   cultural values and benefits, facilitating communication between
   scientists and stakeholders and enabling economic, multicriterion,
   deliberative evaluation and other methods that can clarify tradeoffs and
   synergies involving cultural ES. Based on this approach, a common
   representation is offered that frames cultural services, along with all
   ES, by the relative contribution of relevant ecological structures and
   functions and by applicable social evaluation approaches. This
   perspective provides a foundation for merging ecological and social
   science epistemologies to define and integrate cultural services better

   to develop and test ideas about basic social processes; this article
   assesses the state of the rich but contentious new literature that has
   resulted. The article provides a review and evaluation of sociological
   research that explores the two aspects of transition that have attracted
   the greatest attention: the nature of the transition process and the
   consequences of transition for stratification and mobility. The authors
   address the two theoretical approaches-institutional and
   corporatist-that have been the center of intense debate regarding
   transition and evaluate the empirical evidence for each. The authors
   argue that empirical evidence provides support for elements of each but
   that detailed scope conditions and more nuanced arguments are critical.

AB Marx's conception of human nature includes human "passions" and

   our human capacity for "free conscious activity." However, "emotion" has
   been largely excluded from the sociological lexicon and the capacity for
   conscious action has often been viewed at the level of the individual
   actor and, moreover, in overly "cognitive" and "rational" terms. As a
   result, the very reading of classic texts has been historically biased
   against the seeing of emotion, even when it is addressed. What
   difference does the inclusion of emotion in Marx's conception of human

   theoretical synthesis that accepts the existence of genetic clusters
   consistent with certain racial classifications as well as the validity
   of the genomic research that has identified the clusters, without
   diminishing the social character of their context, meaning, production,
   or consequences. The first part of this article describes the social
   constructionist account of race as lacking biological reality, its main
   shortcomings, and our proposed solution: the concept of clinal classes.
   The second part discusses the character of the group differences that
   would be consistent with clinal classes and introduces the concept of
   genomic individualism, which extends an emerging model for understanding
   biosocial causation to include the genetic effects of ancestry. The
   third part develops the argument for a "bounded nature" reformulation of
   racial constructionism that reconceptualizes racial and ethnic
   categorization as the social perception of ancestry. The final part

AB In contemporary sociology the once prominent study of public opinion has
   virtually disappeared. None of the leading theoretical models in the
   closest disciplinary subfield (political sociology) currently provide
   ample or sufficiently clear space for consideration of public opinion as
   a possible factor in shaping or interacting with key policy or political
   outcomes in democratic polities. In this article, we unearth and
   document the sources of this curious development and raise questions
   about its implications for how political sociologists have come to
   understand policy making, state formation, and political conflict. We
   begin by reconstructing the dismissal of public opinion in the
   intellectual reorientation of political sociology from the late 1970s
   onward. We argue that the most influential scholarly works of this
   period (including those of Tilly, Skocpol, Mann, Esping-Andersen, and
   Domhoff) face an underlying paradox: While often rejecting public
   opinion, their theoretical logics ultimately presuppose its operation.
   These now classical writings did not move toward research programs
   seeking engagement with the operation and formation of public opinion,
   even though our immanent critique suggests they in fact require
   precisely this turn. We address the challenge of reconceptualizing how
   public opinion might be productively integrated into the sociological
   study of politics by demonstrating that the major arguments in the
   subfield can be fruitfully extended by grappling with public opinion. We
   conclude by considering several recent, interdisciplinary examples of
   scholarship that, we argue, point the way toward a fruitful
   revitalization.

   exposed an important limitation in three dominant conceptions of the

   political action are permeable and indistinct. This article develops a
   theory of civic production to better account for the inherent
   normativity and "porousness" of this analytic category. I conceptualize
   the civic as a variable, contingent outcome or product of a contentious
   performance undertaken in some venue for some reason. The phenomenon of
   "civic recreation," a form of fund-raising that combines a leisure
   activity with a public cause, underscores the necessity of a theory of
   civic production. I draw from social movement theory and from

AB The relation between SES (socioeconomic status) and academic achievement
   in school-aged children is well established; children from low SES
   families have more difficulty in school. However, few studies have been
   able to establish a link between SES and learning in infancy, and thus
   the developmental onset of SES effects remains unknown. The limited
   studies that have been conducted to explore the link between SES and
   learning in infancy have generated mixed results: some demonstrate a
   link between SES and learning in infants as young as 6-9 months (Smith,
   Fagan, & Ulvund, 2002) while others do not. Further, studies examining
   the genetic as well as environmental contributors to learning in infancy
   and early childhood suggest that the effect of SES is likely cumulative
   and that as children develop, the effect of a low SES environment will
   become more pronounced (Tucker-Drob, Rhemtulla, Harden, Turkheimer, &
   Fask, 2011). Using aggregated data from 790 infants collected across 18
   studies, we examined the contribution of SES and other demographic
   factors to learning of an operant kicking task in 2-4-month-old infants
   in a meta-analysis. Results indicated that, at least with respect to
   operant conditioning, an infant is an infant: that is SES did not affect
   learning rate or ability to learn in infants under 4-months of age. SES
   effects may therefore be better characterized as cumulative, with
   tangible effects emerging sometime later in life. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

   Utilizing restricted-use data that links workers in the Survey of Income

   the effect of measurement error on estimates of racial earnings
   inequality. Results show that varying levels of mean-reverting error
   causes underestimation of earnings inequality. Notably, mean reversion
   is steeper for Black men than for White men, bringing about substantial
   downward bias in the estimated earnings gaps between Whites and Blacks
   at lower percentiles as well as large underestimation of within-racial

   obstetric services, highlighting the need to examine birthing
   preparation and perceptions of EmOC, including caesarean sections.
   Twenty women who delivered at a hospital and were identified by
   physicians as having severe obstetric complications during delivery or
   immediately thereafter were selected to participate in this qualitative
   study. Purposive sampling was used for selecting the women. The study
   was carried out in Matlab, Bangladesh, during March 2008-August 2009.
   Data-collection methods included in-depth interviews with women and,
   whenever possible, their family members. The results showed that the
   women were poorly informed before delivery about pregnancy-related
   complications and medical indications for emergency care. Barriers to
   care-seeking at emergency obstetric facilities and acceptance of
   lifesaving care were related to apprehensions about the physical
   consequences and social stigma, resulting from hospital procedures and
   financial concerns. The respondents held many misconceptions about
   caesarean sections and distrust regarding the reason for recommending
   the procedure by the healthcare providers. Women who had caesarean
   sections incurred high costs that led to economic burdens on family
   members, and the blame was attributed to the woman. The postpartum
   health consequences reported by the women were generally left untreated.
   The data underscore the importance of educating women and their families
   about pregnancy-related complications and preparing families for the
   possibility of caesarean section. At the same time, the health systems
   need to be strengthened to ensure that all women in clinical need of
   lifesaving obstetric surgery access quality EmOC services rapidly and,
   once in a facility, can obtain a caesarean section promptly, if needed.
   While greater access to surgical interventions may be lifesaving,
   policy-makers need to institute mechanisms to discourage the
   over-medicalization of childbirth in a context where the use of
   caesarean section is rapidly rising.

AB Background: Heroin abuse remains an important public health problem,
   particularly in economically disadvantaged areas. Insight into this
   problem is gained from interviewing addicted individuals. However, we
   lack systematic data on factors that motivate heroin users to
   participate in non-treatment research that offers both financial
   incentives (compensation) and non-financial incentives (e.g., short-term
   medication).
   Aim: To better understand the relative importance of several types of
   personal motivations to participate in non-treatment buprenorphine
   research, and to relate self-motivations to social, economic,
   demographic and drug use factors.
   Methods: Heroin dependent volunteers (N = 235 total; 57 female and 178
   male; 136 African American, 86 Caucasian, and 13 Other) applied for
   non-therapeutic buprenorphine research in an urban outpatient setting
   from 2004 to 2008. We conducted a semi-structured behavioral economic
   interview, after which participants ranked 11 possible motivations for
   research participation.
   Results: Although the study was repeatedly described as non-treatment
   research involving buprenorphine, participants often ranked some
   treatment-related motivations as important (wanting to reduce/stop
   heroin use, needing a medication to get stabilized/detoxify). Some
   motivations correlated with income, heroin use, and years since
   marketing of buprenorphine. Two dimensions emerged from principal
   component analysis of motivation rankings: (1) treatment motivation vs.
   greater immediate needs and (2) commitment to trying alternatives vs. a
   more accepting attitude toward traditional interventions. In summary,
   heroin addicts' self-motivations to engage in non-therapeutic research
   are complex - they value economic gain but not exclusively or primarily
   - and relate to variables such as socioeconomic factors and drug use.

AB Objective: Inflammation may represent a biological mechanism underlying
   associations of socioeconomic status (SES) with cardiovascular disease.
   We examined relationships of individual and neighborhood SES with
   inflammatory markers in Mexican American women and evaluated
   contributions of obesity and related heath behaviors to these
   associations. Methods: Two hundred eighty-four Mexican American women
   (mean age = 49.74 years) were recruited from socioeconomically diverse
   South San Diego communities. Women completed measures of
   sociodemographic characteristics and health behaviors, and underwent a
   physical examination with fasting blood draw for assay of plasma
   C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble
   intercellular adhesion molecule I (sICAM-1). Neighborhood SES was
   extracted from the US Census Bureau 2000 database. Results: In
   multilevel models, a 1-standard deviation higher individual or
   neighborhood SES related to a 27.35% and 23.56% lower CRP level (p
   values < .01), a 7.04% and 5.32% lower sICAM-1 level (p values < .05),
   and a 10.46% (p < .05) and 2.40% lower IL-6 level (not significant),
   respectively. Controlling for individual SES, a 1-standard deviation
   higher neighborhood SES related to a 18.05% lower CRP level (p = .07).
   Differences in body mass index, waist circumference, and dietary fat
   consumption contributed significantly to SES-inflammation associations.
   Conclusions: The findings support a link between SES and inflammatory
   markers in Mexican American women and implicate obesity and dietary fat
   in these associations. Additional effects of neighborhood SES were not
   statistically significant; however, these findings should be viewed
   tentatively due to the small sample size to evaluate contextual effects.

AB The study of sport spectatorship has an increasing focus on the
   importance of fandom beyond fan violence. Fundamental to understanding
   fan behavior are the meaningful rituals and emotions experienced by
   fans. In this paper, I use the theoretical work of Randall Collins to
   examine the ritualistic outcomes of collective effervescence, emotional
   energy, and group symbols and solidarity among sport fans. I illustrate
   these concepts using case study data from participant observation of
   fans of a U.S. football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and content
   analysis of news articles. I extend Collins' interaction ritual (IR)
   theory by taking the group as the unit of analysis and analyzing group
   solidarity beyond situational interactions and typical sport settings,
   including the significant life events of weddings and funerals. While
   critiquing Collins' (2004) a priori portrayal of sports fans, the
   analysis advances IR theory, improving its utility for understanding
   sports fan behavior.

AB Background: Beliefs, attitudes, and preferences about the risk and
   benefits of genetic testing are important determinants of willingness to
   undergo testing. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
   perceived importance of genetic testing for alcohol dependence compared
   with other multifactorial diseases among African Americans. Methods:
   Surveys were conducted with 258 participants using the Genetic
   Psycho-Social Implications (GPSI) questionnaire to evaluate several
   areas of hypothetical genetic testing for alcohol dependence.
   Respondents were divided into two groups: those who perceived testing
   for alcohol dependence to be equally important as testing for cancer and
   those who did not. Using chi-square, the groups' responses were compared
   for nine GPSI items measuring beliefs about the severity of alcohol
   dependence, general benefits of genetic testing, and specific benefits
   of genetic testing for diabetes, hypertension, or a disease affecting a
   family member. Results: Nearly 86% of respondents believed that genetic
   testing for alcoholism was equally as important as testing for cancer.
   Those who reported parity of importance of alcohol dependence and cancer
   screening were more likely to believe that alcoholism is a deadly
   disease (p < 0.001) and genetic testing influences health (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: African Americans reported favorable attitudes and beliefs
   in possible availability of susceptibility genetic testing for alcohol
   dependence. The perceived importance of testing for alcohol dependence
   was associated with beliefs about the severity of alcoholism and certain
   benefits of genetic testing in general.

AB A fundamental assumption in nearly all research on social adaptation to
   environmental change is that there is a concomitant and inverse
   relationship between human communities' dependence upon particular
   natural resources affected by environmental change and those communities
   or societies' resilience to disturbances. However, recent theoretical
   and empirical developments suggest resilience is a dynamic social
   process determined, in part, by the ability of communities to act
   collectively and solve common problems. The interactional approach to
   community is utilized to develop a framework whereby various patterns of
   social interaction define the process of social resilience. Data come
   from multiple mixed methods case studies of forest dependent communities
   within Southern Appalachia. The findings reveal varied processes of
   social resilience can occur in communities with similar levels of
   resource dependence; a community's composition of internal social ties
   and their cross-scale linkages to external agencies and organizations
   define these processes.

AB The literature on development in economics and sociology has tended to
   focus on capital flows, investments, and, more recently, institutions as
   key causal factors. International migration, when discussed, is
   relegated to the status of a symptom of underdevelopment and even a
   factor contributing to it. The more recent literature on migrant
   remittances has partially reversed this view by documenting large hard
   currency transfers made by expatriates to their home countries. This
   changed approach to migration and development does not go far enough
   because it does not take into account the organized efforts of immigrant
   communities themselves. Nor does it consider important developmental
   synergies produced by the rising interactions between immigrant
   organizations and sending-country governments. Using data from a
   recently completed comparative study, we document these processes for
   two major countries of out-migrationMexico and China. The study compiled
   inventories of migrant organizations from both countries in the United
   States, interviewed leaders of the major ones, and complemented these
   data with interviews with officials and community leaders in each
   sending country. Profiles of these transnational ties were constructed,
   exemplifying their increasing density and developmental impact at the
   local and national levels. Theoretical and policy implications of the
   findings are discussed.

AB Objective: To test whether a disparity in overweight by socioeconomic
   status (SES; represented by educational attainment) has emerged among
   men or women during a recent 17-year period in China.
   Methods: Data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), a panel
   study including 7314 women and 6492 men, are used to longitudinally
   track the body mass index (BMI) and odds of overweight by educational
   attainment among Chinese adults (baseline age 18-50) from 1989 to 2006
   to determine whether individuals of low (< primary school) versus high
   (> secondary school) educational attainment experienced a
   disproportionately faster increase in BMI or odds of overweight (BMI >=
   25) over time. The unadjusted mean BMI and prevalence of overweight by
   education are presented. Sex-stratified, random-effects models are used
   to estimate the associations, and interactions by birth cohort are
   included.
   Findings: Overweight prevalence doubled for women and tripled for men.
   In 1989, among women, the odds of overweight were not different for
   those of high versus those of low educational attainment; however, by
   2006, the odds of overweight were significantly lower for those with the
   highest education in both the younger (odds ratio (OR) 0.22 (CI 0.11,
   0.42)) and the older (OR 0.27 (CI 0.10, 0.72)) birth cohorts. The
   reverse trend is seen for men, who also begin with no difference in odds
   of overweight by SES, but by 2006, the OR for the highest versus the
   lowest education group was 3.4 (CI 1.82, 6.18).
   Conclusions: Over 17 years, low SES has become associated with higher
   BMI and odds of overweight among Chinese women, whereas high SES remains
   a risk factor for overweight among Chinese men. International Journal of

   more flexible model that is founded in economic or cost-benefit
   considerations. Specific examples of flexibility in mouse feeding

   were measured by immunohistochemistry with staining intensity measured
   in optical density units by semiquantitative absorbance image analysis
   in tumor adjacent tissue from 400 prostatectomy specimens from the Henry
   Ford Health System in Detroit. For each subject, their U.S. Census tract

   median value of the distribution of the proportion of tract residents
   with a high-school education. Generalized estimating equation models
   were used to assess interactions between neighborhood-level SES and
   smoking status, adjusting for race, age, education level, tumor volume,
   primary Gleason grade and prostate specific antigen (PSA) at diagnosis.
   There was a statistical interaction (P = 0.004) between tract-level SES
   and smoking status. In lower SES tracts smoking status was not
   associated with adduct staining, but in higher SES tracts adduct
   staining intensity was 13% (P = 0.01) higher in ever-smokers as compared
   to never-smokers. Among never-smokers, living in a lower SES tract was

   individual outcomes. These urban civic ecology practices including
   community gardening, shellfish reintroductions, tree planting and care,
   and "friends of parks" initiatives to remove invasive and restore native
   species generally begin as small, self-organized efforts after a
   prolonged period of economic and environmental decline or more sudden
   major disruptions, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and conflict. Those
   practices that are sustained expand to encompass partnerships with
   non-profit organizations; local-, state-, and federal-level government
   agencies; and universities. Civic ecology practices reflect local
   cultures and environments as well as the practical knowledge of city
   residents, and thus vary widely across different cities. When viewed as
   local assets in some of the most densely populated urban neighborhoods,
   civic ecology practices offer opportunities for scientific and policy
   partnerships that address the Ecological Society of America's important

AB The article examines the relational organization of close relationships.
   It identifies 'the intimate couple' as central in organising close
   relationships. The analysis draws from 35 configurations of intimates
   and personal narratives of heterosexual Finns, examining who they cite
   as intimate and how their intimacies are organized and narrated. The
   analysis shows how living with a partner in 'the family setting'
   generates 'exclusive family intimacies' pushing other intimates, such as
   friends and wider families, further. Alternative, more inclusive
   intimacies are examined both within and outside the family setting.
   Those living without a partner often cite friends, parents and/or
   siblings as intimates. Outside the family setting there is no other
   structure for close relationships than 'the individual' and her or his
   capability to construct relationships. This leaves some in isolation.
   The article analyses the interplay between structure and agency in the
   contexts of intimacy, family and the contemporary organization of close
   relationships.

AB Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most common
   psychiatric disorders among veterans returning tfrom Iraq and
   Afghanistan. Little research has examined variables that may mediate the
   relation between PTSD and aspects of social functioning, such as
   relationship satisfaction and family functioning. In this
   cross-sectional study, a total of 164 veterans who were seeking VA
   primary care or mental health care within one year after returning from
   Iraq and/or Afghanistan were screened for PTSD and completed a series of
   questionnaires that assessed social functioning, coping, and life
   satisfaction. Results showed that the 86 (52%) veterans who screened
   positive for PTSD reported greater difficulties in their relationships
   with romantic partners, less cohesion in their families, less social
   support, poorer social functioning, and lower life satisfaction compared
   to other treatment-seeking veterans. Less social support from the
   community, excessive worry, decreased acceptance of change, and lower
   availability of secure relationships mediated the association between
   PTSD and poor social functioning. The relation between PTSD and lower
   partner satisfaction was mediated by greater cognitive social avoidance
   and lower availability of secure relationships. These results suggest
   that psychotherapeutic interventions that address these mediating
   variables may help improve social functioning in treatment-seeking
   veterans with PTSD.

AB Healthy behaviors including adequate exercise and sleep, eating
   breakfast, maintaining a healthy weight, and not smoking or binge
   drinking inhibit chronic disease. However, little is known about how
   these behaviors change across life course stages, or the social factors
   that shape healthy behaviors over time. I use multilevel growth models
   and waves I-Ill of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
   (n = 10,775) to evaluate relationships between adolescents' psychosocial
   resources, social support, and family of origin characteristics during
   adolescence and healthy behavior trajectories through young adulthood
   (ages 13-24). I find that healthy behaviors decline dramatically during
   the transition to young adulthood. Social support resources, such as
   school connectedness and support from parents, as well as living with
   non-smoking parents, are associated with higher levels of healthy
   behaviors across adolescence and adulthood. Social support from friends
   is associated with lower engagement in these behaviors, as is living in
   a single parent family or with a smoking parent during adolescence.
   Findings indicate that psychosocial, social support, and family of
   origin resources during adolescence exert a persistent, though generally
   not cumulative, influence on healthy behavior trajectories through young
   adulthood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB While a growing body of research indicates the severe ecological and
   social costs of biofuel production worldwide, the U.S. government
   continues to promote the expansion of this fuel sector. Recent
   congressional testimony regarding the promotion of biofuels via the
   renewable fuel standard (RFS) offers a strategic research site for
   sociological investigation into the practices of key political actors
   and their roles in promoting and discouraging ecologically oriented
   change. Congressional hearings provide a window into the political
   process of energy policy formation, thus informing environmental
   sociological theory and debates. The ecological modernization
   perspective and its assumptions provide the analytical frame of this
   empirical analysis of congressional hearings during the peak legislative
   period concerning biofuels. This research is intended to contribute to
   alternative energy debates, add to our understanding of the role of
   various actors in energy policy formation, and further theoretical
   developments within sociology.

   by youth, multi-racial, and gender movements that emerged in the wake of
   the much larger Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. With a full-blown
   academic legitimation crisis well under way, cultural studies resonated
   strongly with social struggles that shaped both its reception as well as
   its capacity to augment new intellectual academic formations. Retrieving
   the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British
   cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export
   phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad
   caricature of cultural studies' incorporation in the American academia,
   resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments
   feeding into the common binary narratives of the 'failure' of cultural

AB Background: The role of the infection preventionist (IP) has become
   increasingly complex, underscoring the need for rapid mechanisms of
   knowledge acquisition. One mechanism for knowledge acquisition is
   knowledge-sharing through social networks. In a state such as Kentucky
   with predominantly rural health care facilities, an optimal
   knowledge-sharing network is critical; however, descriptions of these
   networks are absent from the literature. The objective of this study was
   to evaluate the knowledge-sharing networks of hospital-based IPs in
   Kentucky.
   Methods: A survey was sent to all hospital-based IPs in Kentucky in
   November 2010. Density and component analyses were used to evaluate
   network cohesion, and centrality statistics and key player algorithms
   were used to identify IPs important to the network.
   Results: A total of 75 (58%) IPs completed the survey. The network
   density was 1.8%. Three components were identified. The median (range)
   centrality measures were as follows: in-degree, 2 (0-11); out-degree,
   0.5 (0-5); betweenness, 0 (0-567); and eigenvector 0.02 (0-0.45). Three
   key players were identified.
   Conclusions: Low network statistics indicate that the knowledge-sharing
   network of hospital-based IPs might not be adequate for efficient
   knowledge-sharing. Interventions to increase the density of the network
   and reduce the number of components are needed. Copyright (C) 2012 by

   as the root of the network size and the average network degree grows at
   least poly-logarithmically in this size. We also establish finite-sample
   confidence bounds on maximum-likelihood blockmodel parameter estimates
   from data comprising independent Bernoulli random variates; these
   results hold uniformly over class assignment. We provide simulations
   verifying the conditions sufficient for our results, and conclude by
   fitting a logit parameterization of a stochastic blockmodel with
   covariates to a network data example comprising self-reported school
   friendships, resulting in block estimates that reveal residual

AB Glacier hazards threaten societies in mountain regions worldwide.
   Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) pose risks to exposed and
   vulnerable populations and can be linked in part to long-term
   post-Little Ice Age climate change because precariously dammed glacial
   lakes sometimes formed as glaciers generally retreated after the
   mid-1800s. This paper provides an interdisciplinary and historical
   analysis of 40 years of glacier hazard management on Mount Hualcan, at
   glacial Lake 513, and in the city of Carhuaz in Peru's Cordillera Blanca
   mountain range. The case study examines attempted hazard zoning, glacial
   lake evolution and monitoring, and emergency engineering projects to
   drain Lake 513. It also analyzes the 11 April 2010 Hualcan rock-ice
   avalanche that triggered a Lake 513 GLOF; we offer both a scientific
   assessment of the possible role of temperature on slope stability and a
   GIS spatial analysis of human impacts. Qualitative historical analysis
   of glacier hazard management since 1970 allows us to identify and
   explain why certain actions and policies to reduce risk were implemented
   or omitted. We extrapolate these case-specific variables to generate a
   broader socio-environmental framework identifying factors that can
   facilitate or impede disaster risk reduction and climate change
   adaptation. Facilitating factors are technical capacity, disaster events
   with visible hazards, institutional support, committed individuals, and
   international involvement. Impediments include divergent risk
   perceptions, imposed government policies, institutional instability,
   knowledge disparities, and invisible hazards. This framework emerges
   from an empirical analysis of a coupled social-ecological system and
   offers a holistic approach for integrating disaster risk reduction and
   climate change adaptation.

   the suffering or well-being of others. In the present research, we
   investigate class-based differences in dispositional compassion and its
   activation in situations wherein others are suffering. Across studies,
   relative to their upper-class counterparts, lower-class individuals
   reported elevated dispositional compassion (Study 1), as well as greater
   self-reported compassion during a compassion-inducing video (Study 2)
   and for another person during a social interaction (Study 3).
   Lower-class individuals also exhibited heart rate deceleration-a
   physiological response associated with orienting to the social
   environment and engaging with others-during the compassion-inducing
   video (Study 2). We discuss a potential mechanism of class-based
   influences on compassion, whereby lower-class individuals' are more

AB Background: Relationships among religiosity and other psychosocial
   factors in determining suicidal behaviors in adolescence and in emerging
   adulthood have been inconclusive. We sought to investigate prospective
   relationships among religiosity, psychosocial factors and suicidal
   behaviors using a nationally representative sample of adolescents
   emerging into adulthood.
   Method: Analysis was based on 9412 respondents from four waves of
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. A Generalized
   Estimating Equation (GEE) procedure was used to fit a series of models
   on the response variable (suicidal behaviors) and a set of psychosocial
   and religiosity predictors taking into account the correlated structure
   of the datasets.
   Results: Analyses showed that adolescent suicidality and religious
   activity participation showed significant declines over time. Using
   multinomial logistic regression we found that females showed
   statistically significant risks of suicidal behaviors, but this effect
   declined in adulthood. In adjusted models, baseline attendance of a
   church weekly was associated with 42% reduction (95% Confidence
   Interval: 0.35-0.98) of suicide ideation in Wave III. Across all waves,
   low support from fathers (compared with mothers) consistently explained
   variability in suicidal behaviors among genders emerging into adulthood.
   Limitations: Accurate measurement of religiosity is psychometrically
   challenging.
   Conclusions: The findings of the study indicate that religious activity
   participation is associated with reduced suicidal behaviors among
   adolescents but this effect declines during emerging adulthood.
   Psychosocial supports particularly from fathers' have an enduring impact
   on reduced suicidal behaviors among adolescents and emerging adults.
   Prevention, identification and evaluation of disorders of suicidality
   need a careful assessment of underlying mental pain (psyache) to reduce
   the likelihood of aggravated suicide. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   To describe the relationship between subjective social status and
   functional decline in older adults.
   Longitudinal cohort study.
   The Health and Retirement Study, a nationally representative survey of
   community-dwelling older adults (2004-2008).
   Two thousand five hundred and twenty-three community-dwelling older
   adults.
   Self-report of social status (SSS), categorized into three groups,
   reported by participants who marked a 10-rung ladder to represent where
   they stand in society. Four-year functional decline (new difficulty in
   any of five activities of daily living, mobility decline and/or death)
   Mean age was 64; 46% were male, 85% were white. At baseline, lower SSS
   was associated with being younger, unmarried, of nonwhite
   race/ethnicity, higher rates of chronic medical conditions and ADL
   impairment (P < 0.01). Over 4 years, 50% in the lowest SSS group
   declined in function, compared to the middle and highest groups (28% and
   26%), P-trend < 0.001. Those in the lowest rungs of SSS were at
   increased risk of 4-year functional decline (unadjusted RR = 1.91, CI
   1.-9-2.46). The relationship between a subjective belief that one is
   worse off than others and functional decline persisted after serial
   adjustment for demographics, objective SES measures, and baseline health
   and functional status (RR 1.36, CI 1.08-1.73).
   In older adults, the belief that one is in the lowest rungs of social
   status is a measure of socioeconomic distress and of significant risk
   for functional decline. These findings suggest that self-report of low
   subjective social status may give clinicians additional information
   about which older adults are at high risk for future functional decline.

   informed healthcare values that influence their expectations of
   healthcare. There is limited empirical research on this community's
   preferences for cultural modifications in healthcare delivery.
   Identify healthcare accommodations requested by American Muslims.
   Using community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods, we
   partnered with four community organizations in the Greater Detroit area
   to design and conduct thirteen focus groups at area mosques serving
   African American, Arab American, and South Asian American Muslims.
   Qualitative content analysis utilized a framework team-based approach.
   Participants reported stigmatization within the healthcare system and
   voiced the need for culturally competent healthcare providers. In
   addition, they identified three key healthcare accommodations to address
   Muslim sensitivities: the provision of (1) gender-concordant care, (2)
   halal food and (3) a neutral prayer space. Gender concordance was
   requested based on Islamic conceptions of modesty and privacy. Halal
   food was deemed to be health-promoting and therefore integral to the
   healing process. Lastly, a neutral prayer space was requested to ensure
   security and privacy during worship.
   This study informs efforts to deliver high-quality healthcare to
   American Muslims in several ways. We note three specific healthcare
   accommodations requested by this community and the religious values
   underlying these requests. Healthcare systems can further cultural
   sensitivity, engender trust, and improve the healthcare experiences of
   American Muslims by understanding and then attempting to accommodate
   these values as much as possible.

AB Although few disagree that advancements in technology and the
   establishment of trade-conducive transnational institutions play an
   important role in augmenting the potential for trade globalization,
   there is more disagreement surrounding alternative causal explanations
   of trade during the postwar period. While world-system scholars argue
   that international trade increases when a hegemonic nation-state is
   powerful enough to provide geopolitical stability and trade-conducive
   policies, world-polity theorists maintain that trade results from the
   emanation of cultural scripts that create compatible national
   institutions and trust among nation-states. This article tests these
   theories by analyzing a global-level data set with information from 1945
   to 2005 via autoregressive integrated moving-average models. The results
   provide strong support for the world-system contention that increases in
   the power of the hegemonic nation-state amplify levels of trade
   globalization. Furthermore, although there is some support for the
   world-polity contention that the spread of democracy is positively
   associated with international trade, there is little evidence to
   validate the claim that the proliferation of intergovernmental
   organizations enhances trade globalization.

   less if the coercer is a computer. These hypotheses are extended from

AB Background: Despite well-established gender differences in adult smoking
   behaviors, relatively little is known about gender discrepancies in
   smoking behaviors among adolescents, and even less is known about the
   role of gender in smoking cessation among teen populations.
   Method: The present study examined gender differences in a population of
   755 adolescents seeking to quit smoking through the American Lung
   Association's Not-On-Tobacco (N-O-T) program. All participants enrolled
   in the N-O-T program between 1998 and 2009. All participants completed a
   series of questionnaires prior to and immediately following the
   cessation intervention. Analyses examined gender differences in a range
   of smoking variables, cessation success and direct and indirect effects
   on changes in smoking behaviors.
   Results: Females were more likely to have parents, siblings and romantic
   partners who smokes, perceive that those around them will support a
   cessation effort, smoke more prior to intervention if they have friends
   who smoke, and to have lower cessation motivation and confidence if they
   have a parent who smokes. Conversely, males were more likely to have
   lower cessation motivation and confidence and be less likely to quit if
   they have a friend who smokes.
   Conclusions: Gender plays an important role in adolescent smoking
   behavior and smoking cessation. Further research is needed to understand
   how these differences may be incorporated into intervention design to
   increase cessation success rates among this vulnerable population of
   smokers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   existing but limited literature on food choice for diverse populations
   renders such an assumption problematic. This qualitative study examined
   the food choices of a population most at risk for obesity - low-income
   African American women - by considering psychological factors, social
   and cultural meanings of foods, and structural conditions that shape how
   women decide what to eat. Interviews revealed the complexity of their
   food choices, illustrating the extent to which multiple influences
   operate simultaneously on food choice decisions. Implications for

   that some types of public health interventions do not correspond to the

AB The authors recently reported high sero-prevalence among
   African-Americans of high African ancestry. We sought to determine
   whether neighborhood-level socio-economic characteristics are associated
   with prevalence and whether this helps explain the link between African
   ancestry and .
   Antibodies to proteins were assessed in the serum of 336
   African-American and 329 white Southern Community Cohort Study
   participants. Prevalence odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals
   (CIs) for CagA+ and CagA- were calculated using polytomous logistic
   regression in relation to 10 Census block group-level measures of
   socio-economic status.
   After adjusting for individual-level characteristics, three
   neighborhood-level factors were significantly inversely related to CagA+
   : percent completed high school; median house values; and percent
   employed (comparing highest to lowest tertile, OR, 0.47, 95 % CI,
   0.26-0.85; OR, 0.56, 95 % CI, 0.32-0.99; and OR, 0.59, 95 % CI,
   0.34-1.03, respectively). However, accounting for these measures did not
   attenuate the association between African ancestry and CagA+ , with
   African-Americans of low, medium, and high African ancestry maintaining
   two-, seven-, and ninefold increased odds, respectively, compared to
   whites.
   Neighborhood-level measures of education, employment, and house values
   are associated with CagA+ sero-prevalence, but do not explain the
   persistent strong relationship between African ancestry level and CagA+
   . The findings suggest that neighborhood socio-economic status can help
   to highlight high-risk areas for prevention and screening efforts and
   that the link between African ancestry and may have a biological basis.

AB Recent research, although inconsistent, indicates that socioeconomic
   status (SES) may be associated with hormone receptor (HR) status. This
   study aims to examine the association between SES and breast cancer HR
   status within and across racial/ethnic groups stratified by age at
   diagnosis and tumor stage.
   The study subjects were 184,602 women with incident breast cancer
   diagnosed during 2004-2007 and identified from the National Cancer
   Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results program.
   Log-binomial regression assessed the risk of having breast tumors that
   were (1) HR-negative versus HR-positive and (2) HR-unknown versus
   HR-known between women who, at the time of diagnosis, were residing in
   high or medium poverty areas compared to low poverty areas.
   High poverty areas tended to have a greater prevalence of HR-negative
   tumors compared to more affluent areas. Although not always significant,
   this was observed among non-Hispanic white and Hispanic women regardless
   of age-tumor stage category, and only among young, non-Hispanic black
   women and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander women with regional and
   distant stage. High poverty areas also tended to have a greater
   prevalence of HR-unknown tumors compared to more affluent areas.
   Furthermore, significant trends between HR status and poverty level
   varied by race/ethnicity, age, and tumor stage.
   Poverty may be related to breast cancer negative and unknown HR status.
   These findings suggest the effects of non-genetic factors on biochemical
   features of breast cancer, as well as imply a clinical importance to
   improve HR measurement or recording for low socioeconomic breast cancer
   patients.

AB Altruistic punishment occurs when an agent incurs a cost to punish
   another but receives no material benefit for doing so. Despite the
   seeming irrationality of such behavior, humans in laboratory settings
   routinely pay to punish others even in anonymous, one-shot settings.
   Costly punishment is ubiquitous among social organisms in general and is
   increasingly accepted as a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation.
   Yet if it is true that punishment explains cooperation, the evolution of
   altruistic punishment remains a mystery In a series of computer
   simulations I give agents the ability to punish one another while
   playing a continuous prisoner's dilemma. In simulations without social
   structure, expected behavior evolves agents do not punish and
   consequently no cooperation evolves. Likewise, in simulations with
   social structure but no ability to punish, no cooperation evolves.
   However, in simulations where agents are both embedded in a social
   structure and have the option to inflict costly punishment, cooperation
   evolves quite readily. This suggests a simple and broadly applicable
   explanation of cooperation for social organisms that have nonrandom
   social structure and a predisposition to punish one another. Results
   with scale-free networks further suggest that nodal degree distribution
   plays an important role in determining whether cooperation will evolve
   in a structured population.

AB The primary aims of the current study were to longitudinally examine the
   direct relationship between children's temperamental surgency and social
   behaviors as well as the moderating role of children's emotion
   regulation. A total of 90 4.5-year-old children participated in a
   laboratory visit where children's temperamental surgency was rated by
   experimenters and children's emotion regulation abilities were assessed.
   The summer before entry into first grade, children's social behaviors
   with unfamiliar peers were observed in the laboratory and mothers
   completed a questionnaire about children's social behaviors. Supporting
   our hypotheses, results revealed that children high in temperamental
   surgency developed more negative peer behaviors, whereas children low in
   temperamental surgency were more likely to develop behavioral wariness
   with peers. Emotion regulatory behaviors were found to moderate the
   relation between temperamental surgency and aggression, where
   high-surgent children who showed high levels of social support seeking
   were less likely to be rated by their mothers as high in aggression.
   Furthermore, results revealed that low-surgent children who showed high
   levels of distraction/self-soothing were more likely to show behavioral
   wariness around unfamiliar peers, whereas high-surgent children who used
   more distraction/self-soothing behaviors were rated by their mothers as
   lower in social competence. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objectives To measure empirically the influence of race and
   socioeconomic status (SES) on the diagnosis of child abuse and
   willingness to report to child protection services.
   Study design A total of 5000 pediatricians randomly selected from the
   American Medical Association's Masterfile received 1 of 4 randomly
   assigned versions of a fictional clinical presentation of a child
   (black/white + high SES/low SES) that described an unwitnessed event in
   a mobile 18-month-old child resulting in an oblique femur fracture.
   Outcome measures included ranking the degree to which the injury was
   accidental versus abuse and agreement with reporting the injury to child
   protection services.
   Results A total of 2109 of 4423 physicians responded (47.7%). Patient's
   race did not have an effect on a diagnosis of abuse (black, 45% versus
   white, 46%). Abuse was more likely to be diagnosed in patients with low
   SES (48% versus 43%, overall P = .02).
   Conclusion This study supports earlier work demonstrating physicians'
   greater willingness to consider abuse as a potential cause of injury in
   low SES children. It failed to demonstrate the finding of retrospective,
   real world studies of an increased likelihood to consider abuse in black
   patients. Future work should try to understand why there remains a
   differential approach to evaluating minority children for abuse in real
   world settings. (J Pediatr 2012;160:1003-8).

AB In this study, three cities located in the U.S. Corn Belt are evaluated
   for impacts of past (1992-2001) and projected (2001-2030) urban
   expansion on ecosystem goods and services, with a specific focus on
   changes in energy balance, hydrology, and productivity. Scenarios for
   high-, medium- and low-density urban areas are simulated using a dynamic
   agro-ecosystem model (Agro-IBIS), by incorporating new parameterizations
   for impervious surfaces and turf grass. Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m albedo data and remote sensing-derived
   30-m resolution maps from the U.S. National Land Cover Database are used
   as model input to simulate biogeochemical, thermodynamic, and
   hydrological cycles for a range of land-cover types in each region. The
   results show that the expanding urban areas have a significant impact on
   each city's capacity to regulate climate and flooding. High-density
   urban areas, for instance, have soil surface temperatures up to 6A
   degrees C higher than soils within natural and managed ecosystems.
   Expansion of turf grass in residential areas could require an additional
   8-105 million m(3) of water use annually, which increases runoff by
   15-48% and reduces the capacity to respond/adapt to flooding. Finally,
   the analysis shows that net primary productivity (NPP) decreases as
   expected due to the removal of cropland, forests, and grasslands in
   favor of development, but increased urban turf grass provides an annual
   offset of 40-210 g C m(-2). Urban expansion through 2030 is estimated to
   lower total annual crop production by 8.1, 8.6, and 16.7% for the
   Madison, Peoria, and Indianapolis regions, respectively. Given current
   projections for city growth to exceed 2-3% per year in the north-central
   U.S., urban expansion across a nine-state region in the Corn Belt could
   potentially take an additional 210,000-310,000 ha of farmland out of
   production annually at a time when demand for food, fuel, and fiber is
   increasing. Because conversion of cropland to urban uses is nearly
   always unidirectional, any changes to ecosystem goods and services due
   to urbanization are likely to be permanent and irreversible.

   for coeliac disease is lifelong adherence to a rigorous gluten-free
   diet. The present study aimed to evaluate the influence of coeliac
   disease on the social aspects of daily life of individuals in the USA.
   Methods: The present study used a self-administered survey including the
   standard Quality of Life questionnaire (12-item short-form) with
   validated disease-specific questions. sas statistical software 2010 (SAS
   Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to calculate the mean (SD). Results:
   Individuals with coeliac disease overall had a low positive health
   perception. Validated diet and disease-specific questions revealed a
   significant negative impact on quality of life in social settings.
   Specifically, the areas of travel, dining out and family life are most
   affected. The negative impact of diet significantly decreased over time,
   although it did not resolve for the domains of dining out of the home
   and travel. Those diagnosed in childhood and maintained on the diet had
   less of an impact on the quality of life as an adult. Conclusions:
   Individuals with coeliac disease in the USA have a diminished quality of
   life, especially in the social aspects of life.

AB Attributions modulate the impact of stressful events on mental health.
   However, little is known about attributions for discriminatory events
   and their relationship to psychosocial outcomes in sexual minority
   individuals. Relationships were examined between gay men's attributions
   for discrimination and their satisfaction with social support, a
   variable critical to mental health in this population. Gay men (N = 307)
   completed online measures of satisfaction with social support,
   attributions for discriminatory events, and key minority stress
   constructs. Self blaming attributions for discrimination were associated
   with decreased satisfaction with social support, independent of the
   frequency with which participants reported experiencing discrimination.
   The link between self blaming and satisfaction with social support was
   partially mediated by a latent affective construct comprised of anxiety,
   depression, and low positive affect. A moderation effect was also found,
   such that the relationship between frequency of perceived discriminatory
   events and dissatisfaction with social support was amplified for men
   reporting more blame toward perpetrators of discrimination. Results
   support attributions for discrimination as valuable additions to
   minority stress models. Assessing self and other blame for these
   discriminatory events may help to clarify pathways by which
   discrimination can undermine gay men's satisfaction with their social
   support networks.

   Patients sent for refraction in June 2009 were asked to rate their
   satisfaction with their eyeglasses. If they did not obtain eyeglasses,
   they were asked the reason e.g., cost, lost prescription, etc.
   Fifty-five percent (54/99) of patients who received a prescription did
   not obtain eyeglasses. The most common reason was cost (67 %).
   Eighty-eight percent of patients had some form of health insurance;
   however, 100 % were lacking eyeglasses coverage. The mean visual acuity
   pre-refraction was 20/80 versus 20/30 post-refraction (p < 0.001). It is
   well known that refractive error is a major cause of blindness
   worldwide, which negatively impacts the patient and their community.
   However, it is infrequently addressed that these conditions persist in
   parts of the develop world, including the United States. Los Angeles
   County Hospital is an example of an environment with many low-income
   patients in need of refractive correction who are limited mainly by cost
   in attaining eyeglasses. Furthermore, insurance organizations that cover
   low-income patients provide minimal or no coverage for prescription
   eyeglasses.

AB Background Socio-economic disparities in nutrition are well documented.
   This study tested the hypothesis that socio-economic differences in
   nutrient intakes can be accounted for, in part, by diet cost.
   Methods A representative sample of 1295 adults in King County (WA) was
   surveyed in 2008-2009, and usual dietary intakes were assessed based on
   a food-frequency questionnaire. The monetary value of individual diets
   was estimated using local retail supermarket prices for 384 foods.
   Nutrients of concern as identified by the 2005 Dietary Guidelines
   Advisory Committee were fibre, vitamins A, C and E, calcium, magnesium
   and potassium. A nutrient density score based on all seven nutrients was
   another dependent measure. General linear models and linear regressions
   were used to examine associations among education and income, nutrient
   density measure and diet cost. Analyses were conducted in 2009-2010.
   Results Controlling for energy and other covariates, higher-cost diets
   were significantly higher in all seven nutrients and in overall nutrient
   density. Higher education and income were positively and significantly
   associated with the nutrient density measure, but these effects were
   greatly attenuated with the inclusion of the cost variable in the model.
   Conclusions Socio-economic differences in nutrient intake can be
   substantially explained by the monetary cost of the diet. The higher
   cost of more nutritious diets may contribute to socio-economic
   disparities in health and should be taken into account in the
   formulation of nutrition and public health policy.

AB Objective To characterise the population that presents to the Accident
   and Emergency Centre (AEC) at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) and
   to identify risk factors associated with bypassing proximal care
   facilities. Methods A structured questionnaire was verbally administered
   to patients presenting to the AEC over 2 weeks. The questionnaire
   focused on the use of health care resources and characteristics of
   current illness or injury. Measures recorded include demographics,
   socioeconomic status, chief complaint, transportation and mobility,
   reasons for choosing KATH and health care service utilisation and cost.
   Results The total rate of bypassing proximal care was 33.9%. On
   multivariate analysis, factors positively associated with bypassing
   included age older than 38 years (OR: 2.18, P 0.04) and prior visits to
   facility (OR 2.88, P 0.01). Bypassers were less likely to be insured (OR
   0.31, P 0.01), to be seeking care due to injury (OR 0.42, P 0.03) and to
   have previously sought care for the problem (OR 0.10, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions Patients who bypass facilities near them to seek care at an
   urban AEC in Ghana do so for a combination of reasons including
   familiarity with the facility, chief complaint and insurance status.
   Understanding bypassing behaviour is important for guiding health care
   utilisation policy decisions and streamlining cost-effective,
   appropriate access to care for all patients.

   making, that is, the process through which cultural forms grow into
   being and are materially accomplished. I will do so through the study of
   the morphogenetic process through which the Spiral Jetty, an earthwork
   sculpture created by the American artist Robert Smithson, came into
   being. This study will show that artistic production constitutes an
   irreducible form of material practice which cannot be adequately
   understood as an individual activity or as an activity guided or
   constrained by 'external' social factors. As I shall argue, the
   attention to the material practice of artistic production reveals a much
   needed insight into the practices, materials and processes through which
   culture is actually produced and materially accomplished.

   explain how Adorno's argument concerning the critical dimension of
   aesthetic experience is useful for understanding this response. In
   addition, I invoke Adorno's dialectical understanding of art's
   'dual-character' in order to explain how critical art is possible within
   an art world dominated by market concerns. I also explore Walter
   Benjamin's contentions concerning the democratizing capacities of new

   their standing as judges of the creation and display of art. This
   article draws on Boltanski's and Thevenot's work on the sorts of
   justifications which arise when joint action is interrupted.
   Specifically, we look at the justifications embedded in two seemingly
   disparate critiques - one from Clement Greenberg dating from the 1950s
   and another by Michael Kimmelman from the 2000s. An investigation of the
   justifications used within these critiques - separated by over five
   decades - reveals how boundaries between art and its public have been
   generated and maintained over the years.

AB My paper proposes the concept of relational work to explain economic
   activity. In all economic action, I argue, people engage in the process
   of differentiating meaningful social relations. For each distinct
   category of social relations, people erect a boundary, mark the boundary
   by means of names and practices, establish a set of distinctive
   understandings that operate within that boundary, designate certain
   sorts of economic transactions as appropriate for the relation, bar
   other transactions as inappropriate, and adopt certain media for
   reckoning and facilitating economic transactions within the relation. I
   call that process relational work. After identifying specific elements
   of a relational work approach, the paper focuses on the case of monetary
   differentiation. It compares a relational work theory of earmarking
   money with behavioral economics' individually based mental accounting
   approach.

AB This paper attempts to clarify the concept of relational work for
   understanding economic life as proposed by Viviana Zelizer. To do so, it
   first compares the concept to similar notions used in other disciplinary
   fields. Second, it reinterprets some exemplary economic sociology
   studies by using the relational work lens to clarify the concept's
   utility for empirical analysis. Third, it speculates about the place of
   relational work in the theoretical toolkit of economic sociologists, in
   particular its relation to embeddedness. The paper concludes by arguing
   for the utility of the concept to integrate structural, cultural, and
   power-focused analyses of economic life, to highlight the
   often-overlooked role of emotions in economic exchange, and to ground an
   alternative to rational action theory in economic sociology.

   circuits emphasizes the script-like sequences and the existing cultural

   concept of performance circuits allows for Zelizer's concept of
   relational work to be applied in ethnographic studies of economic life,
   decomposing the constituent parts that enable the accomplishment of
   value in the marketplace. The paper opens with a dramaturgical
   performance at the United States Federal Reserve and then turns to
   microstudies of handicraft production, modern art markets, and
   neighborhood branding to demonstrate how one can study market dramas
   unfolding, sometimes unremarkably, emotions being generated, and
   background representations making loosely scripted actions
   understandable.

   roles or norms are ambiguous. It shows that the explicit identification
   of the role that relational work plays in those relationships story
   militates for-and extends, improves upon, and arguably completes-a
   particular understanding of what economic sociologists should mean when
   they talk about the "embedding" of the economic in social relations. The
   article hence shows the utility of jointly using otherwise disparate

AB This article provides an ecological framework for understanding
   adolescent-initiated parent abuse. We review research on
   adolescent-initiated parent abuse, identifying sociodemographic
   characteristics of perpetrators and victims (e.g., gender, age,
   race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status [SES]). Bronfenbrenner's [1]
   ecological systems theory is applied, which examines the risk and
   protective factors for adolescent-initiated parent abuse within micro-
   (maltreatment, domestic violence, parenting behavior and disciplinary
   strategies), meso- (peer influence), exo- (media influence), macro-
   (gender role socialization), and chronosystem (change in family
   structure) levels. Findings from our review suggest that older and White
   children are significantly more likely to abuse their parents. Females
   are selective in the target of their aggression, while males target
   family members in general. Mothers are significantly more likely to be
   abused than fathers. However, researchers also report variations in the
   association between SES and parent abuse. Domestic violence and child
   maltreatment are risk factors, while findings on parenting behavior and
   disciplinary strategies are mixed. Peer influence, exposure to media
   violence, gender role socialization, and change in family structure can
   potentially increase the risk of parent abuse. Practice and research
   implications are also discussed. An ecological systems framework allows
   for an examination of how various contexts interact and influence parent
   abuse behavior, and can provide needed directions for further research.

AB Past research has documented compromised development for teenage
   mothers' children compared to others, but less is known about predictors
   of school readiness among these children or among teenage fathers'
   children. Our multidimensional measures of high and low school readiness
   incorporated math, reading, and behavior scores and parent-reported
   health. Using parent interviews and direct assessments from the Early
   Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, we predicted high and low
   school readiness shortly before kindergarten among children born to a
   teenage mother and/or father (N a parts per thousand aEuro parts per
   thousand 800). Factors from five structural and interpersonal domains
   based on the School Transition Model were measured at two time points,
   including change between those time points, to capture the dynamic
   nature of early childhood. Four domains (socioeconomic resources,
   maternal characteristics, parenting, and exposure to adults) predicted
   high or low school readiness, but often not both. Promising factors
   associated with both high and low readiness among teen parents' children
   came from four domains: maternal education and gains in education
   (socioeconomic), maternal age of at least 18 and fewer depressive
   symptoms (maternal characteristics), socioemotional parenting quality
   and home environment improvements (parenting), and living with fewer
   children and receiving nonparental child care in infancy (exposure to
   adults). The findings preliminarily suggest policies that might improve
   school readiness: encouraging maternal education while supplying child
   care, focusing teen pregnancy prevention efforts on school-age girls,
   basic socioeconomic supports, and investments in mental health and
   high-quality home environments and parenting.

AB Much of the widespread poverty, environmental desecration, and waste of
   human life seen around the globe could be prevented by known (to
   humanity as a whole) technologies, many of which are simply not
   available to those that need it. This lack of access to critical
   information for sustainable development is directly responsible for a
   morally and ethically unacceptable level of human suffering and death. A
   solution to this general problem is the concept of open source
   appropriate technology or OSAT, which refers to technologies that
   provide for sustainable development while being designed in the same
   fashion as free and open source software. OSAT is made up of
   technologies that are easily and economically utilized from readily
   available resources by local communities to meet their needs and must
   meet the boundary conditions set by environmental, cultural, economic,
   and educational resource constraints of the local community. This paper
   explores both the open source and appropriate technology aspects of OSAT
   to create a paradigm, in which anyone can both learn how to make and use
   needed technologies free of intellectual property concerns. At the same
   time, anyone can also add to the collective open source knowledge
   ecosystem or knowledge commons by contributing ideas, designs,
   observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It is argued that
   if OSAT continues to grow and takes hold globally creating a vibrant
   virtual community to share technology plans and experiences, a new
   technological revolution built on a dispersed network of innovators
   working together to create a just sustainable world is possible.

AB Urban growth and development patterns have been implicated in the loss
   of ecosystem functioning, increased economic burdens on communities, and
   impacts to residents' human health. However, the effects of growth and
   development on the functioning of social systems are less understood. In
   this paper we present the findings of an interpretive study
   investigating two primary questions: (1) How do diverse stakeholders
   living and working in the urban-rural interface describe and
   characterize change in their communities? and (2) What are stakeholders'
   perceptions of urban growth consequences in their communities? 30 key
   informant interviews were conducted with stakeholders in two communities
   within the Lower Kaskaskia River watershed, Illinois. Community
   stakeholders, including business representatives, agricultural
   producers, community decision-makers, educators and natural resource
   professionals living and working at the urban-rural interface, provided
   rich insider perspectives on urban growth and its consequences for
   quality of life in their communities. Qualitative data analysis
   uncovered both shared and contested characterizations of change in the
   communities, such as loss of farmland, a more vital community economy,
   the decay of a sense of community, and cultural conflict. The study has
   implications for resource professionals, community planners and local
   actors by identifying potential urban growth consequences on residents'
   sense of place and community identity and offering a framework for
   monitoring the sociocultural impacts of land use change. (C) 2012

   Using a mixed-method approach combining spatial data and interview
   analyses, we investigate both the structural and behavioral aspects of
   amenity migration in San Juan and Okanogan counties of Washington State.
   Results indicate that second-home owners' desire for privacy and escape
   is reflected in patterns of spatial isolation among second homes in the
   study area. These patterns have potentially significant ecological
   effects. Second-home owners also seek to protect their investments by
   supporting regulations which support their version of a rural idyll.
   Therefore, policy-makers should be wary of strategies to promote
   regulations which promote aesthetic rather than social and ecological

AB Purpose: Degrees of nutrient intake and food groups have been linked to
   differential chronic disease risk. However, intakes of specific
   nutrients may also be associated with differential diet costs and
   unobserved differences in socioeconomic status (SES). The present study
   examined degrees of nutrient intake, for every key nutrient in the diet,
   in relation to diet cost and SES.
   Methods: Socio-demographic data for a stratified random sample of adult
   respondents in the Seattle Obesity Study were obtained through telephone
   survey. Dietary intakes were assessed using food frequency questionnaire
   (FFQ) (n = 1,266). Following standard procedures, nutrient intakes were
   energy-adjusted using the residual method and converted into quintiles.
   Diet cost for each respondent was estimated using Seattle supermarket
   retail prices for 384 FFQ component foods.
   Results: Higher intakes of dietary fiber, vitamins A, C, D, E, and B12,
   beta carotene, folate, iron, calcium, potassium, and magnesium were
   associated with higher diet costs. The cost gradient was most pronounced
   for vitamin C, beta carotene, potassium, and magnesium. Higher intakes
   of saturated fats, trans fats and added sugars were associated with
   lower diet costs. Lower cost lower quality diets were more likely to be
   consumed by lower SES.
   Conclusion: Nutrients commonly associated with a lower risk of chronic
   disease were associated with higher diet costs. By contrast, nutrients
   associated with higher disease risk were associated with lower diet
   costs. The cost variable may help somewhat explain why lower income
   groups fail to comply with dietary guidelines and have highest rates of
   diet related chronic disease.

AB Cognitive neuroscientists often study social cognition by using simple
   but socially relevant stimuli, such as schematic faces or images of
   other people. Whilst this research is valuable, important aspects of
   genuine social encounters are absent from these studies, a fact that has
   recently drawn criticism. In the present review we argue for an
   empirical approach to the determination of the equivalence of different
   social stimuli. This approach involves the systematic comparison of
   different types of social stimuli ranging in their approximation to a
   real social interaction. In garnering support for this cognitive
   ethological approach, we focus on recent research in social attention
   that has involved stimuli ranging from simple schematic faces to real
   social interactions. We highlight both meaningful similarities and
   differences in various social attentional phenomena across these
   different types of social stimuli thus validating the utility of the
   research initiative. Furthermore, we argue that exploring these
   similarities and differences will provide new insights into social
   cognition and social neuroscience.

AB As a defining characteristic of Mesoamerican civilization, the ballgame
   has a long and poorly understood history. Because the ballgame is
   associated with the rise of complex societies, understanding its origins
   also illuminates the evolution of socio-politically complex societies.
   Although initial evidence, in the form of ceramic figurines, dates to
   1700 BCE, and the oldest known ballcourt dates to 1600 BCE, the ritual
   paraphernalia and ideology associated with the game appear around 1400
   BCE, the start of the so-called Early Horizon, defined by the spread of
   Olmec-style symbols across Mesoamerica. Early Horizon evidence of
   ballgame paraphernalia both identical to and different from that of the
   Gulf Coast Olmec can be seen on figurines from coastal Chiapas and the
   central highlands of Mexico, respectively. The Mexican state of Oaxaca,
   however, has yielded little data on early involvement in the ballgame.
   The discovery of a ballplayer figurine in the Mixteca Alta region of
   Oaxaca demonstrates the early participation of this region in the
   iconography and ideology of the ballgame. In lieu of an actual
   ballcourt, the focus may have been on the symbolic component of
   ballplayers and their association with supernatural forces, as part of
   emerging leaders' legitimization strategies.

AB As the world grows less biologically diverse, it is becoming less
   linguistically and culturally diverse as well. Biologists estimate
   annual loss of species at 1,000 times or more greater than historic
   rates, and linguists predict that 50-90% of the world's languages will
   disappear by the end of this century. Prior studies indicate
   similarities in the geographic arrangement of biological and linguistic
   diversity, although conclusions have often been constrained by use of
   data with limited spatial precision. Here we use greatly improved
   datasets to explore the co-occurrence of linguistic and biological
   diversity in regions containing many of the Earth's remaining species:
   biodiversity hotspots and high biodiversity wilderness areas. Results
   indicate that these regions often contain considerable linguistic
   diversity, accounting for 70% of all languages on Earth. Moreover, the
   languages involved are frequently unique (endemic) to particular
   regions, with many facing extinction. Likely reasons for co-occurrence
   of linguistic and biological diversity are complex and appear to vary
   among localities, although strong geographic concordance between
   biological and linguistic diversity in many areas argues for some form
   of functional connection. Languages in high biodiversity regions also
   often co-occur with one or more specific conservation priorities, here
   defined as endangered species and protected areas, marking particular
   localities important for maintaining both forms of diversity. The
   results reported in this article provide a starting point for focused
   research exploring the relationship between biological and
   linguistic-cultural diversity, and for developing integrated strategies
   designed to conserve species and languages in regions rich in both.

   both inequalities and conflicts within groups. In contrast to the
   adoption of a better tool or a more productive crop, which can be
   adopted by a single individual, a new institution works only if most
   people adopt it. This explains why collective action against those
   benefitting from the status quo at the expense of others, as well as
   conflict between groups governed by different norms and institutions,
   figures so prominently in our capacity to adapt to changing

AB Background: People with autism have abnormal preferences, ranging from
   an apparent lack of preference for social stimuli to unusually strong
   preferences for restricted sets of highly idiosyncratic stimuli. Yet the
   profile of preferences across social and nonsocial domains has not been
   mapped out in detail, and the processes responsible remain poorly
   understood.
   Methods: To assess preferences across a range of stimuli, we measured
   real monetary donations to 50 charities spanning categories pertaining
   to people, mental health, animals, or the environment. We compared the
   donations made by 16 high-functioning adults with autism to those made
   by neurotypical controls matched on age, gender and education. We
   additionally collected ratings of how people evaluated the different
   charities.
   Results: Compared with controls, high-functioning adults with autism
   donated less overall and also showed a significantly disproportionate
   reduction in donations to people charities compared with donations to
   the other charities. Furthermore, whereas controls discriminated
   strongly between different people charities, choosing to donate a lot of
   money to some and very little to others, much less discrimination was
   seen in the autism group. Ratings that probed how participants
   constructed their preferences did not differ between groups, except for
   a difference in the perceived impact of pictures and text information
   about people charities. Strikingly, there were some charities related to
   mental health, and autism in particular, to which the autism group
   donated considerably more than did the controls.
   Conclusions: People with autism were found to have reduced preference
   and sensitivity towards charities benefiting other people. The findings
   provide evidence for a domain-specific impairment in social cognition in
   autism spectrum disorder, and in particular in linking otherwise intact
   social knowledge to the construction of value signals on which
   preferences regarding other people are based.

AB The purpose of the present study was to examine the relative association
   of genetic and environmental factors with individual differences in each
   of the proximal, jointly necessary, and sufficient causes for suicidal
   behavior, according to the Interpersonal-Psychological Theory of Suicide
   (IPTS; joiner, 2005). We examined data on derived scales measuring
   acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness (the determinants
   of suicidal behavior, according to theory) from 348 adolescent male
   twins. Univariate biometrical models were used to estimate the magnitude
   of additive genetic (A), non-additive genetic (D), shared environmental
   (C), and non-shared environmental (E) effects associated with the
   variance in acquired capability, belongingness, and burdensomeness. The
   best fitting model for the acquired capability allowed for additive
   genetic and environmental effects, whereas the best fitting model for
   burdensomeness and belongingness allowed for shared and non-shared
   environmental effects. The present research extends prior work by
   specifying the environmental and genetic contributions to the components
   of the IPTS, and our findings suggest that belongingness and
   burdensomeness may be more appropriate targets for clinical intervention
   than acquired capability as these factors may be more malleable or
   amenable to change. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Although attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is frequently
   comorbid with disruptive behavior disorders, less is known about ADHD
   and comorbid anxiety. To improve understanding about the association of
   anxiety and social functioning, we studied 223 6 to 9 year-old
   ethnically diverse boys and girls (M = 7.4 years) with and without ADHD.
   According to parents, children with ADHD and anxiety (n = 46) and ADHD
   only (n = 71) were consistently less socially competent than comparison
   children (i.e., no anxiety and ADHD: n = 80) and children with anxiety
   only (n = 26), who did not differ from one another. A similar pattern
   emerged for teacher ratings where youth with ADHD only and ADHD with
   anxiety exhibited the most social problems, but they did not differ from
   each other. These data suggest that comorbid anxiety does not exacerbate
   social dysfunction among 6 to 9 year-old children with ADHD. We consider
   findings within a developmental psychopathology framework to further
   understand social development in children with ADHD and anxiety. (C)

AB Using a population-based, panel survey, we study how egocentric social
   networks change over time, and the relationship between egocentric
   network properties and health and pro-social behaviors. We find that the
   number of prosocial activities is strongly positively associated with
   having more friends, or an increase in degree, with approximately 0.04
   more prosocial behaviors expected for every friend added. Moreover,
   having more friends is associated with an improvement in health, while
   being healthy and prosocial is associated with closer relationships.
   Specifically, a unit increase in health is associated with an expected
   0.45 percentage-point increase in average closeness, while adding a
   prosocial activity is associated with a 0.46 percentage-point increase
   in the closeness of one's relationships. Furthermore, a tradeoff between
   degree and closeness of social contacts was observed. As the number of
   close social contacts increases by one, the estimated average closeness
   of each individual contact decreases by approximately three
   percentage-points. The increased awareness of the importance of
   spillover effects in health and health care makes the ascertainment of
   egocentric social networks a valuable complement to investigations of
   the relationship between socioeconomic factors and health.

AB Neighborhood-level interventions provide an opportunity to better
   understand the impact that neighborhoods have on health. In 2004,
   municipal authorities in Medellin, Colombia, built a public transit
   system to connect isolated low-income neighborhoods to the city's urban
   center. Transit-oriented development was accompanied by municipal
   investment in neighborhood infrastructure. In this study, the authors
   examined the effects of this exogenous change in the built environment
   on violence. Neighborhood conditions and violence were assessed in
   intervention neighborhoods (n = 25) and comparable control neighborhoods
   (n = 23) before (2003) and after (2008) completion of the transit
   project, using a longitudinal sample of 466 residents and homicide
   records from the Office of the Public Prosecutor. Baseline differences
   between these groups were of the same magnitude as random assignment of
   neighborhoods would have generated, and differences that remained after
   propensity score matching closely resembled imbalances produced by
   paired randomization. Permutation tests were used to estimate
   differential change in the outcomes of interest in intervention
   neighborhoods versus control neighborhoods. The decline in the homicide
   rate was 66% greater in intervention neighborhoods than in control
   neighborhoods (rate ratio = 0.33, 95% confidence interval: 0.18, 0.61),
   and resident reports of violence decreased 75% more in intervention
   neighborhoods (odds ratio = 0.25, 95% confidence interval 0.11, 0.67).
   These results show that interventions in neighborhood physical
   infrastructure can reduce violence.

AB This paper introduces urban land teleconnections as a conceptual
   framework that explicitly links land changes to underlying urbanization
   dynamics. We illustrate how three key themes that are currently
   addressed separately in the urban sustainability and land change
   literatures can lead to incorrect conclusions and misleading results
   when they are not examined jointly: the traditional system of land
   classification that is based on discrete categories and reinforces the
   false idea of a rural-urban dichotomy; the spatial quantification of
   land change that is based on place-based relationships, ignoring the
   connections between distant places, especially between urban functions
   and rural land uses; and the implicit assumptions about path dependency
   and sequential land changes that underlie current conceptualizations of
   land transitions. We then examine several environmental "grand
   challenges" and discuss how urban land teleconnections could help
   research communities frame scientific inquiries. Finally, we point to
   existing analytical approaches that can be used to advance development
   and application of the concept.

AB Background: New combination vaccines reduce the number of injections
   needed for immunization. However, possible drawbacks include higher
   prices, extra doses of vaccine antigens and increased minor adverse
   events. Our objective was to measure parental and societal values for
   attributes of childhood combination vaccines.
   Methods: We conducted a discrete choice experiment using an online
   survey of adults administered by Knowledge Networks. Values were
   measured for attributes of combination vaccines for a hypothetical child
   aged 6 months: (1) number of injections, (2) extra dose of hepatitis B
   vaccine, (3) 20% higher chance of fever, (4) community-level
   immunization coverage of 2-year-olds of 90% or 80%, and (5) cost per
   visit. Logistic regression with generalized estimating equations was
   used to analyze the value of different attributes and generate a
   marginal willingness-to-pay for a change in attribute level.
   Results: The response rate was 64% (N = 558). Most respondents were
   parents (63%) and most respondents agreed that combination vaccines were
   safe (77%). Respondents were willing to pay $7.68 to avoid an injection
   (compared to $9.94 when looking at parents only). However, respondents
   were willing to pay $41.57 to avoid higher risk of fever after one set
   of immunizations (10% versus 30%) and $65.42 for higher immunization
   coverage rates. These results were very similar for parents only. There
   was no significant preference to avoid an extra dose of hepatitis B
   vaccine.
   Conclusions: Respondents were willing to pay larger amounts to avoid
   increased risk of minor adverse events and to increase community-level
   immunization coverage than to avoid injections. These values should be
   taken into account when determining the risks and benefits of
   combination vaccines. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Research in industrial countries suggests that, with no other knowledge
   about a person, positive traits are attributed to taller people and
   correspondingly, that taller people have slightly better socioeconomic
   status (SES). However, research in some non-industrialized contexts has
   shown no correlation or even negative correlations between height and
   socioeconomic outcomes. It remains unclear whether positive traits
   remain attributed to taller people in such contexts. To address this
   question, here we report the results of a study in a foraging-farming
   society of native Amazonians in Bolivia (Tsimane')-a group in which we
   have previously shown little association between height and
   socioeconomic outcomes. We showed 24 photographs of pairs of Tsimane'
   women, men, boys, and girls to 40 women and 40 men >16 years of age. We
   presented four behavioral scenarios to each participant and asked them
   to point to the person in the photograph with greater strength,
   dominance, social concern, or knowledge. The pairs in the photographs
   were of the same sex and age, but one person was shorter. Tsimane' women
   and men attributed greater strength, dominance, and knowledge to taller
   girls and boys, but they did not attribute most positive traits to
   taller adults, except for strength, and more social concern only when
   women assessed other women in the photographs. These results raise a
   puzzle: why would Tsimane' attribute positive traits to tall children,
   but not tall adults? We propose three potential explanations: adults'
   expectations about the more market integrated society in which their
   children will grow up, height as a signal of good child health, and
   children's greater variation in the traits assessed corresponding to
   maturational stages.

AB Background: Low-socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with a higher
   colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality. Screening with
   colonoscopy, the most commonly used test in the US, has been shown to
   reduce the risk of death from CRC. This study examined if, among insured
   persons receiving care in integrated healthcare delivery systems,
   differences exist in colonoscopy use according to neighborhood SES.
   Methods: We assembled a retrospective cohort of 100,566 men and women,
   50-74 years old, who had been enrolled in one of three US health plans
   for >= 1 year on January 1, 2000. Subjects were followed until the date
   of first colonoscopy, date of disenrollment from the health plan, or
   December 31, 2007, whichever occurred first. We obtained data on
   colonoscopy use from administrative records. We defined screening
   colonoscopy as an examination that was not preceded by gastrointestinal
   conditions in the prior 6-month period. Neighborhood SES was measured
   using the percentage of households in each subject's census-tract with
   an income below 1999 federal poverty levels based on 2000 US census
   data. Analyses, adjusted for demographics and comorbidity index, were
   performed using Weibull regression models.
   Results: The average age of the cohort was 60 years and 52.7% were
   female. During 449,738 person-years of follow-up, fewer subjects in the
   lowest SES quartile (Q1) compared to the highest quartile (Q4) had any
   colonoscopy (26.7% vs. 37.1%) or a screening colonoscopy (7.6% vs.
   13.3%). In regression analyses, compared to Q4, subjects in Q1 were 16%
   (adjusted HR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.80-0.88) less likely to undergo any
   colonoscopy and 30%(adjusted HR = 0.70, CI: 0.65-0.75) less likely to
   undergo a screening colonoscopy.
   Conclusion: People in lower-SES neighborhoods are less likely to undergo
   a colonoscopy, even among insured subjects receiving care in integrated
   healthcare systems. Removing health insurance barriers alone is unlikely
   to eliminate disparities in colonoscopy use.

AB Imagined futures, once a vital topic of theoretical inquiry within the
   sociology of culture, have been sidelined in recent decades. Rational
   choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth
   aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This
   article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive
   sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and
   present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism
   appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and
   archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling,
   the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce
   educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort,
   unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be
   interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a
   virtuous identity, claims to be "one who aspires."

AB In the last two decades classical sociology, notably Marx, has been
   mined for environmental insights in the attempt to surmount the "human
   exemptionalism" of post-Second World War sociology. Weber, however, has
   remained an enigma in this respect. This article addresses Weber's
   approach to the environment, including its significance for his
   interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For
   Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical
   realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy
   scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways
   within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to
   constructing a meaningful postexemptionalist sociology.

AB Ladakh presents some unique challenges for development and nature
   conservation initiatives. Since opening to tourism in 1974, its unique
   landscapes, biodiversity, and culture have attracted adventure-seeking
   tourists from all over the world. Tourism, especially in the past few
   decades, has developed very rapidly, bringing many economic and social
   changes with adverse environmental impacts. By recognizing the threats
   posed by unplanned tourism, a number of organizations and institutions
   working in the area felt the urgency to initiate sustainable
   community-based tourism projects that would protect the local wildlife
   and natural resources and offer alternative livelihood opportunities to
   the local population. The homestay model in Ladakh is designed on the
   principle of equitable access and hence is available for adoption by
   households across economic classes. This article uses the particular
   case of Korzok homestays, implemented by the World Wide Fund For Nature
   (WWF-India) near the Ramsar wetland Tsomoriri, to illustrate how
   community development needs can be integrated with conservation goals.
   It elaborates on the evolution of the initiative, some early impacts,
   and how the initiative might evolve in the future. A general list of
   recommendations is also presented.

AB The debate about abortion regret rests on competing assumptions about
   women's attachment to pregnancy. Antiabortion claimants argue women
   always attach to pregnancy (inevitably regretting abortion), while
   abortion rights supporters counter that women do not attach to
   pregnancies they choose to terminate (feeling relief instead). Neither
   assumption explains women's experience; research shows that attachment
   is discursively produced. Using interview data from 21 women, this study
   moves past these political claims to empirically identify three sources
   of women's emotional difficulty around abortion: social disapproval,
   romantic relationship loss, and head versus heart conflict. Findings
   point to the importance of attention to women's lived experience and

   associations between children's HL proficiency and supportive family
   climate were examined in Chinese immigrant families with pre-school-aged
   children. Parental warmth, cultural maintenance values, and use of HL
   support were investigated as aspects of family climate. Measures
   included observable parent-child interactions and performance-based
   language proficiency assessments. While parental cultural maintenance
   values appeared influential, parental behavioral support of HL showed
   more robust prospective associations with children's HL development.
   Concurrently, children's earlier HL proficiency predicted subsequent
   parental behavior; parents whose children had limited HL proficiency
   decreased their use of HL support 1 later. Implications of the findings
   are discussed for immigrant parents with young children.

AB Policy makers dealing with complex systems oftentimes rely on "linear
   thinking." This is understandable due to the ease and convenience
   offered by the simplicity of such conceptualization. Although this line
   of thinking may help facilitate decision making processes, it is only as
   defensible as the degree at which the system under consideration behaves
   linearly. Recent work shows that diverse properties of cities exhibit
   power-law relationships with population size. Such relationships may
   invalidate the reliance on linear thinking. Furthermore, in the era of
   globalization, resources and people move virtually freely through bounds
   of any confines used to define a system. We incorporate into a simple
   resource-population model the power-law scaling behavior and the
   influence of import and immigration, and investigate their effects on
   sustainable growth of communities. We explore through bifurcation
   analysis the different scenarios of how an unsustainable system could be
   sustained. Import can be effective if: the import exceeds a critical
   level and a critical mass of people populates the system. In contrast,
   increasing immigration alone can rescue the intrinsically unsustainable
   system, both directly through people entering the system and indirectly
   by increasing its harvesting ability, although critical values exist
   that cause the population to sharply rise or shrink. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Background Understanding childhood obesity's root causes is critical to
   the creation of strategies to improve our children's health. We sought
   to define the association between childhood obesity and household income
   and how household income and childhood behaviors promote childhood
   obesity.
   Methods We assessed body mass index in 109,634 Massachusetts children,
   identifying the percentage of children who were overweight/obese versus
   the percentage of children in each community residing in low-income
   homes. We compared activity patterns and diet in 999 sixth graders
   residing in 4 Michigan communities with varying annual household income.
   Results In Massachusetts, percentage of overweight/obese by community
   varied from 9.6% to 42.8%. As household income dropped, percentage of
   overweight/obese children rose. In Michigan sixth graders, as household
   income goes down, frequency of fried food consumption per day doubles
   from 0.23 to 0.54 (P < .002), and daily TV/video time triples from 0.55
   to 2.00 hours (P < .001), whereas vegetable consumption and
   moderate/vigorous exercise go down.
   Conclusions The prevalence of overweight/obese children rises in
   communities with lower household income. Children residing in lower
   income communities exhibit poorer dietary and physical activity
   behaviors, which affect obesity. (Am Heart J 2012;163:836-43.)

AB Racial/ethnic minorities experience persistent health disparities due in
   part to their exposure to chronic SES and psychosocial risk. The
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and its hormonal end product,
   cortisol, are believed to mediate the associations between chronic
   stress and poor health. In this study, racial/ethnic differences in
   diurnal salivary cortisol rhythms in 179 preadolescent youths and the
   contributing roles of SES risk, psychosocial risk, perceived
   discrimination, harsh parenting, and parental monitoring were examined.
   The analyses revealed racial/ethnic differences in diurnal cortisol
   rhythms, with African Americans having significantly flatter
   morning-to-evening cortisol slopes than Caucasians and with Latinos
   having significantly lower evening cortisol levels than Caucasians.
   Greater psychosocial risk and less parental monitoring were associated
   with flatter cortisol slopes. Racial/ethnic differences on the cortisol
   measures persisted when controlling for SES, psychosocial risk, and
   parenting quality. The need to assess chronic risk across the lifespan
   and disentangle possible genetic from environmental contributors is
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   clinicians and administrators from primary care clinics for the
   underserved. Individual interviews were conducted, followed by a
   combined focus group with administrators from three jurisdictions; there
   were three focus groups with clinicians from each clinic system. Common
   themes were identified, and responses from groups were compared.
   Administrators and clinicians report extensive trauma histories among
   patients. Clinician barriers include lack of time, patient resistance,
   and inadequate referral options; administrators cite reimbursement
   issues, staff training, and lack of clarity about the term trauma. A key
   facilitator is doctor-patient relationship There were differences in
   perceived barriers and facilitators at the institutional and clinical
   levels for mental health care for patients with trauma. Importantly,
   there is agreement about better access to and development of
   trauma-specific interventions. Findings will aid the development and
   implementation of trauma-focused interventions embedded in primary care.

AB This article introduces a novel observational ambulatory monitoring
   method called the electronically activated recorder (EAR). The EAR is a
   digital audio recorder that runs on a handheld computer and periodically
   and unobtrusively records snippets of ambient sounds from participants'
   momentary environments. In tracking moment-to-moment ambient sounds, it
   yields acoustic logs of people's days as they naturally unfold. In
   sampling only a fraction of the time, it protects participants' privacy
   and makes large observational studies feasible. As a naturalistic
   observation method, it provides an observer's account of daily life and
   is optimized for the objective assessment of audible aspects of social
   environments, behaviors, and interactions (e.g., habitual preferences
   for social settings, idiosyncratic interaction styles, subtle emotional
   expressions). This article discusses the EAR method conceptually and
   methodologically, reviews prior research with it, and identifies three
   concrete ways in which it can enrich psychosomatic research.
   Specifically, it can a) calibrate psychosocial effects on health against
   frequencies of real-world behavior; b) provide ecological observational
   measures of health-related social. processes that are independent of
   self-report; and c) help with the assessment of subtle and habitual
   social behaviors that evade self-report but have important health
   implications. An important avenue for future research lies in merging
   traditional self-report based ambulatory monitoring methods with
   observational approaches such as the EAR to allow for the simultaneous
   yet methodologically independent assessment of inner, experiential
   aspects (e.g., loneliness) and outer, observable aspects (e.g., social
   isolation) of real-world social processes to reveal their unique effects
   on health.

AB Introduction: Relatively little is known about the socioeconomic
   correlates of phthalate metabolite urine concentrations among the
   general population, exposures of increasing public health concern,
   particularly for women of reproductive age. Methods: We pooled data from
   the 2001-2008 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey to examine the associations between phthalate metabolite
   concentrations (including the molar sum of four di-2-ethylhexyl
   phthalate (DEHP) metabolites, the molar sum of two dibutyl phthalate
   (DBP) metabolites, and metabolites of benzylbutyl phthalate (BzBP) and
   diethyl phthalate (DEP)) with socioeconomic indicators (including
   ethnicity, education, income, and food security status) among women 20
   to 39 years age. We also derived a socioeconomic status summary measure
   using factor analysis and investigated its associations with metabolite
   concentrations. Results: In fully adjusted models, the lowest quartile
   of overall socioeconomic status was associated with 1.83 (95%
   CI=1.54-2.17) times the concentrations of mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP),
   and 0.72 (95% CI=0.54-0.98) times the concentrations of (molar sum) DEHP
   metabolites compared with the highest quartile of overall socioeconomic
   status. This latter association was driven primarily by educational
   attainment. All Non-White ethnicities combined had 1.24 (95%
   CI=1.09-1.40) times the concentrations of (molar sum) DBP metabolites,
   1.32 (95% CI=1.12-1.56) times the mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP)
   concentrations, and 0.82 (95% CI=0.71-0.96) the concentrations of MBzP
   of Non-Hispanic Whites. Conclusions: Biomarkers of phthalate exposure
   vary with socioeconomic factors in women of reproductive age in the
   United States. Given the public health concern surrounding phthalate
   exposure, more research is needed to elucidate the reasons for these
   differences. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Tobacco use greatly contributes to overall socioeconomic health
   disparities, and physicians are a major source of information about
   effective methods for tobacco cessation. This study examined the tobacco
   intervention practices of primary care physicians in Arkansas who treat
   a high proportion of lower socioeconomic status patients. More than 70%
   of respondents' patients were covered by Medicaid and/or Medicare or
   paid for primary care services without health insurance. Although
   physicians were highly motivated and considered cessation to be very
   important, 74% had no training of any kind in the treatment of tobacco
   dependence and familiarity with the free treatment services in Arkansas
   was low. Younger and nonwhite physicians and physicians with any type of
   training in treating tobacco dependence reported more positive
   attitudes, more frequent intervention behaviors and more familiarity
   with treatment services. More frequently seeing the effects of tobacco
   use on the health of patients as well as increased knowledge,
   preparedness, and perceived effectiveness of treatments were related to
   a higher frequency of providing cessation assistance. More frequently
   seeing the effects of tobacco use on patients, as well as increased
   familiarity with treatment services were related to a higher frequency
   of referring patients to treatment services. These findings suggest that
   training experiences that increase physician awareness of the
   multiplicity of consequences of tobacco use as well as increase
   knowledge, preparedness, perceived effectiveness of treatments and
   familiarity with treatment services will increase the frequency with
   which physicians assist and refer this important patient population.

AB Objective: To examine associations of television viewing with eating
   behaviors in a representative sample of US adolescents.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Public and private schools in the United States during the
   2009-2010 school year.
   Participants: A total of 12 642 students in grades 5 to 10 (mean [SD]
   age, 13.4[0.09] years; 86.5% participation).
   Main Exposures: Television viewing (hours per day) and snacking while
   watching television (days per week).
   Main Outcome Measures: Eating (>= 1 instance per day) fruit, vegetables,
   sweets, and sugary soft drinks; eating at a fast food restaurant (>= 1
   d/wk); and skipping breakfast (>= 1 d/wk).
   Results: Television viewing was inversely related to intake of fruit
   (adjusted odds ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) and vegetables (0.95;
   0.91-1.00) and positively related to intake of candy (1.18; 1.14-1.23)
   and fast food (1.14; 1.09-1.19) and skipping breakfast (1.06; 1.02-1.10)
   after adjustment for socioeconomic factors, computer use, and physical
   activity. Television snacking was related to increased intake of fruit
   (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10), candy (1.20; 1.16-1.24),
   soda (1.15; 1.11-1.18), and fast food (1.09; 1.06-1.13), independent of
   television viewing. The relationships of television viewing with fruit
   and vegetable intake and with skipping breakfast were essentially
   unchanged after adjustment for television snacking; the relationships
   with intake of candy, soda, and fast food were moderately attenuated.
   Age and race/ethnicity modified relationships of television viewing with
   soda and fast food intake and with skipping breakfast.
   Conclusion: Television viewing was associated with a cluster of
   unhealthy eating behaviors in US adolescents after adjustment for
   socioeconomic and behavioral covariates. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2012;

AB Recent breast cancer treatment studies conducted in large urban settings
   have reported racial disparities in the appropriate use of adjuvant
   chemotherapy. This article presents the first focused evaluation of
   black-white differences in receipt and completion of chemotherapy for
   breast cancer in a primarily rural region of the United States. We
   performed chart abstraction on initial therapy received by 868 women
   diagnosed with Stages I, IIA, IIB, or IIIA breast cancer in 2001-2003 in
   southwest Georgia (SWGA). For chemotherapy, information collected
   included treatment plan, dates of delivery, concordance between therapy
   planned and received, and date and reasons for end of treatment. The
   patient's age at diagnosis, race, marital status, insurance coverage,
   hormone receptor status, comorbidities, socioeconomic status,
   urban/rural status, treatment site, and distance to the site were also
   collected. Following univariate analyses, we used multivariable logistic
   regression modeling to examine the impact of race on the likelihood of
   (1) receiving chemotherapy and (2) completing planned chemotherapy. For
   patients terminating chemotherapy prematurely, the reasons were
   documented. The results showed that the unadjusted black-white
   difference in receipt of chemotherapy (48.3 vs. 36.0%) was significant,
   but in the multivariable analysis the black-white odds ratio (OR = 1.18)
   was not. While the unadjusted black-white difference (92.0 vs. 87.8%) in
   completing chemotherapy was not significant, in multivariable models
   black race was positively associated with completing care (p ranging
   from 0.032 to 0.087 and OR, correspondingly, from 2.16 to 2.64). The
   impact of race on completing chemotherapy was influenced by marital
   status, with a significant black-white difference for patients not
   married (OR = 4.67), but no difference for those married (OR = 1.06). We
   find compelling racial differences in this largely rural region-with
   black breast cancer patients receiving or completing chemotherapy at
   rates that equal or exceed white patients. Further investigation is
   warranted, both in SWGA and in other rural regions.

AB Though larger social networks are associated with reduced breast cancer
   mortality, there is a need to clarify how both social support and social
   burden influence this association. We included 4,530 women from the
   Women's Health Initiative who were diagnosed with breast cancer between
   1993 and 2009, and provided data on social networks (spouse or intimate
   partner, religious ties, club ties, and number of first-degree
   relatives) before diagnosis. Of those, 354 died during follow-up, with
   190 from breast cancer. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to
   evaluate associations of social network members with risk of
   post-diagnosis mortality, further evaluating associations by social
   support and social burden (caregiving, social strain). In
   multivariate-adjusted analyses, among women with high but not low social
   support, being married was related to lower all-cause mortality. By
   contrast, among women with high but not low social burden, those with a
   higher number of first-degree relatives, including siblings, parents,
   and children, had higher all-cause and breast cancer mortality (among
   caregivers: 0-3 relatives (ref), 4-5 relatives, HR = 1.47 (95% CI:
   0.62-3.52), 6-9 relatives, HR = 2.08 (95% CI: 0.89-4.86), 10+ relatives,
   HR = 3.55 (95% CI: 1.35-9.33), P-continuous = 0.02, P-interaction =
   0.008). The association by social strain was similar though it was not
   modified by level of social support. Other social network members were
   unrelated to mortality. Social relationships may have both adverse and
   beneficial influences on breast cancer survival. Clarifying these
   depends on understanding the context of women's relationships.

AB BACKGROUND: The global focus on improved cookstoves (ICSs) and clean
   fuels has increased because of their potential for delivering triple
   dividends: household health, local environmental quality, and regional
   climate benefits. However, ICS and clean fuel dissemination programs
   have met with low rates of adoption.
   OBJECTIVES: We reviewed empirical studies on ICSs and fuel choice to
   describe the literature, examine determinants of fuel and stove choice,
   and identify knowledge gaps.
   METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the
   adoption of ICSs or cleaner fuels by households in developing countries.
   Results are synthesized through a simple vote-counting meta-analysis.
   RESULTS: We identified 32 research studies that reported 146 separate
   regression analyses of ICS adoption (11 analyses) or fuel choice (135
   analyses) from Asia (60%), Africa (27%), and Latin America (19%). Most
   studies apply multivariate regression methods to consider 7-13
   determinants of choice. Income, education, and urban location were
   positively associated with adoption in most but not all studies.
   However, the influence of fuel availability and prices, household size
   and composition, and sex is unclear. Potentially important drivers such
   as credit, supply-chain strengthening, and social marketing have been
   ignored.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adoption studies of ICSs or clean energy are scarce,
   scattered, and of differential quality, even though global distribution
   programs are quickly expanding. Future research should examine an
   expanded set of contextual variables to improve implementation of stove
   programs that can realize the "win-win-win" of health, local
   environmental quality, and climate associated with these technologies.

AB Elucidating how inequity aversion (a tendency to dislike and correct
   unequal outcomes) functions as one develops is important to
   understanding more complex fairness considerations in adulthood.
   Although previous research has demonstrated that adults and children
   reduce inequity, it is unclear if people are actually responding
   negatively to inequity or if people dislike others getting more than
   them (motivated by social comparison) and like to share maximal
   resources, especially with those who have few resources (motivated by
   social welfare preferences). In order to evaluate if children are truly
   averse to inequity, we had 3-to 8-year-old children distribute resources
   to 3rd parties and found that 6- to 8-year-old children would rather
   throw a resource in the trash than distribute unequally, suggesting that
   concerns with equity can trump concerns with maximal sharing. We also
   demonstrated that children's reactions were not based on wanting to
   avoid upsetting the recipients or based on a preference for visual
   symmetry and that children will even throw away a resource that could
   have gone to themselves in order to avoid inequity. These results
   demonstrate the existence of inequity aversion in children, provide a
   new method for studying inequity aversion specifically, and suggest the
   need for new models to explain why inequity aversion may have evolved.

AB Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of neurological
   disability among young and middle-aged adults. One of the most
   devastating consequences of MS in this relatively young population group
   is unemployment. Although certain demographic and disease factors have
   been associated with employment, few studies have examined the
   contribution of person-specific factors, such as personality.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to determine the extent to which
   personality, demographics, and clinical measures contribute to
   unemployment in MS.
   Method: A total of 101 individuals with MS who were enrolled in a
   clinical trial on cognition underwent a brief neuropsychological battery
   and completed questionnaires related to vocation, mood, fatigue, and
   personality. Neurological impairment was measured with the Expanded
   Disability Status Scale (EDSS).
   Results: Employment status was related with disease duration, MS
   subtype, level of neurological impairment, fatigue, performance on
   measures assessing information processing speed (Symbol Digit Modalities
   Test (SDMT)), learning and memory (Selective Reminding Test), and the
   personality characteristic of persistence. Based on a forward logistic
   regression analysis, EDSS, SDMT, and persistence were the strongest
   predictors of employment status.
   Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of personality on
   outcomes in MS and point to the need for more clinical attention and
   research in this area.

AB The purpose of this case report was to describe the outcomes following
   the use of kinesthetic feedback as a primary intervention strategy for
   gait training. The plan of care for this 22-year-old female addressed
   the patient's social wellness goal of "walking more normally," using
   motor learning principles. At initial examination, the patient
   demonstrated asymmetries for gait kinematics between the left and right
   lower extremity (analyzed using video motion analysis), pattern of force
   distribution at the foot, and activation of specific lower extremity
   muscles (as measured by surface electromyography). Interventions for
   this patient consisted of neuromuscular and body awareness training,
   with an emphasis on kinesthetic feedback. Weekly sessions lasted 30-60
   minutes over 4 weeks. The patient was prescribed a home program of
   walking 30-60 minutes three times/week at a comfortable pace while
   concentrating on gait correction through kinesthetic awareness of
   specific deviations. Following intervention, the patient's gait improved
   across all objective measures. She reported receiving positive comments
   from others regarding improved gait and a twofold increase in her
   walking confidence. Outcomes support a broadened scope of practice that
   incorporates previously unreported integration of a patient's social
   wellness goals into patient management.

AB Objective: Multiple studies have shown social network variables to
   mediate and predict drinking outcome, but, because of self-selection
   biases, these studies cannot reliably determine whether the influence is
   causal or correlational. The goal of this study was to evaluate evidence
   for a causal role for social network characteristics in determining
   long-term outcomes using state-of-the-art statistical methods. Method:
   Outpatient and aftercare clients enrolled in Project MATCH (N = 1,726)
   were assessed at intake and at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 months; the
   outpatient sample was also followed to 39 months. Generalized linear
   modeling with propensity stratification tested whether changes in social
   network ties (i.e., number of pro-abstainers and pro-drinkers) at Month
   9 predicted percentage of days abstinent and drinks per drinking day at
   15 and 39 months, covarying for Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance at
   Month 9. Results: An increase in the number of pro-drinkers predicted
   worse drinking outcomes, measured by percentage of days abstinent and
   drinks per drinking day, at Months 15 and 39 (p < .0001). An increase in
   the number of pro-abstainers predicted more percentage of days abstinent
   for both time periods (p < .01). The social network variables uniquely
   predicted 5%-12% of the outcome variance; AA attendance predicted an
   additional 1%-6%. Conclusions: Network composition following treatment
   is an important and plausibly causal predictor of alcohol outcome across
   3 years, adjusting for multiple confounders. The effects are consistent
   across patients exhibiting a broad range of alcohol-related impairment.
   Results support the further development of treatments that promote
   positive social changes and highlight the need for additional research
   on the determinants of social network changes. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs,

AB Although considerable research has shown the importance of social
   connection for physical health, little is known about the higher-level
   neurocognitive processes that link experiences of social connection or
   disconnection with health-relevant physiological responses. Here we
   review the key physiological systems implicated in the link between
   social ties and health and the neural mechanisms that may translate
   social experiences into downstream health-relevant physiological
   responses. Specifically, we suggest that threats to social connection
   may tap into the same neural and physiological 'alarm system' that
   responds to other critical survival threats, such as the threat or
   experience of physical harm. Similarly, experiences of social connection
   may tap into basic reward-related mechanisms that have inhibitory
   relationships with threat-related responding. Indeed, the neurocognitive
   correlates of social disconnection and connection may be important
   mediators for understanding the relationships between social ties and
   health.

AB Profound changes in family-related behavior have occurred over the past
   40 years in the US. To evaluate the extent to which family sociology has
   kept pace with these changes the article first reviews four prominent
   sociology journals from 1993 to 2011, investigating the range of family
   types covered in published articles over nearly two decades and the
   kinds of approaches taken to study non-traditional families. The article
   then presents two case studies of research areas that have always been
   central to family studies - reproduction and household labor - to review
   how changes in family structure impact core family processes and alter
   the approaches for studying them. The advent of assisted reproductive
   technologies and the range of living arrangements in which the division
   of household labor now occurs challenge the parameters of the
   'traditional' family. The findings indicate that family sociologists
   have been slow to rethink underlying categories of analysis,
   methodological approaches and scope of inquiry in the wake of
   significant changes in family experience. Assumptions about the kinds of
   family forms and household arrangements underlying family research have
   not yet expanded to meet new realities in American family life.

AB This article draws upon recent works in sociology, jurisprudence, and
   feminist theory in order to assess the ways in which feminism, and sex
   and gender more generally, have become intricately interwoven with
   punitive agendas in contemporary US politics. Melding existing
   theoretical discussions of penal trends with insights drawn from my own
   ethnographic research on the contemporary anti-trafficking movement in
   the United States-the most recent domain of feminist activism in which a
   crime frame has prevailed against competing models of social justice-I
   elaborate upon the ways that neoliberalism and the politics of sex and
   gender have intertwined to produce a carceral turn in feminist advocacy
   movements previously organized around struggles for economic justice and
   liberation. Taking the anti-trafficking movement as a case study, I
   further demonstrate how human rights discourse has become a key vehicle
   both for the transnationalization of carceral politics and for the
   reincorporation of these policies into the domestic terrain in a
   benevolent, feminist guise. I conclude by urging greater and more
   nuanced attention to the operations of gender and sexual politics within
   mainstream analyses of contemporary modes of punishment, as well as a
   careful consideration of the neoliberal carceral state within feminist
   discussions of gender, sexuality, and the law.

   their community to identify categories of contested resources that
   instigate interpersonal conflicts, often resulting in incidences of
   social aggression. Analysis of frequency data on quarrels (N = 334)
   reveals that women target several diverse categories of resources, with
   social types appearing as frequently as food and mates. It was also
   found that the focus of women's competition changes throughout the
   life-course, consistent with the notion that current vs. future
   reproduction and quantity-quality trade-offs might have different
   influences on competition and social conflict over resources within
   women's social networks across different age groups. Aggr. Behav.

AB There are an enormous number of incorrect stereotypes that characterize
   the differences between women and men. Indeed, nearly all of these
   stereotypes are based on cultural inaccuracies and faulty data without
   consideration of biology and the distinct sociological differences
   between genders. Sociological differences are those that relate to the
   development, structure, interaction and behavior of organized groups of
   human beings, or societies, and their values and beliefs. Gender is a
   social construct referring "to the culturally and historically based
   differences in the roles, attitudes and behaviors of men and women"
   ([1], p.1) as shaped by norms and stereotypes. Sex, on the other hand,
   serves to classify living things according to their reproductive organs
   and functions assigned by chromosomal complement (according to the US
   Institute of Medicine) and the physical and biological characteristics
   arising from these organs and functions. The two terms are generally
   viewed as dichotomous; however, they are closely intertwined in as yet
   hardly understood ways, and it is frequently difficult to distinguish
   between them since gendered life experiences can have profound effects
   on body structure and function [2]. In this review, we will examine to
   what extent gender roles and stereotypes shape the daily lives of women
   in their roles as students, employees, wives, and mothers and their
   health. These data have implications for the etiology of autoimmunity
   and also for differences in the natural history of disease. (C) 2011

AB Specialty referral patterns can affect health care costs as well as
   clinical outcomes. For a given clinical problem, referring physicians
   usually have a choice of several physicians to whom they can refer. Once
   the decision to refer is made, the choice of individual physician may
   have important downstream effects.
   To examine the reasons why primary care and specialist physicians choose
   certain specific colleagues to refer to and how those reasons differ by
   specialty.
   Cross-sectional Web-based survey supplemented with analysis of
   administrative claims data.
   A total of 616 physicians in office-based patient care specialties who
   were members of an academic physicians' organization and treated
   Medicare patients in 2006.
   A total of 386 respondents (63% response rate) were presented with a
   "roster" of other physicians' names with whom we predicted they had a
   relationship based on sharing Medicare patients. Among physicians in
   their "professional network" (consisting of any listed physician with
   whom respondents acknowledged a professional relationship), respondents
   reported if they referred to those physicians, and if so, provided up to
   two reasons why they referred to that particular colleague. Using
   logistic regression, we examined the likelihood that different
   specialists would endorse specific reasons for referring to chosen
   colleagues.
   Primary care physicians (PCPs) initiated referrals to 66% of their
   "professional network" colleagues, while medical and surgical
   specialists initiated referrals to 49% and 52%, respectively (p < 0.001
   for both versus PCPs). After adjustment, medical specialists were less
   likely than PCPs to cite ease of communication with colleagues (RR =
   0.69, 95% CI = 0.49-0.91), and medical and surgical specialists were
   less likely than PCPs to cite "shares my medical record system" as a
   reason to refer (medical specialist RR = 0.13, 95% CI 0.03-0.40,
   surgical specialist RR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.05-0.78).
   Specialists frequently initiate referrals, bypassing PCPs. In choosing
   specific physicians to refer to, PCPs are more often concerned with
   between-physician communication and patient access. Modifying referral
   practices among doctors may need to account for such patterns of
   behavior.

AB Neighborhood characteristics are associated with health and the

   among older adults. Little is known about the relationship between
   perception of neighborhood safety and functional decline in older
   adults.
   To determine the relationship between perceived neighborhood safety and
   functional decline in older adults.
   Longitudinal, community-based.
   18,043 persons, 50 years or older, who participated in the 1998 and 2008
   Health and Retirement Study.
   The primary outcome was 10-year functional decline (new difficulty or
   dependence in any Activity of Daily Living, new mobility difficulty,
   and/or death). The primary predictor was perceived neighborhood safety
   categorized into three groups: "very safe", "moderately safe", and
   "unsafe." We evaluated the association between perceived neighborhood
   safety and 10-year functional decline using a modified Poisson
   regression to generate unadjusted and adjusted relative risks (ARR).
   At baseline 11,742 (68.0%) participants perceived their neighborhood to
   be very safe, 4,477 (23.3%) moderately safe, and 1,824 (8.7%) unsafe.
   Over 10 years, 10,338 (53.9%) participants experienced functional
   decline, including 6,266 (50.2%) who had perceived their neighborhood to
   be very safe, 2,839 (61.2%) moderately safe, and 1,233 (63.6%) unsafe, P
   < 0.001. For the 11,496 (63.3%) of participants who were functionally
   independent at baseline, perceived neighborhood safety was associated
   with 10-year functional decline (moderately safe ARR 1.15 95% CI
   1.09-1.20; unsafe ARR 1.21 95% CI: 1.03-1.31 compared to very safe
   group). The relationship between perceived neighborhood safety and
   10-year functional decline was not statistically significant for
   participants who had baseline functional impairment.
   Asking older adults about their perceived neighborhood safety may
   provide important information about their risk of future functional
   decline. These findings also suggest that future studies might focus on
   assessing whether interventions that promote physical activity while
   addressing safety concerns help reduce functional decline in older
   adults.

AB Physician organizations (POs)-independent practice associations and
   medical groups-located in lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas may
   score poorly in pay-for-performance (P4P) programs.
   To examine the association between PO location and P4P performance.
   Cross-sectional study; Integrated Healthcare Association's (IHA's) P4P
   Program, the largest non-governmental, multi-payer program for POs in
   the U.S.
   160 POs participating in 2009.
   We measured PO SES using established methods that involved geo-coding
   11,718 practice sites within 160 POs to their respective census tracts
   and weighting tract-specific SES according to the number of primary care
   physicians at each site. P4P performance was defined by IHA's program
   and was a composite mainly representing clinical quality, but also
   including measures of patient experience, information technology and
   registry use.
   The area-based PO SES measure ranged from -11 to +11 (mean 0, SD 5), and
   the IHA P4P performance score ranged from 23 to 86 (mean 69, SD 15). In
   bivariate analysis, there was a significant positive relationship
   between PO SES and P4P performance (p < 0.001). In multivariate
   analysis, a one standard deviation increase in PO SES was associated
   with a 44% increase (relative risk 1.44, 95%CI, 1.22-1.71) in the
   likelihood of a PO being ranked in the top two quintiles of performance
   (p < 0.001).
   Physician organizations' performance scores in a major P4P program vary
   by the SES of the areas in which their practice sites are located. P4P
   programs that do not account for this are likely to pay higher bonuses
   to POs in higher SES areas, thus increasing the resource gap between
   these POs and POs in lower SES areas, which may increase disparities in
   the care they provide.

AB Non-verbal communication is an important aspect of the diagnostic and
   therapeutic process, especially with older patients. It is unknown how
   non-verbal communication varies with physician and patient race.
   To examine the joint influence of physician race and patient race on
   non-verbal communication displayed by primary care physicians during
   medical interviews with patients 65 years or older.
   Video-recordings of visits of 209 patients 65 years old or older to 30
   primary care physicians at three clinics located in the Midwest and
   Southwest.
   Duration of physicians' open body position, eye contact, smile, and
   non-task touch, coded using an adaption of the Nonverbal Communication
   in Doctor-Elderly Patient Transactions form.
   African American physicians with African American patients used more
   open body position, smile, and touch, compared to the average across
   other dyads (adjusted mean difference for open body position = 16.55, p
   < 0.001; smile = 2.35, p = 0.048; touch = 1.33, p < 0.001). African
   American physicians with white patients spent less time in open body
   position compared to the average across other dyads, but they also used
   more smile and eye gaze (adjusted mean difference for open body position
   = 27.25, p < 0.001; smile = 3.16, p = 0.005; eye gaze = 17.05, p <
   0.001). There were no differences between white physicians' behavior
   toward African American vs. white patients.
   Race plays a role in physicians' non-verbal communication with older
   patients. Its influence is best understood when physician race and
   patient race are considered jointly.

   Scale. Ratings suggested that the CAI would be easiest to adapt across
   cultures. However, in a recent study, the CAI was found to have weaker
   psychometric properties than some of the other measures. Problems were
   identified for specific subscales on all the performance-based
   assessments across multiple countries. India, China, and Mexico
   presented the greatest challenges in adaptation. For international
   clinical trials, it would be important to use the measures that are most
   adaptable, to adapt subscales that are problematic for specific
   countries or regions, or to develop a battery composed of the subscales
   from different instruments that may be most acceptable across multiple
   cultures with minimal adaptation.

AB In this essay I ask why it is so common for people to hold strong
   beliefs despite insufficient evidence to justify them. I approach this
   question from an evolutionary perspective of ultimate causation rather
   than a neurophysiological perspective of proximate causation. Beginning
   with simple optical illusions, I use a progression of examples to argue
   that humans are programmed to form false beliefs due to (i) intrinsic
   errors of intuition and, more importantly, (ii) a propensity to accept
   intuitively compelling beliefs without sufficient evidence when they
   appear to provide solutions to problems that cannot be solved with
   available knowledge. The formation of these false beliefs and their
   persistence constitute a phenomenon I call a pseudo-solution trap. I
   show that these mental traps are especially prevalent in the area of
   medicine. I end by showing that pseudo-solution traps are expected to
   feasibly lead to a belief in the supernatural, including an afterlife
   and one or more deities.

AB Wyoming provides more fossil fuels to the remainder of the United States
   than any other state or country, and its citizens remain skeptical of
   anthropogenic influences on their climate. However, much of the state
   including Yellowstone National Park and the headwaters of several major
   river systems, may have already been affected by rising temperatures.
   This paper examines the historic climate record from Wyoming in the
   context of similar to 14,000-year temperature reconstructions based on
   fossil pollen data. The analysis shows that 24 of 30 U.S. Historical
   Climatology Network records from the state show an increase in the
   frequency of unusually warm years since 1978. Statewide temperatures
   have included 15 years (50%) from 1978 to 2007 that were greater than 1
   sigma above the mean annual temperature for 1895-1978. The frequent warm
   years coincide with a reduction in the frequency of extremely low (<-20A
   degrees C) January temperatures, and are not well explained by factors
   such as solar irradiance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Linear
   regressions require inclusion of atmospheric greenhouse gas
   concentrations to explain the multi-decadal temperature trends. The
   observed warming is large in Yellowstone National Park where 21 years
   (70%) from 1978 to 2007 were greater than 1 sigma above the 1895-1978
   mean; the deviation from the mean (> 1A degrees C) is greater than any
   time in the past 6,000 years. Recent temperatures have become as high as
   those experienced from 11,000 to 6,000 years ago when summer insolation
   was > 6% higher than today and when regional ecosystems experienced
   frequent severe disturbances.

AB Various aspects of moral functioning, aggression, and positive peer
   regard were assessed in 153 preschool children. Our hypotheses were
   inspired by an evolutionary approach to morality that construes moral
   norms as tools of the social elite. Accordingly, children were also
   rated for social dominance and strategies for its attainment. We
   predicted that aspects of moral functioning would be only loosely
   related to each other and that moral cognitions about rules (unlike
   emotion attributions and moral internalization) would demonstrate
   patterns suggestive of instrumentality. Results showed that cognitions
   about moral rules and internalized conscience were unrelated and that
   sociomoral behavior was more strongly related to the latter than to the
   former. In addition, promoting group norms (Selective Moral Engagement)
   positively predicted social dominance, whereas internalized conscience
   negatively predicted social dominance. Children who controlled resources
   via both prosocial and coercive means (i.e., bistrategic) showed
   enhanced moral cognitions about rules (despite high levels of
   aggression) but had deficits in emotional aspects of moral functioning
   in the eyes of teachers. Patterns of Selective Moral Engagement invite
   comparisons to tattling and impression management. The findings are
   contrasted with alternative hypotheses that are advanced from
   traditional yet prevailing approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB . Self-efficacy or confidence in ones ability to successfully engage in
   goal-directed behaviour has been shown to influence medication adherence
   across many chronic illnesses. In the present study, we investigated the
   psychometric properties of a self-efficacy instrument used during
   treatment for chronic hepatitis C viral infection (HCV). Baseline (n =
   394) and treatment week 24 (n = 254) data from the prospective,
   longitudinal Viral Resistance to Antiviral Therapy of Chronic Hepatitis
   C study were examined. Baseline participants were randomly split into
   two equal-sized subsamples (S1 and S2). Initial exploratory and
   confirmatory factor analyses (EFA/CFA) were performed on S1, while S2
   was used to validate the factor structure of the S1 results using CFA.
   An additional CFA was performed on the treatment week 24 participants.
   Convergent and discriminant validity were assessed by comparing the
   revised instrument with other psychosocial measures: depression, social
   support, quality of life and medication-taking behaviour. Our findings
   supported a reduced 17-item global measure of HCV treatment
   self-efficacy (HCV-TSE) with four underlying factors: patient
   communication self-efficacy, general physical coping self-efficacy,
   general psychological coping self-efficacy and adherence self-efficacy.
   The global score (0.920.94) and four factors (0.850.96) demonstrated
   good internal consistency. Correlations of convergent and discriminant
   validity yielded low to moderate associations with other measures of
   psychosocial functioning. The revised HCV-TSE instrument provides a
   reliable and valid global estimate of confidence in ones ability to
   engage in and adhere to HCV antiviral treatment. The four-factor
   structure suggests different types of efficacy beliefs may function
   during HCV treatment and should be explored further in relation to
   clinical outcomes.

   implicated, cultural variables have not been systematically evaluated to
   determine their relationship to anxiety symptoms in Latino youth. The
   present study examined family orientation values, as measured by family
   obligation and affiliative obedience, and their relationship to youth
   anxiety symptoms. The sample consisted of 133 Latino students (grades
   5th through 7th) of low-income backgrounds in an urban public school
   setting. Structural equation models revealed that higher family
   orientation was associated with separation anxiety/panic (beta = .32)
   and harm avoidance (beta = .51). Models employing language proficiency
   and use mirrored those employing family orientation, suggesting that
   language fluency captures, in part, family socialization values. The
   results provide support for the impact of culture in the assessment and
   specific needs of Latino youth with anxiety problems. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   pairs.
   Materials and Methods: We accessed United Network for Organ Sharing
   files to identify adult living donor renal transplant recipients who
   received a transplant between 1997 and 2007. We evaluated factors
   associated with unrelated donation and compared a composite index of the
   socioeconomic characteristics of donor and recipient ZIP Codes between
   living unrelated and living related renal transplantation pairs. Spousal
   pairs were categorized as living related.
   Results: Of 39,168 adult renal transplant recipients 19% underwent
   living unrelated renal transplantation. These recipients were more
   likely white (vs black, Hispanic and other race OR 0.77-0.82, p < 0.05)
   and more highly educated (college vs less than high school OR 0.66, 95%
   CI 0.54-0.77), and more commonly received care at high volume transplant
   centers (vs lowest volume centers OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.95). Living
   unrelated renal transplantation recipients and donors lived in higher
   socioeconomic status index ZIP Codes than living related recipients
   (mean +/- SD recipients and donors 0.62 +/- 3.74 and 0.44 +/- 3.63 vs
   0.03 +/- 3.85 and 0.10 +/- 3.87, respectively, each p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Living unrelated renal transplantation donors and
   recipients are generally of higher socioeconomic status than their
   living related renal transplantation counterparts. There is restricted
   access to unrelated donors among underserved populations.

AB Military expenditures have escalated over the last three decades in both
   developed and less developed countries, without a corresponding
   expansion of military personnel. Spending has instead been directed
   towards hi-tech weaponry, what we refer to as the "new" military. We
   hypothesize that this new, increasingly capital-intensive military is no
   longer a pathway of upward mobility or employer of last resort for many
   uneducated, unskilled, or unemployed people, with significant
   consequences for those individuals and society as a whole. One such
   consequence, we argue, is an increase in income inequality. We test this
   hypothesis with cross-national panel models, estimated for 82 developed
   and less developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Findings indicate that
   military capital-intensiveness, as measured by military expenditures per
   soldier, exacerbates income inequality net of control variables. Neither
   total military expenditures/GDP nor military participation has a
   significant effect. It appears from these findings that today's "new"
   military establishment is abrogating its historical role as an
   equalizing force in society, with important policy implications. (C)

   methodological tools that account for selection biases arising from a

   their human rights treaty obligations, whereas physical integrity abuses

AB This article examines the social and ecological transformations in the
   Sicilian bluefin tuna fishery during the modern era. The analysis
   utilizes a sociological framework that draws on theory from
   environmental sociology, specifically metabolic rift theory. Escalating
   pressure on the fishery has contributed to a host of environmental and
   social problems, including pushing this important fishery to the brink
   of collapse. Using a combination of primary and secondary source data,
   this research employs sociological methods and analyzes recent changes
   in the socio-ecological metabolism of the fishery. The study explores
   the unsustainable nature of capitalist food production by examining the
   'rift' in the society and nature metabolism that has emerged in the
   modern Sicilian bluefin tuna fishery. It advances the discussion on the
   ways in which the social relations of modern capitalist production have
   transformed the socio-ecological metabolism in agri-food production.

AB As society seeks to meet the needs of a growing human population and
   rising aspirations for consumption, many of the ecosystem services on
   which society depends have declined in the global aggregate. Although
   some local societies sustainably manage their natural resources for long
   time periods, the more frequent pattern is overuse of renewable
   resources and a trajectory toward degradation. How can this degradation
   be reversed? In this paper we draw on four New Zealand examples and the
   literature to posit a set of design principles and recommendations to
   foster transformation from social-ecological degradation toward more
   sustainable pathways. These include a strong sense of place,
   prioritizing long-term solutions over short-term benefits, collective
   engagement of all key stakeholders and willingness to compromise, right
   to organize and manage, negotiated consensus on sustainability goals,
   formal and informal monitoring, flexibility to renegotiate goals and
   adapt, and guidance by a skilled facilitator. We also identify
   guidelines that foster consensus-building in the face of contested
   solutions. Examples from New Zealand and the literature suggest that
   local social-ecological systems can self-organize to shift toward more
   sustainable trajectories and that society can foster conditions that
   increase the likelihood of favorable transformations.

AB Prognosis is critical in individualizing care for older adults with late
   life disability. Evidence suggests that preferences for prognostic
   information may be culturally determined. Yet little is known about the
   preferences of diverse elders for discussing prognosis.
   To determine the preferences for discussing prognosis of a diverse
   sample of older adults with late-life disability
   We interviewed 60 older adults with mean age 78 and mean 2.5 Activities
   of Daily Living dependencies. Participants were recruited from San
   Francisco's On Lok program, the first Program of All-inclusive Care for
   the Elderly (PACE). Participants were interviewed in English, Spanish,
   and Cantonese, and responded to scenarios in which their doctors
   estimated they had 5 years and 1 year left to live. Open-ended questions
   explored the reasons for their responses. Results were analyzed
   qualitatively using grounded theory.
   Sixty-five percent of participants wanted to discuss the prognosis if
   their doctor estimated they had < 5 years to live and 75% if the
   estimate was < 1 year. Three themes were prominent among patients who
   wanted to discuss prognosis: to prepare, to make the most of the life
   they had left, and to make medical or health-related decisions. Those
   who preferred not to discuss prognosis described emotional difficulty,
   the uncertainty of prognosis, or that it would not be useful. Nearly all
   participants said that doctors should not make assumptions based on race
   or ethnicity, though differences between ethnic groups emerged.
   Most patients in this diverse sample of disabled elders were interested
   in discussing prognosis, while a substantial minority was not. Among
   those participants who preferred to discuss prognosis, many said that
   prognostic information would be important as they made difficult medical
   and personal decisions in late-life. Clinicians should inquire about
   preferences for discussing prognosis before sharing prognostic
   estimates.

AB OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to examine the relationship
   between cumulative social adversity and childhood obesity among
   preschool-aged children (N = 1605) in the Fragile Families and Child
   Wellbeing Study.
   METHODS: Maternal reports of intimate partner violence, food insecurity,
   housing insecurity, maternal depressive symptoms, maternal substance
   use, and father's incarceration were obtained when the child was 1 and 3
   years of age. Two cumulative social risk scores were created by summing
   the 6 factors assessed at ages 1 and 3 years. Child height and weight
   were measured at 5 years of age. Logistic regression models stratified
   according to gender were used to estimate the association between
   cumulative social risk and obesity, adjusting for sociodemographic
   factors.
   RESULTS: Seventeen percent of children were obese at age 5 years, and
   57% had at least 1 social risk factor. Adjusting for sociodemographic
   factors, girls experiencing high cumulative social risk (>= 2 factors)
   at age 1 year only (odds ratio [OR]: 2.1 [95% confidence interval [CI]:
   1.1-4.1]) or at 3 years only (OR: 2.2 [95% CI: 1.2-4.2]) were at
   increased odds of being obese compared with girls with no risk factors
   at either time point. Those experiencing high cumulative risk at age 1
   and 3 years were not at statistically significant odds of being obese
   (OR: 1.9 [95% CI: 0.9-4.0]). No significant associations were noted
   among boys.
   CONCLUSIONS: There seems to be gender differences in the effects of
   cumulative social risk factors on the prevalence of obesity at 5 years
   of age. Understanding the social context of families could make for more
   effective preventive efforts to combat childhood obesity.

AB Land-ownership patterns in rural areas are undergoing changes. To
   explore the critical question of how changing land ownership in a
   watershed potentially drives land use, we examined differences in
   individual landowners' reasons for owning drylands. We conducted a mail
   survey of 767 landowners in three counties of central Texas, USA. Using
   exploratory factor analysis we reduced motivations into six dimensions:
   agricultural production, profit-orientation, rural lifestyle, financial
   investment, mineral extraction, and wildlife enterprise. A cluster
   analysis of these dimensions classified landowners into three groups:
   agricultural production, multiple-objective, and lifestyle-oriented. We
   validated these classifications using variables related to land
   management, land characteristics, ranching and farming perceptions, and
   demographics. The landowner groups performed well in discriminating
   between socio-demographic variables. Although landowners in central
   Texas are still largely involved in agricultural production (61%), only
   24% focus on it exclusively. More than one third (39%) own land
   exclusively for lifestyle reasons. Changing motivations for owning land
   may be indicative of a cultural shift that can lead to landscape-scale
   changes in land cover. Policy tools and education efforts that recognize
   this heterogeneity in landowners will enhance the resiliency and
   sustainability of rural communities and of the dryland ecosystems on
   which they depend. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   long-term data are rarely available. In a multi-year study in Wolong
   Nature Reserve, China, we followed a representative sample of 220 local
   households from 1999 to 2007 to investigate the diverse benefits that
   these households received from recent development of nature-based
   tourism in the area. Within eight years, the number of households
   directly participating in tourism activities increased from nine to
   sixty. In addition, about two-thirds of the other households received
   indirect financial benefits from tourism. We constructed an empirical
   household economic model to identify the factors that led to
   household-level participation in tourism. The results reveal the effects
   of local households' livelihood assets (i.e., financial, human, natural,
   physical, and social capitals) on the likelihood to participate directly
   in tourism. In general, households with greater financial (e.g.,
   income), physical (e.g., access to key tourism sites), human (e.g.,
   education), and social (e.g., kinship with local government officials)
   capitals and less natural capital (e.g., cropland) were more likely to
   participate in tourism activities. We found that residents in households
   participating in tourism tended to perceive more non-financial benefits
   in addition to more negative environmental impacts of tourism compared
   with households not participating in tourism. These findings suggest
   that socioeconomic impact analysis and change monitoring should be
   included in nature-based tourism management systems for long-term
   sustainability of protected areas.

AB Despite decades of research on social capital, studies that explore the
   relationship between political institutions and generalized trust-a key
   element of social capital-across time are sparse. To address this issue,
   we use various cross-national public-opinion data sets including the
   World Values Survey and employ pooled time-series OLS regression and
   fixed-and random-effects estimation techniques on an unbalanced panel of
   74 countries and 248 observations spread over a 29-year time period.
   With these data and methods, we investigate the impact of five
   political-institutional factors-legal property rights, market
   regulations, labor market regulations, universality of socioeconomic
   provisions, and power-sharing capacity-on generalized trust. We find
   that generalized trust increases monotonically with the quality of
   property rights institutions, that labor market regulations increase
   generalized trust, and that power-sharing capacity of the state
   decreases generalized trust. While generalized trust increases as the
   government regulation of credit, business, and economic markets
   decreases and as the universality of socioeconomic provisions increases,
   both effects appear to be more sensitive to the countries included and
   the modeling techniques employed than the other political-institutional
   factors. In short, we find that political institutions simultaneously
   promote and undermine generalized trust.

AB The rapid adoption of mobile phone technologies in Africa is offering
   exciting opportunities for engaging with high-risk populations through
   mHealth programs, and the vast volumes of behavioral data being
   generated as people use their phones provide valuable data about human
   behavioral dynamics in these regions. Taking advantage of these
   opportunities requires an understanding of the penetration of mobile
   phones and phone usage patterns across the continent, but very little is
   known about the social and geographical heterogeneities in mobile phone
   ownership among African populations. Here, we analyze a survey of mobile
   phone ownership and usage across Kenya in 2009 and show that distinct
   regional, gender-related, and socioeconomic variations exist, with
   particularly low ownership among rural communities and poor people. We
   also examine patterns of phone sharing and highlight the contrasting
   relationships between ownership and sharing in different parts of the
   country. This heterogeneous penetration of mobile phones has important
   implications for the use of mobile technologies as a source of
   population data and as a public health tool in sub-Saharan Africa.

AB Background: Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the
   second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States.
   It is unclear how county-level primary care physician (PCP) availability
   and socioeconomic deprivation affect the spatial and temporal variation
   of breast cancer incidence and mortality.
   Methods: We used the 1988-2008 public-use county-based data from nine
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) programs to analyze
   the temporal and spatial disparity of PCP availability and socioeconomic
   deprivation on early-stage incidence, advanced-stage incidence and
   breast cancer mortality. The spatio-temporal analysis was implemented by
   a novel structural additive modeling approach.
   Results: Greater PCP availability was significantly associated with
   higher early-stage incidence, advanced-stage incidence and mortality
   during the entire study period while socioeconomic deprivation was
   significantly negatively associated with early-stage incidence,
   advanced-stage incidence, and mortality up to 1992. However, the
   observed influence of PCP availability and socioeconomic deprivation
   varied by county.
   Conclusions: We showed important associations of PCP availability and
   socioeconomic deprivation with the three breast cancer indicators.
   However, the effect of these associations varied over time and across
   counties. The association of PCP availability and socioeconomic
   deprivation was stronger in selected counties.

AB The consequences of environmental change for human migration have gained
   increasing attention in the context of climate change and recent
   large-scale natural disasters, but as yet relatively few large-scale and
   quantitative studies have addressed this issue. We investigate the
   consequences of climate-related natural disasters for long-term
   population mobility in rural Bangladesh, a region particularly
   vulnerable to environmental change, using longitudinal survey data from
   1,700 households spanning a 15-y period. Multivariate event history
   models are used to estimate the effects of flooding and crop failures on
   local population mobility and long-distance migration while controlling
   for a large set of potential confounders at various scales. The results
   indicate that flooding has modest effects on mobility that are most
   visible at moderate intensities and for women and the poor. However,
   crop failures unrelated to flooding have strong effects on mobility in
   which households that are not directly affected but live in severely
   affected areas are the most likely to move. These results point toward
   an alternate paradigm of disaster-induced mobility that recognizes the
   significant barriers to migration for vulnerable households as well
   their substantial local adaptive capacity.

AB Brune's proposal that erstwhile 'vulnerability' genes need to be
   reconsidered as 'plasticity' genes, given the potential for certain
   environments to yield increased positive function in the same domain as
   potential dysfunction, has implications for psychiatric nosology as well
   as a more dynamic understanding of the relationship between genes and
   culture. In addition to validating neuropsychiatric spectrum disorder
   nosologies by calling for similar methodological shifts in
   gene-environment-interaction studies, Brune's position elevates the
   importance of environmental contexts - inclusive of socio-cultural
   variables - as mechanisms that contribute to clinical presentation. We
   assert that when models of susceptibility to plasticity and
   neuropsychiatric spectrum disorders are concomitantly considered, a new
   line of inquiry emerges into the co-evolution and co-determination of
   sociocultural contexts and endophenotypes. This presents potentially
   unique opportunities, benefits, challenges, and responsibilities for
   research and practice in psychiatry.

AB The concept of contagion has steadily expanded from its original
   grounding in epidemic disease to describe a vast array of processes that
   spread across networks, notably social phenomena such as fads, political
   opinions, the adoption of new technologies, and financial decisions.
   Traditional models of social contagion have been based on physical
   analogies with biological contagion, in which the probability that an
   individual is affected by the contagion grows monotonically with the
   size of his or her "contact neighborhood"-the number of affected
   individuals with whom he or she is in contact. Whereas this contact
   neighborhood hypothesis has formed the underpinning of essentially all
   current models, it has been challenging to evaluate it due to the
   difficulty in obtaining detailed data on individual network
   neighborhoods during the course of a large-scale contagion process. Here
   we study this question by analyzing the growth of Facebook, a rare
   example of a social process with genuinely global adoption. We find that
   the probability of contagion is tightly controlled by the number of
   connected components in an individual's contact neighborhood, rather
   than by the actual size of the neighborhood. Surprisingly, once this
   "structural diversity" is controlled for, the size of the contact
   neighborhood is in fact generally a negative predictor of contagion.
   More broadly, our analysis shows how data at the size and resolution of
   the Facebook network make possible the identification of subtle
   structural signals that go undetected at smaller scales yet hold pivotal
   predictive roles for the outcomes of social processes.

AB In this study, we present an indexing scheme to screen large numbers of
   brownfield sites in wide areas (municipalities, counties, states or
   other types of districts) in order to develop initial planning
   strategies for fund allocation and redevelopment. The scheme entails
   three dimensions, socioeconomic, smart growth and environmental, for
   each of which an index is constructed on the basis of location-specific
   variables irrespective of the target end use. Socioeconomic variables
   include population density, property values and unemployment which
   collectively represent the potential contribution of brownfield
   redevelopment to economic growth. The smart growth or livability index
   was developed on the basis of the LEED ND evaluation scheme of the U.S.
   Green Building Council, isolating location-specific features. Finally,
   the environmental index incorporates variables that represent the
   potential source of contamination (past use), pathway of exposure (soil
   permeability) and receptors (zoning, proximity to water bodies, parks,
   critical habitats, open spaces, wetlands and floodplains). The
   application of the indices to the City of New Haven, Connecticut as a
   case study yielded four priority sites out of 47 in the city inventory.
   Even though the indices were sensitive to the chosen weights,
   prioritization of sites in clusters reduced the effect; the top four
   sites were identical in the case study and 31 out of 47 sites were
   present in the same cluster regardless of the weighting scheme. (C) 2012

   enable cultural cuisine, ethnomedicine, and identity continuity; (c)

   and its changes, (2) to interpret and associate the change in urban
   greenness structure within its zoning area, (3) to characterize and
   discuss the influence of urbanization on the spatial distribution and

   analysis (LSMA) was adopted to extract the fraction maps of four
   endmembers (imperviousness, grassland, woodland, and soil) using Landsat
   Thematic Mapper (TM). The research results indicate that LSMA offers a
   better classified map than the traditional Maximum Likelihood
   Classification with an improved overall accuracy from 78.99% to 86.20%.
   The greenness dynamics within each census tract as well as planning zone
   were derived based on the each two successive fraction maps and fuzzy
   set concepts. The significant decrease of grassland in the
   business-based landscape (average green density decreased from 30% to
   17%) with a slight decrease of woodland (from 63% to 60%) indicate the
   urbanization in the Baltimore-Washington corridor area impact its
   spatial morphology, structure, and ecological environment under the
   special socioeconomic development and reserve policies. The combination
   of remote sensing data and GIS zoning data provides us a comprehensive
   track on the pattern and process of urban greenness to deliver
   significant information for city planners and policy makers, as well as
   the unique dataset for other researcher to further evaluate the

AB Background: Recent advances in automated assessment of basic vocabulary
   lists allow the construction of linguistic phylogenies useful for
   tracing dynamics of human population expansions, reconstructing
   ancestral cultures, and modeling transition rates of cultural traits
   over time.
   Methods: Here we investigate the Tupi expansion, a widely-dispersed
   language family in lowland South America, with a distance-based
   phylogeny based on 40-word vocabulary lists from 48 languages. We coded
   11 cultural traits across the diverse Tupi family including traditional
   warfare patterns, post-marital residence, corporate structure, community
   size, paternity beliefs, sibling terminology, presence of canoes,
   tattooing, shamanism, men's houses, and lip plugs.
   Results/Discussion: The linguistic phylogeny supports a Tupi homeland in
   west-central Brazil with subsequent major expansions across much of
   lowland South America. Consistently, ancestral reconstructions of
   cultural traits over the linguistic phylogeny suggest that social
   complexity has tended to decline through time, most notably in the
   independent emergence of several nomadic hunter-gatherer societies.
   Estimated rates of cultural change across the Tupi expansion are on the
   order of only a few changes per 10,000 years, in accord with previous
   cultural phylogenetic results in other language families around the
   world, and indicate a conservative nature to much of human culture.

AB A successful social interaction often requires on-line and active
   construction of an ever-changing mental-model of another persons
   beliefs, expectations, emotions, and desires. It also requires the
   ability to maintain focus, problem-solve, and flexibly pursue goals in a
   distraction-rich environment, as well as the ability to take-turns and
   inhibit inappropriate behaviors. Many of these tasks rely on executive
   functions (EF) working memory, attention/cognitive control, and
   inhibition. Executive functioning has long been viewed as relatively
   static. However, starting with recent reports of successful cognitive
   interventions, this view is changing and now EFs are seen as much more
   open to both short- and long-term training, warm-up, and exhaustion
   effects. Some of the most intriguing evidence suggests that engaging in
   social interaction enhances performance on standard EF tests.
   Interestingly, the latest research indicates these EF benefits are
   selectively conferred by certain on-line, dynamic social interactions,
   which require participants to mentally engage with another person and
   actively construct a model of their mind. We review this literature and
   highlight its connection with evolutionary and cultural theories
   emphasizing links between intelligence and sociality.

AB Background: Social support is frequently linked to positive parenting
   behavior. Similarly, studies increasingly show a link between
   neighborhood residential environment and positive parenting behavior.
   However, less is known about how the residential environment influences
   parental social support. To address this gap, we examine the
   relationship between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and
   collective efficacy and the level and change in parental caregiver
   perceptions of non-familial social support.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The data for this study came from three
   data sources, the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
   (PHDCN) Study's Longitudinal Cohort Survey of caregivers and their
   offspring, a Community Survey of adult residents in these same
   neighborhoods and the 1990 Census. Social support is measured at Wave 1
   and Wave 3 and neighborhood characteristics are measured at Wave 1.
   Multilevel linear regression models are fit. The results show that
   neighborhood collective efficacy is a significant (beta = .04; SE = .02;
   p = .03), predictor of the positive change in perceived social support
   over a 7 year period, however, not of the level of social support,
   adjusting for key compositional variables and neighborhood concentrated
   disadvantage. In contrast concentrated neighborhood disadvantage is not
   a significant predictor of either the level or change in social support.
   Conclusion: Our finding suggests that neighborhood collective efficacy
   may be important for inducing the perception of support from friends in
   parental caregivers over time.

AB A case study of Denver, Colorado explores the roles of three social
   actors-individual users, infrastructure designer-operators, and policy
   actors-in near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in U.S. cities.
   Energy efficiency, renewable energy, urban design, price- and
   behavioral-feedback strategies are evaluated across
   buildings-facilities, transportation, and materials/waste sectors in
   cities, comparing voluntary versus regulatory action configurations. GHG
   mitigation impact depends upon strategy effectiveness per unit, as well
   as societal participation rates in various action-configurations.
   Greatest impact occurs with regulations addressing the vast existing
   buildings stock in cities, followed by voluntary behavior change in
   electricity use/purchases, technology shifts (e.g., to
   teleconferencing), and green-energy purchases among individual users. A
   portfolio mix of voluntary and regulatory actions can yield a best-case
   maximum of similar to 1% GHG mitigation annually in buildings and
   transportation sectors, combined. Relying solely on voluntary actions
   reduces mitigation rates more than five-fold. A portfolio analysis of
   climate action plans in 55 U.S. cities reveals predominance of voluntary
   outreach programs that have low societal participation rates and hence
   low GHG impact, while innovative higher-impact behavioral,

AB High rates of substance use and related problems have been long
   recognized as critical health issues for Native American adolescents.
   Unfortunately, no manualized interventions address the specific needs of
   Native American adolescents in a culturally appropriate manner. In 2006,
   the Cherokee Nation partnered with the University of Colorado to employ
   a community-based participatory research process to develop an
   intervention for Native American adolescents with substance use
   problems. The resulting intervention, Walking On, is an explicit blend
   of traditional Cherokee healing and spirituality with science-based
   practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency
   management and is designed to address the specific needs and worldviews
   of Native American adolescents with substance use problems and their
   families. Each individual and family session includes a brief
   assessment, a skill-building component, and a ceremony. A Weekly Circle
   (multifamily group) promotes sobriety and builds a community of healing.
   Early pilot study results suggest that Walking On is feasible for use in
   tribal substance abuse treatment programs. While Walking On shows early
   promise, the intervention will require further study to examine its
   efficacy.

AB Objectives To examine the effects of behavioral, health, and
   socio-demographic factors on being overweight or obese among older
   Chinese adults.
   Methods This research uses panel data from the China Health and
   Nutrition Survey, which was designed to examine how social and economic
   transformation affected the health and nutritional status of residents.
   For these analyses, we used all available information on adults aged 60
   years or older surveyed in 1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006 (N = 3,591). Body
   mass index (BMI) was dichotomized as normal (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)) and
   overweight (25.0-29.9 kg/m(2))/obese (>= 30 kg/m(2)). Generalized
   estimating equations were used to estimate population-averaged
   (marginal) effects.
   Results The combined prevalence of overweight or obese was approximately
   33%. Moderate or heavy non-leisure physical activities (OR = 0.39; 95%
   CI = 0.32-0.49) and smoking (OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.57-0.84) decreased
   the odds of being overweight or obese, while drinking alcohol (OR =
   1.25; 95% CI = 1.05-1.50) increased the odds. For individuals in all
   income levels, the amount of non-leisure physical activity strongly
   affected the BMI among the older Chinese adults.
   Conclusions Active lifestyle interventions may help counter what could
   otherwise be a growing obesity epidemic in China.

AB Chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the
   United States and have significant behavioral origins. African Americans
   suffer a disproportionate burden of chronic disease relative to other US
   racial/ethnic groups. Previous research supports an association between
   both general and religious social support and health behaviors that
   impact the risk of chronic disease. The present study examined the
   relative contributions of these constructs to a variety of health
   behaviors in a national probability sample of African American men and
   women (N = 2,370). A telephone interview assessing fruit and vegetable
   consumption, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and current
   cigarette use was completed by participants. Results showed that several
   dimensions of religious social support predicted fruit and vegetable
   consumption, moderate physical activity, and alcohol use over and above
   the role of general social support. Findings highlight the unique role
   of religious support in this population in the context of health
   behaviors. Implications for health promotion interventions are
   discussed.

AB Standards of ethical practice in any profession change over time. In
   this paper I examine the philosophical underpinning of the ethical norms
   of biological anthropology and how these norms have influenced the
   practice of the discipline over the past 60 years. Particular attention
   is paid to bioethics, a special branch of applied ethics concerned with
   human health and human-subjects research. Codification of bioethics
   began after World War II with the Nuremberg Code, and there currently
   are multiple documents that define the relationship between researcher
   and subject for anyone working with human populations. The evolution of
   these documents and their application is examined. All of these codes
   emphasize the centrality of voluntary consent and set forth criteria
   that must be met before any research can be conducted. Biological
   anthropologists often work with identified and stressed populations in a
   complex, active, long-term relationship. This relationship presents
   multiple ethical challenges, including individual and group consent for
   research projects. Changing ideas concerning the actualization of
   consent in particular are presented. Emerging topics-such as
   compensation, data sharing, biobanks, and large databases and
   collections-are discussed. These topics will generate continued
   discussion of ethics in human biology research.

AB It is widely recognized that our understanding of the racial order will
   remain forever unsatisfactory so long as we fail to turn our analytic
   gaze back upon ourselves, the analysts of racial domination, and inquire
   critically into the hidden presuppositions that shape our thought.
   However, for reflexivity to be employed widely in the interest of
   scientific truth, analysts must acknowledge that reflexive thinking
   entails much more than observing how one's social position (racial
   identity or class background, for example) affects one's scientific
   analyses. In this paper, we deepen the meaning of scholarly reflexivity,
   discussing how it can be directed at three levels of hidden
   presuppositions: the social, the disciplinary, and the scholastic.

   emergent continent-scale questions such as cryosphere loss and landscape
   change is becoming increasingly apparent on the basis of a capacity to
   combine long-term observations and experimental results with new
   observatory-based measurements, to study socioecological systems, to
   advance the use of environmental cyberinfrastructure, to promote
   environmental science literacy, and to engage with decisionmakers in
   framing major directions for research. The long-term context of network
   science, from understanding the past to forecasting the future, provides
   a-valuable perspective for helping to solve many of the crucial
   environmental problems facing society today.

   Long Term Ecological Research Network sites to enhance policy,

   case studies, we explore the approaches used to inform policy on
   atmospheric deposition, public land management, land conservation, and
   urban forestry, including decision maker engagement and integration of
   local knowledge, application of models to analyze the potential
   consequences of policy and management decisions, and adaptive management
   to generate new knowledge and incorporate it into decisionmaking.
   Efforts to enhance the role of long-term research in informing major
   environmental challenges would benefit from the development of metrics
   to evaluate impact; stronger partnerships among research sites,

AB Scenario studies have emerged as a powerful approach for synthesizing
   diverse forms of research and for articulating and evaluating
   alternative socioecological futures. Unlike predictive modeling,
   scenarios do not attempt to forecast the precise or probable state of
   any variable at a given point in the future. Instead, comparisons among
   a set of contrasting scenarios are used to understand the systemic
   relationships and dynamics of complex socioecological systems and to
   define a range of possibilities and uncertainties in quantitative and
   qualitative terms. We describe five examples of scenario studies
   affiliated with the US Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Network and
   evaluate them in terms of their ability to advance the LTER Network's
   capacity for conducting science, promoting social and ecological science
   synthesis, and increasing the saliency of research through sustained
   outreach activities. We conclude with an argument that scenario studies
   should be advanced programmatically within large socioecological
   research programs to encourage prescient thinking in an era of
   unprecedented global change.

AB The US National Science Foundation funded Long Term Ecological Research
   (LTER) Network supports a large (around 240) and diverse portfolio of
   long-term ecological experiments. Collectively, these long-term
   experiments have (a) provided unique insights into ecological patterns
   and processes, although such insight often became apparent only after
   many years of study; (b) influenced management and policy decisions; and
   (c) evolved into research platforms supporting studies and involving
   investigators who were not part of the original design. Furthermore,
   this suite of long-term experiments addresses, at the site level, all of
   the US National Research Council's Grand Challenges in Environmental
   Sciences. Despite these contributions, we argue that the scale and scope
   of global environmental change requires a more-coordinated multisite
   approach to long-term experiments, ideally, such an approach would
   include a network of spatially extensive multifactor experiments,
   designed in collaboration with ecological modelers that would build on

AB Analyses of long-term records at 35 headwater basins in the United
   States and Canada indicate that climate change effects on streamflow are
   not as clear as might be expected, perhaps because of ecosystem
   processes and human influences. Evapotranspiration was higher than was
   predicted by temperature in water-surplus ecosystems and lower than was
   predicted in water-deficit ecosystems. Streamflow was correlated with
   climate variability indices (e.g., the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the
   Pacific Decadal Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation), especially
   in seasons when vegetation influences are limited. Air temperature
   increased significantly at 17 of the 19 sites with 20- to 60-year
   records, but streamflow trends were directly related to climate trends
   (through changes in ice and snow) at only 7 sites. Past and present
   human and natural disturbance, vegetation succession, and human water
   use can mimic, exacerbate, counteract, or mask the effects of climate
   change on streamflow, even in reference basins. Long-term ecological
   research sites are ideal places to disentangle these processes.

AB The cryosphere-the portion of the Earth's surface where water is in
   solid form for at least one month of the year-has been shrinking in
   response to climate warming. The extents of sea ice, snow, and glaciers,
   for example, have been decreasing. In response, the ecosystems within
   the cryosphere and those that depend on the cryosphere have been
   changing. We identify two principal aspects of ecosystem-level responses
   to cryosphere loss: (1) trophodynamic alterations resulting from the
   loss of habitat and species loss or replacement and (2) changes in the
   rates and mechanisms of biogeochemical storage and cycling of carbon and
   nutrients, caused by changes in physical forcings or ecological
   community functioning. These changes affect biota in positive or
   negative ways, depending on how they interact with the cryosphere. The
   important outcome, however, is the change and the response the human
   social system (infrastructure, food, water, recreation) will have to
   that change.

   purpose of this study was to identify sociodemographic characteristics,
   health care variables, and cultural values having significant
   independent associations with intentions to donate blood or saliva
   samples for cancer genetics research among African American adults.
   Method: Cross-sectional survey of donation intentions. Results: The
   majority of respondents (73%) were willing to donate a biological sample
   for cancer genetics research. The results of the multivariate regression
   model found that respondents who received care at a facility other than
   a doctor's office (e. g., community center) were about five times more
   likely to be willing to donate a sample for cancer genetics research
   (odds ratio [OR] = 5.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16-24.12, p =
   0.03); whereas, greater levels of religiosity (OR = 0.09, 95% CI =
   0.01-0.75, p = 0.02) and present temporal orientation (OR = 0.23, 95% CI
   = 0.06-0.79, p = 0.02) were associated with a lower likelihood of
   donating a sample. Conclusion: Efforts to enhance donation of biological
   samples for cancer genetics research may need to target diverse clinical
   sites for recruitment. Additionally, recruitment materials may need to
   address cultural values related to religiosity and present temporal
   orientation.

AB Objective: This study investigated the effects of acculturation on
   cortisol, a biological correlate of maternal psychological distress, and
   perinatal infant outcomes, specifically gestational age at birth and
   birth weight. Methods: Fifty-five pregnant women of Mexican descent were
   recruited from a community hospital, and their saliva samples were
   collected at home for 3 days during pregnancy at 15 to 18 weeks (early),
   26 to 32 weeks (mid), and more than 32 weeks (late) of gestation and
   once in the postpartum period (4-12 weeks). These values were used to
   determine the diurnal cortisol slope at each phase of pregnancy. Mothers
   also completed an acculturation survey and gave permission for a medical
   chart review to obtain neonate information. Results: Multiple regression
   analyses determined that greater acculturation levels significantly
   predicted earlier infant gestational age at birth (R-2 = 0.09, p =.03).
   Results from t tests revealed that mothers of low-birth-weight infants
   (<2500 g) had significantly higher acculturation scores than mothers of
   infants with birth weight greater than 2500 g (t = -2.95, p = .005). A
   blunted maternal cortisol slope during pregnancy was also correlated
   with low birth weight (r = -0.29, p = .05) but not gestational age (r =
   -0.08, p = .59). In addition, more acculturated women had a flatter
   diurnal cortisol slope late in pregnancy (R-2 = 0.21, p = .01). Finally,
   diurnal maternal cortisol rhythms were identified as a potential
   mediator between increased acculturation and birth weight. Conclusions:
   This study associated increased acculturation with perinatal outcomes in
   the US Mexican population. This relationship may be mediated by prenatal
   maternal diurnal cortisol, which can program the health of the fetus
   leading to several adverse perinatal outcomes.

AB Introduction: Exposure to child maltreatment is associated with elevated
   risk for behavioral disorders in adulthood. One explanation for this
   life-course association is that child maltreatment increases
   vulnerability to the effects of subsequent stressors; however, the
   extent to which maltreatment increases sensitivity to social context has
   never been examined. We evaluated whether the association between
   neighborhood physical disorder and binge drinking was modified by child
   maltreatment exposure.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study, a
   prospective representative sample of predominately African Americans in
   the Detroit population. Neighborhood physical disorder was measured via
   systematic neighborhood assessment. Child maltreatment indicators
   included self-reported physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Incident
   binge drinking was defined as at least one episode of >= 5 drinks (men)
   or >= 4 drinks (women) in the past 30-day period among those with no
   binge drinking at baseline (N = 1013).
   Results: Child maltreatment and neighborhood physical disorder
   interacted to predict incident binge drinking (8 = 0.16, p = 0.02) and
   maximum number of past 30-day drinks (8 = 0.15, p = 0.04), such that
   neighborhood physical disorder predicted problematic alcohol use only
   among individuals with high exposure to child maltreatment.
   Conclusion: The results add to the growing literature that African
   Americans in the US are exposed to an array of stressors that have
   pernicious consequences for problematic alcohol use. Our results
   document the need for increased attention to the potential for at-risk
   alcohol use among populations with a high degree of stress exposure. (C)

AB Objective: The functional, financial, and social impact on families of
   children with Down syndrome (DS) in the United States and the role of
   the US health care system in ameliorating these impacts have not been
   well characterized. We sought to describe the demographic
   characteristics and functional difficulties of these children and to
   determine whether children with DS, compared with children with
   "intellectual disability" (ID) generally, and compared with other
   "children and youth with special health care needs" (CYSHCN), are more
   or less likely to receive health care that meets quality standards
   related to care coordination and to have their health care service needs
   met. Methods: This study analyzed data from the 2005-2006 National
   Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs (n = 40,723). Children
   and youth aged 0 to 17 years with special health care need (CYSHCN) who
   experience DS (n = 395) and/or IDs (n = 4252) were compared with each
   other and other CYSHCN on a range of functioning, family impact, and
   health care quality variables using bivariate and multivariate methods.
   Data were weighted to represent all CYSHCN in the United States.
   Results: Compared with CYSHCN without DS, children with DS were
   significantly less likely to receive comprehensive care within a medical
   home (29.7% vs 47.3%; p < .001). Parents of children with DS were also
   significantly more likely to cut back or stop work due to their child's
   health needs (23.5% vs 55.1%; p < .001). Although overall system
   performance was poorer for children with DS compared with those with ID
   and no DS after adjustment for family income, prevalence on most aspects
   of quality of care and family impacts evaluated were similar for these 2
   groups. Conclusions: In this study, the families of children with DS,
   and ID generally, are burdened disproportionately when compared with
   other CYSHCN, reflecting the combination of impairments intrinsic to DS
   and ID and impacts of suboptimal medical care coordination and social
   support. (J Dev Behav Pediatr 33: 214-220, 2012)

AB Eating is necessary for survival, gives great pleasure, and can be
   perturbed leading to undernutrition, overnutrition, and eating
   disorders. The development of feeding in humans relies on complex
   interplay between homeostatic mechanisms; neural reward systems; and
   child motor, sensory, and socioemotional capability. Furthermore,
   parenting, social influences, and the food environment influence the
   development of eating behavior. The rapid expansion of new knowledge in
   this field, from basic science to clinical and community-based research,
   is expected to lead to urgently needed research in support of effective,
   evidence-based prevention and treatment strategies for undernutrition,
   overnutrition, and eating disorders in early childhood. Using a
   biopsychosocial approach, this review covers current knowledge of the
   development of eating behavior from the brain to the individual child,
   taking into account important contextual influences. (J Dev Behav

AB Objective. Accelerated atherosclerosis is a major cause of death in
   systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), yet little is known about the effect
   of socioeconomic status. We investigated whether education or income
   levels are associated with cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes in
   SLE.
   Methods. Our study involved a longitudinal cohort of all patients with
   SLE enrolled in the Hopkins Lupus Cohort from 1987 through September
   2011. Socioeconomic status was measured by education level (>= 12 years
   or < 12) and income tertiles (> $60,000, $25,000 $60,000, or < $25,000).
   Results. A total of 1752 patients with SLE were followed prospectively
   every 3 months. There were 1052 whites and 700 African Americans.
   Current smoking, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus were more
   common in African Americans (p < 0.01 for all), but there was no
   statistical difference in the frequency of myocardial infarction or
   stroke. In multivariate analyses stratified by ethnicity, low income was
   strongly associated with most traditional cardiovascular risk factors in
   whites, but only with smoking and diabetes in African Americans. In
   whites, low income increased the risk of both myocardial infarction (OR
   3.24, 95% CI 1.41-7.45, p = 0.006) and stroke (OR 2.85, 95% CI
   1.56-5.21, p = 0.001); in African Americans, these relationships were
   not seen. Low education, in contrast, was associated with smoking in
   both ethnic groups.
   Conclusion. Low income, not low education, is the socioeconomic status
   variable associated with cardiovascular risk factors and events. This
   association is most clearly demonstrable in whites. (First Release March

AB Human behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of others.
   Obtaining a good reputation or avoiding a bad one is a powerful
   incentive for a plethora of human actions. Theoretical considerations
   suggest that reputation may be a key mediator of aspects of altruistic
   behavior that are uniquely human. Despite its considerable influence on
   human social behavior and the growing interest in social neuroscience,
   investigations of the neural basis of reputation-based decision-making
   are still in their infancy. Here, I argue that reputation is an
   important aspect of human social cognition and present some of the

AB Pandemic influenza planning in the United States violates the demands of
   social justice in 2 fundamental respects: it embraces the neutrality of
   procedural justice at the expense of more substantive concern with
   health disparities, thus perpetuating a predictable and preventable
   social injustice, and it fails to move beyond lament to practical
   planning for alleviating barriers to accessing care.
   A pragmatic social justice approach, addressing both health disparities
   and access barriers, should inform pandemic preparedness.
   Achieving social justice goals in pandemic response is challenging, but
   strategies are available to overcome the obstacles. The public
   engagement process of one state's pandemic ethics project influenced the
   development of these strategies. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102: 586-591.

AB Objectives. To better understand why some people worry more about
   terrorism compared with others, we measured how much US residents
   worried about a terrorist event in their area and examined the
   association of their fears with their concerns about acute and chronic
   hazards and other correlates.
   Methods. In 2008 (n = 600) and 2010 (n = 651), we performed a
   random-digit dialing national landline telephone survey. We asked about
   worries about terrorism and 5 other environmental health hazard issues.
   We also collected demographic and socioeconomic data.
   Results. Only 15% worried "a great deal" about a terrorist event in
   their area and 18% to 33% were greatly concerned about other
   environmental issues. Fear about acute hazard events was a stronger
   predictor of a great deal of concern about terrorism than were age,
   race/ethnicity, gender, educational achievement, and other correlates.
   Conclusions. Those who worried most about acute environmental health
   hazard events were most likely to worry about terrorism. Also, those who
   were older, poorer, Blacks, or Latinos, or who lived in populous urban
   areas felt they were most vulnerable to terrorist attacks. We recommend
   methods to involve US citizens as part of disaster planning. (Am J

AB Objectives. We examined whether the health risk behaviors of lesbian,
   gay, and bisexual (LGB) youths are determined in part by the religious
   composition of the communities in which they live.
   Methods. Data were collected from 31 852 high school students, including
   1413 LGB students, who participated in the Oregon Healthy Teens survey
   in 2006 through 2008. Supportive religious climate was operationalized
   according to the proportion of individuals (of the total number of
   religious adherents) who adhere to a religion supporting homosexuality.
   Comprehensive data on religious climate were derived from 85
   denominational groups in 34 Oregon counties.
   Results. Among LGB youths, living in a county with a religious climate
   that was supportive of homosexuality was associated with significantly
   fewer alcohol abuse symptoms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.58; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 0.40, 0.85) and fewer sexual partners (OR = 0.77; 95% Cl
   = 0.60, 0.99). The effect of religious climate on health behaviors was
   stronger among LGB than heterosexual youths. Results remained robust
   after adjustment for multiple confounding factors.
   Conclusions. The religious climate surrounding LGB youths may serve as a
   determinant of their health risk behaviors. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We examined how US cultural involvement related to suicide
   attempts among youths in the Dominican Republic.
   Methods. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of
   youths attending high school in the Dominican Republic (n=8446). The
   outcome of interest was a suicide attempt during the past year. The US
   cultural involvement indicators included time spent living in the United
   States, number of friends who had lived in the United States, English
   proficiency, and use of US electronic media and language.
   Results. Time lived in the United States, US electronic media and
   language, and number of friends who had lived in the United States had
   robust positive relationships with suicide attempts among youths
   residing in the Dominican Republic.
   Conclusions. Our results are consistent with previous research that
   found increased risk for suicide or suicide attempts among Latino youths
   with greater US cultural involvement. Our study adds to this research by
   finding similar results in a nonimmigrant Latin American sample. Our
   results also indicate that suicide attempts are a major public health
   problem among youths in the Dominican Republic. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We examined whether the risk of premature mortality
   associated with living in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods
   varies according to the health status of individuals.
   Methods. Community-dwelling adults (n=566402; age=50-71 years) in 6 US
   states and 2 metropolitan areas participated in the ongoing prospective
   National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, which began in
   1995. We used baseline data for 565679 participants on health behaviors,
   self-rated health status, and medical history, collected by mailed
   questionnaires. Participants were linked to 2000 census data for an
   index of census tract socioeconomic deprivation. The main outcome was
   all-cause mortality ascertained through 2006.
   Results. In adjusted survival analyses of persons in good-to-excellent
   health at baseline, risk of mortality increased with increasing levels
   of census tract socioeconomic deprivation. Neighborhood socioeconomic
   mortality disparities among persons in fair-to-poor health were not
   statistically significant after adjustment for demographic
   characteristics, educational achievement, lifestyle, and medical
   conditions.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood socioeconomic inequalities lead to large
   disparities in risk of premature mortality among healthy US adults but
   not among those in poor health. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:680-688.

AB Objectives. We considered interactions between physical activity and
   body mass index (BMI) and neighborhood factors.
   Methods. We used recursive partitioning to identify predictors of low
   recreational physical activity (<2.5 hours/week) and overweight and
   obesity (BMI >= 25.0 kg/m(2)) among 118 315 women in the California
   Teachers Study. Neighborhood characteristics were based on 2000 US
   Census data and Reference US business listings.
   Results. Low physical activity and being overweight or obese were
   associated with individual sociodemographic characteristics, including
   race/ethnicity and age. Among White women aged 36 to 75 years, living in
   neighborhoods with more household crowding was associated with a higher
   probability of low physical activity (54% vs 45% to 51%). In less
   crowded neighborhoods where more people worked outside the home, the
   existence of fewer neighborhood amenities was associated with a higher
   probability of low physical activity (51% vs 46%). Among non-African
   American middle-aged women, living in neighborhoods with a lower
   socioeconomic status was associated with a higher probability of being
   overweight or obese (46% to 59% vs 38% in high-socioeconomic status
   neighborhoods).
   Conclusions. Associations between physical activity, overweight and

AB Context: Community epidemiological data on the prevalence and correlates
   of adolescent mental disorders are needed for policy planning purposes.
   Only limited data of this sort are available.
   Objective: To present estimates of 12-month and 30-day prevalence,
   persistence (12-month prevalence among lifetime cases and 30-day
   prevalence among 12-month cases), and sociodemographic correlates of
   commonly occurring DSM-IV disorders among adolescents in the National
   Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent Supplement.
   Design: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent
   Supplement is a US national survey of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavior,
   and substance disorders among US adolescents based on face-to-face
   interviews in the homes of respondents with supplemental parent
   questionnaires.
   Setting: Dual-frame household and school samples of US adolescents.
   Participants: A total of 10 148 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years
   (interviews) and 1 parent of each adolescent (questionnaires).
   Main Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders assessed with the World
   Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview and
   validated with blinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for
   Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children. Good
   concordance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve >=
   0.80) was found between Composite International Diagnostic Interview and
   Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age
   Children diagnoses.
   Results: The prevalence estimates of any DSM-IV disorder are 40.3% at 12
   months (79.5% of lifetime cases) and 23.4% at 30 days (57.9% of 12-month
   cases). Anxiety disorders are the most common class of disorders,
   followed by behavior, mood, and substance disorders. Although relative
   disorder prevalence is quite stable over time, 30-day to 12-month
   prevalence ratios are higher for anxiety and behavior disorders than
   mood or substance disorders, suggesting that the former are more chronic
   than the latter. The 30-day to 12-month prevalence ratios are generally
   lower than the 12-month to lifetime ratios, suggesting that disorder
   persistence is due more to episode recurrence than to chronicity.
   Sociodemographic correlates are largely consistent with previous
   studies.
   Conclusions: Among US adolescents, DSM-IV disorders are highly prevalent
   and persistent. Persistence is higher for adolescents than among adults
   and appears to be due more to recurrence than chronicity of
   child-adolescent onset disorders.

AB Context: Estimates of DSM-IV disorder prevalence are high; stringent

   Objective: To present US national data on the prevalence and

   (SED), defined by the US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
   Administration, from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication
   Adolescent Supplement.
   Design: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication Adolescent
   Supplement is a national survey of DSM-IV anxiety, mood, behavior, and
   substance disorders among US adolescents.
   Setting: Dual-frame household and school samples of US adolescents.
   Participants: Total of 6483 pairs of adolescents aged 13 to 17
   (interviews) and parents (questionnaires).
   Main Outcome Measures: The DSM-IV disorders were assessed with the World
   Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview and
   validated with blinded clinical interviews based on the Schedule for
   Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children. Serious
   emotional disturbance was operationalized as a DSM-IV/Composite
   International Diagnostic Interview disorder with a score of 50 or less
   on the Children's Global Assessment Scale (ie, moderate impairment in
   most areas of functioning or severe impairment in at least 1 area).
   Concordance of Composite International Diagnostic Interview SED
   diagnoses with blinded Schedule for Affective Disorders and
   Schizophrenia for School-Age Children diagnoses was good.
   Results: The estimated prevalence of SED was 8.0%. Most SEDs were due to
   behavior (54.5%) or mood (31.4%) disorders. Although respondents with 3
   or more disorders made up only 29.0% of those with 12-month
   DSM-IV/Composite International Diagnostic Interview disorders, they
   constituted 63.5% of SEDs. Predictive effects of high comorbidity were
   significantly greater than the product of their disorder-specific odds
   ratios and consistent across disorder types. Associations of
   sociodemographic variables with SED were generally nonsignificant after
   controlling for disorder type and number.
   Conclusions: The high estimated 12-month prevalence of DSM-IV disorders
   among US adolescents is largely due to mild cases. The significant
   between-disorder differences in risk of SED and the significant effect
   of high comorbidity have important public health implications for
   targeting interventions.

AB Context: Comprehensive descriptions of substance use and abuse
   trajectories have been lacking in nationally representative samples of
   adolescents.
   Objective: To examine the prevalence, age at onset, and sociodemographic
   correlates of alcohol and illicit drug use and abuse among US
   adolescents.
   Design: Cross-sectional survey of adolescents using a modified version
   of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
   Setting: Combined household and school adolescent samples.
   Participants: Nationally representative sample of 10 123 adolescents
   aged 13 to 18 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime estimates of alcohol and illicit
   substance use and DSM-IV diagnoses of abuse, with or without dependence.
   Results: By late adolescence, 78.2% of US adolescents had consumed
   alcohol, 47.1% had reached regular drinking levels defined by at least
   12 drinks within a given year, and 15.1% met criteria for lifetime
   abuse. The opportunity to use illicit drugs was reported by 81.4% of the
   oldest adolescents, drug use by 42.5%, and drug abuse by 16.4%. The
   median age at onset was 14 years for alcohol abuse with or without
   dependence, 14 years for drug abuse with dependence, and 15 years for
   drug abuse without dependence. The associations observed by age, sex,
   and race/ethnicity often varied significantly by previous stage of use.
   Conclusions: Alcohol and drug use is common in US adolescents, and the
   findings of this study indicate that most cases of abuse have their
   initial onset in this important period of development. Prevention and
   treatment efforts would benefit from careful attention to the correlates
   and risk factors that are specific to the stage of substance use in
   adolescents.

   gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and low socioeconomic status (SES)
   on neurodevelopment and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
   outcomes.
   Design: Cohort study.
   Setting: Flushing, New York.
   Participants: A total of 212 preschool children as a part the ongoing
   cohort study.
   Main Exposures: Gestational diabetes mellitus and low SES.
   Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes are ADHD diagnosis based on
   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition)
   criteria at age 6 years and several well-validated measures of
   neurobehavioral outcomes, cognitive functioning, ADHD symptoms, and
   temperament at age 4 years. Secondary outcomes are parent and teacher
   reports of behavioral and emotional problems at age 6 years.
   Neurobehavioral measures in relation to GDM and low SES were examined
   using generalized estimating equations and multivariate logistic
   regression analyses.
   Results: Both maternal GDM and low SES were associated with an
   approximately 2-fold increased risk for ADHD at age 6 years. However,
   the risk by GDM was greater among lower SES families than among higher
   SES families. Children exposed to both GDM and low SES demonstrated
   compromised neurobehavioral functioning, including lower IQ, poorer
   language, and impoverished behavioral and emotional functioning. A test
   of additive interaction found that the risk for ADHD increased over
   14-fold (P=.006) when children were exposed to both GDM and low SES.
   Neither children exposed to maternal GDM alone nor those exposed to low
   SES alone had a notable increased risk for ADHD.
   Conclusions: Maternal GDM and low SES, especially in combination,
   heighten the risk for childhood ADHD. Longterm prevention efforts should
   be directed at mothers with GDM to avoid suboptimal neurobehavioral
   development and mitigate the risk for ADHD among their offspring.

AB This study revisits a debate played out in Current Anthropology as to
   whether subsistence decisions are the result of individual strategy to
   cope with poverty and increase wealth (advanced by Kuznar in 2001 and
   2002) or conformity to social norms (advanced by Henrich and McElreath
   in 2002)-a debate that mirrors discussions within the behavioral
   sciences about individual versus social learning and within the social
   sciences about agency versus structure. This study, set in southwestern
   Madagascar, goes beyond previous investigations by examining the
   influence on choices in simple risk and time preference experiments of
   multiple measures of income, wealth, status, and need, as well as
   conformity at three nested levels: ethnicity (Masikoro, Mikea, and
   Vezo), village, and clan. Logistic regression models found that both
   wealth and income variables and social group memberships predict
   choices, where the bestfit model, evaluated with the Akaike Information
   Criterion, combined income and either ethnicity or village. The
   coinfluence of strategy and conformity on economic decisions suggests
   that humans habitually balance individual goals against social
   pressures. Equating wealth effects with individual learning and rational
   choice or equating ethnic effects with social learning and bounded
   rationality erects a series of false dichotomies.

AB Aims: To quantify relationships between societal-level factors and
   diabetes prevalence and identify potential policy responses.
   Methods: Using data from International Diabetes Federation, World Health
   Organization, World Bank, and Food and Agricultural Organization, we
   extracted recent estimates for country-level variables: total caloric
   availability; sugar, animal fat, fruit and vegetable availability;
   physical inactivity markers (vehicles per capita and value-added from
   service sector); gross domestic product per capita (GDP); imports; and
   age-adjusted mortality rate. We used generalized linear models to
   investigate relationships between these factors and diabetes prevalence.
   Results: Median global diabetes prevalence was 6.4% in 2010. Every
   additional percentage point of calories from sugar/sweeteners and from
   animal fats were associated with 5% (OR: 1.05, 95% CI 1.02-1.07) and 3%
   (OR: 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.06) higher diabetes prevalence, respectively,
   while each additional unit in fruit and vegetable availability was
   associated with 3% lower diabetes prevalence (OR: 0.97, 95% CI
   0.93-0.99). One percent higher GDP from the service industry was
   associated with a 1% higher diabetes prevalence (OR: 1.01, 95% CI
   0.99-1.02).
   Conclusion: Macro-level societal factors are associated with diabetes
   prevalence. Investigating how these factors affect individual-level
   diabetes risk may offer further insight into policy-level interventions.

AB Purpose: To evaluate trends in the geographic distribution of the
   radiation oncology (RO) workforce.
   Methods and Materials: We used the 1995 and 2007 versions of the Area
   Resource File to map the ratio of RO to the population aged 65 years or
   older (ROR) within different health service areas (HSA) within the
   United States. We used regression analysis to find associations between
   population variables and 2007 ROR. We calculated Gini coefficients for
   ROR to assess the evenness of RO distribution and compared that with
   primary care physicians and total physicians.
   Results: There was a 24% increase in the RO workforce from 1995 to 2007.
   The overall growth in the RO workforce was less than that of primary
   care or the overall physician workforce. The mean ROR among HSAs
   increased by more than one radiation oncologist per 100,000 people aged
   65 years or older, from 5.08 per 100,000 to 6.16 per 100,000. However,
   there remained consistent geographic variability concerning RO
   distribution, specifically affecting the non-metropolitan HSAs.
   Regression analysis found higher ROR in HSAs that possessed higher
   education (p = 0.001), higher income (p < 0.001), lower unemployment
   rates (p < 0.001), and higher minority population (p = 0.022). Gini
   coefficients showed RO distribution less even than for both primary care
   physicians and total physicians (0.326 compared with 0.196 and 0.292,
   respectively).
   Conclusions: Despite a modest growth in the RO workforce, there exists
   persistent geographic maldistribution of radiation oncologists allocated
   along socioeconomic and racial lines. To solve problems surrounding the
   RO workforce, issues concerning both gross numbers and geographic
   distribution must be addressed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Study Design. A retrospective-cohort investigation (N = 245) utilizing a
   review of patient medical records and costs accrued through the Workers'
   Compensation Fund of Utah.
   Objective. To replicate a previous study of compensation and medical
   costs in compensated lumbar fusion patients, to identify changes in
   costs across time, and to identify biopsychosocial variables predictive
   of current costs.
   Summary of Background Data. Previous studies have demonstrated that
   medical costs associated with lumbar fusion have been rising
   drastically. It is unclear whether rising fusion costs are occurring in
   compensation populations. Prior studies have also demonstrated that
   costs can be predicted on the basis of presurgical biopsychosocial
   variables, and there is a need to determine whether such variables are
   still relevant.
   Methods. A retrospective review of patient medical records and
   compensation and medical costs paid by the Workers' Compensation Fund of
   Utah was performed.
   Results. Since the mid-1990s, medical costs for compensated lumbar
   fusion patients in Utah have risen approximately 174%, whereas
   compensation costs have increased roughly with the pace of inflation.
   Wage and assignment to nurse case management predicted compensation
   costs, whereas assignment to nurse case management also predicted
   medical costs.
   Conclusion. Medical costs among compensated Utah patients receiving
   lumbar fusion have risen dramatically since the 1990s, whereas
   compensation costs have not. Biopsychosocial variables continue to be
   predictive of these costs, although to a more modest degree than in
   prior studies. Further investigations should look at other factors
   leading to increased medical costs.

AB Background: The relative affordability of energy-dense versus
   nutrient-rich foods may promote socioeconomic disparities in dietary
   quality and obesity. Although supermarkets are the largest food source
   in the American diet, the associations between SES and the cost and
   nutrient content of freely chosen food purchases have not been
   described.
   Purpose: To investigate relationships of SES with the energy cost
   ($/1000 kcal) and nutrient content of freely chosen supermarket
   purchases.
   Methods: Supermarket shoppers (n = 69) were recruited at a Phoenix AZ
   supermarket in 2009. The energy cost and nutrient content of
   participants' purchases were calculated from photographs of food
   packaging and nutrition labels using dietary analysis software. Data
   were analyzed in 2010-2011.
   Results: Two SES indicators, education and household income as a
   percentage of the federal poverty guideline (FPG), were associated with
   the energy cost of purchased foods. Adjusting for covariates, the amount
   spent on 1000 kcal of food was $0.26 greater for every multiple of the
   FPG, and those with a baccalaureate or postbaccalaureate degree spent an
   additional $1.05 for every 1000 kcal of food compared to those with no
   college education. Lower energy cost was associated with higher total
   fat and less protein, dietary fiber, and vegetables per 1000 kcal
   purchased.
   Conclusions: Low-SES supermarket shoppers purchase calories in
   inexpensive forms that are higher in fat and less nutrient-rich. (Am J

   Exerc., Vol. 44, No. 4, pp. 637-646, 2012. Background: There is growing
   interest in identifying neighborhood environment factors related to
   physical activity. Purpose: This study aimed to examine whether
   objective built (e.g., residential density) and perceived (e.g.,
   aesthetics) environment factors around adults' residence are correlates
   of their physical activity and reported walking behavior after
   accounting for known psychosocial (e.g., self-efficacy, barriers to
   physical activity) and demographic correlates of physical activity.
   Methods: Objective built environment characteristics were created
   through network buffers around individual participants (n = 2199)
   selected from neighborhoods differing on walkability characteristics and
   household income. Participants wore accelerometers to obtain a more
   objective measure of overall physical activity and self-reported on
   leisure and transportation-related walking, perceptions of neighborhood
   environment, ps-ychosocial factors related to physical activity, and
   demographic factors. Census-level demographic factors were also
   considered. Results: Retail floor area ratio, a metric combining land
   use mix and pedestrian design factors, was the environmental factor most
   related to accelerometry-measured physical activity and self-reported
   transportation-related walking after accounting for psychosocial and
   demographic factors. Street connectivity was also related to
   transportation-related walking, whereas perceived aesthetics was
   positively related to leisure walking. Conclusions: Environmental
   factors, particularly the availability of proximal nonresidential
   destinations designed for pedestrian access, were related to adults'
   physical activity and walking after accounting for psychosocial and
   demographic correlates, including reasons for residential selection.

AB This paper applies social capital analysis to the geographic variations
   in health care utilization documented by the Dartmouth Atlas project.
   The paper proposes a typology of social capital effects on behaviour
   relevant to health policy, including a dimension of interpersonal
   transactions in which strict adherence to a duty to others may be
   overcome by a measure of selfishness. The paper examines the concept of
   physician-induced demand through this lens, hypothesizing that regions
   with low social capital will have a higher intensity of health care
   resource utilization. A series of regressions employing indicators of
   intensity is presented to illustrate a likely link between social
   capital and utilization. The paper concludes that, while other effects
   of social capital may explain geographic variations, there appears to be
   enough circumstantial evidence of opportunistic behaviour by physicians
   to justify consideration of more rigorous physician payment policies in
   the US Medicare programme.

   explore change in the systematic assessment of teaching methods and
   techniques since Baker's and Chin's studies and the extent to which
   publications in Teaching Sociology reflect improved assessment. We find
   that while there has been improvement, not all articles reflect the
   growing scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) movement. While the
   mission of Teaching Sociology is to publish materials that would be
   "helpful to the discipline's teachers" (see the journal's mission
   statement at http://asanet.org/journals/ts/index.cfm), the most useful
   information is arguably that which is supported by the kind of
   systematic assessment that SoTL requires. We also discuss implications

   how biological factors (e.g., genetics), individual-level behaviors
   (e.g., smoking), and social factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) shape
   health status and access to health care. Active learning techniques were
   utilized to introduce the sociological imagination as it pertains to
   health, as well as to physically demonstrate stratification processes. A
   pretest-posttest design was implemented to evaluate the activity's
   impact on student learning outcomes (N = 305). Analysis suggests that
   after the activity students regarded society as important for
   influencing health, including a shift in responsibility for one's health
   away from the individual, and that students gained a greater
   understanding of the importance of social class in shaping health. In
   open-ended responses, students indicated that the physicality of the
   approach provided further clarity of abstract concepts. Implications of
   these findings and broader directions for advancing students'
   understanding of disparities related to health are discussed.

   premeasures. Students also stated that the highly structured nature of
   the course was important for their success but somewhat frustrating.
   Other important student perceptions were that the course was demanding
   and time consuming; past courses helped prepare for the capstone
   experience but that there are gaps in this preparation; they learn best
   via active learning, feedback, and application; they are proud of their

AB Sociology majors learn that sociological theory is foundational to our
   field; it frames the way we look at the world and provides guiding
   questions for our social inquiry. But sociology instructors know that
   teaching theory is a challenge. A number of activities have been created
   to engage students in sociological theory courses. This note discusses
   an exercise that adds to these activities and is tied to the learning
   outcomes of a theory course. The author's students are given a
   challenge: For 72 hours back-to-back, avoid checking or communicating
   via Facebook or MySpace; making calls from cell phones, unless it is an
   emergency; and texting or e-mailing from cell phones and handheld
   devices. The author found that this Technology Fast Challenge helped
   students foster a sociological perspective and allowed them to engage
   the ideas and questions of major social theorists. The author discusses
   the format of the challenge, the outcomes, and applications to other
   courses.

AB This paper explores issues that are central to ecological economics. In
   spite of a substantial body of research and other literature that has
   appeared in recent decades on transition, and countless other efforts,
   no progress has been made to halt the increase in global warming, global
   emissions, rampant population growth, or several hundred other critical
   planet sustainability indicators including global species extinction.
   The opposite is true. Consumption has escalated and it is poised to
   double and, with it, planetary decay has followed closely. The aim of
   this work is to introduce a pragmatic solution and the economics
   mechanisms solidly rooted in science, in the laws of conservation of
   mass and energy, and in environmental and ecological sustainability that
   are necessary to overcome the tremendous forces of social, political,
   and economic resistance to major change. To advance towards a
   sustainable civilization, adopting a holistic approach with those
   underlying principles in all aspects of human activity, among others
   economy, finance, industry, commerce, engineering, politics,
   architecture, and education, is both lacking and fundamentally required.
   A short review of the state-of-the-art of the science on the critical
   status of the planet's resources and its life-supporting systems is
   presented, as well as a brief catalog of the seminal works of the
   science that gave rise to its metrics and established early on the
   groundwork for the understanding of the degree of sustainability of the
   planet. We present the argument why past and current schemes of human
   economics, organization, culture, and politics cannot achieve anything
   else, but complete and utter failure under their own underlying
   precepts. A rigorous and disciplined process on how to overcome and
   avoid the precipitous decline and collapse of the environmental and
   planetary biosystems on which all life depends, including human life,
   and a new view towards the world and the universe we all have no choice
   but to live in, are also offered.

AB Low-income communities and communities of color often suffer from
   multiple environmental hazards that pose risks to their health. Here we
   extended a cumulative environmental hazard inequality index (CEHII) -
   developed to assess inequalities in air pollution hazards - to compare
   the inequality among three urban counties in California: Alameda, San
   Diego, and Los Angeles. We included a metric for heat stress to the
   analysis because exposure to excessively hot weather is increasingly
   recognized as a threat to human health and well-being. We determined if
   inequalities from heat stress differed between the three regions and if
   this added factor modified the metric for inequality from cumulative
   exposure to air pollution. This analysis indicated that of the three air
   pollutants considered, diesel particulate matter had the greatest
   inequality, followed by nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate
   matter (PM2.5). As measured by our index, the inequalities from
   cumulative exposure to air pollution were greater than those of single
   pollutants. Inequalities were significantly different among single air
   pollutant hazards within each region and between regions; however,
   inequalities from the cumulative burdens did not differ significantly
   between any two regions. Modeled absolute and relative heat stress
   inequalities were small except for relative heat stress in San Diego
   which had the second highest inequality. Our analysis, techniques, and
   results provide useful insights for policy makers to assess inequalities
   between regions and address factors that contribute to overall
   environmental inequality within each region. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Background Although the prevalence of prenatal smoking among minority
   women exceeds the projected 2010 national objective, data on the
   determinants of prenatal smoking among minorities remain sparse.
   Methods We examined associations between self-reported experiences of
   racial discrimination on prenatal smoking among urban black and Hispanic
   women aged 18-44 years (n=677). Our main independent variable was
   created from the Experiences of Discrimination (EOD) scale.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were estimated to examine the
   relationship between EOD (moderate EOD as the referent group) and
   smoking for the entire sample and then separately by race/ethnicity
   adjusted for sociodemographic variables. We also examined the role of
   ethnic identity (EI) as a buffer to racial discrimination (n=405).
   Results The prevalence of smoking was 18.1% versus 10% for black and
   Hispanic women, respectively (p=0.002). There were no significant
   differences in the level of EOD based on race. In multivariate
   regressions, compared to those reporting moderate EOD, women reporting
   high discrimination (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.60) had higher odds of
   smoking. In stratified analyses, this relationship remained significant
   only in black women. Results suggest that foreign-born Hispanic women
   with higher EI were less likely to smoke compared to their low-EI
   counterparts (3.5 vs 10.1%; p=0.08).
   Conclusion These are the first data in pregnant minority women showing
   an association between discrimination and increased risk of smoking
   particularly among black women. Ethnic identity and nativity status were
   also associated with smoking risk. Smoking cessation programmes should
   consider such factors among childbearing minority women.

AB Background: This study compared two interventions for improving the
   social skills of high functioning children with autism spectrum
   disorders in general education classrooms. One intervention involved a
   peer-mediated approach (PEER) and the other involved a child-assisted
   approach (CHILD). Method: The two interventions were crossed in a 2 x 2
   factorial design yielding control, PEER, CHILD, and both PEER and CHILD
   conditions. Sixty children participated from 56 classrooms in 30
   schools. Interventions involved 12 sessions over 6 weeks, with a 3-month
   follow-up. Outcome measures included self, peer and teacher reports of
   social skills and independent weekly observations of children on their
   school playground over the course of the intervention. Results:
   Significant improvements were found in social network salience, number
   of friendship nominations, teacher report of social skills in the
   classroom, and decreased isolation on the playground for children who
   received PEER interventions. Changes obtained at the end of the
   treatment persisted to the 3-month follow-up. Conclusions: These data
   suggest that significant improvements can be made in peer social
   connections for children with autism spectrum disorders in general
   education classrooms with a brief intervention, and that these gains
   persist over time.

AB The wide adoption of social media has increased the competition among
   ideas for our finite attention. We employ a parsimonious agent-based
   model to study whether such a competition may affect the popularity of
   different memes, the diversity of information we are exposed to, and the
   fading of our collective interests for specific topics. Agents share
   messages on a social network but can only pay attention to a portion of
   the information they receive. In the emerging dynamics of information
   diffusion, a few memes go viral while most do not. The predictions of
   our model are consistent with empirical data from Twitter, a popular
   microblogging platform. Surprisingly, we can explain the massive
   heterogeneity in the popularity and persistence of memes as deriving
   from a combination of the competition for our limited attention and the
   structure of the social network, without the need to assume different
   intrinsic values among ideas.

AB Introduction: Since the 1960 s, the number of international medical
   graduates (IMGs) in the United States has increased significantly. Given
   concerns regarding the effects of this loss to their countries of
   origin, the authors undertook a study of IMGs from lower income
   countries currently practicing in the United States.
   Methods: The AMA Physician Masterfile was accessed to identify all
   265,851 IMGs in active practice in the United States. These were divided
   by state of practice and country of origin. World Bank income
   classification was used to identify lower income countries.
   Results: 128,729 IMGs were identified from 53 lower income countries,
   constituting 15 percent of the US active physician workforce. As a
   percentage of the workforce, West Virginia (29%), New Jersey (27%), and
   Michigan (26%) had the most IMGs from lower income countries, and
   Montana, Idaho, and Alaska (all less than 2%), the least. The countries
   with the greatest loss of physicians to the United States per 100,000
   population were the Philippines, Syria, Jordan, and Haiti.
   Discussion: The reliance of US medicine on physicians from lower income
   countries is beneficial to the United States both clinically and
   economically. However, it results in a loss of the lower income
   country's investment in the IMG's education. We discuss possible
   mechanisms to compensate the lower income countries for the medical
   education costs of their physicians who immigrate to the US.

AB Background: Social and structural influences of condom negotiation among
   female sex workers (FSWs) remain understudied. This study assesses
   environmental and individual factors associated with condom negotiation
   among FSWs at high risk for acquiring HIV in a large urban setting of
   Metro Manila, Philippines.
   Methods: Female bar/spa workers (N = 498), aged 18 and over, underwent
   interview-led surveys examining their sexual health practices in the
   context of their risk environments. Data were collected from April
   2009-January 2010 from 54 venues. Multiple logistic regressions were
   conducted to assess socio-behavioral factors (e. g., age, education,
   length of time employed as an entertainer, and alcohol/drug use) and
   socio-structural factors (e. g., venue-level peer/manager support,
   condom rule/availability, and sex trafficking) associated with condom
   negotiation, adjusting for individuals nested within venues.
   Results: Of 142 FSWs who traded sex in the previous 6 months (included
   in the analysis), 24% did not typically negotiate condom use with venue
   patrons. Factors in the physical environment - trafficked/coerced into
   work (AOR = 12.92, 95% CI = 3.34-49.90), economic environment - sex
   without a condom to make more money (AOR = 1.52, 95% CI 1.01-2.30),
   policy environment - sex without a condom because none was available
   (AOR = 2.58, 95% CI = 1.49-4.48), and individual risk - substance use
   (AOR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.28-4.35) were independently associated with
   FSWs' lack of condom negotiation with venue patrons.
   Conclusions: Factors in the physical, economic, and policy environments,
   over individual (excepting substance use) and social level factors, were
   significantly associated with these FSWs' condom negotiations in the
   Philippines. Drawing upon Rhodes' risk environment framework, these
   results highlight the need for policies that support safer sex
   negotiations among sex workers in the context of their risk
   environments. Interventions should reduce barriers to condom negotiation
   for FSWs trafficked/coerced into their work, substance using, and
   impacted by economic conditions and policies that do not support condom
   availability.

AB Public opinion is often affected by the presence of committed groups of
   individuals dedicated to competing points of view. Using a model of
   pairwise social influence, we study how the presence of such groups
   within social networks affects the outcome and the speed of evolution of
   the overall opinion on the network. Earlier work indicated that a single
   committed group within a dense social network can cause the entire
   network to quickly adopt the group's opinion (in times scaling
   logarithmically with the network size), so long as the committed group
   constitutes more than about 10% of the population (with the findings
   being qualitatively similar for sparse networks as well). Here we study
   the more general case of opinion evolution when two groups committed to
   distinct, competing opinions A and B, and constituting fractions p(A)
   and p(B) of the total population respectively, are present in the
   network. We show for stylized social networks (including Erdos-Renyi
   random graphs and Barabasi-Albert scale-free networks) that the phase
   diagram of this system in parameter space (p(A), p(B)) consists of two
   regions, one where two stable steady-states coexist, and the remaining
   where only a single stable steady-state exists. These two regions are
   separated by two fold-bifurcation (spinodal) lines which meet
   tangentially and terminate at a cusp (critical point). We provide
   further insights to the phase diagram and to the nature of the
   underlying phase transitions by investigating the model on infinite
   (mean-field limit), finite complete graphs and finite sparse networks.
   For the latter case, we also derive the scaling exponent associated with
   the exponential growth of switching times as a function of the distance
   from the critical point.

AB BACKGROUND: A minimum of 12 dissected lymph nodes (LNs) has been
   recommended as a consensus guideline for resections in colon cancer
   patients. This study assessed the influence of both socioeconomic status
   (SES) and hospital type on compliance with this colon LN dissection
   guideline and examined the time trend for =12 LNs dissected.METHODS:
   Stage I to III incident colon cancer cases diagnosed from 1996 to 2007
   were obtained from the Louisiana Tumor Registry. A composite census
   tract-level SES score was created to serve as a surrogate for
   individual-level SES. Hospitals performing colon resections were
   categorized into 5 groups according to the Commission on Cancer
   Accreditation Program. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used.
   RESULTS: Of 10,460 colon cancer cases diagnosed during the study period,
   43.9% had >= 12 LNs dissected. Patients residing in less affluent SES
   areas were less likely to receive a dissection of >= 12 nodes than those
   residing in more affluent areas. SES was no longer significant after
   adjusting for race, sex, age, stage, grade, anatomic subsite, diagnosis
   year, and hospital type. In contrast, hospital type was significantly
   associated with the number of LNs dissected, even after adjusting for
   other factors. Patients diagnosed from 2002 to 2007 were twice as likely
   ( 95% confidence interval, 1.84-2.17) to have >= 12 LNs dissected than
   those diagnosed from 1996 to 2001 after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: In
   Louisiana, hospital type is an independent significant predictor of
   adequate LN evaluation for colon cancer. Training and education are
   needed to reduce this disparity in the facilities with consistently
   lower LN yield in their dissections. Cancer 2012; 118: 1675-83. (C) 2011

AB Objectives: To investigate the possibility that Koreans show different
   patterns in reporting discriminatory experiences based on their gender
   and education level, we analyzed the participants who answered "Not
   Applicable'' for the questions of discriminatory experiences that they
   were eligible to answer.
   Methods: Discriminatory experiences in eight social situations were
   assessed using the 7th wave of Korean Labor and Income Panel Study.
   After restricting the study population to waged workers, a logistic
   regression model was constructed to predict the probability that an
   individual has experienced discrimination based on the observed
   covariates for each of eight situations, using the data of participants
   who answered either Yes or No. With the model fit, the predicted logit
   score of discrimination (PLSD) was obtained for participants who
   answered Not Applicable (NA), as well as for those who answered Yes or
   No. The mean PLSD of the NA group was compared with those of the Yes
   group and the No group after stratification by gender and education
   level using an ANOVA model.
   Results: On the questions of discrimination in getting hired and
   receiving income, the PLSD of the NA group was significantly higher than
   that of the No group and was not different from that of Yes group for
   female and junior high or less educated workers, suggesting that their
   NA responses were more likely to mean that they have experienced
   discrimination. For male and college or more educated workers, the NA
   group had a PLSD similar to that for the No group and had a
   significantly higher PLSD than the Yes group, implying that their NA
   responses would mean they that they have not experienced discrimination.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the responses of NA on the
   discrimination questionnaire may need different interpretation based on
   the respondents' gender and education level in South Korea.

AB The present study explores the dramatic projection of one's own views
   onto those of Jesus among conservative and liberal American Christians.
   In a large-scale survey, the relevant views that each group attributed
   to a contemporary Jesus differed almost as much as their own views.
   Despite such dissonance-reducing projection, however, conservatives
   acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with regard to "fellowship" issues
   (e. g., taxation to reduce economic inequality and treatment of
   immigrants) and liberals acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with
   regard to "morality" issues (e. g., abortion and gay marriage). However,
   conservatives also claimed that a contemporary Jesus would be even more
   conservative than themselves on the former issues whereas liberals
   claimed that Jesus would be even more liberal than themselves on the
   latter issues. Further reducing potential dissonance, liberal and
   conservative Christians differed markedly in the types of issues they
   claimed to be more central to their faith. A concluding discussion
   considers the relationship between individual motivational processes and
   more social processes that may underlie the present findings, as well as
   implications for contemporary social and political conflict.

AB Historical collapse of ancient states poses intriguing social-ecological
   questions, as well as potential applications to global change and
   contemporary strategies for sustainability. Five Old World case studies
   are developed to identify interactive inputs, triggers, and feedbacks in
   devolution. Collapse is multicausal and rarely abrupt. Political
   simplification undermines traditional structures of authority to favor
   militarization, whereas disintegration is preconditioned or triggered by
   acute stress (insecurity, environmental or economic crises, famine),
   with breakdown accompanied or followed by demographic decline. Undue
   attention to stressors risks underestimating the intricate interplay of
   environmental, political, and sociocultural resilience in limiting the
   damages of collapse or in facilitating reconstruction. The conceptual
   model emphasizes resilience, as well as the historical roles of leaders,
   elites, and ideology. However, a historical model cannot simply be
   applied to contemporary problems of sustainability without adjustment
   for cumulative information and increasing possibilities for popular
   participation. Between the 14th and 18th centuries, Western Europe
   responded to environmental crises by innovation and intensification;
   such modernization was decentralized, protracted, flexible, and broadly
   based. Much of the current alarmist literature that claims to draw from
   historical experience is poorly focused, simplistic, and unhelpful. It
   fails to appreciate that resilience and readaptation depend on
   identified options, improved understanding, cultural solidarity,
   enlightened leadership, and opportunities for participation and fresh
   ideas.

AB Episodes of population loss and cultural change, including the famous
   Classic Collapse, punctuated the long course of Maya civilization. In
   many cases, these downturns in the fortunes of individual sites and
   entire regions included significant environmental components such as
   droughts or anthropogenic environmental degradation. Some afflicted
   areas remained depopulated for long periods, whereas others recovered
   more quickly. We examine the dynamics of growth and decline in several
   areas in the Maya Lowlands in terms of both environmental and cultural
   resilience and with a focus on downturns that occurred in the Terminal
   Preclassic (second century Common Era) and Terminal Classic (9th and
   10th centuries CE) periods. This examination of available data indicates
   that the elevated interior areas of the Yucatan Peninsula were more
   susceptible to system collapse and less suitable for resilient recovery
   than adjacent lower-lying areas.

AB Although culture is usually thought of as the collection of knowledge
   and traditions that are transmitted outside of biology, evidence
   continues to accumulate showing how biology and culture are inseparably
   intertwined. Cultural conflict will occur only when the beliefs and
   traditions of one cultural group represent a challenge to individuals of
   another. Such a challenge will elicit brain processes involved in
   cognitive decision-making, emotional activation and physiological
   arousal associated with the outbreak, conduct and resolution of
   conflict. Key targets to understand biocultural differences include
   primitive drives-how the brain responds to likes and dislikes, how it
   discounts the future, and how this relates to reproductive behaviour-but
   also higher level functions, such as how the mind represents and values
   the surrounding physical and social environment. Future cultural wars,
   while they may bear familiar labels of religion and politics, will
   ultimately be fought over control of our biology and our environment.

AB The social science literature contains numerous examples of human
   tribalism and parochialism-the tendency to categorize individuals on the
   basis of their group membership, and treat ingroup members benevolently
   and outgroup members malevolently. We hypothesize that this tribal
   inclination is an adaptive response to the threat of coalitional
   aggression and intergroup conflict perpetrated by 'warrior males' in
   both ancestral and modern human environments. Here, we describe how male
   coalitional aggression could have affected the social psychologies of
   men and women differently and present preliminary evidence from
   experimental social psychological studies testing various predictions
   from the 'male warrior' hypothesis. Finally, we discuss the theoretical
   implications of our research for studying intergroup relations both in
   humans and non-humans and discuss some practical implications.

AB Social contexts can have dramatic effects on decisions. When individuals
   recognize each other as coming from the same social group, they can
   coordinate their actions towards a common goal. Conversely, information
   about group differences can lead to conflicts both economic and
   physical. Understanding how social information shapes decision processes
   is now a core goal both of behavioural economics and neuroeconomics.
   Here, we describe the foundations for research that combines the
   theoretical framework from identity economics with the experimental
   methods of neuroscience. Research at this intersection would fill
   important gaps in the literature not addressed by current approaches in
   either of these disciplines, nor within social neuroscience, psychology
   or other fields. We set forth a simple taxonomy of social contexts based
   on the information content they provide. And, we highlight the key
   questions that would be addressed by a new 'identity neuroeconomics'.
   Such research could serve as an important and novel link between the
   social and natural sciences.

AB Anecdotal evidence abounds that conflicts between two individuals can
   spread across networks to involve a multitude of others. We advance a
   cultural transmission model of intergroup conflict where conflict
   contagion is seen as a consequence of universal human traits (ingroup
   preference, outgroup hostility; i.e. parochial altruism) which give
   their strongest expression in particular cultural contexts. Qualitative
   interviews conducted in the Middle East, USA and Canada suggest that
   parochial altruism processes vary across cultural groups and are most
   likely to occur in collectivistic cultural contexts that have high
   ingroup loyalty. Implications for future neuroscience and computational
   research needed to understand the emergence of intergroup conflict are
   discussed.

AB We used the five weeks leading up to the 2008 presidential election as a
   backdrop to examine the ways that the brain processes attitudes and
   beliefs under different circumstances. We examined individual
   differences in personal issue importance and trait perspective-taking,
   as well as the temporal context in which attitude representation took
   place (i.e. number of days until the election). Finally, we examined the
   extent to which similar or dissimilar processes were recruited when
   considering the attitudes of political ingroup and outgroup candidates.
   Brain regions involved in social cognition and theory of mind, and to a
   lesser extent the limbic system, were modulated by these factors. Higher
   issue importance led to greater recruitment of neural regions involved
   in social cognition, across target perspectives. Higher trait
   perspective-taking was also associated with greater recruitment of
   several regions involved in social cognition, but differed depending on
   target perspective; greater activity was observed in prefrontal regions
   associated with social cognition when considering the perspective of
   one's own candidate compared with the opponent, and this effect was
   amplified closer to the election. Taken together, these results
   highlight ways in which ability and motivational relevance modulate
   socio-affective processing of the attitudes of others.

AB Decisions to trust people with whom we have no personal history can be
   based on their social reputation-a product of what we can observe about
   them (their appearance, social group membership, etc.)-and our own
   beliefs. The striatum and amygdala have been identified as regions of
   the brain involved in trust decisions and trustworthiness estimation,
   respectively. However, it is unknown whether social reputation based on
   group membership modulates the involvement of these regions during trust
   decisions. To investigate this, we examined
   blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity while participants
   completed a series of single-shot trust game interactions with real
   partners of varying races. At the time of choice, baseline BOLD
   responses in the striatum correlated with individuals' trust bias-that
   is, the overall disparity in decisions to trust Black versus White
   partners. BOLD signal in the striatum was higher when deciding to trust
   partners from the race group that the individual participant considered
   less trustworthy overall. In contrast, activation of the amygdala showed
   greater BOLD responses to Black versus White partners that scaled with
   the amount invested. These results suggest that the amygdala may
   represent emotionally relevant social group information as a subset of
   the general detection function it serves, whereas the striatum is
   involved in representing race-based reputations that shape trust
   decisions.

AB Objectives: Our study was conducted to coiled exploratory data on Arab
   mothers in the United States regarding their dietary and physical
   activity behaviors and to assess the relationship of acculturation to
   these behaviors.
   Design: Focus groups and interviews were conducted to collect data on
   dietary and physical activity behaviors of Arab mothers in Lubbock,
   Texas. The Social Cognitive Theory guided the development of questions
   related to the role of acculturation on the dietary and physical
   activity behaviors. The Male Arab-American Acculturation Scale was used
   to measure acculturation.
   Results: A bicultural dietary pattern of Arab mothers emerged. Negative
   behaviors included skipping meals, increased intake of high-fat fast
   foods and meat consumption, and lack of traditional physical activity.
   Some reported reasons for the negative behaviors included children's
   preferences, lack of access to traditional foods, preference for
   convenience, the low cost of some foods, and lack of time. Positive
   changes for some Arab mothers included healthier cooking techniques,
   reading nutritional labels, and making new healthy food choices clue to
   increased awareness of healthy foods, availability and affordability of
   many healthy choices in the United States, and Arab mothers' attempts to
   enrich their families' meals with vegetables in order to keep the Arabic
   dietary pattern.
   Conclusion: Positive dietary and physical activity changes should be
   supported. Nutrition interventions are needed that address the major
   barriers to diet and physical activity changes reported by these Arab
   mothers. (Ethn Dis. 2012;22(2):192-197)

AB Panel surveys are widely used in sociology to examine life-course
   trajectories and to assess causal effects. However, when using panel
   data researchers usually assume that the act of measuring respondents'
   attitudes and behaviors has no effect on the attributes being measured
   or on the accuracy of reports about those attributes. Evidence from
   cognitive psychology, marketing research, political science and other
   fields suggests that this assumption may not be warranted. Using a
   rigorous experimental design, we examine the magnitude of panel
   conditioning bias - the bias emerging from having answered questions in
   prior waves of a survey - in a panel study of substance use among
   adolescents in Chile. We find that adolescents who answered survey
   questions about alcohol, cigarette, marijuana and cocaine use were
   considerably less likely than members of a control group to report
   substance use when re-interviewed one year later. This finding has
   important implications, and also points to the need for sociologists to
   be concerned about panel conditioning as an important methodological
   issue.

AB What is the relationship between state-level politics and the resources
   devoted to children's health insurance programs (CHIP)? The authors
   asses this question by drawing on theories from the power resources,
   institutionalist, logic of industrialism, and racial threat schools of
   thought. The authors find that each approach offers some explanatory
   power for per capita CHIP spending. In particular, Republican strength
   in state legislatures and governorships are associated with diminished
   CHIP spending. Professionalized state legislatures, strong state
   financial capacities, and states with a legacy of social policy
   innovation were linked to greater CHIP spending. States with more
   uninsured children tended to spend more per capita. And states with
   greater numbers of blacks spent less per capita. But there was no
   similar effect for Hispanics. The authors conclude that an array of
   forces at the state level figure prominently in cross-state inequality

   data from a random, national survey of adults to examine the empirical
   connections between perceptions of science and secular identities in the

   correlate strongly with American secularism, particularly among atheists
   and agnostics. Additionally, politicized views of science help account
   for the previously documented relationship between political and secular

AB Contemporary social research often has located religion's public
   influence by focusing on individual or collective religious actors. In
   this unitary actor model, religion is a stable, uniform feature of an
   individual or collectivity. However, recent research shows that people's
   religious expression outside religious congregations varies by context.
   Building on this new work, along with insights from Erving Goffman and
   cultural sociology, an alternative, "cultural-interactionist model" of
   religious expression focuses on how group styles enable and constrain
   religious expression in public settings. Illustrating the model are two
   ethnographic cases, a religiously sponsored homeless advocacy
   organization and a secondary comparison setting from an activist
   campaign for housing, both from a U.S. metropolitan area. Shifting from
   actors to settings and group styles clarifies the interplay between
   religious and nonreligious culture over time. The shift refines our
   understanding of how religion's civic or political effects work, as in
   the case of building social capital for collective action. The
   cultural-interactionist model enables us to track historical change in
   everyday group settings. It promotes further research on historically
   changing ways of managing religious diversity, and diverse ways of
   constructing a religious self.

AB Low socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with mortality in several

   through different pathways. However, the independent effect of each
   measure mutually adjusting for the effect of other SES measures is not
   clear. The association between poverty-income ratio (PIR) and education
   and all-cause mortality among 15,646 adults, aged >20 years, who
   participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey in the USA, was examined. The lower PIR quartiles and less than
   high school education were positively associated with all-cause
   mortality in initial models adjusting for the demographic, lifestyle and
   clinical risk factors. After additional adjustment for education, the
   lower PIR quartiles were still significantly associated with all-cause
   mortality. The multivariable odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval
   (CI)] of all-cause mortality comparing the lowest to the highest
   quartile of PIR was 2.11 (1.52-2.95, p trend <= 0.0001). In contrast,
   after additional adjustment for income, education was no longer
   associated with all-cause mortality [multivariable OR (95% CI) of
   all-cause mortality comparing less than high school to more than high
   school education was 1.05 (0.85-1.31, p trend=0.57)]. The results
   suggest that income may be a stronger predictor of mortality than
   education, and narrowing the income differentials may reduce the health
   disparities.

   population-based cohort, were analyzed. Adolescents were recruited from
   randomly selected geopolitical units (GPUs) in Minnesota at ages 12 to
   13 (n = 1953), and were surveyed every six months (2000-2006) until 18.
   The association between baseline social factors and smoking initiation
   was analyzed using logistic regression. Linear regression was used to
   analyze predictors and age of initiation among smokers (n = 603).
   Results. Higher proportion of 15-16 year-olds who smoke at the
   area-level (GPU) was associated with younger initiation (15.47 vs 15.87,
   p<.05). Higher proportion of the population employed and higher median
   household income were associated with older initiation (15.90 vs. 15.56
   p<.05). Parent education, living with parents or siblings who smoke,
   living in homes that allow smoking, and having friends who smoke at
   baseline were associated with smoking initiation or younger initiation
   (p<.05). Participants whose parents had less than a high school
   education were 1.6 times more likely than those with college educated
   parents to have smoked at least a whole cigarette (CI = 1.06, 2.26).
   Conclusion. Factors at multiple levels of influence effect adolescent
   smoking initiation. Smoking by older age peers and lower SES predicts
   earlier smoking. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Socioeconomic Value and Growth of Naturalized Musa balbisiana L. A.
   Colla Leaves in Honduras. Musa balbisiana (Musaceae) is a seed-producing
   diploid banana indigenous to Southeast Asia. After it was introduced to
   Honduras it became naturalized in nearby second-growth areas of the
   north coast. Local residents were quick to recognize the socioeconomic
   value of these wild banana leaves as a wrap for traditional nacatamales.
   To estimate the monetary value and to provide preliminary data on
   sustainable harvest of these leaves, interviews and field research were
   undertaken in 2009. From July to September of that year, each of 38
   harvesters averaged a weekly sale of 4,400 cut, de-veined, and blanched
   M. balbisiana leaves. This weekly harvest sold for Lempiras (Lps.)
   550.00 or ca. U.S. $30.00 to truckers, who transported them to major
   markets. The number of leaves produced in three months was estimated by
   two techniques: 1) The traditional cut of the entire pseudostem and 2) a
   careful cut to only remove useful leaves. The number of useful leaves
   cut at the onset of the study and three months later was 11 and 13 for
   techniques 1 and 2, respectively. This difference was not significant,
   but the more careful method did yield significantly wider, longer, and a
   greater number of total leaves (useful plus immature). This is the first
   field study to estimate leaf production by naturalized M. balbisiana
   plants in Honduras. All leaves are currently harvested from wild
   populations and no sustainable management plans exist. The socioeconomic
   value and cultural use of M. balbisiana leaves in Honduras is an example
   of an exotic species that has important socioeconomic benefits. This
   naturalized Musa appears to have few of the negative impacts typically
   attributed to exotic plants.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess women's likelihood of feeling comfortable in
   discussing vulvar pain.
   STUDY DESIGN: Using a survey of women with self-reported
   clinician-diagnosed vulvodynia, we assessed the likelihood of comfort in
   discussing vulvar pain within four types of relationships:
   husband/partner, mother/sister, best friend, and other women friends.
   Separate multivariable models were fit for relationship type to
   determine whether vulvar pain characteristics (length, severity, family
   history) were associated with likelihood of feeling comfortable in
   discussing.
   RESULTS: A total of 67% of women with a partner were comfortable
   discussing their vulvar pain with that person, whereas 39% were
   comfortable with family and 26% were comfortable with women friends.
   Independent of age, the more years women had vulvodynia the less likely
   they would be comfortable discussing it. Compared to lower levels of
   vulvar pain, increasing levels (mild, moderate and severe) were
   associated with greater comfort in discussing their pain with friends;
   women were 10% more likely to be comfortable with each increase in pain
   level, and 12% more likely to be comfortable with other women friends.
   CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that vulvar pain characteristics may
   determine how comfortable a woman is to discuss her vulvar pain, but it
   varies by relationship type. (J Reprod Med 2012;57:109-114)

AB Previous research suggests liberal religious advocates often find it
   necessary to use broadly accessible technical or moral language to
   communicate with policymakers and public audiences, yet this conformity
   to secular speech norms diminishes the distinctiveness of their
   religious voices. Communicating through storytelling offers them one way
   of overcoming this dilemma. This is demonstrated by examining liberal
   religious advocacy during recent healthcare reform debates in the United
   States, using data from interviews and public communications by
   advocates. By embedding stories within religiopolitical performances
   that highlight their religious identities, advocates convey
   policy-relevant information without relying on explicitly religious
   language that may be inaccessible or unpersuasive to diverse audiences.
   They also deploy storytelling strategically, bearing witness to
   injustices experienced firsthand, secondhand, from the pews, and from
   the past, depending on the context. These findings have implications for
   ongoing debates about religious citizens capacity to communicate across
   lines of difference in the public sphere.

AB BACKGROUND: Although end-of-life care preferences vary across
   racial/ethnic groups, little is known about how cultural values affect
   end-of-life care preferences among South Asian immigrants and their
   offspring in the US.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine the perspectives of first-and second-generation
   South Asians living in the US regarding end-of-life care.
   DESIGN: Focus group study. Discussions explored participant preferences
   and experiences with family members facing the end of life.
   PARTICIPANTS: Twelve first-generation and 11 second-generation
   self-identified Asian Indians living in the mid-Atlantic region.
   APPROACH: Content analysis of focus group transcripts.
   RESULTS: First-generation participants ranged in age from 41 to 76 years
   and were evenly split by gender. Second-generation participants ranged
   in age from 23 to 36 years and included seven women and four men. All
   participants were highly educated, and two thirds were either studying
   or working in a health care field. All but two subjects were Hindu.
   Several themes emerged that highlighted cultural differences and
   challenges for this population in the context of end-of-life care:
   attitudes toward death and suffering; family duty; and preferences for
   information disclosure and decision making. Participants described
   cultural challenges due to the evolution of traditional roles, lack of
   explicit discussion between patients and family members about
   preferences and care expectations, and a tension between wanting to meet
   traditional expectations and the challenges in doing so given US social
   realities.
   CONCLUSIONS: Traditional cultural values, such as duty to family,
   greatly influenced end-of-life care preferences and retained importance
   across generations. Clinicians caring for Asian Indian patients at the
   end of life may be better able to assess care preferences after
   exploring the complex interplay between traditional expectations and
   specific social realities for each patient. Particular attention should
   be given to attitudes toward death and suffering, family duty, and
   preferences for information disclosure and decision making.

AB The Chicago School of urban sociology and its extension in the spatial
   assimilation model have provided the dominant framework for
   understanding the interplay between immigrant social and spatial
   mobility. However, the main tenets of the theory were derived from the
   experience of prewar, centralized cities; scholars falling under the
   umbrella of the Los Angeles School have recently challenged the extent
   to which they are applicable to the contemporary urban form, which is
   characterized by sprawling, decentralized, and multinucleated
   development. Indeed, new immigrant destinations, such as those scattered
   throughout the American Southeast, are both decentralized and lack prior
   experience with large-scale immigration. Informed by this debate this
   paper traces the formation and early evolution of Hispanic neighborhoods
   in Durham, NC, a new immigrant destination. Using qualitative data we
   construct a social history of immigrant neighborhoods and apply survey
   and census information to examine the spatial pattern of neighborhood
   succession. We also model the sorting of immigrants across neighborhoods
   according to personal characteristics. Despite the many differences in
   urban form and experience with immigration, the main processes forging
   the early development of Hispanic neighborhoods in Durham are remarkably
   consistent with the spatial expectations from the Chicago School, though
   the sorting of immigrants across neighborhoods is more closely connected
   to family dynamics and political economy considerations than purely
   human capital attributes.

   instruments have been developed in the United States, very little or no

   Ages and Stages Questionnaires: Social Emotional (ASQ:SE) by examining
   the appropriateness of the translation as well as its reliability and
   validity when studied with a large sample of Korean young children and
   their parents. Overall, findings were positive. Internal consistency for
   the Korean-translated ASQ:SE was strong, with an overall alpha of .68,
   ranging from .56 to .77. Test-retest reliability was .84 between ASQ:SE
   questionnaires completed by parents at successive time periods. Overall
   agreement of two questionnaire classifications (i.e., at risk, OK)
   completed by parents within one to four weeks was 94. Validity results,
   which were used to establish cutoff points and measure convergent
   validity, were also adequate. Further research on validity and
   reliability of the Korean ASQ:SE with a larger, more diverse sample is

AB BACKGROUND: Since 1900, thousands of medical journal articles have been
   published on the topic of racial disparities in health and medical
   outcomes in the United States, including overlapping disparities based
   on health insurance status. But research on the question of such
   disparities in the medical treatment of injury from assault-matters of
   public safety, considerable public expense, and policy debate-is
   lacking.
   METHODS: To determine differences by race and insurance status on death
   from intentional injury by others on and after trauma center arrival,
   propensity score matching is used to estimate adjusted mortality risk
   ratios by race and medical insurance controlling for facility, case, and
   injury characteristics. Analysis is based on a nationally representative
   sample of 100 Level I and II US trauma centers (National Trauma Data
   Bank 2005-2008) and includes 137,618 black and white assault cases aged
   15 years and older: 35% white, and 65% black, with 46% of the whites and
   60% of the blacks coded as uninsured.
   RESULTS: Black patients showed higher overall raw mortality rates from
   assault than whites (8.9% vs. 5.1%), but after propensity score
   matching, the black to white adjusted risk ratio for death from assault
   (homicide) dropped significantly across firearm, cutting/piercing, and
   blunt injuries. After adjustment, estimated black deaths were 29% in
   excess of white deaths for firearm injuries, 36% in excess for
   cutting/piercing injuries, and 61% in excess for blunt injuries.
   Uninsured blacks comprised 76% of all excess trauma center deaths from
   assault.
   CONCLUSIONS: Along with insurance status, and after excluding on-scene
   deaths, among patients brought to the Level I and II trauma centers,
   race is a substantial independent predictor of who dies from assault.
   Blacks, especially the uninsured, have significantly worse outcomes
   overall, but there is some evidence that this pattern is minimized at
   higher levels of injury severity. (J Trauma. 2012; 72: 773-782.

   improve the collection and reporting of social data for the purpose of
   describing health disparities across subpopulation groups and informing
   equitable health policies. It illustrates how sociologists in
   governmental agencies can be agents of social change in broad-based
   collaborative efforts to improve population health and social policy. It
   describes the context in which a governmental agency is uniquely

AB This article focuses on the ways in which opinion polls in Iran were
   conducted during the 'reform' in Iran (1997-2005). Instead of
   highlighting the various ways in which polls strategically manipulate,
   persuade or represent 'the people', the article shows how the specific
   modes of interpretation of polls enable different kinds of publics.
   Drawing on the case of the Ayandeh Polling Institute, the author
   demonstrates how opinion polling in Iran was utilized as a political
   strategy that contributed to the formation of a counter-public, which
   served as the backbone of the reform movement. The author highlights not
   just the macro-historical processes within which the practice of polling
   is embedded, but also the micro-interactional impact of polling on the
   people whose opinions are being gauged.

AB PURPOSE: Maternal marriage is protective against preterm birth (PTB),
   whereas advanced maternal age is associated with increased PTB risk.
   Because relations between social factors and health may vary during the
   life course, we assessed how the relation between marital status and PTB
   risk may change with maternal age.
   METHODS: We assessed the interaction between marital status and maternal
   age as a determinant of PTB among all live singleton births in Michigan
   between 1995 and 2006. We also fit stratified models by race. We
   calculated absolute differences in predicted PTB as well as odds ratios
   of PTB by marital status for each age group.
   RESULTS: In adjusted models, there was a significant interaction
   (p(interaction) < .001) between marital status and maternal age. The
   predicted probability of PTB by marital status was marginally different
   among mothers ages 20-25 years (absolute difference of 1.5%); this
   difference was substantially greater (3.9% or greater) after 31 years of
   age. Odds of PTB followed a similar trajectory. Findings were similar
   among black and white mothers.
   CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between marriage and PTB may vary with
   maternal age suggesting that the influence of social factors on risk for
   adverse birth outcomes may differ through the maternal life trajectory.
   We discuss plausible explanations for these findings. Ann Epidemic!

AB Mass media exposure is a strong determinant of tobacco use yet little is
   known about this relationship in African countries. We explored
   socio-demographic and socio-contextual correlates of tobacco consumption
   and associations between mass media exposure, gender and the use of any
   and various forms of tobacco among Nigerians.
   The study included 47,805 adults from the cross-sectional and nationally
   representative Nigeria demographic and health survey 2008. Weighted
   binary logistic models predicted any tobacco use whereas weighted
   multinomial logistic models predicted smoking and smokeless tobacco, all
   compared with no tobacco use.
   Approximately 4.2% of Nigerian adults used tobacco-2.7% smoked tobacco
   whereas 1.5% used smokeless tobacco. Tobacco use was more prevalent
   among men than women (12% vs. 0.6%; p value < 0.0001). Gender modified
   the associations between tobacco use and radio exposure or TV exposure
   (p values ranged = 0.02-0.05). Among men, some radio exposure and high
   radio exposure were associated with increased odds of any tobacco use,
   compared with no radio exposure. Among men, infrequently reading
   newspapers/magazines and frequently reading newspapers/magazines were
   associated with higher odds of smokeless tobacco use, compared with not
   reading newspapers/magazines. Among women, infrequently reading
   newspapers/magazines was associated with reduced odds of smokeless
   tobacco use, compared with not reading newspaper/magazines.
   The relationships between mass media exposure and tobacco consumption
   differed by gender and were more pronounced among men. Research on radio
   programs may help to form policies that can address tobacco use among
   Nigerian men.

AB The burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality in India is
   substantial, with smokeless tobacco being the predominant form of
   tobacco use. Use of smokeless tobacco (for example gutkha, paan, khaini,
   and pan masala) is linked to a host of socioeconomic and cultural
   factors including gender, regional differences, educational level, and
   income disparities. Given the scale of the problem, a national social
   marketing campaign was developed and implemented. The creative approach
   used testimonials from a surgeon and patients at Tata Memorial Hospital
   in Mumbai. The communication message approach was designed to reflect
   the realities of disfiguring, disabling, and fatal cancers caused by
   smokeless tobacco. Evaluation of the campaign identified significant
   differences across a range of campaign behavioral predictors by audience
   segments aware of the campaign versus those who were "campaign unaware".
   Significant findings were also identified regarding vulnerable groups by
   gender (female/male) and rural/urban disparities. Findings are discussed
   in relation to the powerful impact of using graphic, emotive, and
   testimonial imagery for tobacco control with socially disadvantaged
   groups.

AB In this study, we sought to better understand the social, economic, and
   ecological factors influencing the development of sustainable management
   practices for Mauritia flexuosa (aguaje) in two Maijuna indigenous
   communities. Focus groups, semi-structured interviews and household
   surveys were conducted to document current and historical patterns of
   aguaje harvest and management, the importance of aguaje to household
   income, and to identify current harvesting strategies and key
   perceptions regarding management. This was complemented with ecological
   sampling in 12 aguaje stands to determine population abundance,
   population structure, and sex ratio. Results indicated that M. flexuosa
   stands show clear evidence of past over-exploitation, with a current sex
   ratio of 3.48 males for each female, and low adult female densities (21
   females/ha). Despite this, M. flexuosa remains highly abundant and
   populations maintain an inverted J-curve structure; however, results
   also showed a significant relationship between low densities of adult
   females and low densities of seedlings (R-2 = 0.476; p = 0.013),
   suggesting that the felling of females from the canopy is reducing
   recruitment rates. The current state of M. flexuosa populations
   corroborates the harvest history as told by interviewees that intensive
   destructive harvesting began in the 1990s and has since waned, primarily
   due to the decline in the stock of females and low prices. Attempts at
   non-destructive harvesting, via the use of climbing harnesses has had
   mixed success as nearly half of the M. flexuosa palms harvested in 2010
   were cut down rather than climbed. Scarcity of adult females and low
   prices resulted in low return on effort, and current income from aguaje
   accounts for just 5% of the communities' cash income. Results indicated
   that four factors synergistically interact to hinder development of
   sustainable aguaje management: (1) low resource stock, (2) market
   barriers, including poor market access and low prices, (3) limited
   access to climbing technology and training, and (4) limited
   organizational experience at a community level, which limits the
   effectiveness of attempts to mitigate the first three barriers. Despite
   these challenges, the maijuna and aguaje have many attributes associated
   with successful management of natural resources. Our study suggests that
   in cases where forest resources have already been degraded,
   transitioning to more sustainable management alternatives can be
   difficult as a number of ecological and socio-economic factors interact
   to hinder implementation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB In preparation for a proposed large-scale food fortification program in
   Cameroon, we completed a nationally representative, cross-sectional,
   cluster survey to assess the consumption patterns of four potentially
   fortifiable foods (refined vegetable oil, wheat flour, sugar, and
   bouillon cube) by women and children. Thirty clusters were randomly
   chosen in each of three ecologic zones (south, north, and large cities)
   and 10 households (HH) per cluster were selected, each with a child
   12-59 mo old and a primary female caregiver 15-49 y old (total 1002 HH).
   Blood samples were collected and food consumption was assessed by FFQ
   and 24-h dietary recall. Anemia (39% of women, 58% of children) and
   deficiencies of iron (15-32%, 21-70%), zinc (77%, 70%), vitamin A (22%,
   35%), and vitamin B-12 (28%, 27%) were common, especially in the north
   and among HH with lower socio-economic status (SES). Oil was consumed by
   54% of HH, whereas >75% of HH consumed wheat flour, sugar, and bouillon
   cube. For most foods, coverage was lower among HH with lower SES. On
   average, oil, wheat flour, and sugar were consumed once per day and
   bouillon cube was consumed twice per day. Median intakes of oil, wheat
   flour, sugar, and bouillon cube (among consumers) were 19.8, 79.4, 30.0,
   and 1.9 g/d for women and 12.0, 49.4, 19.4, and 0.9 g/d for children,
   respectively. Food consumption patterns of high risk population
   subgroups must be considered, along with technical feasibility and cost,
   for the selection of appropriate vehicles for food fortification. J.

   psychosocial constructs was developed using existing taxonomies and
   criteria regarding the malleability, actionability, and validity of
   constructs. Panel members identified measures for each construct based
   on their expertise and experience. Measures were selected on the basis
   of the following criteria: practicality, brevity, validity, availability
   of existing data, and lack of confounds between psychosocial constructs
   and outcomes. Results: The panel came to a consensus in recommending 24
   measures representing 22 constructs. Conclusions: It is important that
   the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regularly
   evaluates its methodologies to ensure it is in line with current best
   practices. The measures identified will be used modularly in the
   National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health fieldwork
   depending on the nature of the evaluation request, industry type, and

AB This study used the ostracism detection theory to investigate how
   ostracism impacts individuals in two ways: (1) immediate poststressor
   needs, mood, ruminative thoughts, and desire to affiliate, and (2)
   short-term affective and cortisol reactivity. A total of 58 college
   students were randomly assigned to the inclusion or ostracism conditions
   of Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game. Immediately following the
   experimental manipulation, ostracized participants reported more
   thwarted psychological need states, more negative mood, and fewer
   positive ruminative thoughts, relative to their included counterparts.
   Ostracized participants reported a greater interest in affiliating with
   others in online or in-person settings. In the short-term, ostracized
   males reported more hostility than included males, although the scores
   were within expected norms for most males. There was no relation between
   Cyberball condition and gender across time for depression, anxiety, or
   positive affect. Approximately 20 min after the onset of the stressor,
   women in the luteal phase and women taking oral contraceptives in the
   ostracized group displayed higher cortisol than their counterparts in
   the included group. Relative to baseline, however, cortisol did not
   reliably increase after the onset of the stressor. Ostracized females
   taking oral contraceptives showed the greatest decline in cortisol,
   compared to included oral contraceptive users. Overall, results suggest
   that most of the negative effects of ostracism are immediate and limited
   to psychological, not neuroendocrine, responses. Aggr. Behav. 38:

   networks and peer-nominated behaviors were collected on 671
   second-through fourth-grade children in 34 urban, low-income classrooms.
   Nested regression models with robust cluster standard errors
   demonstrated that the association between children's number of
   relationships and their levels of relational aggression was moderated by
   the number of relationships that their affiliates had. Children with
   more peer relationships (i.e., higher network centrality) exhibited
   higher levels of relational aggression, but only when these
   relationships were with peers who had fewer connections themselves
   (i.e., poorly connected peers). This finding remained significant even
   when controlling for common predictors of relational aggression
   including gender, overt aggression, prosocial behavior, victimization,
   social preference, and perceived popularity. Results are discussed in
   terms of their implications for advancing the literature on childhood
   relational aggression and their practical applications for identifying

AB Objectives. We examined factors that influence health-related quality of
   life (HRQOL) among individuals aged 50 years and older with and without
   functional limitations.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System to assess associations among demographic
   characteristics, health care access and utilization indicators,
   modifiable health behaviors, and HRQOL characterized by recent
   physically and mentally unhealthy days in those with and those without
   functional limitations. We defined functional limitations as activity
   limitations owing to physical, mental, or emotional health or as the
   need for special equipment because of health.
   Results. Age, medical care costs, leisure-time physical activity, and
   smoking were strongly associated with both physically and mentally
   unhealthy days among those with functional limitations. Among those
   without functional limitations, the direction of the effects was
   similar, but the size of the effects was substantially smaller.
   Conclusions. The availability of lower cost medical care, increasing
   leisure-time physical activity, and reducing rates of cigarette smoking
   will improve population HRQOL among older adults with and without
   functional limitations. These factors provide valuable information for
   determining future public health priorities. (Am J Public Health.

AB This article builds upon Traumatic Brain Injury Common Data Elements
   (TBI CDE) version 1.0 and the pediatric CDE Initiative by emphasizing
   the essential role of psychosocial risk and protective factors in
   pediatric TBI research. The goals are to provide a compelling rationale
   for including psychosocial risk and protective factors in addition to
   socioeconomic status (SES), age, and sex in the study design and
   analyses of pediatric TBI research and to describe recommendations for
   core common data elements in this domain. Risk and protective factor
   research is based on the ecological theory of child development in which
   children develop through a series of interactions with their immediate
   and more distant environments. Home, school, religious, and social
   influences are conceptualized as risk and/or protective factors. Child
   development and TBI researchers have interpreted risk and protective
   variables as main effects or as interactions and have used cumulative
   risk indices and moderation models to describe the relationship among
   these variables and outcomes that have to do with development and with
   recovery from TBI. It is likely that the number, type, and interaction
   among risk and protective factors each contribute unique variance to
   study outcomes. Longitudinal designs in TBI research will be essential
   to understanding the reciprocal relationships between risk/protective
   factors and the recovery/outcome made by the child. The search for
   effective interventions to hasten TBI recovery mandates the need to
   target modifiable risks and to promote protective factors in the child's
   environment.

TI Relation of Supervisor Social Control to Employee Substance Use:

PY 2012
AB Objective: Research on supervisor social control provided little
   evidence for a relation to employee alcohol use, and only one study
   explored illicit drug use. Based on past research, several hypotheses
   were developed that the relation between supervisor social control and
   substance use depends on (a) the dimension social control (contact vs.
   enforcement), (b) the temporal context of substance use (on the job vs.
   off the job), and (c) substance legality (alcohol vs. illicit drugs).
   Method: Data came from a national probability sample of U.S. workers.
   Supervisor social control represented both supervisor contact and
   supervisor enforcement. Measures of alcohol and illicit drug use each
   assessed several dimensions of off-the-job use (overall use, overall
   impairment, and use after work) and on-the-job use (use before work, use
   during the workday, and impairment during the workday). Results: As
   hypothesized, the results did not support a relation of supervisor
   contact to off-the-job or on-the-job alcohol use and illicit drug use.
   Supervisor enforcement was unrelated to off-the-job alcohol use but was
   negatively related to on-the-job alcohol use. Supervisor enforcement was
   negatively related to both off-the-job and on-the-job illicit drug use.
   Conclusions: These findings help clarify the generally unsupportive
   findings from past research for a relation between supervisor social
   control and employee alcohol use, as well as extend this line of
   research to include illicit drug use. The results suggest that to fully
   understand the relation of supervisor social control to employee
   substance use, one must consider the dimension of supervisor social
   control, temporal context of substance use, and substance legality. (J.

AB Numerous studies indicate that social dysfunction is associated with
   negative symptoms of schizophrenia during the chronic phase of illness.
   However, it is unclear whether social abnormalities exist during the
   premorbid phase in people who later develop schizophrenia with prominent
   negative symptoms, or whether social functioning becomes progressively
   worse in these individuals from childhood to late adolescence. The
   current study examined differences in academic and social premorbid
   functioning in people with schizophrenia meeting criteria for deficit
   (i.e., primary and enduring negative symptoms) (DS: n=74) and
   non-deficit forms of schizophrenia (ND: n=271). Premorbid social and
   academic functioning was assessed for childhood, early adolescence, and
   late adolescence developmental periods on the Premorbid Adjustment Scale
   (PAS). Results indicated that both DS and ND participants showed
   deterioration in social and academic functioning from childhood to late
   adolescence. However, while ND schizophrenia demonstrated greater
   deterioration of academic compared to social premorbid functioning from
   childhood to late adolescence, the DS group exhibited comparable
   deterioration across both premorbid domains, with more severe social
   deterioration than the ND group. Findings suggest that people with DS
   show poorer social premorbid adjustment than those with ND as early as
   childhood, and are particularly susceptible to accelerated deterioration
   as the onset of schizophrenia becomes imminent. Thus, poor premorbid
   social adjustment and significant social deterioration from childhood to
   adolescence may be a hallmark feature of people who later go on to
   develop prominent negative symptoms and a unique marker for the DS
   subtype of schizophrenia. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   positively associated with the vertical flow of exports, and the
   relationship is much more pronounced for lower-income countries than for
   high-income countries. Additional findings suggest that the observed
   relationship for lower-income nations has grown in magnitude through

AB Aims: To assess cross-level interactions between neighborhood and
   individual socioeconomic status (SES) on alcohol consumption and
   problems, and investigate three possible explanations for such
   interactions, including the double jeopardy, status inconsistency and
   relative deprivation hypotheses. Methods: Data from the 2000 and 2005 US
   National Alcohol Surveys were linked to the 2000 US Census to define
   respondent census tracts as disadvantaged, middle-class and advantaged.
   Risk drinking (consumption exceeding national guidelines), monthly
   drunkenness and alcohol problems were examined among low-, middle- and
   high-SES past-year drinkers (n = 8728). Gender-stratified, multiple
   logistic regression models were employed, and for outcomes with a
   significant omnibus F-test, linear contrasts were used to interpret
   interactions. Results: Cross-level SES interactions observed for men
   indicated that residence in advantaged neighborhoods was associated with
   markedly elevated odds of risk drinking and drunkenness for low-SES men.
   Linear contrasts further revealed a nearly 5-fold increased risk for
   alcohol problems among these men, relative to middle-SES and high-SES
   men also living in advantaged neighborhoods. Among women, neighborhood
   disadvantage was related to increased risk for alcohol problems, but
   there were no significant SES interactions. These findings did not
   support theories of double jeopardy and status inconsistency.
   Conclusion: Consistent with the relative deprivation hypothesis,
   findings highlight alcohol-related health risks among low-SES men living
   in affluent neighborhoods. Future research should assess whether this
   pattern extends to other health risk behaviors, investigate causal
   mechanisms and consider how gender may influence these.

AB Community-based forestry (CBF) represents an environmental governance
   strategy that promotes democratic practices, strengthens local
   livelihoods, and sustains forest ecosystems for the benefit of all
   community members. Much prior research has explored the necessary
   conditions for successful CBF operation. Less attention has been paid to
   how established CBF organizations, as they near the end of the start-up
   phase of operations, change in response to shifting political, economic,
   social, and environmental conditions. Drawing on "new economic
   sociology" concepts of embeddedness, this interdisciplinary study
   compares organizational transitions in the Public Lands Partnership in
   Colorado and the Association of Forest Communities of Peten in
   Guatemala. The paper conceptualizes these empirical cases as processes
   of organizational change embedded in multi-scalar contexts rather than
   sets of static structures best designed a priori. Important
   organizational changes are closely linked to the multiple embeddedness
   of the groups' diverse activities in complex contexts of varying actors,
   objectives, and perspectives on organizational objectives.
   Organizational contradictions emerging from this multiple embeddedness
   are argued to be features of these community-based groups that help
   produce moments of "structural choice" in which participants seek to
   maintain organizational effectiveness and legitimacy. An embeddedness
   analytical approach suggests that criteria for judging success cannot be
   predetermined, but rather are shaped by these contingent processes of
   structural choice.

   on this tradition by expanding the discursive locations from which to
   understand the construction of meanings in civil society. Through

   the comparison of 9/11 to the attacks on Pearl Harbor has led to varying

AB This article draws on 40 in-depth semi-structured interviews of three
   groups of people who restrict their consumption in various ways:
   voluntary simplifiers, religious environmentalists, and green home
   owners. I identify common patterns in the emergence of green lifestyles
   across all groups. Green practices are not isolated decisions or
   actions, but components in an ongoing project. As a result, green
   lifestyles are often experienced as both a work in progress and a
   provisionally coherent life narrative. Furthermore, I explore bricolage,
   the cobbling together of resources at hand by nonexperts, as a mechanism
   for lifestyle change and expand the concept to include environmental
   practices and themes. I adopt a pragmatist perspective to understand
   lifestyle change as a deliberate process undertaken in response to a
   problem left underaddressed by current policies and practices. This
   article also weighs in on the debate in the sociology of culture over
   how culture influences action.

AB Suicide may be moralistic in naturea response to conduct the perpetrator

   theory of social control. Donald Blacks theories of social control
   explain the handling of grievances with their social structureor
   geometryas defined by the social characteristics and relationships of
   those involved in a conflict. Here I draw on Blacks paradigm of pure
   sociology and theories of social control to identify the social
   structure of moralistic suicide. For example, moralistic suicide varies
   directly with social closeness and is greater in an upward direction
   than in a downward direction. This theory is simple, general, testable,
   and explains variation not addressed by previous theories of suicide.

AB Now reaching over 100 million families, the burgeoning microcredit
   movement has come to play a dominant role in the international
   development agenda. This is especially true in Nicaragua, where
   microcredit has supplanted the Sandinistas' more radical approaches to
   poverty alleviation and women's empowerment. Survey and focus group data
   from borrowers with seven prominent Nicaraguan microfinance institutions
   show that women benefit less than men from microcredit because they get
   smaller loans and they invest those loans in less lucrative businesses.
   Also, these women are constrained by household responsibilities. These
   findings call into question neoliberal notions that market forces can
   solve societal problems such as gender inequality.

AB Residential landscapes are a common setting of human-environment
   interactions. These ubiquitous ecosystems provide social and ecological
   services, and yard maintenance leads to intended and unintended
   ecological outcomes. The ecological characteristics of residential
   landscapes and the human drivers of landscape management have been the
   focus of disciplinary studies, often at a single scale of analysis.
   However, an interdisciplinary examination of residential landscapes is
   needed to understand the feedbacks and tradeoffs of these complex
   adaptive social-ecological systems as a whole. Our aim is to synthesize
   the diversity of perspectives, scales of analysis, and findings from the
   literature in order to 1) contribute to an interdisciplinary
   understanding of residential landscapes and 2) identify research needs
   while providing a robust conceptual approach for future studies. We
   synthesize 256 studies from the literature and develop an
   interdisciplinary, multi-scalar framework on residential landscape
   dynamics. Complex human drivers (attitudinal, structural, and
   institutional factors) at multiple scales influence management practices
   and the feedbacks with biophysical characteristics of residential
   landscapes. However, gaps exist in our interdisciplinary understanding
   of residential landscapes within four key but understudied areas: 1) the
   link between social drivers and ecological outcomes of management
   decisions, 2) the ecosystem services provided by these landscapes to
   residents, 3) the interactions of social drivers and ecological
   characteristics across scales, and 4) generalizations of patterns and
   processes across cities. Our systems perspective will help to guide
   future interdisciplinary collaborations to integrate theories and
   research methods across geographic locations and spatial scales.

AB The potential contribution of social science research to close the gap
   of knowledge between cognitive neuroscience and educational research has
   been underappreciated. Despite their virtual absence in the
   interdisciplinary dialog of neuroscience, sociology of education and
   related study of the cultural impact of formal education have generated
   research relevant to an understanding of how the social environment,
   such as widespread schooling, co-evolves with, and enhances
   neurocognitive development. Two clusters of isolated research
   literatures are synthesized that taken together anticipates a dynamic
   integration of neuroscience and education. The first cluster is on the
   social construction of cognition through formal education in
   contemporary society, including the effects of schooling on neurological
   and cognitive development; the demographic expansion of exposure to the
   developmental influence of schooling; and education's cultural impact on
   the meaning of the learning experience and reinforcement of cognition as
   the key human capability across ever more key institutions in
   postindustrial society. The second cluster turns the issue around by
   examining current investigations from neuroscience that support
   neurological hypotheses about the causes behind the schooling effect on
   neurocognitive development. We propose that further integration of these
   literatures will provide a more ecologically valid context in which to
   investigate the evolving functional architecture of the contemporary
   brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Development of interpersonal relationships is a fundamental human
   motivation, and behaviors facilitating social bonding are prized. Some
   individuals experience enhanced reward from alcohol in social contexts
   and may be at heightened risk for developing and maintaining problematic
   drinking. We employed a 3 (group beverage condition) 62 (genotype)
   design (N = 422) to test the moderating influence of the dopamine D4
   receptor gene (DRD4 VNTR) polymorphism on the effects of alcohol on
   social bonding. A significant gene x environment interaction showed that
   carriers of at least one copy of the 7-repeat allele reported higher
   social bonding in the alcohol, relative to placebo or control
   conditions, whereas alcohol did not affect ratings of 7-absent allele
   carriers. Carriers of the 7-repeat allele were especially sensitive to
   alcohol's effects on social bonding. These data converge with other
   recent gene-environment interaction findings implicating the DRD4
   polymorphism in the development of alcohol use disorders, and results
   suggest a specific pathway by which social factors may increase risk for
   problematic drinking among 7-repeat carriers. More generally, our
   findings highlight the potential utility of employing transdisciplinary
   methods that integrate genetic methodologies, social psychology, and
   addiction theory to improve theories of alcohol use and abuse.

AB In many biological and social interactions, individuals with private
   information have incentives to misrepresent their information. A
   prominent example is when offspring know their need or condition but the
   parents do not. Theory showed that signal costs can ensure truthful
   communication in such situations, but further studies have cast in doubt
   whether empirically measured costs are high enough to sustain honesty,
   and whether the costly signaling equilibrium represents a fitness
   advantage over non-signaling. Here, I tackle these issues with a model
   of signaling that takes place at the behavioral time-scale through
   dynamic responses of individuals to each other. I then embed this
   behavioral model in an evolutionary one that asks how the decision rules
   of the parent and offspring evolve in response to the trade-off between
   signal costs and the costs of provisioning. I find that a non-costly
   honest signaling equilibrium can evolve when relatedness between
   siblings is above a certain threshold. This threshold is lower when (i)
   offspring get satiated more quickly, (ii) the cost of provisioning to
   the parent escalates less rapidly, or (iii) the variation in offspring
   need is higher. These results provide a potential resolution to the
   apparent paradox of costly begging. I also discuss the relation between
   costly signaling and mechanism design theories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Research has consistently documented that social relationships influence
   physical health, a link that may implicate systemic inflammation. We
   examined whether daily social interactions predict levels of
   proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and the soluble receptor for tumor
   necrosis factor-alpha (sTNF alpha RII) and their reactivity to a social
   stressor. One-hundred twenty-two healthy young adults completed daily
   diaries for 8 d that assessed positive, negative, and competitive social
   interactions. Participants then engaged in laboratory stress challenges,
   and IL-6 and sTNF alpha RII were collected at baseline and at 25- and
   80-min poststressor, fromoralmucosal transudate. Negative social
   interactions predicted elevated sTNF alpha RII at baseline, and IL-6 and
   sTNF alpha RII 25-min poststressor, as well as total output of sTNF
   alpha RII. Competitive social interactions predicted elevated baseline
   levels of IL-6 and sTNF alpha RII and total output of both cytokines.
   These findings suggest that daily social interactions that are negative
   and competitive are associated prospectively with heightened
   proinflammatory cytokine activity.

AB Keeping track of various amounts of social cognitive information,
   including people's mental states, traits, and relationships, is
   fundamental to navigating social interactions. However, to date, no
   research has examined which brain regions support variable amounts of
   social information processing ("social load"). We developed a social
   working memory paradigm to examine the brain networks sensitive to
   social load. Two networks showed linear increases in activation as a
   function of increasing social load: the medial frontoparietal regions
   implicated in social cognition and the lateral frontoparietal system
   implicated in nonsocial forms of working memory. Of these networks, only
   load-dependent medial frontoparietal activity was associated with
   individual differences in social cognitive ability (trait
   perspective-taking). Although past studies of nonsocial load have
   uniformly found medial frontoparietal activity decreases with increasing
   task demands, the current study demonstrates these regions do support
   increasing mental effort when such effort engages social cognition.
   Implications for the etiology of clinical disorders that implicate
   social functioning and potential interventions are discussed.

   that, relative to villages in which such positions were never reserved,
   the gender gap in aspirations closed by 20% in parents and 32% in
   adolescents in villages assigned a female leader for two election
   cycles. The gender gap in adolescent educational attainment was erased,
   and girls spent less time on household chores. We found no evidence of

   preparation for future educational attainment. The secondary effects are
   then the net direct effects of social class on the transition to the
   next higher level of education, which are interpreted as average effects
   of class conditions on students' choices. In this article, the standard
   model of primary and secondary effects is laid out in explicit form, and
   primary and secondary effects are then estimated for college entry among
   recent high school graduates in the United States. The challenges of
   estimating these effects for educational transitions in the United
   States are then explained, focusing on the weak warrant for causal
   inference that is used to justify the calculation of counterfactual net
   differences across classes. Alternative estimates of associational
   primary and secondary effects are then offered, after which the
   prospects for the identification of causal secondary effects by
   conditioning on additional confounders are assessed. In conclusion, an
   appeal is made for attention to the policy-relevant patterns of
   heterogeneity that research on primary and secondary effects may be able
   to reveal, and a case is made for elaboration and direct identification
   of the presupposed choice mechanism that has been assumed to generate
   secondary effects in past research.

AB BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women experience higher breast cancer
   mortality than white (W) women. These differences persist even among
   estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers. The 21-gene recurrence
   score (RS) predicts recurrence in patients with ER-positive/lymph
   node-negative breast cancer according to RS scorelow risk (RS, 0-18),
   intermediate risk (RS, 19-31), and high risk (RS, >31). The high-risk
   group is most likely to benefit from chemotherapy, to achieve minimal
   benefit from hormonal therapy, and to exhibit lower ER levels
   (intrinsically luminal B cancers). In the current study, the authors
   investigated racial differences in RS testing, scores, treatment, and
   outcome. METHODS: Tumor registry data from 3 Atlanta hospitals
   identified women who were diagnosed with breast cancers during 2005
   through 2009. Medical record abstraction provided information on RS and
   other tumor/ treatment factors. Statistical analyses used chi-square/
   exact tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 2186 patients,
   including 1192 AA women and 992 W women, 853 women had stage I or II,
   ER-positive/ lymph node-negative disease and, thus, were eligible for RS
   testing (AA 372 [31.2%]; W 481 [48.5%]; P <.0001); and 272 women (31.8%)
   received testing (AA 76 [20.4%]; W 196 [40.7%]; P <.0001). Tumors were
   distributed into the following groups according to risk: low risk (n =
   133), medium risk (n = 113), and high risk (n = 26). The mean RS did not
   differ by race, but risk groups did (low-risk group: 46.1% vs 50% for AA
   women and W women, respectively; high-risk group: 15.8% vs 7.1%,
   respectively; P.043). In multivariate analyses, AA race (odds ratio,
   3.6) was associated independently with high risk scores. CONCLUSIONS: AA
   women were half as likely as W women to receive 21-gene RS testing but
   were 2-fold more likely to be categorized as high risk. The current data
   suggested that testing guidelines are not applied equivalently, testing
   bias may attenuate racial differences in RS, and disparate outcomes may
   be explained in part by differences in RS, although compliance and
   pharmacogenomics also may play a role. Cancer 2012; 118: 788-96. (C)

AB BACKGROUND: Although the overall age-adjusted incidence rates for female
   breast cancer are higher among whites than blacks, mortality rates are
   higher among blacks. Many attribute this discrepancy to disparities in
   health care access and to blacks presenting with later stage disease.
   Within the Department of Defense (DoD) Military Health System, all
   beneficiaries have equal access to health care. The aim of this study
   was to determine whether female breast cancer treatment varied between
   white and black patients in the DoD system. METHODS: The study data were
   drawn from the DoD cancer registry and medical claims databases. Study
   subjects included 2308 white and 391 black women diagnosed with breast
   cancer between 1998 and 2000. Multivariate logistic regression analyses
   that controlled for demographic factors, tumor characteristics, and
   comorbidities were used to assess racial differences in the receipt of
   surgery, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy. RESULTS: There was no
   significant difference in surgery type, particularly when mastectomy was
   compared with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation (blacks vs
   whites: odds ratio [OR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.5).
   Among those with local stage tumors, blacks were as likely as whites to
   receive chemotherapy (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.9-1.7) and hormonal therapy
   (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.6-1.4). Among those with regional stage tumors,
   blacks were significantly less likely than whites to receive
   chemotherapy (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.7) and hormonal therapy (OR, 0.5;
   95% CI, 0.3-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Even within an equal access health care
   system, stage-related racial variations in breast cancer treatment are
   evident. Studies that identify driving factors behind these within-stage
   racial disparities are warranted. Cancer 2012; 118: 812-20. (C) 2011

AB This paper analyses poverty and inequality dynamics among smallholders
   along the Transamazon Highway. We measure changes in poverty and
   inequality for original settlers and new owners, contrasting
   income-based with multidimensional indices of well-being. Our results
   show an overall reduction in both poverty and inequality among
   smallholders, although poverty decline was more pronounced among new
   owners, while inequality reduction was larger among original settlers.
   This trend suggests that families have an initial improvement in
   livelihood and well-being which tends to reach a limit later-a sign of
   structural limitations common to rural areas and maybe a replication of
   boom and bust trends in local economies among Amazonian municipalities.
   In addition, our multidimensional estimates of well-being reveal that
   some economically viable land use strategies of smallholders (e. g.,
   pasture) may have important ecological implications for the regional
   landscape. These findings highlight the public policy challenges for
   fostering sustainable development among rural populations.

AB In the early 1980s residents of Hobeni, in South Africa's Eastern Cape,
   were subjected to forced resettlement, under "betterment" policy
   ostensibly aimed at soil conservation. They were moved into a spatially
   contiguous but socially differentiated village. South Africa's political
   transition ended this policy, and in the early 1990s, some people,
   mainly from part of the resettlement area (Kunene) characterized by
   dense kinship networks who had faced pressure to leave, and began to
   return voluntarily to their former sites, opting to live in dispersed,
   flexible settlements. Few people resettled in Mhlanganisweni, a part of
   the village more diverse in its social composition, returned to their
   former sites. This research highlights the ways exclusion within
   "socially-embedded" land tenure systems, together with the layout of
   resettlement areas and other forms of social and economic
   differentiation, caused patterns of resettlement to diverge from
   planners' intentions.

AB Establishing private property in land through registration and titling
   has been promoted in developing countries due to the anticipated
   benefits of private ownership in access to credit, productivity
   enhancing investments, and productivity gains. Evidence of such benefits
   is limited, however. In this paper, we examine a related question: What
   is the impact of privatization on cooperation in farm labor? Data
   collected in 2005 from Samburu District in Kenya is analyzed, comparing
   one community where land has been privatized to a second where land is
   communally held in a group ranch. It is hypothesized that households
   with title deeds are less likely to cooperate in farm labor than
   households without deeds. The hypothesis was confirmed, as the odds of
   cooperating in communal farm labor are 93.0% lower for households with
   deeds compared to those without. This effect has negative implications
   for collective action efforts in Siambu.

AB Cognitive flexibility requires processing multiple sources of
   information and flexible adaptation of behavioral responses. Poverty
   negatively impacts cognitive control in young children, but its effects
   on infants are not well-understood. This study investigated
   longitudinally the development of cognitive flexibility in low-income
   infants. Thirty-two infants (15 low-SES, 17 high-SES) were tested at 6,
   9, and 12 months of age. Cognitive flexibility was measured with a
   perseverative reaching task, where infants were taught to reach to one
   location and then asked to switch to a second location. High-SES infants
   replicated the typical developmental trajectory, reaching randomly at 6
   months, perseverating at 9 months, and reaching correctly at 12 months.
   In contrast, the low-SES infants showed a delayed pattern, reaching
   correctly at 6 months, randomly at 9 months, and perseverating at 12
   months. Links between cognitive flexibility and frontal cortex
   development are explored as a potential mechanism. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB The quality of children's social interactions and their attachment
   security with a primary caregiver are two widely studied indices of
   socioemotional functioning in early childhood. Although both Bowlby and
   Ainsworth suggested that the parent-child interactions underlying the
   development of attachment security could be distinguished from other
   aspects of parent-child interaction (e.g., play), relatively little
   empirical research has examined this proposition. The aim of the current
   study was to explore this issue by examining concurrent relations
   between toddler's attachment security in the Strange Situation Procedure
   and quality of mother-child social interaction in a high-risk sample of
   toddlers characterized by prenatal cocaine exposure and low levels of
   maternal education. Analyses of variance suggested limited relations
   between attachment security and quality of social interaction. Further

AB Like many economic exchanges, industrial symbiosis (IS) is thought to be
   influenced by social relationships and shared norms among actors in a
   network. While many implicit references to social characteristics exist
   throughout the literature, there have been few explicit attempts to
   operationalize and measure the concepts. The short mental
   distance,trust,openness, and communication recorded among managers in
   Kalundborg, Denmark, set a precedent for examining and encouraging
   social interactions among key personnel in the dozens of eco-industrial
   networks around the world. In this article we explore the relationships
   among various aspects of social embeddedness, social capital, and IS. We
   develop a conceptual framework and an approach using quantitative and
   qualitative methods to identify and measure these social
   characteristics, including social network structure, communication, and
   similarities in norms and conceptions of waste, and apply them in an
   industrial network in Nanjangud, South India. The findings suggest that
   there is a fairly high level of shared norms about dealing with wastethe
   short mental distancein this network, but by-product transactions are
   only weakly correlated with the structure and content of communication
   among managers. Replication of this approach can increase the
   understanding and comparability of the role of social characteristics in
   eco-industrial activities around the world.

   Tech. Rep. PNW-GTR-849. Portland, OR: U.S. Department of Agriculture,
   Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station. 107 p.The past
   decade has seen resurgence in interest in gathering wild plants and
   fungi in cities. In addition to gathering by individuals, dozens of
   groups have emerged in U.S., Canadian, and European cities to facilitate
   access to nontimber forest products (NTFPs), particularly fruits and
   nuts, in public and private spaces. Recent efforts within cities to
   encourage public orchards and food forests, and to incorporate more
   fruit and nut trees into street tree planting programs indicate a
   growing recognition among planners that gathering is an important urban
   activity. Yet the academic literature has little to say about urban
   gathering practices or the people who engage in them. This annotated
   bibliography and literature review is a step toward filling the gap in
   knowledge about the socioecological roles of NTFPs in urban ecosystems
   in the United States. Our objectives are to demonstrate that gathering
   the collecting of food and raw materials is a type of human-plant
   interaction that warrants greater attention in urban green space
   management, and to provide an overview of the literature on human-plant
   interactions including gathering in urban environments. Our review found
   that very few studies of urban gathering have been done. Consequently,
   we included gathering field guides, Web sites, and articles from the
   popular media in our search. These sources, together with the small
   number of scientific studies of urban gathering, indicated that people
   derive numerous benefits from gathering plants and fungi in U.S. cities.
   Gathering provides useful products, encourages physical activity, offers
   opportunities to connect with and learn about nature, helps strengthen
   social ties and cultural identities, and, in some contexts, can serve as
   a strategic tool for ecological restoration. These benefits parallel
   those identified in environmental psychology and cultural ecology
   studies of the effects of gardening and being in nature. The literature
   on human-plant interactions also emphasizes that humans need to be
   treated as endogenous factors in dynamic, socially and spatially
   heterogeneous urban ecosystems. Spatially explicit analyses of
   human-plant interactions show that the distribution of wealth and power
   within societies affects the composition, species distribution, and
   structure of urban ecologies. Our review also indicates that tensions
   exist between NTFP gatherers and land managers, as well as between
   gatherers and other citizens over gathering, particularly in public
   spaces. This tension likely is related to perceptions about the impact
   these practices have on cherished species and spaces. We conclude that
   gathering is an important urban activity and deserves a greater role in
   urban management given its social and potential ecological benefits.
   Research on urban gathering will require sensitivity to existing power
   imbalances and the use of theoretical frameworks and methodologies that
   assume humans are integral and not always negative components of
   ecosystems.

AB High densities of people living around protected areas (PAs) in South
   Asia require management strategies to balance conservation goals and
   livelihood needs. Based on a survey of 777 households around five PAs in
   India and Nepal, this paper provides a comparative perspective of Indian
   and Nepali households' views of protected area benefits and costs, their
   attitude toward conservation in general, and attitude toward protected
   area staff. Results indicate mixed responses towards tourism, varying
   from very favorable in Nepal to less favorable in India. The majority
   (81%) held positive attitudes towards the existence and importance of
   PAs but had negative perceptions of PA staff (69%). Most residents
   perceived benefits from access to fuel wood, fodder and other PA
   resources including benefits from tourism, while crop and livestock
   losses from wildlife were the main costs. Households overall positive
   attitudes towards the PAs and conservation despite high losses from
   living around PAs suggests that local residents may support conservation
   if their livelihood needs are met. Comparisons of household attitudes
   and perceptions suggest that locally based strategies rather than
   top-down approaches are likely to be more effective. Extending PA
   benefits to smaller landholders, households that are highly
   resource-dependent or experiencing higher income losses from
   human-wildlife conflicts, and less educated residents are particularly
   important to balance costs and losses from living around protected
   areas.

   is needed to elucidate the relationship between parental feeding
   practices and adiposity in diverse populations. The present study tested
   if: (1) parental feeding practices differed by race/ethnicity, (2)
   parental pressure to eat and parental restriction were associated with
   adiposity levels, and (3) to investigate the relationship between
   parental feeding practices and/or child adiposity with socioeconomic
   status (SES). Structural equations modeling was conducted to test the
   model in 267 children aged 7-12 years self-identified as African
   American (AA), European American (EA), or Hispanic American (HA) from
   economically diverse backgrounds. Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and
   computed tomography scanning were used to determine body composition and
   abdominal fat distribution, respectively. Parental restriction was a
   significant predictor of child adiposity while parental pressure to eat
   had an inverse relationship with child adiposity. HA parents reported
   significantly higher levels of restriction and pressure to eat, whereas
   EA parents reported the lowest. SES was positively associated with child
   adiposity and inversely related to parental restriction and pressure to
   eat. Thus, parental feeding practices differ across racial/ethnic groups
   and SES and may contribute to population differences in child adiposity.

   Methods We analyzed 1960-2006 age-standardized US county cancer
   mortality data, total and site-specific (lung, prostate, colorectal,
   breast, cervix, stomach), stratified by county income quintile for the
   US total, black, and white populations.
   Results Between 1960 and 2006, US socioeconomic inequities in cancer
   mortality variously shrunk, widened, reversed, and stagnated, depending
   on time period and cancer site. For all cancers combined and most, but
   not all, sites, absolute, but not relative, socioeconomic gaps were
   greater for the black compared to white population. Compared to the
   yearly age-specific mortality rates among whites in the most affluent
   counties, the percent of excess cancer deaths among whites in the lower
   four county income quintiles first rose above 0 in 1990 and in 2006
   equaled 5.4% (95% CI 4.8, 6.0); among blacks, it rose from 6.0% (95% CI
   4.5, 7.4) in 1960 to 24.7% (95% CI 23.9, 25.5) in 1990 and remained at
   this level through 2006.
   Conclusions The hypothesis that cancer mortality inequities are bound to
   increase is refuted by long-term data on total and site-specific cancer
   mortality stratified by socioeconomic position and race/ ethnicity.

   Adjusting for age, Roma were more than twice as likely as non-Roma to
   report poor SRH (RR = 2.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.8, 2.8).
   After adjustment for household consumption, employment, and education,
   the RR was reduced to 1.6 (95% CI = 1.3, 2.0). Romani women, regardless
   of whether they were living in poverty or not, experienced the greatest
   risk of poor SRH, with risks relative to non-Roma males not in poverty
   of 3.2 (95% CI = 2.3, 4.2) and 3.1 (95% CI = 2.4, 4.0), respectively.
   Roma in Serbia are at increased risk of poor SRH; Romani women

   substrates. First, evidence showing that social pain activates
   pain-related neural regions is reviewed. Then, studies exploring some of
   the expected consequences of such a physical pain social pain overlap
   are summarized. These studies demonstrate that a) individuals who are
   more sensitive to one kind of pain are also more sensitive to the other
   and b) factors that increase or decrease one kind of pain alter the
   other in a similar manner. Finally, what these shared neural substrates
   mean for our understanding of socially painful experience is discussed.

AB Little is known about the simultaneous effect of socioeconomic status
   (SES), psychosocial, and health-related factors on race differences in
   mortality in older adults.
   This study examined the association between race and mortality and the
   role of SES, health insurance, psychosocial factors, behavioral factors,
   and health-related factors in explaining these differences.
   Data consisted of 2,938 adults participating in the Health, Aging and
   Body Composition study. Mortality was assessed over 8 years.
   SES differences accounted for 60% of the racial differences in all-cause
   mortality; behavioral factors and self-rated health further reduced the
   disparity. The racial differences in coronary heart disease mortality
   were completely explained by SES. Health insurance and behavioral
   factors accounted for some, but not all, of the race differences in
   cancer mortality.
   Race-related risk factors for mortality may differ by the underlying
   cause of mortality.

AB Neighborhood social cohesion (NSC) may contribute to understanding how
   neighborhood contexts influence the physical and mental health of
   residents.
   We examined the relation of NSC to self-rated mental and physical health
   and evaluated the mediating role of NSC on relations between
   neighborhood socioeconomic status, ethnic composition, and health.
   A sample of 3,098 Hispanic and non-Hispanic residents within 597 census
   tracts in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona rated their health,
   psychological distress, and their perceptions of NSC. Census tract
   estimates provided neighborhood contextual measures.
   Neighborhood social cohesion was significantly related to better
   physical and mental health. Both individually rated NSC and
   neighborhood-level NSC mediated relations between neighborhood contexts
   and health outcomes. Substantive findings were consistent across
   Hispanic and non-Hispanic residents.
   The findings have implications for improving ethnic and socioeconomic
   disparities in physical and mental health through attention to social
   cohesion among neighborhood residents.

AB Hypertension is more prevalent and clinically severe among
   African-Americans than whites. Several health behaviors influence blood
   pressure (BP) control, but effective, accessible, culturally sensitive
   interventions that target multiple behaviors are lacking.
   We evaluated a culturally adapted, automated telephone system to help
   hypertensive, urban African-American adults improve their adherence to
   their antihypertensive medication regimen and to evidence-based
   guidelines for dietary behavior and physical activity.
   We randomized 337 hypertensive primary care patients to an 8-month
   automated, multi-behavior intervention or to an education-only control.
   Medication adherence, diet, physical activity, and BP were assessed at
   baseline and every 4 months for 1 year. Data were analyzed using
   longitudinal modeling.
   The intervention was associated with improvements in a measure of
   overall diet quality (+3.5 points, p < 0.03) and in energy expenditure
   (+80 kcal/day, p < 0.03). A decrease in systolic BP between groups was
   not statistically significant (-2.3 mmHg, p = 0.25).
   Given their convenience, scalability, and ability to deliver tailored
   messages, automated telecommunications systems can promote
   self-management of diet and energy balance in urban African-Americans.

AB African-Americans suffer disproportionately from tobacco-associated
   morbidity and mortality. Considering the relationship between cultural
   variables and cessation may be important for reducing disparities.
   This study aimed to examine acculturation as a predictor of smoking
   cessation following a standard group intervention.
   Treatment-seeking smokers (N = 140) participated in a group intervention
   for cessation plus transdermal nicotine patch therapy and completed the
   African American Acculturation Scale-Revised at baseline. The primary
   outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at the
   end-of-counseling and 3 and 6 months postintervention.
   Adjusted logistic regression analyses found that acculturation predicted
   end-of-counseling and 3-month 7-day point prevalence abstinence;
   traditional African-Americans (i.e., less acculturated) were less likely
   to quit smoking. Cultural superstitions, religious beliefs and
   practices, and interracial attitudes were predictive of smoking
   cessation.
   Acculturation was associated with cessation following a group-based
   intervention. Culturally specific adaptations to established
   interventions might improve outcomes for traditional smokers.

AB Classic and contemporary research on person perception has demonstrated
   the paramount importance of interpersonal warmth. Recent research on
   embodied cognition has shown that feelings of social warmth or coldness
   can be induced by experiences of physical warmth or coldness, and vice
   versa. Here we show that people tend to self-regulate their feelings of
   social warmth through applications of physical warmth, apparently
   without explicit awareness of doing so. In Study 1, higher scores on a
   measure of chronic loneliness (social coldness) were associated with an
   increased tendency to take warm baths or showers. In Study 2, a physical
   coldness manipulation significantly increased feelings of loneliness. In
   Study 3, needs for social affiliation and for emotion regulation,
   triggered by recall of a past rejection experience, were subsequently
   eliminated by an interpolated physical warmth experience. Study 4
   provided evidence that people are not explicitly aware of the
   relationship between physical and social warmth (coldness), as they do
   not consider a target person who often bathes to be any lonelier than
   one who does not, with all else being equal. Together, these findings
   suggest that physical and social warmth are to some extent substitutable
   in daily life and that this substitution reflects an unconscious
   self-regulatory mechanism.

AB Theory and evidence suggest that everyday positive emotions may be
   potent factors in resilience during periods of chronic stress, yet the
   body of evidence is scant. Even less research focuses on the adaptive
   functions of specific positive emotions in this critical context. In the
   current research, 54 women with metastatic breast cancer provided
   information about their emotional responses to benefits received to test
   hypotheses regarding the social functions of gratitude. One set of
   analyses provide support for the hypothesized role of ego-transcendence
   in feeling gratitude upon receipt of a benefit from another person. As
   predicted, in a second set of analyses, grateful responding to received
   benefits predicted an increase in perceived social support over three
   months only for women low in ambivalence over emotional expression.
   These findings add to evidence regarding the social causes and
   consequences of gratitude, supporting a view of gratitude as an
   other-focused positive emotion that functions to promote high-quality
   relationships. Discussion focuses on the chronically stressful context
   as an important testing ground for theory on gratitude and other
   positive emotions.

AB Premature mortality and disparities in morbidity observed in
   African-American men may be associated with factors in their social,
   economic, and built environments that may be especially influential
   during the transition to adulthood.
   To have young, African-American men from Los Angeles County identify and
   prioritize factors associated with their transition to manhood using
   photovoice methodology and pile-sorting exercises.
   Qualitative study using community-based participatory research (CBPR)
   and photovoice
   Twelve African-American men, ages 16-26 years, from Los Angeles County,
   California.
   We used CBPR principles to form a community advisory board (CAB) whose
   members defined goals for the partnered project, developed the
   protocols, and participated in data collection and analysis.
   Participants were given digital cameras to take 50-300 photographs over
   three months. Pile-sorting techniques were used to facilitate
   participants' identification and discussion of the themes in their
   photos and selected photos of the group. Pile-sorts of group photographs
   were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster
   analysis to systematically compare participants' themes and identify
   patterns of associations between sorted photographs. Sub-themes and
   related quotes were also elicited from the pile-sorting transcripts. The
   CAB and several study participants met periodically to develop
   dissemination strategies and design interventions informed by study
   findings.
   Four dominant themes emerged during analysis: 1) Struggles face during
   the transition to manhood, 2) Sources of social support, 3) Role of
   sports, and 4) Views on Los Angeles lifestyle. The project led to the
   formation of a young men's group and community events featuring
   participants.
   CBPR and photovoice are effective methods to engage young,
   African-American men to identify and discuss factors affecting their
   transition to manhood, contextualize research findings, and participate
   in intervention development.

AB Despite the growing burden of chronic disease globally, few studies have
   examined the socioeconomic patterning of risk across countries. The
   authors examined differences in the social patterning of body mass index
   (BMI) and current smoking by urbanicity among 70 countries from the
   2002-2003 World Health Surveys. Age-adjusted, gender-stratified ordinary
   least squares and logistic regression analyses were conducted in each
   country to assess the relation between education and BMI Of smoking.
   Meta-analytic techniques were used to assess heterogeneity between
   countries in the education-risk factor relations. Meta-regression was
   used to determine whether the heterogeneity could be explained by
   country-level urbanicity. In the least urban countries, persons with
   higher education had a higher BMI, while the opposite pattern was seen
   in the most urban countries, with this pattern being especially
   pronounced among women. In contrast, smoking was consistently
   concentrated among persons of lower education among all men and among
   women in the least urban countries. For women in the most urban
   countries, higher education was associated with higher odds of smoking,
   although there was substantial variability in this relation. These
   results highlight a global trend toward an increasing burden of chronic
   disease risk among persons of lower socioeconomic position as countries
   become more urban.

AB Objectives. We tested the effectiveness of a community-based,
   literacy-sensitive, and culturally tailored lifestyle intervention on
   weight loss and diabetes risk reduction among low-income,
   Spanish-speaking Latinos at increased diabetes risk.
   Methods. Three hundred twelve participants from Lawrence, Massachusetts,
   were randomly assigned to lifestyle intervention care (IC) or usual care
   (UC) between 2004 and 2007. The intervention was implemented by trained
   Spanish-speaking individuals from the community. Each participant was
   followed for 1 year.
   Results. The participants' mean age was 52 years; 59% had less than a
   high school education. The 1-year retention rate was 94%. Compared with
   the UC group, the IC group had a modest but significant weight reduction
   (-2.5 vs 0.63 Ib; P=.04) and a clinically meaningful reduction in
   hemoglobin A1c (-0.10% vs -0.04%; P=.009). Likewise, insulin resistance
   improved significantly in the IC compared with the UC group. The IC
   group also had greater reductions in percentage of calories from total
   and saturated fat.
   Conclusions. We developed an inexpensive, culturally sensitive diabetes
   prevention program that resulted in weight loss, improved HbA1c, and
   improved insulin resistance in a high-risk Latino population. (Am J

   Methods. We modeled the hazard of quitting over a 5-year period among
   863 smokers who participated in the 2005 New York Social Environment
   Study.
   Results. In adjusted Cox proportional hazard models, prohibitive
   neighborhood smoking norms were significantly associated with higher
   rates of smoking cessation (second quartile hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17;
   95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.59, 2.32; third quartile HR=2.37; 95% CI
   = 1.17, 4.78; fourth quartile HR=1.80; 95% CI=0.85, 3.81). We did not
   find a significant association between neighborhood collective efficacy
   and cessation or significant evidence of a joint relation of collective
   efficacy and smoking norms with cessation.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood social norms may be more relevant than is
   collective efficacy to smoking cessation. The normative environment may
   shape health behavior and should be considered as part of public health
   intervention efforts. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:343-351.

AB Objectives. We investigated determinants of and disparities in

   from 2002 to 2008.
   Methods. Using data on 4421 US women aged 15 to 24 years from the
   National Survey of Family Growth (2002, n=2157; 2006-2008, n=2264), we
   employed descriptive and univariate statistics and multivariate
   regression models to examine service use across women's sociodemographic
   and reproductive characteristics and to investigate potential disparate
   changes in service use over time.
   Results. More than half the sample (59%) had used services in the past
   year. In regression models, predictors of service use included age,
   education, birthplace, insurance, religious participation, mother's
   education, childhood family situation, age at menarche, sexual
   intercourse experience, recent number of partners, and previous
   gynecological diagnosis. Although service use decreased by 8% overall
   from 2002 to 2006-2008 (P <.001), the magnitude of decline was similar
   across demographic and socioeconomic groups.
   Conclusions. Inequalities in reproductive health service use exist among
   women in the United States, particularly among the youngest and socially
   disadvantaged women, which may translate to poor and disparate
   reproductive outcomes. Public health and policy strategies are needed to
   eliminate inequities in reproductive health service. (Am J Public

AB Objective To conduct a cross-national comparative study of the
   prevalence and correlates of female genital cutting (FGC) practices and
   beliefs in western Africa.
   Methods Data from women who responded to the Multiple Indicator Cluster
   Surveys between 2005 and 2007 were used to estimate the frequencies of
   ever having been circumcised, having had a daughter circumcised, and
   believing that FGC practices should continue. Weighted logistic
   regression using data for each country was performed to determine the
   independent correlates of each outcome.
   Findings The prevalence of FGC was high overall but varied substantially
   across countries in western Africa. In Sierra Leone, Gambia, Burkina
   Faso and Mauritania, the prevalence of FGC was 94%, 79%, 74% and 72%,
   respectively, whereas in Ghana, Niger and Togo prevalence was less than
   6%. Older age and being Muslim were generally associated with increased
   odds of FGC, and higher education was associated with lower odds of FGC.
   The association between FGC and wealth varied considerably. Burkina Faso
   was the only country in our study that experienced a dramatic reduction
   in FGC prevalence from women (74%) to their daughters (25%); only 14.2%
   of the women surveyed in that country said that they believe the
   practice should continue.
   Conclusion The prevalence of FGC in western Africa remains high overall
   but varies substantially across countries. Given the broad range of
   experiences, successful strategies from countries where FGC is declining
   may provide useful examples for high-prevalence countries seeking to
   reduce their own FGC practices.

   774); and out-patient (n = 952) comparing three out-patient treatments
   (Project MATCH). Measurements AA attendance during treatment; mediators
   at 9 months; and outcomes [percentage of days abstinent (PDA) and drinks
   per drinking day (DDD)] at 15 months. Findings Among out-patients the
   effect of AA attendance on alcohol outcomes was explained primarily by
   adaptive social network changes and increases in social abstinence
   self-efficacy. Among more impaired aftercare patients, in addition to
   mediation through adaptive network changes and increases in social
   self-efficacy, AA lead to better outcomes through increasing
   spirituality/religiosity and by reducing negative affect. The degree to
   which mediators explained the relationship between AA and outcomes
   ranged from 43% to 67%. Conclusion While Alcoholics Anonymous
   facilitates recovery by mobilizing several processes simultaneously, it
   is changes in social factors which appear to be of primary importance.

AB Investigations of the reception of textual objects have alternately
   emphasized demographically conditioned patterns of evaluation and taste,
   or the agency of viewers, readers, and listeners in constructing their
   own cultural interpretations. In the present article, we advance an
   empirical and formal analysis of the cultural reception of texts in
   which interpretations of the multiple dimensions on which a text may be
   evaluated are transmitted and modified within small groups of
   individuals in face-to-face contact. We contribute an approach in which
   the intersection of social structure, individual readings, and
   interactive group processes all may enter into readers' interpretations
   of a novel. Our investigation focuses on a set of book clubs for which
   we collected data on group members' pre- and post-discussion evaluations
   of a specific book, and the interpersonal influence networks that were
   formed during the groups' discussions. We analyze these data with a
   multilevel model of individuals nested in groups, which allows us to
   address the effects of structure and group dynamics on cultural
   reception in a single analytic framework.

AB This article examines why global corporate social responsibility (CSR)
   frameworks have gained popularity in the past decade, despite their
   uncertain costs and benefits, and how they affect adherents' behavior.
   We focus on the two largest global frameworks-the United Nations Global
   Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative-to examine patterns of CSR
   adoption by governments and corporations. Drawing on institutional and
   political-economy theories, we develop a new analytic framework that
   focuses on four key environmental factors-global institutional pressure,
   local receptivity, foreign economic penetration, and national economic
   system. We propose two arguments about the relationship between stated
   commitment and subsequent action: decoupling due to lack of capacity and
   organized hypocrisy due to lack of will. Our cross-national time-series
   analyses show that global institutional pressure through nongovernmental
   linkages encourages CSR adoption, but this pressure leads to ceremonial
   commitment in developed countries and to substantive commitment in
   developing countries. Moreover, in developed countries, liberal economic
   policies increase ceremonial commitment, suggesting a pattern of
   organized hypocrisy whereby corporations in developed countries make
   discursive commitments without subsequent action. We also find that in
   developing countries, short-term trade relations exert greater influence
   on corporate CSR behavior than do long-term investment transactions.

AB Sociology has seen a renewed interest in the study of morality. However,
   a theory of the self that explains individual variation in moral
   behavior and emotions is noticeably absent. In this study, we use
   identity theory to explain this variability. According to identity
   theory, actors are self-regulating entities whose goal is to verify
   their identities. An individual's moral identity-wherever it falls on
   the moral-immoral continuum-guides behavior, and people experience
   negative emotions when identity verification does not ensue.
   Furthermore, the identity verification process occurs within situations
   that have cultural expectations-that is, framing rules and feeling
   rules-regarding how individuals should act and feel. These cultural
   expectations also influence the degree to which people behave morally.
   We test these assumptions on a sample of more than 350 university
   students. We investigate whether the moral identity and framing
   situations in moral terms influences behavior and feelings. Findings
   reveal that the identity process and framing of situations as moral are
   significantly associated with moral action and moral emotions of guilt
   and shame.

AB Objective To examine the productivity of patients with scleroderma
   (systemic sclerosis [SSc]) both outside of and within the home in a
   large observational cohort.
   Methods. One hundred sixty-two patients completed the Work Productivity
   Survey. Patients indicated whether or not they were employed outside of
   the home, how many days per month they missed work (employment or
   household work) due to SSc, and how many days per month productivity was
   decreased by >= 50%. Patients also completed other patient-reported
   outcome measures. We developed binomial regression models to assess the
   predictors of days missed from work (paid employment or household
   activities). The covariates included: type of SSc, education, physician
   and patient global assessments, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)
   disability index (DI), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness
   Therapy-Fatigue, and Center of Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
   Short Form.
   Results. The mean age of patients was 51.8 years and 52% had limited
   cutaneous SSc. Of the 37% of patients employed outside of the home,
   patients reported missing 2.6 days per month of work and had 2.5 days
   per month of productivity reduced by half. Of the 102 patients who were
   not employed, 39.4% were unable to work due to their SSc. When we
   assessed patients for household activities (n = 162), patients missed an
   average of 8 days of housework per month and had productivity reduced by
   an average of 6 days per month. In the regression models, patients with
   lower education and poor assessment of overall health by a physician
   were more likely to miss work outside of the home. Patients with limited
   cutaneous SSc and high HAQ DI scores were more likely to miss work at
   home.
   Conclusion. SSc has a major impact on productivity at home and at work.
   Nearly 40% of patients reported disability due to their SSc.

AB Background Racial disparities persist in early childhood wheezing and
   cannot be completely explained by known risk factors.
   Objective To evaluate the associations of genetic ancestry and
   self-identified race with early childhood recurrent wheezing, accounting
   for socio-economic status (SES) and early life exposures.
   Methods We studied 1034 children in an urban, multi-racial, prospective
   birth cohort. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the
   association of genetic ancestry as opposed to self-identified race with
   recurrent wheezing (>3 episodes). Sequential models accounted for
   demographic, socio-economic factors and early life risk factors. Genetic
   ancestry, estimated using 150 ancestry informative markers, was
   expressed in deciles.
   Results Approximately 6.1% of subjects (mean age 3.1 years) experienced
   recurrent wheezing. After accounting for SES and demographic factors,
   African ancestry (OR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.31) was significantly
   associated with recurrent wheezing. By self-reported race, hispanic
   subjects had a borderline decrease in risk of wheeze compared with
   African Americans (OR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.19-1.00), whereas white subjects
   (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.14-1.57) did not have. After further adjustment for
   known confounders and early life exposures, both African (OR: 1.19, 95%
   CI: 1.05-1.34) and European ancestry (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.74-0.94)
   retained a significant association with recurrent wheezing, as compared
   with self-identified race (ORwhites: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09-1.14;
   ORhispanic: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.20-1.08). There were no significant
   interactions between ancestry and early life factors on recurrent
   wheezing.
   Conclusions and Clinical Relevance In contrast to self-identified race,
   African ancestry remained a significant, independent predictor of early
   childhood wheezing after accounting for early life and other known risk
   factors associated with lung function changes and asthma. Genetic
   ancestry may be a powerful way to evaluate wheezing disparities and a
   proxy for differentially distributed genetic and early life risk factors
   associated with childhood recurrent wheezing.

   pictures, whereas Americans did not show this tendency. In Study 2,
   Russian Latvians were randomly primed with symbols of each culture,
   after which we measured the speed of recognition for positive versus

   recognizing negative words (as compared with baseline) when primed with
   Russian versus Latvian cultural symbols. Greater identification with

AB Hepatitis C virus (HCV), an emerging bloodborne pathogen, causes chronic
   liver disease frequently except in about 10-20% of infections which
   undergo spontaneous resolution. Investigating factors that influence
   viral clearance is essential to understand the natural history of this
   infection and establishing novel strategies for prevention and
   treatment. HCV clearance was estimated in a unique cohort of 1,260 HIV
   and HBV negative current drug users enrolled for a hepatitis B
   vaccination study. It was defined as the inability to detect viral RNA
   using a PCR method in presence of serum anti-HCV antibody EIA.
   Associated demographic and socio-behavioral factors including drug use
   patterns were identified from the enrolled subjects using multivariate
   regression analysis. 33.3% (420/1260) of drug users were found positive
   for anti-HCV antibodies and 14.8% (62/420) of these individuals achieved
   viral clearance (negative PCR test). Race or ethnicity of the
   participants was the only significant factor associated with HCV
   clearance. Hispanics (OR = 3.4, 95% CI: 1.3-8.5, P = 0.01) and
   Caucasians (OR = 3.1, 95% CI: 1.5-6.6, P = 0.003) had significantly
   higher odds of clearing the virus compared to African Americans when
   adjusted for age and gender. None of the socio-behavioral factors
   including alcohol intake and drug use patterns were significant
   determinants of HCV clearance. Racial or ethnic differences in HCV
   clearance were observed in this study suggesting an important role of
   host genetic susceptibility factors in determining the clinical course
   of this disease. Further research is needed to examine these genetic
   associations of hostvirus relationships. J. Med. Virol. 84:235-241,

AB Management of game animals requires understanding of factors that affect
   harvest levels. Although influenced by international law, bobcat (Lynx
   rufus) management is the responsibility of state or provincial agencies,
   and jurisdictional environmental, ecological, and regulatory differences
   may alter which variables influence harvest. Consequently, our
   understanding of the factors driving bobcat harvest should be at a scale
   similar to that at which they are managed. We associated 32?years of
   bobcat harvest data from Minnesota with socioeconomic (e.g., pelt
   prices, license sales) and ecological variables (e.g., prey abundance,
   bobcat-specific index of winter severity) to determine what variables
   most strongly influenced annual bobcat harvest. We constructed candidate
   negative binomial generalized linear models based on an
   informationtheoretic approach and used quasi-likelihood Akaike's
   Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size to assess the
   relative performance of each model. Our best model suggested that annual
   bobcat harvest in Minnesota was positively related to the proportion of
   scent stations visited by bobcats and season length, and negatively
   related to the proportion of days when the maximum temperature did not
   exceed the bobcat's lower critical temperature. Our results differ from
   those of other studies examining factors influencing furbearer harvest
   that have suggested furbearer harvest is driven primarily by pelt price,
   and suggest that managers can influence the annual harvest of bobcats by
   changing season length. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.

AB Letendre, Fincher & Thornhill (2010) argue that pathogen intensity
   provides the ultimate explanation for why some countries are more prone
   to civil war than others. They argue that the economic and political
   factors highlighted in previous research on civil war are largely caused
   by underlying differences in pathogen intensity, and contend that
   disease proneness increases the risk of civil war through its effects on
   resource competition and xenophobia. They present empirical evidence
   that they interpret as consistent with their argument: a statistically
   significant correlation between pathogen intensity and civil war onset.
   In this comment, we raise concerns over their interpretation of the
   empirical evidence and their proposed causal mechanisms. We find that
   the data provide stronger evidence for the reverse causal relationship,
   namely that civil war causes disease to become more prevalent. This
   finding is consistent with the literatures on the public health effects
   of civil war as well as research on state capacity and public health.

AB Building on the implications of qualitative work from India and urbanism
   theories, I aim to understand whether religious bonding social capital
   in contemporary India increases with greater urbanization and whether
   such increases are moderated by caste or social class position. Results
   from multinomial logistic regression on 1,417 Hindu respondents in a
   nationally representative sample of India (World Values Survey-India
   2001) indicate that religious bonding is fostered by urbanism and that
   this association is stronger for upper castes. But there is little
   evidence that social class similarly moderates the association between
   urbanism and religious bonding. In light of these findings, religious
   bonding might be better understood as rooted in the interaction of caste
   dynamics and changes in the urban environment, rather than as a result
   of greater affluence. The data are also consistent with work
   underscoring the importance of disentangling social class and caste
   among Hindus in contemporary India.

AB Social networks show striking structural regularities(1,2), and both
   theory and evidence suggest that networks may have facilitated the
   development of large-scale cooperation in humans(3-7). Here, we
   characterize the social networks of the Hadza, a population of
   hunter-gatherers in Tanzania(8). We show that Hadza networks have
   important properties also seen in modernized social networks, including
   a skewed degree distribution, degree assortativity, transitivity,
   reciprocity, geographic decay and homophily. We demonstrate that Hadza
   camps exhibit high between-group and low within-group variation in
   public goods game donations. Network ties are also more likely between
   people who give the same amount, and the similarity in cooperative
   behaviour extends up to two degrees of separation. Social distance
   appears to be as important as genetic relatedness and physical proximity
   in explaining assortativity in cooperation. Our results suggest that
   certain elements of social network structure may have been present at an
   early point in human history. Also, early humans may have formed ties
   with both kin and non-kin, based in part on their tendency to cooperate.
   Social networks may thus have contributed to the emergence of
   cooperation.

AB Unlike most species, humans cooperate extensively with group members who
   are not closely related to them, a pattern sustained in part by
   punishing non-cooperators and rewarding cooperators. Because internally
   cooperative groups prevail over less cooperative rival groups, it is
   thought that violent intergroup conflict played a key role in the
   evolution of human cooperation. Consequently, it is plausible that
   propensities to punish and reward will be elevated during intergroup
   conflict. Using experiments conducted before, during and after the 2006
   Israel-Hezbollah war, we show that, during wartime, people are more
   willing to pay costs to punish non-cooperative group members and reward
   cooperative group members. Rather than simply increasing within-group
   solidarity, violent intergroup conflict thus elicits behaviours that,
   writ large, enhance cooperation within the group, thereby making victory
   more likely.

AB Background: Studies have reported that the predictive ability of
   self-rated health (SRH) for mortality varies by sex/gender and
   socioeconomic group. The purpose of this study is to evaluate this
   relationship in Japan and explore the potential reasons for differences
   between the groups.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: The analyses in the study were based on
   the Aichi Gerontological Evaluation Study's (AGES) 2003 Cohort Study in
   Chita Peninsula, Japan, which followed the four-year survival status of
   14,668 communitydwelling people who were at least 65 years old at the
   start of the study. We first examined sex/gender and education-level
   differences in association with fair/poor SRH. We then estimated the
   sex/gender-and education-specific hazard ratios (HRs) of mortality
   associated with lower SRH using Cox models. Control variables, including
   health behaviors (smoking and drinking), symptoms of depression, and
   chronic co-morbid conditions, were added to sequential regression
   models. The results showed men and women reported a similar prevalence
   of lower SRH. However, lower SRH was a stronger predictor of mortality
   in men (HR = 2.44 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.14-2.80]) than in
   women (HR = 1.88 [95% CI: 1.44-2.47]; p for sex/gender interaction =
   0.018). The sex/gender difference in the predictive ability of SRH was
   progressively attenuated with the additional introduction of other
   co-morbid conditions. The predictive ability among individuals with high
   school education (HR = 2.39 [95% CI: 1.74-3.30]) was similar to that
   among individuals with less than a high school education (HR = 2.14 [95%
   CI: 1.83-2.50]; p for education interaction = 0.549).
   Conclusions: The sex/gender difference in the predictive ability of SRH
   for mortality among this elderly Japanese population may be explained by
   male/female differences in what goes into an individual's assessment of
   their SRH, with males apparently weighting depressive symptoms more than
   females.

AB Background: A growing body of empirical evidence indicates that
   low-level social capital is related to poor mental health outcomes.
   However, the prospective association between social capital and
   depression remains unclear, and no published studies have investigated
   the association with longitudinal data in East-Asian countries.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the ongoing Korean Welfare Panel Study to
   prospectively investigate association between social capital and
   depression. Social capital was measured at the individual level by two
   items specific to interpersonal trust and reciprocity. Depression was
   annually assessed as a dichotomous variable using the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. After excluding participants who
   had depression in 2006, logistic regression models were applied to
   estimate the association between each social capital indicator and
   new-onset depression developed in 2007 or long-term depression in both
   2007 and 2008. We also examined the association in a subpopulation
   restricted to healthy participants after excluding individuals with any
   pre-existing disability, chronic disease, or poor self-rated health
   condition.
   Results: Compared to the high interpersonal trust group, the odds ratios
   of developing new-onset and long-term depression among the low
   interpersonal trust group were 1.22 (95% CI: 1.08 similar to 1.38) and
   1.23 (95% CI: 1.03 similar to 1.50), respectively, and increased to 1.32
   (95% CI: 1.10 similar to 1.57) and 1.47 (95% CI: 1.05 similar to 2.08)
   in the subpopulation analyses restricted to healthy individuals.
   Although the low and intermediate reciprocity group also had
   significantly higher odds of developing new-onset depression compared to
   the high reciprocity group, the effects were attenuated and
   statistically non-significant in the subpopulation analyses.
   Conclusion: Low interpersonal trust appears to be an independent risk
   factor for new-onset and long-term depression in South Korea.

AB Ecological restoration programs and payments for ecosystem services have
   both attracted broad academic and policy attention. While they are
   inherently linked and thus should be part of the integrated processes of
   ecosystem management, they have been largely pursued separately. The
   majority of restoration ecologists and socioeconomic scholars tend to
   dwell in their own "comfort zone" and concentrate on different,
   disciplinary facets of the same issues. However, this situation is not
   conducive to the accomplishment of their common cause. The objective of
   this paper is to make a case for more effective efforts in integrating
   ecological restoration programs and payments for ecosystem services and
   thus more substantive interdisciplinary collaboration in the science and
   practice of ecological restoration and ecosystem service provision. To
   that end, the relevant research developments and bodies of literature
   are carefully reviewed, and China's recent experience and lessons in
   retiring and converting degraded cropland extensively presented. It is
   hoped that these efforts will highlight the challenges and opportunities
   in the current state of affairs and convince scientists in different
   disciplines to work together in better and more broadly integrated
   research of ecological restoration programs and payments for ecosystem
   services. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Amid increasing recognition of the importance of the environmental
   factor in understanding poverty and development, this article coins the
   term "environmental poverty" to refer to the lack of the healthy
   environment needed for society's survival and development as a direct
   result of human-induced environmental degradation. A decomposed
   environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) demonstrates that places (such as
   countries, counties, or cities) following the "grow first, clean up
   later" approach (or the first half of the EKC) may obtain economic gains
   accompanied by extreme environmental sacrifice, excessive social
   injustice, and income and environmental inequalities. The same place may
   include communities whose curves differ in shape. Some communities may
   prosper at the expense of other communities, which may fall into
   environmental poverty and eventually irreversible environmental
   degradation and economic failure. Places following alternatives or "flat
   EKCs" may be slow in getting out of economic poverty, but enjoy a
   healthier environment, equality in income and environmental quality, and
   social justice. Countries, especially developing countries, should
   aspire to sustainable alternatives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Network structure varies across cities. This variation may yield
   important knowledge about how the internal structure of the city affects
   its performance. This paper systematically compares a set of surface
   transportation network structure variables (connectivity, hierarchy,
   circuity, treeness, entropy, accessibility) across the 50 largest
   metropolitan areas in the United States. A set of scaling parameters are
   discovered to show how network size and structure vary with city size.
   These results suggest that larger cities are physically more
   inter-connected. Hypotheses are presented as to why this might obtain.
   This paper then consistently measures and ranks access to jobs across 50
   US metropolitan areas. It uses that accessibility measure, along with
   network structure variables and city size to help explain
   journey-to-work time and auto mode share in those cities. A 1 percent
   increase in accessibility reduces average metropolitan commute times by
   about 90 seconds each way. A 1 percent increase in network connectivity
   reduces commute time by 0.1 percent. A 1 percent increase in
   accessibility results in a 0.0575 percent drop in auto mode share, while
   a 1 percent increase in treeness reduces auto mode share by 0.061
   percent. Use of accessibility and network structure measures is
   important for planning and evaluating the performance of network
   investments and land use changes.

AB Disentangling the effects of selection and influence is one of social
   science's greatest unsolved puzzles: Do people befriend others who are
   similar to them, or do they become more similar to their friends over
   time? Recent advances in stochastic actor-based modeling, combined with
   self-reported data on a popular online social network site, allow us to
   address this question with a greater degree of precision than has
   heretofore been possible. Using data on the Facebook activity of a
   cohort of college students over 4 years, we find that students who share
   certain tastes in music and in movies, but not in books, are
   significantly likely to befriend one another. Meanwhile, we find little
   evidence for the diffusion of tastes among Facebook friends-except for
   tastes in classical/jazz music. These findings shed light on the
   mechanisms responsible for observed network homogeneity; provide a
   statistically rigorous assessment of the coevolution of cultural tastes
   and social relationships; and suggest important qualifications to our
   understanding of both homophily and contagion as generic social
   processes.

AB Objective: We undertook a longitudinal study in rural Uganda to
   understand the association of food insecurity with morbidity and
   patterns of healthcare utilization among HIV-infected individuals
   enrolled in an antiretroviral therapy program.
   Design: Longitudinal cohort study.
   Methods: Participants were enrolled from the Uganda AIDS Rural Treatment
   Outcomes cohort, and underwent quarterly structured interviews and blood
   draws. The primary predictor was food insecurity measured by the
   validated Household Food Insecurity Access Scale. Primary outcomes
   included health-related quality of life measured by the validated
   Medical Outcomes Study-HIV Physical Health Summary (PHS), incident
   self-reported opportunistic infections, number of hospitalizations, and
   missed clinic visits. To estimate model parameters, we used the method
   of generalized estimating equations, adjusting for sociodemographic and
   clinical variables. Explanatory variables were lagged by 3 months to
   strengthen causal interpretations.
   Results: Beginning in May 2007, 458 persons were followed for a median
   of 2.07 years, and 40% were severely food insecure at baseline. Severe
   food insecurity was associated with worse PHS, opportunistic infections,
   and increased hospitalizations (results were similar in concurrent and
   lagged models). Mild/moderate food insecurity was associated with missed
   clinic visits in concurrent models, whereas in lagged models, severe
   food insecurity was associated with reduced odds of missed clinic
   visits.
   Conclusion: Based on the negative impact of food insecurity on morbidity
   and patterns of healthcare utilization among HIV-infected individuals,
   policies and programs that address food insecurity should be a critical
   component of HIV treatment programs worldwide. (C) 2011 Wolters Kluwer

PY 2012
AB Purpose - We make a case for bridging two types of logics - analytic and
   dialectic - for explaining processes of social-historical change, and
   maintain that a successful bridge between these two logics depends on a
   variety of conditions and most especially the type of analytic logic or
   model one employs for capturing dynamic processes.
   Methodology/approach - Conventional models of social change processes
   typically presuppose ergodic social worlds and are problematic as
   analytic approaches generally and most certainly are not fertile grounds
   for feeding dialectic theorization. Instead, we propose modeling dynamic
   processes that begin by assuming a nonergodic social world - one in
   flux, one that is nonrepeating, one within which model process and
   parameter structures are historically contingent and change with time,
   one that is autocatalytic, creating and changing its own possibilities.
   Findings - We develop the line of thinking adumbrated above and
   illustrate these modeling strategies with empirical examples from US
   labor movement history. Results from these examples lend much weight to
   our proposals. Thus, this chapter demonstrates that concerns about the
   use of ergodic assumptions and about greater use of dialectical
   reasoning when studying social processes are not idle speculations
   within theoretical commentaries but have practical consequences in the
   conduct of research and the building of better theory.
   Research limitations/implications - To approximate such an approach,
   social scientists should avoid cross-sectionalist and longitudinal
   modeling strategies that presuppose stability and homogeneity in
   parameter and process structures. Homogeneity and stability in parameter
   and process structures should be demonstrated, not assumed.
   Originality/value - Rather than accepting the alienated spheres of
   social science analytics and dialectic theory, our proposal presupposes
   nonergodic social worlds and takes pragmatic steps for estimating
   analytic models that are more amenable to dialectic reasoning. Models
   that take nonergodicity seriously not only have the potential to produce
   better, historically grounded analytics but are also best suited to
   bridge with dialectic logic, thus taking advantage of the strengths of
   both forms of logic.

AB Purpose - This essay attempts to answer the question, "What
   distinguishes inter-human influence from other forms of influence?"
   Design/methodology/approach - Specifying the micro-foundations of social
   structures in terms of communicative inferences necessitates a revision
   of the concept of social structures (and institutions) as distributed,
   and hence, uncertain, structures of expectation. Institutional realities
   are generated in linguistic interaction through the indirect
   communication of generic references. The generalizing function of
   language - in particular, abstraction and memory - coupled with its
   reflexive function, to turn references into things, are sufficient to
   generate both social structures and institutions as collective
   inferences.
   Findings - Social relations are fundamentally communicative relations.
   The communicative relation is triadic, implying an enunciator, an
   audience, and some referential content. Through linguistic
   communication, humans are capable of communicating locally with others
   about others nonlocally. Institutions exist only as expectations
   concerning the expectations of others. These expectations, however, are
   not only in the mind, and they are not exclusively psychological
   entities. Linguistically, these expectations appear as the reported
   statement within the reporting statement, that is, they are constituted
   through indirect discourse.
   Research limitations/implications - An important implication for current
   sociological theory is that, from the point of view of a sociology
   defined as communication about communication from within communication,
   institutional realities should not be reified as existing
   naturalistically or objectively above or behind the communications
   through which they are instantiated.
   Originality value - This approach, then, is decidedly anti-"realist."
   The goal of such research is to examine the inadequacy of nonreflexive
   models of social order. Accounts of how sets of social relationships
   emerge will remain inadequate if they do not reflect upon the cognitive
   and communicative processes which make possible the consideration of
   such structures.

AB Purpose - This chapter focuses on the status of Emile Durkheim's work in
   the United States, and on the prospects of its rehabilitation in light
   of the crisis of theory engendered by the critique of the theory of the
   sign and the paradox presented by the application of terms that invoke
   an inertial view of culture to everyday discourse.
   Design/methodology/approach - How is it possible to reconcile the most
   general aspect of the internal life of the sociality that Durkheim
   places under the name of "solidarity," with the theoretically expansive
   idea of social movements and with an idea of a generative culture
   radically different from the inertial institutional concept attributed
   to Durkheim? Our argument depends on conceiving of society as a course
   of activity, therefore, according to internal relations among
   subjectivities and objectivities. The main ontological assumptions of
   the human sciences are that humans and human affairs are essentially
   social and that sociality is irreducible and irrepressible. That
   difference lies at the heart of every attempt to identify something as
   unitary, complete, and stable.
   Findings - Culture is tied to social movements, where the latter are
   thought of as expressions of the "becoming" of society. An understanding
   of the dynamics of culture requires revisiting dialectics and "internal
   relations." The challenge to the idea of meaning based on the exchange
   of signs requires a reformulation of basic categories of human science.
   When the social is thought of as historical, it is necessary to think of
   history as immanent rather than as a condition or temporal course.
   Therefore, one is driven back to Marx by way of Hegel, where "history"
   refers to the contradictory character of whatever can be said about the
   social. It follows that every instance of unity is merely ostensible and
   cannot be relied on as a primary referent of a social science.
   Research limitations/implications - "Culture" can no longer stand for
   something inert; rather, it appears as radically generative and
   reflexive. Further, it is not independent of economic reality, though it
   has the sort of weight that makes economism impossible.
   Originality value - This chapter will stimulate more insightful
   appreciations of the work of Emile Durkheim, relative to his typical
   reception in U.S. social science. For instance, to reappropriate
   Durkheim for theoretical purposes, it is necessary to work through the
   problems raised by poststructuralism and the literature of
   ethnomethodology and its adjacent areas of research, with attention to
   the ontological presuppositions of theories of human affairs and the
   epistemological requirement of all the human sciences, that theory find
   itself in its object and its object in itself.

AB Purpose - The discourse about civil society is closely tied to the role
   of collective action in general, and of social movements in particular.
   Yet the origins of the recent emphasis on civil society are located in
   the 1980s - the time period during which the wave of neoliberalism began
   its rise and spread.
   Design/methodology/approach - In order to properly situate the concept
   of civil society and related debates, they must be linked to efforts to
   delegitimate and demonize the state that also started gaining momentum
   during that decade.
   Findings - The historical context of its emergence suggests that civil
   society may not be so much an analytical category for purposes of social
   research, but a theoretical category that is imbued with political
   content, both positively and negatively - both as a means to promote
   progressive ends, and as an expression of the context in which those
   ends started to face mounting resistance.
   Research limitations/implications - At the very least, the concept of
   civil society has a tendency to distract - both by design and by default
   - from important questions and challenges, such as those related to the
   role and persistence of structures of inequality in early 21st century
   global civilization.
   Originality/value - A promising starting point to circumnavigate the
   counterproductive consequences of the use and abuse of the civil society
   concept and debate for social research may be its explicitly dynamic
   conceptualization.

AB Amid growing difficulties for professionals generally, media workers in
   particular are negotiating the increasingly contested boundary space
   between producers and users in the digital environment. This article,
   based on a review of the academic literature, explores that larger
   tension transforming the creative industries by extrapolating from the
   case of journalism - namely, the ongoing tension between professional
   control and open participation in the news process. Firstly, the
   sociology of professions, with its emphasis on boundary maintenance, is
   used to examine journalism as boundary work, profession, and ideology -
   each contributing to the formation of journalism's professional logic of
   control over content. Secondly, by considering the affordances and
   cultures of digital technologies, the article articulates open
   participation and its ideology. Thirdly, and against this backdrop of
   ideological incompatibility, a review of empirical literature finds that
   journalists have struggled to reconcile this key tension, caught in the
   professional impulse toward one-way publishing control even as media
   become a multi-way network. Yet, emerging research also suggests the
   possibility of a hybrid logic of adaptability and openness - an ethic of
   participation - emerging to resolve this tension going forward. The
   article concludes by pointing to innovations in analytical frameworks
   and research methods that may shed new light on the producer-user
   tension in journalism.

AB Power and domination once occupied center stage in organizational
   sociology. But as the field developed, the concept of power was
   marginalized and its overall significance for the drama of organization
   life neglected. Normative critiques of domination were recast as puzzles
   of obedience to authority, while scholars wishing to study the concrete
   workings of power regimes found themselves groping in the shadows. In
   this introduction, we advocate putting power and domination back on the
   agenda. Following the lead of classical theorists of power, we argue
   that organizations should be seen as scenes of struggles and as
   political projects to be constantly achieved and reconstructed. We
   critique structural and abstract perspectives that neglect the constant
   engagement of people in the negotiation of rules, meanings, and
   destinies. And we survey novel ideas that can help us to see power not
   as an abstract entity but as a pattern of interactions and social
   relationships that is instantiated in specific projects of domination
   and resistance. It is through this lens that power studies can be
   reinvigorated.

AB The discovery of meso-level social orders in organizational theory,
   political sociology, and social movement theory, what have subsequently
   been called sectors, policy domains, and most popularly, fields (or in
   organizational sociology, organizational fields), opens up a theoretical
   terrain that has not yet been fully explored (see Martin, 2003 for one
   view of fields). In this chapter, we propose that in fact all of these
   phenomena (and several others), fields, domains, policy domains,
   sectors, networks, and in game theory, the "game'' bear a deep
   theoretical relationship to one another. They are all a way of
   characterizing how meso-level social orders, social spaces are
   constructed. We want to make a bold claim: the idea of fields is the
   central sociological construct for understanding all arenas of
   collective strategic action. The idea of fields is not just useful for
   understanding markets and political policy domains, but also social
   movements, and many other forms of organized social life. In essence,
   scholars working on their particular empirical corner of the world have
   inadvertently discovered something fundamental about social structure:
   that collective actors somehow manage to work to get "action'' toward
   their socially and cultural constructed ends and in doing so, enlist the
   support of others in order to produce meso-level social orders.

AB My story is one of becoming a sociologist by accident. Throughout this
   story, I emphasize the turning points I took and those thrust upon me
   during my sociological journey. The turning points in my path to
   becoming a sociologist began during my childhood, although I could not
   have foreseen them. Both of my parents had experienced downward social
   mobility yet had managed to receive university degrees despite enduring
   hardships and living through the Great Depression. Gender roles
   circumscribed opportunities for girls who grew up in the 1950s. Thus, I
   entered a women's profession, occupational therapy. After a few years,
   my interest in teaching occupational therapy students led me back to
   graduate school to seek a master's degree in sociology at San Francisco
   State College. I gained a new worldview, although I soon learned that
   quantification and esoteric theorizing, not social issues, commanded the
   attention of most mid-1960s sociologists. I also learned that women
   sociologists had scant opportunities despite their qualifications but
   decided to seek a doctoral degree in sociology anyway. Eventually the
   University of California, San Francisco, accepted me in their first
   cohort of doctoral students and subsequently I worked closely with
   Anselm Strauss, my dissertation chair, and Barney Glaser, from whom I
   learned grounded theory. After finishing my dissertation, a temporary
   appointment at Sonoma State College turned into a tenure-track
   appointment. Although many years at Sonoma have been tumultuous, I have
   also had the privilege of developing a writing program to assist the
   faculty in their research and writing.

AB My early life was punctuated by turning points and transformations that
   gradually led to a surprising and late-blooming academic career - my
   first "real'' sociology position began when I was 44. Here I trace six
   different trajectories of scholarly work which have compelled me:
   feminist women's health and technoscience studies; social worlds/arenas
   and the disciplinary emergence of reproductive sciences; the sociology
   of work and scientific practices; biomedicalization studies; grounded
   theory and situational analysis as qualitative research methods; and
   symbolic interaction-ists and -isms. I have circled back across them
   multiple times. Instead of seeing a beautifully folded origami of a
   life, it feels more like a crumpled wad of newspapers from various
   times. Upon opening and holding them up to the light in different ways,
   stories may be slowly discerned. I try to capture here some of the
   sweetness and fragility of these moments toward the end of an initially
   stuttering but later wondrously gratifying career.

AB This story tells a version of my life as an ethnographer and symbolic
   interactionist. From an early age, I was intrigued by how people
   interacted and created meaningful worlds for themselves and by my own
   motives, actions, thoughts, and feelings. Later, as a student of
   sociology, my eyes were opened to the macro forces that constrained,
   liberated, and influenced actions, identities, and performances.
   Eventually, I located myself on the margins of sociology, as I
   experienced the constraints of mainstream sociology and how this
   perspective limited what and how I could study and write. I was drawn to
   a wider interdisciplinary community of scholars who examined experience
   more concretely and emotionally, and I began to work comfortably in the
   spaces between social science and literature, self and other, research
   and story. I now view myself more as a writer communicating heartfelt
   stories for the purpose of opening up and evoking conversations and
   emotional responses from readers than a reporter giving an account of
   what she has seen, heard, and analyzed from a distance, a researcher who
   works with others rather than one who collects data on them. In my
   current collaborative witnessing project with Holocaust survivors, I
   have come full circle, connecting macrohistory and structure with
   personal storytelling and integrating my sociological eye with a
   communicative heart.

AB My intellectual journey as a sociologist and a symbolic interactionist
   began when I was a 13-year-old eighth-grader in Catholic School on the
   working-class, southwest side of Chicago. My eighth-grade nun pulled me
   aside after school one day and gently told me that, now that I should
   think about what to be when I grow up. She suggested I study to be
   "either a sociologist or a priest.'' After some serious thought, I
   eliminated the option of becoming a priest - yet, the word sociologist
   was intriguing. I had no idea what it really meant, but it had a certain
   ring to it in 1960, when society was becoming a viable and visible
   orientation in terms of major events we were learning a little bit about
   from the good nuns and television - like civil rights, the cold war, and
   the space race. I took her advice and set out on a 50-year journey to
   become a sociologist. The map of the journey has been elusive, though,
   in that what it means to be a sociologist - especially an interactionist
   sociologist - has changed over the years as events in my life and the
   social world have evolved. This journey has had three segments:
   sociology as something to do; sociology as something to know; and
   sociology as something to be. The journey has been profound as well as
   fun because, as I continue to discover what it means to be an
   interactionist sociologist, I discover who I am.

AB The ontogeny of human empathy is better understood with reference to the
   evolutionary history of the social brain. Empathy has deep evolutionary,
   biochemical, and neurological underpinnings. Even the most advanced
   forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain
   connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication,
   social attachment, and parental care. In this paper, we argue that it is
   essential to consider empathy within a neurodevelopmental framework that
   recognizes both the continuities and changes in socioemotional
   understanding from infancy to adulthood. We bring together
   neuroevolutionary and developmental perspectives on the information
   processing and neural mechanisms underlying empathy and caring, and show
   that they are grounded in multiple interacting systems and processes.
   Moreover, empathy in humans is assisted by other abstract and
   domain-general high-level cognitive abilities such as executive
   functions, mentalizing and language, as well as the ability to
   differentiate another's mental states from one's own, which expand the
   range of behaviors that can be driven by empathy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This review integrates cognitive, socioemotional, and neuroimaging
   perspectives on self-development. Neural correlates of key processes
   implicated in personal and social identity are reported from studies of
   children, adolescents, and adults, including autobiographical memory,
   direct and reflected self-appraisals, and social exclusion. While
   cortical midline structures of medial prefrontal cortex and medial
   posterior parietal cortex are consistently identified in neuroimaging
   studies considering personal identity from a primarily cognitive
   perspective ("who am I?"), additional regions are implicated by studies
   considering personal and social identity from a more socioemotional
   perspective ("what do others think about me, where do I fit in?"),
   especially in child or adolescent samples. The involvement of these
   additional regions (including tempo-parietal junction and posterior
   superior temporal sulcus, temporal poles, anterior insula, ventral
   striatum, anterior cingulate cortex, middle cingulate cortex, and
   ventrolateral prefrontal cortex) suggests mentalizing, emotion, and
   emotion regulation are central to self-development. In addition, these
   regions appear to function atypically during personal and social
   identity tasks in autism and depression, exhibiting a broad pattern of
   hypoactivation and hyperactivation, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Over the past four decades, increasingly punitive and
   enforcement-oriented U.S. immigration policies have been legitimized by
   a rhetoric of criminality that stigmatizes Latino immigrant workers and
   intensifies their exploitation. Simultaneously, there has been a
   sevenfold increase in the prison population in the United States, in
   which African Americans are eight times more likely to be jailed than
   Whites (Western 2006, p. 3). In this paper, I draw on scholarship in
   history and sociology, as well as my own anthropological research, to
   develop the argument that criminal justice policies and immigration
   policies together disempower low-wage U. S. labor and maintain
   categorical racial inequalities in a "postracial" United States. First,
   I review the historical role of race in U. S. immigration policy, and I
   consider the evidence for systemic racism in immigration enforcement in
   the contemporary period. Second, I discuss criminal legislation in the
   neoliberal era and examine the ways in which criminal legislation and
   immigration policies together disempower large segments of the U.S.
   workforce, satisfying employer demands for low cost and pliant labor.
   Finally, I argue that a political focus on immigrant workers'
   "illegality" masks the role of the state in (re) defining the legal
   status of low-wage workers and veils the ways in which punitive policies
   maintain historical racial and class inequalities.

AB Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on the planet but are
   declining because of human activities. Despite general recognition of
   the human role in the plight of coral reefs, the vast majority of
   research focuses on the ecological rather than the human dimensions of
   reef ecosystems, limiting our understanding of social relationships with
   these environments as well as potential solutions for reef recovery.
   General frameworks for social-ecological systems (SESs) have been
   advanced, but system-specific approaches are needed to develop a more
   nuanced view of human-environmental interactions for specific contexts
   and resource systems, and at specific scales. We synthesize existing
   concepts related to SESs and present a human dimensions framework that
   explores the linkages between social system structural traits, human
   activities, ecosystem services, and human well-being in coral reef SESs.
   Key features of the framework include social-ecological reciprocity,
   proximate and underlying dimensions, and the directionality of key
   relationships and feedback loops. Such frameworks are needed if human
   dimensions research is to be more fully integrated into studies of
   ecosystem change and the sustainability of linked SESs.

AB Biological resource monitoring systems are implemented in many countries
   and often depend on the participation of local people. It has been
   suggested that these systems empower local participants while promoting
   conservation. We reviewed three wildlife monitoring systems in
   indigenous lands and sustainable development reserves in Brazilian
   Amazonia and one in Namibian Caprivi conservancies, analyzing the
   strategies adopted and conditions that facilitated local empowerment, as
   well as potential impacts on conservation. This provided insights into
   potential avenues to strengthen empowerment outcomes of monitoring
   systems in Latin America and Africa. We assessed four dimensions of
   empowerment at individual and community scales: psychological, social,
   economic, and political. The conditions that facilitated local
   empowerment included the value of natural resources, rights to trade and
   manage resources, political organization of communities, and
   collaboration by stakeholders. The wide range of strategies to empower
   local people included intensifying local participation, linking them to
   local education, feeding information back to communities, purposefully
   selecting participants, paying for monitoring services, marketing
   monitored resources, and inserting local people into broader politics.
   Although communities were socially and politically empowered, the
   monitoring systems more often promoted individual empowerment. Marketing
   of natural resources promoted higher economic empowerment in
   conservancies in Namibia, whereas information dissemination was better
   in Brazil because of integrated education programs. We suggest that
   practitioners take advantage of local facilitating conditions to enhance
   the empowerment of communities, bearing in mind that increasing autonomy
   to make management decisions may not agree with international
   conservation goals. Our comparative analysis of cases in Latin America
   and Africa allows for a greater understanding of the relationships
   between resource monitoring systems, local empowerment, and
   conservation.

AB Agricultural systems are embedded in wider social-ecological processes
   that must be considered in any complete discussion of sustainable
   agriculture. Just as climatic profiles will influence the future
   viability of crops, institutions, i.e., governance agreements, rural
   household and community norms, local associations, markets, and
   agricultural ministries, to name but a few, create the conditions that
   foster sustainable food systems. Because discussions of agricultural
   sustainability often overlook the full range of social dimensions, we
   propose a dual focus on a broad set of criteria, i.e., human health,
   labor, democratic participation, resiliency, biological and cultural
   diversity, equity, and ethics, to assess social outcomes, and on
   institutions that could support diversified farming systems (DFS). A
   comparative analysis of case studies from California's Central Valley,
   Mesoamerican coffee agroforestry systems, and European Union
   agricultural parks finds that DFS practices are unevenly adopted within
   and among these systems and interdependent with institutional
   environments that specifically promote diversified farming practices.
   Influential institutions in these cases include state policies, farmers'
   cooperatives/associations, and organized civic efforts to influence
   agroenvironmental policy, share knowledge, and shape markets for more
   'sustainable' products. The Californian and Mesoamerican cases considers
   organic and fair trade certifications, finding that although they
   promote several DFS practices and generate social benefits, they are
   inadequate as a single strategy to promote agricultural sustainability.
   The complex governance and multifunctional management of Europe's
   peri-urban agricultural parks show unexpected potential for promoting
   DFS. Unless DFS are anchored in supportive institutions and evaluated
   against an inclusive set of social and environmental criteria,
   short-term investments to advance diversified agriculture could miss a
   valuable opportunity to connect ecological benefits with social benefits
   in the medium and long terms.

   the process of formalization. In this context, the concept of fit is
   interpreted as a way of expressing certain theoretical propositions that
   relate a set of variables with each other and with an outcome. This
   perspective is demonstrated through the use of the Web Ontology Language
   to express several "theories of fit." Using a formal language to
   describe types of fit and their associated theories is argued to have
   much potential for advancing the scientific study of social-ecological

AB Accounts of how culture constitutes the learning activities we
   accomplish with others are flourishing. These accounts illustrate how
   participants draw upon, adapt, and contest historically situated social
   practices, tools, and relations to accomplish their learning goals
   [Vygotsky: Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1978]. Yet, they often
   lack attention to the ways that these social features reify and are
   reified by broader power structures and hierarchies. One way that power
   plays out in everyday social interaction is through the stories,
   narratives and ideologies that serve as resources for interpreting and
   organizing ongoing activity. Individuals become attuned to, coordinate
   and mobilize around these broader narratives through the frames they
   engage in moments of interaction. We offer frame analysis as a means of
   investigating both access to learning environments and opportunities to
   learn within them. To situate learning opportunities within and across
   different components of multilevel systems, a distinction is proposed
   between framing within a classroom or learning environment and framing
   access to educational processes and institutions. This paper recommends
   that researchers analyze, and design for, framing that disrupts
   predominant power structures and expands the possibilities for learning
   within more equitable social practices. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG,

AB In this article, we theorize the relation between race and schooling and
   consider the implications for learning. While the body of research on
   culture and learning has come to define learning as an inherently
   cultural and social process, scholars have few theoretical tools to help
   us think about the role of race and racism in relation to students'
   access to identities as learners and to learning. We draw on both
   theoretical and empirical literature to make three core arguments: (a)
   racial 'storylines' or narratives are prevalent in our society and have
   powerful implications for learners, particularly for youth from
   marginalized communities; (b) these racial storylines are a critical
   aspect of life in schools, which serve the purpose of racially and
   academically socializing students; and (c) as these storylines are
   invoked in school settings, certain identities are made available,
   imposed, or closed down. Such identities have important implications for
   students' opportunities to learn and their engagement in learning
   settings. As we conclude, we consider the potential of alternative
   spaces, which can serve to counter dominant narratives about who is
   capable of learning and how learning takes place, and open new spaces
   for identity and learning. Copyright (C) 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB This article considers aspects of the use of class in sociology and
   anthropology since the period around 1970, when Neo-Marxism became
   important in the social sciences, and is concerned primarily with
   Marxist and Weberian uses of the concept. It considers changes in the
   use of class in terms of two dimensions. One is the degree to which
   class is placed in a more macroscopic or more microscopic frame. The
   other is the degree to which class is defined in more objectivist terms
   or relies more on the way that the people being studied use the term. It
   is argued that since around 1970 writing on class has tended to become
   more microscopic and subjectivist. This tendency is related to changes
   within the two disciplines and within society more generally. The
   article closes with a consideration of some of the costs of this
   changing scholarly orientation to class.

   hospital and outpatient locations) from seven state cancer registries
   participating in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Breast
   and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study. Distinction
   was made between men receiving no therapy with no monitoring plan (no
   therapy/no plan [NT/NP]) and those receiving active surveillance (AS).
   Overall, 8.6% received NT/NP and 4.7% received AS. Older age at
   diagnosis, lower clinical risk group, and certain registry locations
   were significant predictors of use of both AS and NT/NP. AS was also
   related to having more severe comorbidities, whereas nonwhite race was
   predicted receiving NT/NP. Men receiving AS lived in areas with a higher
   number of urologists per 100 000 men than those receiving NT/NP. In
   summary, physician and clinical factors were stronger predictors of AS,
   whereas demographic and regional factors were related to receiving
   NT/NP. Physicians appear reluctant to recommend AS for younger patients
   with no comorbidities.

AB Patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) from germinal matrix
   hemorrhage of prematurity often require numerous early interventions, as
   well as long-term follow-up care from pediatric neurosurgeons, which
   continues to place high demands on the existing workforce and pediatric
   health care system. There are established correlations between premature
   birth and low socioeconomic status. The aim of this study is to
   characterize the demographic profile and follow-up patterns in this
   subpopulation of surgically treated infants with PHH from prematurity.
   Methods: A retrospective analysis of the electronic patient records for
   a single institution, from 2007 to 2010, was performed. All patients who
   underwent neurosurgical intervention for the treatment of PHH were
   selected for further analysis. Data elements available within the
   records included patient demographic features, inpatient treatments and
   procedures, inpatient mortality rates, length of stay, and postoperative
   follow-up at the institution. Socioeconomic status was assessed using
   the median household income for the patient's zip code, as reported in
   the United States Census for the year 2000. Results: A total of 40
   patients who underwent neurosurgical intervention for PHH at a single
   institution were identified. More patients were female (52.5%); the
   majority of patients were Black (57.5%). No patients were uninsured;
   most patients had public insurance (62.5%), and 65% were below the
   Maryland State median household income (USD 52,868). There were trends
   toward more frequent emergency room visits among those covered by public
   insurance and those below the state and national median house income,
   although differences were not statistically significant. Conclusions:
   Our data indicate that the majority of patients fall within lower
   household income brackets, are born into households earning less than
   the statewide median household income, and are covered by public
   insurance. In light of the socioeconomic profile of the patient
   population reported here, these data may prove to be useful in
   preventative strategies aimed toward prematurity, PHH, and the ongoing
   treatment of hydrocephalus by pediatric neurosurgeons and other
   pediatric subspecialists. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Baboons were used in the past as models for human evolution. I utilize
   40 years of data from my long-term study on baboons in Kenya to suggest
   that baboons are once again relevant for understanding human evolution,
   not as a referential model but to reset the starting conditions of the
   human experiment. The baboon data also offer a critique of widely held
   ideas about how natural selection might work by looking at real lives in
   real time. This situates competition in a matrix of collaboration and
   illustrates the critical role of chance, contingency, and history in
   baboon survival and success. I make three methodological moves to reach
   these conclusions. The first is to focus on process not just outcome.
   The second is to look at time scales longer than usual studies but
   shorter than evolutionary time as a way to open the black box that
   currently links behavior to evolutionary value. The third is to use
   comparative natural history, Darwin's method, as a way to capture and
   comprehend how complexity is generated and how baboons deal with it in
   their daily lives. These empirical and methodological turns lead to
   conclusions that run counter to widely held ideas about baboons, about
   primates, and about the determinism of natural selection. I follow my
   own research history to illustrate these points. The discussion ranges
   from alternative interpretations of the male and the female dominance
   hierarchies, to insights from a fission that happened when the foraging
   strategy of raiding and nonraiding baboons diverged, to evidence of
   adaptation after translocation, and finally to assessing two unusual
   fusions of baboon groups. Altogether, these natural histories yield
   baboon principles of the social with insights about cognition,
   cooperation, and culture and suggest why baboons can't become human. The
   data also support Weiss and Buchanan's framework (The Mermaid's Tale:
   Four Billion Years of Cooperation in the Making of Living Things.
   Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,2009. 305 p) with its
   alternative view of natural selection in which there is more slippage
   and tolerance, multiple solutions with larger acceptability spaces, and
   the possibility that an adaptive fit will be good enough rather than
   seamless. However, capturing behavioral complexity in the wild poses
   methodological challenges. Long-term field studies provide critical
   information but the current quantitative methods should be expanded also
   include natural history observations of behaviors and events across
   time, space, groups, and landscapes. Finally, the baboon natural
   histories illustrate how the evolutionary game has changed in the
   Anthropocene yielding a cautionary tale about the future for many
   primate species. Am J Phys Anthropol 2012. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

AB In this article, I trace the history of the sociology of law from its
   roots at Yale Law School to the present. The legal realists, situated at
   Yale Law in the 1930s, saw the law as an instrument of policy. Building
   on this foundation, the Yale Law faculty pioneered the sociology of law
   in the 1950s, and the Russell Sage Foundation supported the
   then-emerging field's development in the 1960s. Philip Selznick was a
   major theorist and institution builder in the field, and my own writing
   has stressed how the sociology of law has challenged American ideology
   regarding economic, gender, and social equality. Nowhere is this more
   evident today than in the current racial distribution of the prison
   population. The legal realist vision first developed at Yale Law-of
   constitutional law as an instrument of social policy-was also confirmed
   by the most recent 2012 US Supreme Court decisions on immigration and
   health care.

AB This review outlines a course for US legal historical writing distinct
   from the ascendant mode of the past 30 years, generally known as
   critical legal history or critical historicism. Critical legal history
   (CLH) is premised on the conventional historical strategy of exploring
   the nature of an object by situating it in an appropriate context and
   examining the conjunction between object and context. In CLH's case, the
   object is law and the context is polity, economy, or society, or more
   usually a realm of action that is a mixture of all three. CLH is also
   premised on the further, theoretical, contention that whatever the realm
   of action in relation to which law is situated, the outcome is the same:
   indeterminacy marked by contingency, alternative possibilities, paths
   not taken. In this regard, CLH shares in the general turn in the
   qualitative social sciences and humanities toward complexity. The
   results of this contextualizing or relational approach have been
   empirically rich but are inevitably marked by an abandonment of
   authoritative causal explanation (metatheory) for thick description.
   This review lays out an alternative to CLH's parsing of relations
   between law and what is extrinsic to it, by exploring the explanatory
   potential of allegory, by which what are imagined as distinct become the
   same. Allegory is strikingly visual in conception-figurative,
   emblematic. John Wycliffe called it "ghostly understanding." I explore
   the potential of allegory along three optical dimensions-scope
   (appearance), scale (perspective), and structure (constellation)-that
   together produce what Walter Benjamin called "the dialectical image," a
   nonrelational theory of representation with striking historical
   applications.

AB Arising in the late 1960s and early 1970s-in conjunction with the
   development of sociology of law and the Law and Society Association-gap
   studies dominated much of sociolegal scholarship for a time, providing
   multiple examples of the ways in which law on the books is inconsistent
   with law in action. These gaps, in turn, spurred calls for legal reform.
   By the 1980s, however, gap studies came in for criticism, not only for
   the presumption that law was purposively rational but also for scholars'
   beliefs that they could identify law's aims. To some, the findings were
   naive or undertheorized. Nonetheless, gap studies have illuminated many
   legal practices and have helped to identify pathways by which law may
   have an impact. Even as sociolegal scholarship has become increasingly
   decentered from law, one still sees the tendrils of gap studies in
   research exploring discrepancies between expectations and actuality in
   law and legality.

AB This review examines recent scholarship on the rise of international
   human rights law and proposes that social movements have played critical
   roles both in elevating the standards of human rights in international
   law and in leveraging these standards into better local practices.
   Institutionalization of universal human rights principles began in the
   immediate post-World War II period, in which civil society actors worked
   with powerful states to establish human rights as a key guiding
   principle of the international community and to ensure the actors'
   continuing participation in international human rights institutions. The
   subsequent decades saw various hurdles arise in international politics,
   but civil society actors skillfully used the small openings that they
   had gained to continue to advance the cause of human rights. They held
   powerful governments accountable to their lofty promises about human
   rights and worked with sympathetic governments in the UN system to
   continuously upgrade the standards of international human rights. They
   also leveraged human rights laws toward better local practices, taking
   advantage of new political opportunities created by human rights laws,
   using expanding international channels to increase flows of human and
   material resources, embracing globally legitimated vocabularies of human
   rights to frame their movements, and integrating the broad cultural
   effects of human rights laws to construct new social movement identity
   and actorhood. The review then points out some potential pitfalls of
   international human rights laws: professionalization of movement actors,
   which can undermine the impact of social movements and lead to less
   ambitious and transformative goals; privileging of some causes over
   others, which can lead to demobilization around certain issues; and
   overextending movement goals, which can give rise to strong backlash
   against human rights principles.

AB Elites have changed. They are now more open and meritocratic. They are
   also the engines of inequality. In this article, I argue that elites
   have embraced the rhetoric of the rights movements of the past decades,
   becoming champions of the notion that it is individual capacities that
   matter, not ascriptive characteristics. This stance embraces a new
   efficiency of our world, that of the market. The earnest deployment of
   these ideas by the elite has resulted in a world with less equality,
   less mobility and a more empowered elite. I reflect on how this came to
   be, and how such elite identities might be challenged in the service of

AB The "dual effects" hypothesis argues that social control can be
   effective in promoting positive health-related behavior change, but it
   can also jeopardize the targeted individual's well-being. This
   hypothesis is tested using hemoglobin A1C as an objective indicator of
   behavioral compliance with diabetes self-management behavior and
   depressive symptoms. Differences in the effects of social control on A1C
   and depressive symptoms by sex and ethnicity are tested. Cross-sectional
   data were obtained from a multi-ethnic sample of older adults with
   diabetes (N = 593). Greater social control was associated with poorer
   rather than better odds of achieving glucose control, and with greater
   depressive symptoms. There was no evidence that social control has
   differential effects on either glucose control or depressive symptoms by
   sex or ethnicity. Active use of social control attempts by family
   members and friends, especially if they are coercive or punitive in
   nature, are likely counterproductive for maintaining the physical and
   mental health of older adults with diabetes.

AB Background: Health and financial literacy have been linked to the health
   and well-being of older adults, yet there are few data on how health and
   financial literacy actually impact decision making regarding healthcare
   and economic choices in advanced age. Objective: To examine the
   association of health and financial literacy with decision making in
   older adults. Method: Data came from 525 community-dwelling older
   persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an
   ongoing longitudinal study of aging. Health and financial literacy were
   assessed via a series of questions designed to measure comprehension of
   health and financial information and concepts. The two scores were
   averaged to yield a total literacy score. A modified, 12-item version of
   the Decision-Making Competence Assessment Tool was used to measure
   financial and healthcare decision making (6 items each), using materials
   designed to approximate those used in real world settings. All 12 items
   were summed to yield a total decision-making score. Associations were
   tested via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and education.
   Secondary models adjusted for global cognitive function, income,
   depression and chronic medical conditions. Results: On average,
   participants correctly answered 67% of the literacy questions (health
   literacy = 61.6%, SD = 18.8% and financial literacy = 72.5%, SD =
   16.0%). After adjustment for cognitive function, the total literacy
   score was positively associated with the decision-making total score
   (estimate = 0.64, SE = 0.08, p < 0.001), as well as healthcare (estimate
   = 0.37, SE = 0.5, p < 0.001) and financial decision making (estimate =
   0.28, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). Further, total literacy, health and
   financial literacy all were independently associated with decision
   making in models adjusted for covariates including income, depression,
   and chronic medical conditions (all p values < 0.001). Finally, there
   was evidence of effect modification such that the beneficial association
   between literacy and healthcare decision making was stronger among older
   persons, poorer persons and persons at the lower ranges of cognitive
   ability. Conclusion: Among community based older persons without
   dementia, higher levels of health and financial literacy were associated
   with better decision making, suggesting that improvements in literacy
   could facilitate better decision making and lead to better health and
   quality of life in later years. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

   Capacity-building requires the involved commitment of individuals,
   community organisations, private businesses, academic institutions,
   governmental agencies, and other stakeholders. As population and the
   corresponding demand on environmental and natural resources has
   increased, the need for sustainable resources management
   capacity-building has become critical in Nepal. This paper underscores
   environmental and natural resources capacity-building as an approach to
   achieving sustainable resource management and socio-economic

AB Differential cognitive performance across cultural contexts has been a
   standard result in comparative research. Here we discuss how societal
   changes occurring when a small-scale traditional community incorporates
   elements from industrialized society may contribute to cognitive
   development, and we illustrate this with an analysis of the cognitive
   performances and everyday activities of children from four communities
   representing a range of such incorporations. We discuss this research in
   relation to ontogenesis and sociogenesis and propose several processes
   or mechanisms that may account for cultural and cognitive change in the
   context of societal absorption of elements common in industrialized
   settings. Our perspective centers on the claim that changes in cultural
   features are inextricably linked to changes in human activity and
   cognition. We also suggest that changes that align small-scale
   traditional societies in this way provide certain cognitive advantages
   for individuals raised in, and continuing to live in, traditional
   societies, and such advantages show up in many cognitive measures. We
   also use this information in discussing explanations for the Flynn
   effect. We conclude with consideration of some implications of the
   perspective we offer. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Following on an article in Bennett Berger (1990), Authors of Their Own
   Lives, titled "From Socialism to Sociology," in which I and other
   sociologists describe how we came to sociology, I continue with my
   academic and public career as a sociologist at the University of
   California-Berkeley (1963-1969) and at Harvard subsequently, in the
   Graduate School of Education and the Sociology Department. I describe my
   involvement in the formulation of urban policy in the Kennedy and
   Johnson administrations and beyond, and my attempt to understand the
   student revolt at Berkeley, which spread throughout the United States
   and indeed much of the world. I further discuss my long involvement in
   the issue of affirmative action, on which I in time changed my views,
   originally based on a distinctive conception of the course of ethnicity
   and ethnic and racial groups in the United States, from critical
   opposition to acceptance, and my similar involvement in the debates over
   social policy in the United States, in which a complex point of view has
   too often been summarized under the term neoconservatism.

AB Instrumental variable (IV) methods provide a powerful but underutilized
   tool to address many common problems with observational sociological
   data. Key to their successful use is having IVs that are uncorrelated
   with an equation's disturbance and that are sufficiently strongly
   related to the problematic endogenous covariates. This review briefly
   defines IVs, summarizes their origins, and describes their use in
   multiple regression, simultaneous equation models, factor analysis,
   latent variable structural equation models, and limited dependent
   variable models. It defines and contrasts three methods of selecting
   IVs: auxiliary instrumental variable, model implied instrumental
   variable, and randomized instrumental variable. It provides
   overidentification tests and weak IV diagnostics as methods to evaluate
   the quality of IVs. I review the use of IVs in models that assume
   heterogeneous causal effects. Another section summarizes the use of IVs
   in contemporary sociological publications. The conclusion suggests ways
   to improve the use of IVs and suggests that there are many areas in
   which IVs could be profitably used in sociological research.

AB What is the relationship between social movements and electoral
   politics? Although the empirical reality of American politics has
   increasingly blurred the lines between activism and electoral politics,
   sociology has yet to explore these changes and provide theoretical and
   methodological tools to understand them. Focusing on the experience of
   young Americans, this review explores this relationship and outlines
   opportunities for future research. It is broken down into three
   sections. First, I review the main themes in the study of youth
   political participation in America. Second, using examples from the 2008
   election, the article examines recent increases in youth participation.
   Third and finally, this article discusses the case of the Obama
   campaign, its transition into the Democratic National Committee's
   Organizing for America, and aspects of the 2012 election to highlight
   the complex relationship between movements and electoral politics in
   America today. The paper concludes by highlighting opportunities for
   sociologists to bridge the connections between activism and electoral
   politics in new and meaningful ways.

AB Although explicit attention to the role of small groups has waned in
   sociology, an empirical understanding of the interaction order is
   increasing. A focus on the group-the meso-level of analysis-enriches
   both structural and interactional approaches, stressing shared and
   ongoing meaning. Groups constitute social order, just as groups are
   themselves constituted by that order. The examination of local action
   reveals how interaction orders emerge and create meanings that spread
   throughout a wider network. Despite the limits of a meso-level analysis
   in examining both external webs of constraint and immediate
   negotiations, this approach addresses identity, social capital,
   collective action, group culture, networks, and civil society. By
   building on collective identity, shared history, common spaces, and
   ongoing social relations, groups provide mechanisms through which
   individuals fit into larger structures and through which social
   structures shape individuals.

AB In this article, I review three contemporary streams of scholarship that
   are revitalizing the cultural analysis of religion, an approach that
   dates to the discipline's founding. Research from an institutional field
   perspective focuses on the institutions that shape religious belief,
   practice, and mobilization. Work on lived religion, including
   neo-Durkheimian approaches, focuses on religious experience and
   contested practices of sacralization. Scholarship on religious cultural
   tools and symbolic boundaries analyzes religion as symbolic
   legitimation. These three approaches avoid serious problems associated
   with both market and secularization accounts, in part because of the way
   they conceptualize religious authority and religious identity, and in
   part because of their broader scope of inquiry. In the conclusion, I
   combine the insights from these approaches to articulate a promising
   agenda for future research, offering a set of focus questions that are
   relevant to both classical and contemporary concerns about religion's
   role in modern societies.

AB Status has become an increasingly influential concept in the fields of
   organizational and economic sociology during the past two decades.
   Research in this area has not only helped explain behavior within and
   between organizations, but has also contributed to our understanding of
   status processes more generally. In this review, we point to the
   contributions of this field in terms of the determinants of status, the
   effects of status, and the mechanisms by which these effects are
   produced. We next appraise the way in which a network approach has
   contributed to our formal understanding of status positions and status
   hierarchies. We then highlight recent studies that demonstrate the value
   of studying the structures of status hierarchies themselves rather than
   focusing solely on the actors within them. After suggesting potential
   directions for future research, we conclude by calling for renewed
   efforts to translate concepts and theories across levels of analysis and
   substantive commitment in order to build more general theories of status
   processes.

AB Elites are those with vastly disproportionate control over or access to
   a resource. We can understand this as a position that a social actor
   occupies, or we can imagine such resources as a possession of an actor.
   The study of elites is the study of power and inequality, from above. It
   involves looking at the distribution of social resources, which can
   include economic, social, cultural, political, or knowledge capital. It
   also means exploring the role of institutions such as schools, families,
   and clubs in how such resources are organized and distributed. Over the
   past decade, particularly as social power and economic rewards have
   become increasingly concentrated in the hands of the few, elite
   sociology has experienced a revival. Empirical observations of these
   phenomena point to the changing character of American inequality.

   the impact of female labor supply on the likelihood of divorce with
   specific reference to the independence hypothesis. However, recent
   studies in sociology and economics provide more consistent evidence that
   the direction of causality may be the other way around. Women might
   increase their labor supply in the anticipation of divorce. We review
   the methodological developments in measuring economic independence and
   the recent evidence on its impact on divorce. Then we turn our attention
   to the alternative literature on the impact of divorce on female labor
   supply. We outline the theoretical arguments put forward by this
   literature, discuss the methodological issues in establishing causality,
   summarize the findings, and suggest avenues of further research.

AB Cities in the Southern United States have experienced dynamic economic
   and population growth over the past half-century, challenging existing
   paradigms of urban form, race relations, social movements, and
   immigration. This review shows how the timing of Southern
   urbanization-much later than in the Northeast and Midwest-has
   contributed to Southern cities' distinctive spatial patterns and
   political and economic structures. Southern cities were crucial to
   regional transformation, including the Civil Rights Movement and the end
   of one-party rule in the South. Moreover, Southern cities exemplify key
   trends of the contemporary political economy: a new relationship to
   regional industrialization, new forms of entrepreneurial governance,
   flexible labor markets, the importance of finance and producer services,
   and "new destination" immigration. I conclude by examining two Southern
   cities for their relevance to central themes in contemporary social
   research: Atlanta for the study of the African American experience and
   New Orleans for the sociology of catastrophe.

   during this period, the Vietnamese society conceptualized life course
   development as a process through which an individual gains political
   maturity, which means the learning and practicing of communist
   doctrines. As such, adolescence was viewed between 1975 and 1986 as a
   political stage that prepares youths to become mature communists.
   Adolescents, therefore, were portrayed as miniature communists with
   norms, attitudes and behaviors shaped by communist doctrines.
   Adolescence was not associated with problem behavior or sexual

   current study examines whether the specific effect of SAD on friendship
   quality is stable or varies across gender and ethnicity in a large

   of friendship quality differed slightly but significantly between men
   and women; as a result, effects of SAD were tested in men and women
   separately. After partially constraining friendship quality across
   ethnic groups, our results indicated that the relationship between SAD
   and friendship quality remained robust in all groups. In addition to
   replicating the finding that SAD specifically relates to perceived
   friendship quality, the current study highlights the need to test
   whether underlying constructs such as friendship quality are consistent

AB Psychological health and interpersonal functioning mutually influence

   functioning, resulting in smaller social networks, increased likelihood

   However, little is known about how relationships affect socially anxious
   individuals in return. We utilized a structured interview to assess how
   romantic relationships were perceived as influencing three aspects of
   psychological health (well-being, social anxiety and comfort in social
   situations) and whether these patterns differed as a function of social
   anxiety in an undergraduate sample. The perceived importance of several
   reasons for these effects, including those that could be characterized
   as both protective and harmful, was also assessed. Relationships were
   perceived as having contributed positively in each domain. However, when
   positive and negative reasons were examined separately, socially anxious
   individuals reported benefiting more from the positive reasons and being
   harmed more by negative reasons. Further, social anxiety was associated

AB To minimize the possibility of scrutiny, people with social anxiety
   difficulties exert great effort to manage their emotions, particularly
   during social interactions. We examined how the use of two emotion
   regulation strategies, emotion suppression and cognitive reappraisal,
   predict the generation of emotions and social events in daily life. Over
   14 consecutive days, 89 participants completed daily diary entries on
   emotions, positive and negative social events, and their regulation of
   emotions. Using multilevel modeling, we found that when people high in
   social anxiety relied more on positive emotion suppression, they
   reported fewer positive social events and less positive emotion on the
   subsequent day. In contrast, people low in social anxiety reported fewer
   negative social events on days subsequent to using cognitive reappraisal
   to reduce distress; the use of cognitive reappraisal did not influence
   the daily lives of people high in social anxiety. Our findings support
   theories of emotion regulation difficulties associated with social
   anxiety. In particular, for people high in social anxiety, maladaptive
   strategy use contributed to diminished reward responsiveness.

   modernization theory argues that while economic development harms the
   environment, the magnitude of the harmful link is likely to decrease
   through time. Treadmill of production theory posits that the association
   between environmental harms and development will remain constant or
   possibly increase in magnitude through time. To evaluate these competing
   propositions, interactions between economic development and time are
   used in analyses of three measures of CO2 emissions for 13 CEE nations
   during the 1992 to 2005 period. The results indicate that the magnitude
   of development's effect on all three outcomes increased through time,
   which supports the propositions of treadmill of production theory, while

AB This study explores the elusive social dimension of quantitative
   finance. We conducted three years of observations in the derivatives
   trading room of a major investment bank. We found that traders use
   models to translate stock prices into estimates of what their rivals
   think. Traders use these estimates to look out for possible errors in
   their own models. We found that this practice, reflexive modelling,
   enhances returns by turning prices into a vehicle for distributed
   cognition. But it also induces a dangerous form of cognitive
   interdependence: when enough traders overlook a key issue, their
   positions give misplaced reassurance to those traders that think
   similarly, disrupting their reflexive processes. In cases lacking
   diversity, dissonance thus gives way to resonance. Our analysis
   demonstrates how practices born in caution can lead to overconfidence
   and collective failure. We contribute to economic sociology by
   developing a socio-technical account that grapples with the new forms of
   sociality introduced by financial models - disembedded yet entangled;
   anonymous yet collective; impersonal yet, nevertheless, emphatically
   social.

AB Between 1999 and 2003, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (APIs) in
   the US experienced more rapid growth in the number of AIDS cases than
   any other racial or ethnic group. In addition, the prevalence of HBV and
   HIV co-infection is estimated to be significantly higher among APIs in
   the US than in other racial/ethnic groups. High rates of HIV and
   hepatitis B or C ( HBV and/or HCV) co-infection, in concert with
   language and cultural barriers, create significant challenges to
   effective coordination of treatment. The purpose of this study is to
   identify barriers to care and treatment in APIs with HIV with and
   without hepatitis co-infection. Specifically, we analyze results from
   semi-structured interviews with health care providers (N = 23) and Asian
   Americans who are HIV and hepatitis (HBV and/or HCV) co-infected (N =
   17) in order to clarify how stigma in particular may impede/limit access
   to coordinated health care provision. Providers and clients recognize
   the need for integrated, culturally and linguistically appropriate
   access to care while simultaneously acknowledging that stigma is a
   severe barrier to access to care. This article sheds light on the
   complexities of the stigma experienced by HIV and hepatitis co-infected
   Asian Americans and suggests a need for further research and renewed
   efforts by caregivers to reduce stigma in these communities.

AB Using population-based and family structural data from a high
   HIV-prevalence district of Southern India, this paper considers four
   suggested social scenarios used to explain the positive correlation
   between HIV prevalence and previously married status among Indian women:
   (1) infection from and then bereavement of an infected husband; (2)
   abandonment after husbands learn of their wives' HIV status; (3)
   economic instability after becoming previously married, leading women to
   seek financial support through male partners; and (4) the social status
   of being previously married exposing women to sexual harassment and
   predation. By also considering seroprevalence of two other common
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs), herpes and syphilis, in a
   combined variable with HIV, we limit the likelihood of the first two
   scenarios accounting for the greater part of this correlation. Through a
   nuanced analysis of household residences patterns (family structure),
   standard of living, and education, we also limit the probability that
   scenario three explains a greater portion of the correlation. Scenario
   four emerges as the most likely explanation for this correlation,
   recognizing that other scenarios are also possible. Further, the
   interdisciplinary literature on the social position of previously
   married women in India strongly supports the suggestion that, as a
   population, previously married women are sexually vulnerable in India.
   Previously married status as an STI risk factor requires further
   biosocial research and warrants concentrated public health attention.

   sociodemographic and risk behavior characteristics between black men who
   have sex with both men and women (MSMW) and those who have sex with men
   only (MSMO) and assess factors associated with having any unprotected
   vaginal and/or anal intercourse (UVAI) with women in the last 3 months.
   Data from 326 black men who reported recent unprotected anal intercourse
   with a man in an HIV behavioral intervention study in New York City were
   analyzed. Baseline characteristics were compared between MSMW and MSMO,
   and factors associated with having any UVAI in the past 3 months with
   women among MSMW were evaluated. In total, 26.8% reported having sex
   with both men and women in the last 3 months. MSMW were less likely to
   be HIV infected, use amyl nitrates, and have unprotected receptive anal
   sex with most recent male partner. MSMW were more likely to be over 40
   years old and use heroin. A total of 55.6% of MSMW reported having UVAI
   with women in the last 3 months. Compared to MSMW having only protected
   sex, MSMW having any UVAI with women were less likely to be HIV infected
   and to disclose having sex with men to female partners; they were more
   likely to have greater than four male sex partners in the last 3 months.
   In conclusion, HIV prevention interventions among black MSMW should
   directly address the risk of HIV transmission to both their female and
   male partners. Disclosure of bisexuality to female partners may be an
   important component of future prevention efforts.

AB Urban transgender women often experience several sociocultural
   co-factors which contribute to their risk of HIV infection. A
   transgender-specific HIV Prevention Case Management (PCM) intervention
   was implemented in a community HIV prevention setting and targeted
   reducing sex work and homelessness, increasing legal employment and
   income, and reducing psychological and emotional distress symptoms.
   Sixty high-risk transgender women were enrolled in the ten-session PCM
   intervention. Participants completed approximately nine out of the ten
   sessions (M = 8.7; SD = 2.6) and six-month follow-up evaluations were
   completed with 97% of the participants. Findings from baseline to
   follow-up evaluations demonstrated a decrease in homelessness (31.0% vs.
   10.3%, p < 0.01), less reliance on exchange sex as a primary source of
   income (41.4% vs. 22.4%, p < 0.05), and significant decreases in symptom
   complaints across multiple Brief Symptom Inventory sub-scales, including
   depression, hostility, phobic anxiety, and psychoticism (all significant
   at p < 0.05). Further, socioeconomic improvements following the
   intervention were significantly associated with psychological and
   emotional gains. The study suggests that adding a culturally appropriate
   PCM intervention in a community setting is beneficial in addressing
   co-factors for HIV infection as well as psychological and emotional
   distress symptoms among this extremely high-risk population.

AB The article provides an overview of methods that can be used to develop
   exposure scenarios for unique tribal natural resource usage patterns.
   Exposure scenarios are used to evaluate the degree of environmental
   contact experienced by people with different patterns of lifestyle
   activities, such as residence, recreation, or work. In 1994, U.S.
   President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12898 recognized that
   disproportionately high exposures could be incurred by people with
   traditional subsistence lifestyles because of their more intensive
   contact with natural resources. Since then, we have developed several
   tribal exposure scenarios that reflect tribal-specific traditional
   lifeways. These scenarios are not necessarily intended to capture
   contemporary resource patterns, but to describe how the resources were
   used before contamination or degradation, and will be used once again in
   fully traditional ways after cleanup and restoration. The direct
   exposure factors for inhalation and soil ingestion rates are the same in
   each tribal scenario, but the diets are unique to each tribe and its
   local ecology, natural foods, and traditional practices. Scenarios, in
   part or in whole, also have other applications, such as developing
   environmental standards, evaluating disproportionate exposures,
   developing sampling plans, planning for climate change, or evaluating
   service flows as part of natural resource damage assessments.

AB HIV/AIDS stigma can severely compromise the quality of life of people
   living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) by reducing access and quality of care,
   adherence to therapy, and disclosure of HIV status, thereby potentially
   increasing transmission. The objective of this study was to develop and
   psychometrically test three parallel scales measuring self, experienced,
   and perceived stigma among PLHA (n = 188) in Chennai, India. Exploratory
   factor analysis (EFA), which was used to facilitate item reduction and
   assess construct validity, confirmed the presence of three underlying
   theoretical domains. The final number of items and Cronbach's Alpha for
   each scale were: 8 items, Alpha of 0.84, for self stigma; 7 items, Alpha
   of 0.86, for experienced stigma; and 7 items, Alpha of 0.83, for
   perceived stigma. External validity was ascertained by confirming a
   significant positive association between the measure of each type of
   stigma and depression (measured using CES-D), using structural equation
   modeling (SEM). Therefore, scales were parsimonious, reliable, and were
   found to be valid measures of HIV/AIDS stigma. Using these validated
   scales, researchers can accurately collect data to inform the design of
   stigma reduction programs and interventions and enable subsequent
   evaluation of their effectiveness.

   studies, randomized trials of social interventions have not been
   reported. A representative sample of 120 elderly from Shanghai, China
   was randomized to four groups (Tai Chi, Walking, Social Interaction, No
   Intervention) for 40 weeks. Two MRIs were obtained, one before the
   intervention period, the other after. A neuropsychological battery was
   administered at baseline, 20 weeks, and 40 weeks. Comparison of changes
   in brain volumes in intervention groups with the No Intervention group
   were assessed by t-tests. Time-intervention group interactions for
   neuropsychological measures were evaluated with repeated-measures mixed
   models. Compared to the No Intervention group, significant increases in
   brain volume were seen in the Tai Chi and Social Intervention groups (p
   < 0.05). Improvements also were observed in several neuropsychological
   measures in the Tai Chi group, including the Mattis Dementia Rating
   Scale score (p=0.004), the Trailmaking Test A (p=0.002) and B
   (p=0.0002), the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (p=0.009), and verbal
   fluency for animals (p=0.01). The Social Interaction group showed
   improvement on some, but fewer neuropsychological indices. No
   differences were observed between the Walking and No Intervention
   groups. The findings differ from previous clinical trials in showing
   increases in brain volume and improvements in cognition with a largely
   non-aerobic exercise (Tai Chi). In addition, intellectual stimulation
   through social interaction was associated with increases in brain volume
   as well as with some cognitive improvements.

AB Durkheim's emphasis on the role of emotion in social life has been
   influential in the development of the sociology of emotions. Others have
   analyzed Durkheim's distinctly social conception of reason and
   rationality. However, the interconnections between "emotion" and
   "reason" in his thinking have seldom been directly and systematically
   addressed. These interconnections deserve further explication and
   development, particularly as they apply to the level of language and
   action-i.e., "practical reason"-in everyday life. Seeing the collective
   emotional basis of "social facts," in general, and "logic," "reason,"
   and the basic "categories of the understanding," in particular, opens up

   the species in Native Hawaiian communities. An accurate assessment of
   historical and modern sociocultural values and perceptions is needed to

   since the species is not universally well-regarded by ocean users. We
   conducted extensive archival research and oral history interviews to
   characterize past and current human-monk seal relationships in the
   Hawaiian archipelago. We report heterogeneity in both historical and
   contemporary cultural associations for monk seals, which appear to be
   related to place-specific histories and specific stakeholder groups. We
   introduce the concept of 'cultural endemism' to characterize this
   pattern of sociocultural heterogeneity, and discuss the relevance of
   shifting baselines, species recovery, and sociocultural information to
   conservation planning. We focus on participatory conservation planning
   approaches as being potentially useful in reducing human-wildlife
   conflicts and developing collaborative stewardship for better
   conservation success.

AB Background: A variety of approaches are available that provide cultural
   competency education for practicing physicians. There is, however, still
   a need for additional, innovative approaches that address continuing
   education and professional improvement regarding cultural competency for
   physicians after their training.
   Objective: To assess the potential impact on established clinicians of
   writing an extended case narrative on cultural competency.
   Methods: We conducted structured interviews of physician contributors (n
   = 14) to a book of cases on cultural competency. Authors were invited to
   contribute to the book based on their experiences as established
   clinicians, and previous expertise in cultural competency research or
   education was not required. Because of this, the editors employed a
   process in which they worked with contributors in a one-on-one manner to
   develop their case(s).
   Results: The participants were experienced physicians (all >10 years
   since medical school graduation), most of whom were white (64%) and
   affiliated with an academic medical center (86%). The majority of the
   contributors (1) reported that writing their case(s) increased their
   awareness of, and sensitivity to, issues of cultural competency; (2)
   indicated that the writing of their case(s) changed their approach to
   patient care and/or their education of medical students or graduate
   medical trainees; and (3) would recommend case writing as a vehicle for
   promoting cultural sensitivity and awareness.
   Conclusions: Although preliminary, these data suggest that the cultural
   awareness, sensitivity, and competence of established physicians might
   be enhanced by a process in which clinicians are facilitated in the
   writing of cases that address issues of culture that are pertinent to
   their practice and patient experiences.

AB The goals of this study were to (1) empirically assess the need for
   training in patient-centered culturally sensitive health care among
   medical students and (2) determine if training in such care needs to be
   customized to some degree based on individual or subgroup differences.
   Two hundred seventeen advanced (third- and fourth-year) medical students
   from 4 medical schools participated. Participants self-reported their
   current levels of engagement in patient-centered culturally sensitive
   health care using an online version of the Tucker-Culturally Sensitive
   Health Care Inventory Provider Form. Results indicated that
   participating advanced medical students gave self-ratings of engagement
   in patient-centered culturally sensitive health care that indicate high
   engagement in some but not all of the behaviors and attitudes that
   indicate this care. Additionally, their self-ratings differed in
   association with their gender, race/ethnicity, being fluent in a
   language other than English, and prior experience providing health care
   to racial/ethnic minority patients. Conclusions include that some
   medical students need training in patient-centered culturally sensitive
   health care, and this training ideally should be assessment-based and
   customized to address areas where there are low self-ratings of
   engagement in patient-centered culturally sensitive health care.

AB Background: Black-white disparities in mortality persist after
   adjustment for socioeconomic status and health behaviors. We examined
   whether allostatic load, the physiological profile influenced by
   repeated or chronic life stressors, is associated with black-white
   mortality disparities independent of traditional sociobehavioral risk
   factors.
   Methods: We studied 4515 blacks and whites aged 35 to 64 years from the
   third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994),
   using the linked mortality file, to ascertain participant deaths through
   2006. We estimated unadjusted sex-specific black-white disparities in
   cardiovascular/diabetes-related mortality and noninjury mortality. We
   constructed baseline allostatic load scores based on 10 biomarkers and
   examined attenuation of mortality disparities in 4 sets of
   sex-stratified multivariate models, sequentially adding risk factors:
   (1) age/clinical conditions, (2) socioeconomic status (SES) variables,
   (3) health behaviors, and (4) allostatic load.
   Results: Blacks had higher allostatic load scores than whites; for men,
   2.5 vs 2.1, p < .01; and women, 2.6 vs 1.9, p < .01. For
   cardiovascular/diabetes-related mortality among women, the magnitude of
   the disparity after adjustment for other risk factors (hazard ratio (HR)
   1.63; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-2.75) decreased after
   adjustment for allostatic load (HR, 1.15; 95% Cl, 0.70-1.88). For
   noninjury mortality among women, the magnitude of the disparity after
   adjustment for other risk factors (HR, 1.43; 95% Cl, 1.00-2.04) also
   decreased after adjustment for allostatic load (HR, 1.26; 95% CI,
   0.90-1.78). For men, disparities were attenuated but persisted after
   adjustment for allostatic load.
   Conclusions: Allostatic load burden partially explains higher mortality
   among blacks, independent of SES and health behaviors. These findings
   underscore the importance of chronic physiologic stressors as a negative
   influence on the health and lifespan of blacks in the United States.

AB Oral sex may be used as a form of harm reduction against HIV
   transmission. We compared characteristics of men who have sex with men
   (MSM) in Washington, DC having oral sex versus those having anal sex at
   last encounter. Data collected through National HIV Behavioral
   Surveillance in 2008 using venue-based sampling were used. Men >= 18
   years old disclosing MSM behavior in the past year were analyzed (n =
   500); OraQuick and Western Blot confirmation were used to assess HIV
   status. Multivariable methods were used for data analyses by type of sex
   at last encounter. A total of 71.8% of MSM had anal sex and 28.2%
   reported oral sex at last encounter. Men reporting oral sex were more
   likely to be white, older, insured, HIV-negative, unaware of last
   partner's HIV status, have a main partner, and not be HIV tested in the
   previous year. Significant demographic and behavioral differences exist
   between MSM reporting oral or anal sex; further studies should assess
   whether oral sex is being used as HIV prevention among MSM.

   article is devoted to four related assertions: (1) There has never been
   any agreement on the definition of culture, making cultural sociology a
   field unable to define its central concept. (2) The binary ignores the
   fact that the proper explanation of social behaviour requires both
   structure and culture; culture cannot be its own cause. (3) Cultural
   sociology is soft and sentimental, avoiding conflict as well as
   politics. (4) It neglects policy and policy-relevant research even more
   than the rest of sociology. Structural sociology has some shortcomings
   as well, however, and the culture-structure binary should be abandoned.

AB Novel methods, such as Internet-based interventions, are needed to
   combat the spread of HIV. While past initiatives have used the Internet
   to promote HIV prevention, the growing popularity, decreasing digital
   divide, and multi-functionality of social networking sites, such as
   Facebook, make this an ideal time to develop innovative ways to use
   online social networking sites to scale HIV prevention interventions
   among high-risk groups. The UCLA Harnessing Online Peer Education study
   is a longitudinal experimental study to evaluate the feasibility,
   acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of using social media for
   peer-led HIV prevention, specifically among African American and Latino
   Men who have Sex with Men (MSM). No curriculum currently exists to train
   peer leaders in delivering culturally aware HIV prevention messages
   using social media. Training was created that adapted the Community
   Popular Opinion Leader (C-POL) model, for use on social networking
   sites. Peer leaders are recruited who represent the target population
   and have experience with both social media and community outreach. The
   curriculum contains the following elements: discussion and role playing
   exercises to integrate basic knowledge of HIV/AIDS, awareness of
   sociocultural HIV/AIDS issues in the age of technology, and
   communication methods for training peer leaders in effective,
   interactive social media-based HIV prevention. Ethical issues related to
   Facebook and health interventions are integrated throughout the
   sessions. Training outcomes have been developed for long-term assessment
   of retention and efficacy. This is the first C-POL curriculum that has
   been adapted for use on social networking websites. Although this
   curriculum has been used to target African-American and Latino MSM, it
   has been created to allow generalization to other high-risk groups.

AB HIV care and treatment providers across sub-Saharan Africa are
   integrating livelihood interventions to improve food security of their
   clientele. Many integrated HIV and livelihood programmes (IHLPs) require
   the formation and use of groups of HIV-infected/affected individuals as
   the operational target for programme interventions, indeed, virtually
   without exception the group is the focal point for material and
   intellectual inputs of IHLPs. We sought to critically examine the group
   approach to programming among IHLPs in Uganda, and to explore and
   problematise the assumptions underpinning this model. A case study
   approach to studying 16 IHLPs was adopted. Each IHLP was treated as a
   case comprising multiple in-depth interviews conducted with staff along
   the livelihood programme chain. Additionally, in-depth interviews were
   conducted with staff from The AIDS Support Organization (TASO), and with
   members of 71 HIV-infected TASO-registered client households. Our
   analysis reveals three important considerations in IHLP programming
   regarding the group-centred approach: (1) Group membership is widely
   held to confer benefits in the form of psycho-social and motivational
   support, particularly in empowering individuals to access HIV services
   and handle stigma. This is contrasted with the problem of stigma
   inherent in joining groups defined by HIV-status; (2) Membership in
   groups can bring economic benefits through the pooling of labour and
   resources. These benefits however need to be set against the costs of
   membership, when members are required to make contributions in the form
   of money, goods or labour; (3) Sharing of goods and labour in the
   context of group membership allow members to access benefits which would
   otherwise be inaccessible. In exchange, individual choice and control
   are diminished and problems of resources held in common can arise. While
   the group model can bring benefits to IHLP efficiency and by extension
   to food security, and other outcomes, its application needs to be
   carefully scrutinised at the individual programme level, in terms of
   whether it is an appropriate approach, and in terms of mitigating
   potentially adverse effects.

AB This article presents detailed estimates of relative and absolute health
   inequalities among U. S. working-age adults by educational attainment,
   including six postsecondary schooling levels. We also estimate the
   impact of several sets of mediating variables on the education-health
   gradient. Data from the 1997-2009 National Health Interview Survey (N =
   178,103) show remarkable health differentials. For example, high school
   graduates have 3.5 times the odds of reporting "worse" health than do
   adults with professional or doctoral degrees. The probability of fair or
   poor health in mid-adulthood is less than 5 percent for adults with the
   highest levels of education but over 20 percent for adults without a
   high school diploma. The probability of reporting excellent health in
   the mid-forties is below 25 percent among high school graduates but over
   50 percent for those adults who have professional degrees. These health
   differences characterize all the demographic subgroups examined in this
   study. Our results show that economic indicators and health behaviors
   explain about 40 percent of the education-health relationship. In the
   United States, adults with the highest educational degrees enjoy a wide
   array of benefits, including much more favorable self-rated health,
   compared to their less-educated counterparts.

AB Arctic ecosystems are undergoing rapid changes as a result of global
   climate change, with significant implications for the livelihoods of
   Arctic peoples. In this paper, based on ethnographic research conducted
   with the Inupiaq communities of Noatak and Selawik in northwestern
   Alaska, we detail prominent environmental changes observed over the past
   twenty to thirty years and their impacts on subsistence-based
   lifestyles. However, we suggest that it is ultimately insufficient to
   try to understand how Arctic communities are experiencing and responding
   to climate change in isolation from other stressors. During interviews
   and participant observation documenting local observations of climatic
   and related environmental shifts and impacts to subsistence fishing
   practices, we find the inseparability of environmental, social,
   economic, cultural, and political realms for community residents. Many
   of our informants, who live in a mixed economy based on various forms of
   income and widespread subsistence harvesting of fish and game, perceive
   and experience climate change as embedded among numerous other factors
   affecting subsistence patterns and practices. Changing lifestyles,
   decreasing interest by younger generations in pursuing subsistence
   livelihoods, and economic challenges are greatly affecting contemporary
   subsistence patterns and practices in rural Alaska. Observations of
   climate change are perceived, experienced, and articulated to
   researchers through a broader lens of these linked lifestyle and
   cultural shifts. Therefore, we argue that to properly assess and
   understand the impacts of climate change on the subsistence practices in
   Arctic communities, we must also consider the total environment of
   change that is dramatically shaping the relationship between people,
   communities, and their surrounding environments.

AB Among U.S. and foreign-born Hispanic/Latino older adults living in the
   United States, associations of dietary acculturation and health outcomes
   have yielded no consistent findings. The purpose of this review was to
   present current knowledge and research disparities on acculturation,
   dietary intake, and health outcomes among the fastest growing minority
   group in the United States. Fifteen peer-reviewed studies that measured
   dietary acculturation among Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Dominican older
   adults living in the United States were identified and examined. This
   literature review divulged contradictory associations between dietary
   acculturation and dietary intake, along with nutritional and general
   health outcomes. Conclusive evidence has yet to be attained due to use
   of cross-sectional study designs and numerous acculturation measures as
   well as unique cultural and dietary patterns across diverse
   Hispanic/Latino populations. Further research is needed to ascertain
   dietary acculturation among U.S. and foreign-born Hispanic/Latino older
   adults in the United States and should strive to develop instruments
   that consider the social, economic, and political environments that
   influence the dietary acculturation process. Furthermore, longitudinal
   study designs and qualitative methodologies are warranted.

AB This article focuses on innovative methods for protecting privacy in
   research of Internet-mediated social contexts. Traditional methods for
   protecting privacy by hiding or anonymizing data no longer suffice in
   situations where social researchers need to design studies, manage data,
   and build research reports in increasingly public, archivable,
   searchable, and traceable spaces. In such research environments, there
   are few means of adequately disguising details about the venue and the
   persons being studied. One practical method of data representation in
   contexts in which privacy protection is unstable is fabrication,
   involving creative, bricolage-style transfiguration of original data
   into composite accounts or representational interactions. This article
   traces some of the historical trends that have restricted such creative
   ethical solutions; emphasizes a researcher's obligation to protect
   research participants' privacy in mediated research contexts; and offers
   an introductory framework for reconsidering how to make case-based
   decisions to better protect the interests of participants in situations
   where vulnerability or potential harm is not easily determined.

   cases helps illuminate the very diverse ways in which the growth of
   electronic networks partially transforms existing politico-economic
   orderings. They are extreme cases, one marked by hypermobility and the
   other by physical immobility. But they show us that each is only partly
   so: financial electronic networks are subject to particular types of
   embeddedness and local activist organizations can benefit from novel
   electronic potentials for global operation. Financial electronic
   networks and electronic activism not only reveal two parallel
   developments associated with particular technical properties of the new

AB Since World War II methods have advanced very quickly in sociology and
   social science, while this has not been the case with theory. In this
   article I suggest that one way of beginning to close the gap between the
   two is to focus on theorizing rather than on theory. The place where
   theorizing can be used in the most effective way, I suggest, is in the
   context of discovery. What needs to be discussed are especially ways for
   how to develop theory before hypotheses are formulated and tested. To be
   successful in this, we need to assign an independent place to theorizing
   and also to develop some basic rules for how to theorize. An attempt is
   made to formulate such rules; it is also argued that theorizing can only
   be successful if it is done in close unison with observation in what is
   called a prestudy. Theorizing has turned into a skill when it is
   iterative, draws on intuitive ways of thinking, and goes beyond the
   basic rules for theorizing.

   financial hardship on unprotected anal intercourse with a male sex
   partner of serodiscordant or unknown HIV status in the past 3 months
   among 1081 Latino and 1154 Black men who have sex with men (MSM; n =
   2235) residing in Los Angeles County, California; New York, New York;
   and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
   Methods. We administered HIV testing and a questionnaire assessing 6
   explanatory variables. We combined traditional mediation analysis with
   the results of a path analysis to simultaneously examine the direct,
   indirect, and total effects of these variables on the outcome variable.
   Results. Bivariate analysis showed that homophobia, racism, financial
   hardship, and lack of social support were associated with unprotected
   anal intercourse with a serodiscordant or sero-unknown partner. Path
   analysis determined that these relations were mediated by participation
   in risky sexual situations and lack of social support. However, paths
   between the explanatory variable and 2 mediating variables varied by
   participants' serostatus.
   Conclusions. Future prevention research and program designs should
   specifically address the differential impact of social discrimination
   and financial hardship on lack of social support and risky sexual
   situations among Latino and Black MSM. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We examined how different dimensions of social capital
   (i.e., family and friend connections, neighborhood and family cohesion,
   family conflict) were associated with smoking behavior among a
   nationally representative sample of Asian American men and whether the
   associations varied by ethnic group.
   Methods. The sample consisted of 998 adult Asian American men who
   participated in the National Latino and Asian American Survey from 2002
   to 2003. We conducted weighted multivariate logistic regressions on data
   for the sample and for each of 4 ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Vietnamese,
   Filipino, and Other).
   Results. Vietnamese American men had the highest prevalence of current
   smoking; Chinese American men, the lowest. After controlling for
   sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and perceived
   discrimination, neighborhood cohesion was inversely associated with
   smoking among Asian American men, and family and friend connections and
   family cohesion were not. An exception was family cohesion, which was
   associated with increased odds of smoking among Filipino American men.
   Conclusions. The relationship between social capital and smoking among
   Asian American men varied according to specific dimensions of social
   capital and was ethnicity specific. These findings highlight the need
   for smoking prevention and cessation interventions to take into
   consideration the heterogeneity that exists among Asian Americans. (Am J

AB There is increasing evidence that the Internet and social media can
   influence suicide-related behavior. Important questions are whether this
   influence poses a significant risk to the public and how public health
   approaches might be used to address the issue. To address these
   questions, we provide an overview of ways that social media can
   influence suicidal behavior, both negatively and positively, and we
   evaluate the evidence of the risk. We also discuss the legal
   complexities of this important topic and propose future directions for
   research and prevention programs based on a public health perspective.

AB Background: A quantifiable assessment of socioeconomic status and its
   bearing on clinical outcome in patients with diabetes is lacking. The
   social adaptability index (SAI) has previously been validated in the
   general population and in patients with chronic kidney disease,
   including those on dialysis and with kidney transplant. We hypothesize
   that SAI could be used in diabetes practice to identify a disadvantaged
   population at risk for inferior outcomes.
   Methods: The NHANES-3 database of patients who have diabetes was
   analyzed. The association of the SAI (calculated as the linear
   combination of indicators of education status, employment, income,
   marital status, and substance abuse) with patient survival was evaluated
   using Cox model.
   Results: The study population consisted of 1634 subjects with diabetes
   mellitus with mean age of 61.9 +/- 15.3 years; 40.9% males; 38.5% white,
   27.7% African American, and 31.3% Mexican American. The highest SAI was
   in whites (6.9 +/- 2.5), followed by Mexican Americans (6.5 +/- 2.3),
   and then African Americans (6.1 +/- 2.6) (ANOVA, P<.001). SAI was higher
   in subjects living in metropolitan areas (6.8 +/- 2.6) compared to the
   rural population (6.3 +/- 2.4) (T test, P<.001). Also, SAI was greater
   in males (7.1 +/- 2.4) than in females (6.1 2.4) (T test, P<.001). SAI
   had significant association with survival (hazard ratio 0.9, P<.001) in
   the entire study population and in most of the subgroups (divided by
   race, sex, and urban/rural location). Furthermore, SAI divided into
   tertiles (<= 5, 6 to 8, >8) demonstrated a significant and
   "dose-dependent" association with survival.
   Conclusion: Social adaptability index is associated with mortality in
   the diabetic population and is useful in identifying individuals who are
   at risk for inferior outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB The routing metric is the measure by which a routing protocol chooses
   paths between pairs of source and destination nodes in the network.
   Routing metric has a significant impact on the network resource
   utilization. The most well-known intradomain routing disciplines in
   today's Internet are the minimum hop count routing (e.g., Routing
   Information Protocol (RIP)) and the shortest path routing (e.g., Open
   Shortest Path First (OSPF) and intermediate system to system (IS-IS)).
   In the former case, the routing metric is the number of hops over the
   path and in the latter one, the metric is evaluated with respect to an
   additive link weight function. In this article, we study the impact of
   these two types of metrics on routing of bandwidth-sensitive traffic in
   the network. We first argue that the main characteristics of a
   bandwidth-sensitive routing problem can be captured elegantly through
   transforming the problem from the networking domain into the sociology
   area. This model reveals that the minimum hop count is indeed a dominant
   Individualist view of resource management in the Internet, whereas the
   shortest-path metric has a collectivist trend. We then propose a novel
   hybrid metric, which combines the benefit of both sociological systems.
   Through extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme yields
   much better results, with respect to the number of admitted requests and
   delay of paths, compared with other well-known counterparts.

AB Recent studies show that firms and workers benefit from the geographic
   concentration or spatial agglomeration of employment in a local labor
   market. While economic geographers have devoted considerable attention
   to the benefits firms receive from spatial agglomeration, the reasons
   workers may benefit in the form of higher wages are less clear. I draw
   from several theoretical perspectives in order to explain the
   relationship between spatial agglomeration and wages for U.S. biotech
   workers, including the new economic geography, new structuralism,
   organizational ecology, and the new economic sociology. Using the 1990
   PUMS-L, I employ a hierarchical linear model in order to test hypotheses
   from these perspectives. The results indicate that biotech workers
   benefit more from industrial than urban agglomeration, and these
   benefits are primarily due to the greater degree of organizational
   diversity in large industry clusters and urban labor markets.

AB A positive relationship between traditional cultures and biodiversity
   exists worldwide, but when traditional and formal conservation
   institutions coexist, how they interact and affect biodiversity remains
   poorly studied. From 2005 to 2007, we studied the relationship between
   Tibetan traditional practices and biodiversity. Specifically, how
   traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) and scientific ecological
   knowledge (SEK) affect local biodiversity by affecting people's
   attitudes and behaviors towards conservation. We interviewed 331
   villagers in nine Tibetan villages in Sichuan Province, China. We used
   proxy questions to measure the traditional practices, TEK, SEK,
   conservation attitudes and behaviors of village residents. Meanwhile, we
   assessed the bird diversity around the villages by stratified sampling
   and point counts. The results indicate traditional practices exhibited a
   strong positive correlation with TEK, but a negative correlation with
   formal education and SEK. The villagers with high traditional practices
   had more positive attitudes towards conservation and more actively
   participated in conservation than villagers with low traditional
   practices, and villagers with medium traditional practices were the
   least concerned about, or participated in, conservation activities. Bird
   species richness, abundance, and the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were
   positively correlated with the traditional practice index of each
   village. The results of a negative binomial regression showed the
   traditional practice index was a positive correlative factor of bird
   species richness, while formal education was not a significant variable,
   after controlling for other potential sampling and environment factors.
   Government-sponsored conservation education was somewhat successful in
   raising people's environmental awareness, but these efforts have yet to
   correlate with enhanced biodiversity measures. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB The Jamaica Bay portion of Gateway National Recreation Area, located
   next to highly urbanized New York City, faces many challenges to
   preserve and protect its natural, cultural, and recreational resources.
   To aid in the management of the park resources, detailed estuarine
   shoreline analyses of Jamaica Bay were undertaken using imagery taken in
   1951, 1974, and 2006. A 15-class land use/land cover (LULC)
   classification scheme was created after doing an initial examination of
   the types of LULC in the 2006 orthoimagery and then applied in the
   analyses of the previous years. By quantifying how and where the
   shoreline has changed over the past 60 years, park managers can better
   assess the impact of management practices by comparing LULC of the
   shoreline within the park boundary to the LULC of the shoreline outside
   the park boundary before and after the park was created in 1972. Despite
   the heavy development of New York City and the trend for shoreline
   modification, the overall shoreline of Jamaica Bay has maintained large
   percentages of undeveloped vegetation and sandy beaches. Much of the
   LULC change has occurred in the creeks as a result of dredging and shape
   modification for residential and commercial uses. Park management has
   been effective in limiting the alteration of undeveloped shoreline
   although there have been significant changes in the relative percentages
   of sand and vegetated beaches between 1974 and 2006.

AB This study describes HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI) and risk

   (FSWs) in four cities in Honduras. In 2006, 795 FSWs from Tegucigalpa,
   San Pedro Su la, La Ceiba and Comayagua were recruited using
   respondent-driven sampling (RDS) and tested for HIV prevalence and STI.
   HIV prevalence ranged from no infections in Comayagua to 5.4% in
   Tegucigalpa. With the exception of Comayagua, more than 20% of FSWs were
   infected with M. genitalium. M. genitalium in the aggregated cities was
   associated with HIV positivity, being aged <= 30 years old, drinking
   alcohol more than once weekly and always using condoms with regular
   clients in the past month. In comparison with a 2001 surveillance study
   we found lower rates of HIV infection. Interventions for HIV control and
   prevention among FSWs, including promotion of condom use, are needed in
   Honduras.

AB Previous research has found that infants respond with more
   negative/protest as well as approach-type behaviors in response to the
   loss of maternal attention to a social-rival as compared to a non-social
   item. The purpose of the current research was to conceptually replicate
   the maternal inattention research with a different population and to
   extend on it by examining the relationships between infants' emotional
   responses and their temperament and physiology (brain activity). A
   baseline measure of infant EEG was collected after which mother infant
   dyads (n = 30) participated in two mother-ignoring conditions. Infants
   demonstrated more approach-style responses (maternal-directed gaze,
   proximity, and touch), higher reactivity levels (increased arousal,
   aggression, and disorganization), and more negative affect in the
   social-rival relative to the nonsocial condition. Approach-style
   (jealousy) responses were predictive of the infants' greater left
   frontal baseline EEG activity. Matemal reports of an infant's
   temperamental sociability and approach were not related to frontal EEG
   but several temperamental characteristics were associated with approach
   style responses during the social-rival condition. These findings
   collectively point to the emotion of jealousy in infants, as only during
   the social rival condition were associations between approach style
   responses and negative affect as well as left frontal EEG activity
   uncovered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB During conversation, interactants draw on their shared communicative
   context and history ("common ground") to help decide what to say next,
   tailoring utterances based on their knowledge of what the listener
   knows. The use of common ground draws on an understanding of the
   thoughts and feelings of others to create and update a model of what is
   known by the other person, employing cognitive processes such as theory
   of mind. We tested the hypothesis that the ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex (vmPFC), a neural region involved in processing and interpreting
   social and emotional information, would be critical for the development
   and use of common ground. We studied seven patients with bilateral vmPFC
   damage and seven age-, sex-, and education-matched healthy comparison
   participants, each interacting with a familiar partner. Across 24
   trials, participants verbally directed their partners how to arrange a
   set of 12 abstract tangram cards. Our hypothesis was not supported: the
   vmPFC and healthy comparison groups showed similar development and use
   of common ground, evident in reduction in time and words used to
   describe the cards, similar increases in the use of definite references
   (e.g., the horse), and comparable use of verbal play (playful language)
   in their interactions. These results argue against the idea that the
   vmPFC is critical for the development and use of common ground in social
   interaction. We propose that a cognitive and neuroanatomical bifurcation
   in theory of mind processes may explain this outcome. The vmPFC may be
   important for affective theory of mind (the ability to understand
   another's feelings); however, the development and use of common ground
   in social interaction may place higher demands on the ability to
   understand another's knowledge, or cognitive theory of mind, which may
   not require the vmPFC. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Variation in height and body proportions is relatively well-understood
   at the inter-population level, but less is known about intra-population
   variation. This study explores intra-population variation in body
   proportions among 172 (88 female; 84 male) adult rural Amazonians. We
   test the hypotheses that: (1) stunting is associated with changes in
   proportions and fatness; (2) the sexes express different proportions in
   response to similar environmental stress; and (3) female growth is
   negatively affected by the costs of reproduction. We examined height,
   sitting height, and total leg length in subsamples based on sex and
   nutritional status (stunted/nonstunted) in relation to biocultural
   factors including access to food and healthcare and female reproductive
   history parameters. Differences in proportions were examined using the
   Quick-Test (Tsutakawa and Hewett: Biometrics 33 (1977) 215219);
   correlation analyses were used to detect associations between
   anthropometric data and body fatness, and female reproductive history
   parameters. We found significantly higher rates of stunting among
   females (X(2) = 5.31; P = 0.02; RR = 1.4). Stunted individuals exhibited
   relatively shorter legs than nonstunted individuals (P = 0.02), although
   this was not found in within-sex analyses. A significant negative
   correlation was found between leg length index and fatness (P < 0.01).
   Lastly, females exhibited relatively shorter legs than males (P =
   0.0003) and, among females, height and leg length were significantly
   positively correlated with age-at-first-birth (P < 0.02) suggesting that
   adolescent pregnancy may negatively affect growth in this population.
   Our findings provide insights for the study of intra-population
   variation in body proportions and highlight the importance of
   biocultural data in interpreting the pattern of variation observed in
   living and past populations. Am J Phys Anthropol 147: 113-127, 2012. (C)

   Maryland and Seattle, Washington areas during 2005-2008.
   Method. Walkability, access to parks and recreation facilities and
   moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) minutes per week
   (min/week) were measured objectively. Neighborhood aesthetics, walking
   facilities, social support, self-efficacy, barriers and transportation
   and leisure walking min/week were self-reported.
   Results. Walkability interacted with social support in explaining total
   MVPA (B=13.71) and with social support (B=7.90), self-efficacy.(B=7.66)
   and barriers (B=-8.26) in explaining walking for transportation.
   Aesthetics interacted with barriers in explaining total MVPA (B=-12.20)
   and walking facilities interacted with self-efficacy in explaining
   walking for leisure (B = -10.88; Ps<.05). Summarizing across the
   interactions, living in a supportive environment (vs. unsupportive) was
   related to 30-59 more min/week of physical activity for participants
   with more positive psychosocial attributes, but only 0-28 more min/week
   for participants with less positive psychosocial attributes.
   Conclusion. Results supported synergistic interactions between built

   among older adults. Findings suggest multilevel interventions may be
   most effective in increasing physical activity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB Background: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and highly
   aggressive form of primary breast cancer. Little is known about the risk
   factors for IBC, specifically the association with socioeconomic
   position (SEP).
   Methods: The association between breast cancer type (IBC vs. non-IBC)
   with county-level SEP in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
   database for cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2007 was examined.
   County-level SEP characteristics included metropolitan versus
   non-metropolitan residence, percentage below the poverty level,
   percentage less than high-school graduate, and an index combining the
   poverty and high-school variables. IBC and non-IBC age-adjusted
   incidence rates were calculated, stratified on SEP and race/ethnicity.
   The odds of IBC versus non-IBC given a particular SEP characteristic,
   adjusting for age and race/ethnicity, was examined through fitting of
   hierarchical logistic regression models (HLM).
   Results: Incidence rates for IBC generally increased as SEP decreased,
   whereas the opposite was found for non-IBC. HLM results showed that low
   SEP is associated with higher odds of IBC: highest (>= 20%) versus
   lowest (<10%) persons below the poverty level [OR (95% confidence
   interval, CI) 1.25 (1.09-1.43)]; highest (>28.76%) versus lowest (<=
   15.99%) persons less than high-school graduate [OR (95% CI) = 1.25
   (1.10-1.42)]; and low SEP as measured by poverty-high school index
   versus high SEP [OR (95% CI) = 1.26 (1.11-1.44)].
   Conclusion: Overall breast cancer has been found to be positively
   associated with SEP, whereas in this analysis, IBC was associated with
   decreasing SEP.
   Impact: Studies focused on understanding the disparity in IBC incidence,
   as well as interventions to eliminate these differences are needed.

AB The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the
   existing literature on the incidence of hypertrophic scarring and the
   psychosocial impact of burn scars. In a comprehensive literature review,
   the authors identified 48 articles published since 1965 and written in
   English which reported the incidence and risk factors for hypertrophic
   scarring or assessed outcomes related to scarring. Most studies had
   important methodological limitations limiting the generalizability of
   the findings. In particular, the absence of standardized valid measures
   of scarring and other outcome variables was a major barrier to drawing
   strong conclusions. Among studies on hypertrophic scarring, the
   prevalence rate varied between 32 and 72%. Identified risk factors
   included dark skin, female gender, young age, burn site on neck and
   upper limb, multiple surgical procedures, meshed skin graph, time to
   healing, and burn severity. With regard to psychosocial outcomes, two
   studies compared pediatric burn survivors with a nonburn comparison
   group on a body image measure; neither study found differences between
   groups. Across studies, burn severity and location had a modest
   relationship with psychosocial outcome variables. Psychosocial variables
   such as social comfort and perceived stigmatization were more highly
   associated with body image than burn characteristics. To advance our
   knowledge of the epidemiology of scars and the burden of scars, future
   studies need to implement more rigorous methodologies. In particular,
   standardized valid measures of scarring and other outcomes should be
   developed. This process could be facilitated by an international
   collaboration among burn centers. (J Burn Care Res 2012;33:136-146)

AB Objective: To explore geographic differences in diagnosed emotional and
   behavioral mental health conditions and receipt of treatment. Methods:
   Data are from the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health, a
   nationally representative, parent-reported, cross-sectional survey.
   Pediatric mental health conditions were identified using parents'
   responses to 3 questions regarding whether a health care provider had
   ever told them that their child had depression, anxiety problems, or
   behavioral or conduct problems. Parents also reported on past-year
   treatment or counseling by a mental health professional. State-level
   differences in condition prevalence were identified using unadjusted and
   adjusted prevalence estimates. Multivariate logistic regression assessed
   the odds of not receiving treatment by state and diagnoses. Results:
   Nearly 8% of children aged 6 to 17 years have ever been diagnosed with
   depression or anxiety, and 5.4% have ever been diagnosed with behavioral
   or conduct problems. State-level estimates of parent-reported depression
   or anxiety varied from 4.8% in Georgia to 14.4% in Vermont, while
   prevalence of behavioral problems ranged from 3.2% in California to 9.2%
   in Louisiana. Nearly 10% of all school-aged children and 53.1% of those
   ever diagnosed with either condition type received past-year treatment.
   The odds of receiving past-year parent-reported treatment did not differ
   by state of residence with the exception of Louisiana and Nevada:
   children ever diagnosed had approximately 2.5 times the odds of not
   receiving past-year treatment in these states. Conclusion: The
   prevalence of parent-reported mental health disorders among children
   varies by geographic and sociodemographic factors, while receipt of
   treatment is generally dependent on sociodemographic and health-related
   factors.

   role of socioeconomic status (SE) as a moderator of the effects of
   discrimination on the diurnal decline was also considered for each
   group. In support of the idea that perceptions of unfair treatment take
   on a unique meaning for stigmatized minority groups, results suggest
   that perceived discrimination is associated with a flatter (less
   healthy) diurnal slope among Whites but a steeper (more healthy) diurnal
   slope among African Americans. Perceived discrimination was also found
   to be more strongly associated with a steepening of the diurnal slope
   among lower SES African Americans than higher SES African Americans. (C)

AB Background: Children with prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) have
   significant social skills deficits and are often treated in community
   mental health settings. However, it remains unclear whether these
   children can be effectively treated using manualized, evidence-based
   interventions that have been designed for more general mental health
   populations.
   Methods: To shed light on this issue, the effectiveness of Children's
   Friendship Training (CFT) versus Standard of Care (SOC) was assessed for
   85 children ages 6 to 12 years with and without PAE in a community
   mental health center.
   Results: Children participating in CFT showed significantly improved
   knowledge of appropriate social skills, improved self-concept, and
   improvements in parent-reported social skills compared to children in
   the SOC condition. Moreover, results revealed that within the CFT
   condition, children with PAE performed as well as children without PAE.
   Findings indicated that CFT, an evidence-based social skills
   intervention, yielded greater gains than a community SOC social skills
   intervention and was equally effective for children with PAE as for
   those without PAE.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that children with PAE can benefit from
   treatments initiated in community settings in which therapists are
   trained to understand their unique developmental needs, and that they
   can be successfully integrated into treatment protocols that include
   children without PAE.

   Transgender adults who are stably housed and participated in a telephone

   approaches to monitor transgender health, including adding transgender

AB Objectives. We evaluated the association of household-level stressors
   with depressive symptoms among low-wage nursing home employees.
   Methods. Data were collected in 2006 and 2007 from 452 multiethnic
   primary and nonprimary wage earners in 4 facilities in Massachusetts. We
   used logistic regression to estimate the association of depressive
   symptoms with household financial strain, food insufficiency, and
   work-family spillover (preoccupation with work-related concerns while at
   home and vice versa).
   Results. Depressive symptoms were significantly associated with
   household financial strain (odds ratio [OR]=1.82; 95% confidence
   interval [CI]=1.03, 3.21) and food insufficiency (OR=2.10; 95% CI=1.10,
   4.18). Among primary earners, stratified analyses showed that food
   insufficiency was associated with depressive symptoms (OR=3.60; 95%
   CI=1.42, 9.11) but financial strain was not. Among nonprimary wage
   earners, depressive symptoms correlated with financial strain (OR=3.65;
   95% CI=1.48, 9.01) and work-family spillover (OR=3.22; 95% CI=1.11,
   9.35).
   Conclusions. Household financial strain, food insufficiency, and
   work-family spillover are pervasive problems for working populations,
   but associations vary by primary wage earner status. The prevalence of
   food insufficiency among full-time employees was striking and might have
   a detrimental influence on depressive symptoms and the health of
   working-class families. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:126-133.

AB Objectives. We assessed the impact of social determinants of potential
   exposure to H1N1 - which are unequally distributed by race/ethnicity in
   the United States on - incidence of influenza-like illness (ILI) during
   the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
   Methods. In January 2010 we surveyed a nationally representative sample
   (n = 2079) of US adults from the Knowledge Networks online research
   panel, with Hispanic and African American oversamples. The completion
   rate was 56%.
   Results. Path analysis examining ILI incidence, race, and social
   determinants of potential exposure to H1N1 demonstrated that higher ILI
   incidence was related to workplace policies, such as lack of access to
   sick leave, and structural factors, such as number of children in the
   household. Hispanic ethnicity was related to a greater risk of ILI
   attributable to these social determinants, even after we controlled for
   income and education.
   Conclusions. The absence of certain workplace policies, such as paid
   sick leave, confers a population-attributable risk of 5 million
   additional cases of ILI in the general population and 1.2 million cases
   among Hispanics. Federal mandates for sick leave could have significant
   health impacts by reducing morbidity from ILI, especially in Hispanics.

AB Objectives. We examined interconnections among runaway and homeless
   youths (RHYs) and how aggregated network structure position was
   associated with HIV risk in this population.
   Methods. We collected individual and social network data from 136 RHYs.
   On the basis of these data, we generated a sociomatrix, accomplished
   network visualization with a "spring embedder," and examined k-cores. We
   used multivariate logistic regression models to assess associations
   between peripheral and non-peripheral network position and recent
   unprotected sexual intercourse.
   Results. Small numbers of nominations at the individual level aggregated
   into a large social network with a visible core, periphery, and small
   clusters. Female youths were more likely to be in the core, as were
   youths who had been homeless for 2 years or more. Youths at the
   periphery were less likely to report unprotected intercourse and had
   been homeless for a shorter duration.
   Conclusions. HIV risk was a function of risk-taking youths' connections
   with one another and was associated with position in the overall network
   structure. Social network based prevention programs, young women's
   housing and health programs, and housing-first programs for peripheral
   youths could be effective strategies for preventing HIV among this
   population. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102: 141-147.

AB There is much evidence that humans, as other species, are affected by
   social information when making mate-choice decisions. Witnessing a rival
   show interest in a member of the opposite sex tends to lead human
   observers of both sexes to thereafter rate that person as more appealing
   as a potential mate. However, how this occurs is not well understood. We
   investigate whether this effect is specific to the individual witnessed
   or will generalize to other potential mates with shared
   characteristics-that is, whether humans exhibit trait-based or just
   individual-based mate-choice copying. We found that whereas this kind of
   generalization did occur with some traits, it appeared to depend on age,
   and conspicuously, it did not occur with (inner) facial traits. We
   discuss possible explanations for the age specificity and cue
   specificity in terms of informational benefits and how people attend to
   unfamiliar faces.

AB Purpose of review
   Neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve is increasingly
   utilized in thyroid and parathyroid surgery. Many studies have examined
   this practice with respect to rates of nerve injury. We have reviewed
   this literature with specific focus on ethical and medicolegal issues.
   Recent findings
   The preponderance of data fail to show that neuromonitoring
   significantly reduces the rates of nerve injury in thyroid and
   parathyroid surgery. However, potential benefits can nevertheless be
   identified for patients in predicting nerve injuries and reducing risks
   of bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. The primary ethical and
   medicolegal issues raised by neuromonitoring relate to setting high
   expectations of unproven benefit and not utilizing the technology to
   gain the most information for patient care decision making.
   Summary
   Neuromonitoring can provide valuable information to surgeons about the
   functioning of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and external branch of the
   superior laryngeal nerve. Surgeons should follow guidelines for optimal
   use of neuromonitoring but should not overestimate the benefits of
   neuromonitoring when discussing the technology with patients.

AB Background Research shows that unemployment reduces access to health
   care and vaccines and increases financial difficulty, family conflict,
   and other sources of stress that are known to suppress immune function.
   In addition, seasonal unemployment rates parallel seasonal influenza
   activity. Following a theory that argues that macroeconomic conditions
   affect population health, this paper examines whether there is an
   association between monthly unemployment rates and influenza activity.
   Methods Data from influenza activity surveillance reports from the
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are combined with information
   from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on state-level unemployment rates in
   the U. S. for the flu seasons between 1999 and 2010. Pooled time-series
   cross-section logistic regression analyses are conducted to examine the
   effect of the unemployment rate on the likelihood of widespread and/or
   regional influenza activity in the 48 contiguous states throughout this
   period. A total of 3712 state-month observations are examined.
   Results Net of other factors included in the multivariate regression
   analysis, a one-percentage-point increment in the unemployment rate is
   associated with between a 7.1% and 37.0% increment in the odds of
   widespread influenza (Odds ratio = 1.21). Likewise, a
   one-percentage-point increment in the unemployment rate is associated
   with between a 17.1% and 44.7% increment in the odds of at least
   regional influenza (Odds ratio = 1.30). Results hold regardless of
   whether time-varying state-level characteristics are included.
   Conclusions Higher state-level unemployment increases the likelihood of
   regional and widespread influenza activity.

AB Son preference has been considered as a determinant of women's risk of
   intimate partner violence (IPV) experience in India, although
   quantitative evidence from large nationally representative studies
   testing this relationship is limited. This study examines the
   association between husband's son preference, sex composition of
   children and risk of physical and sexual IPV victimization among wives.
   Information was collected for 26,284 couples in the nationally
   representative 2005-2006 National Family Health Survey of India. The
   exposures were husband's son preference measured as husband's desire for
   one or more sons greater than the number of daughters and sex
   composition of the household: only sons, only daughters and mixed.
   Outcome included past year physical and/or sexual IPV. The results
   showed that husband's reported son preference (RR: 1.05; 95% CI:
   0.98-1.13) and sex composition of children were not associated with risk
   for IPV victimization in the models adjusted for socio-demographic
   factors. The findings from this first population-based study of
   socio-cultural norms around son preference and married Indian women's
   risk for IPV victimization indicate that cultural preference for sons
   does not influence women's risk for IPV victimization.

AB The clinical implications of the term narcissism are a matter of
   continuous debate. This article critically examines pertinent literature
   of the last 12 years using a set of validators and attempting to
   identify narcissism as a trait, a domain, a dimension, or a personality
   disorder/type. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)-specific
   literature (particularly in epidemiological, developmental, and
   laboratory-testing areas) is scarce when compared with other personality
   disorders. A tendency to ideologically dominated clinical reports is
   observed with individual cases or small samples of nonclinical
   populations. Clinical descriptions of the condition vary within a wide
   range of descriptors, superficial or ambiguous conceptualizations,
   different sub-types, and inconclusive meta-analytical findings.
   Comorbidity with many Axes I and II conditions and the presence of
   narcissistic behavioral and emotional manifestations in other DSM
   conditions were frequent findings. The reintroduction of NPD in the
   personality disorders DSM-5 proposal seems to be related to nonclinical
   or heuristic considerations. It is concluded that NPD as such shows
   nosological inconsistency and that its consideration as a trait domain
   with needed further research would be strongly beneficial to the field.

AB Exposure to Western popular culture is hypothesized to increase risk for
   eating disorders. This study tests this hypothesis with respect to the
   proposed diagnosis of Binge Eating Disorder (BED) in an epidemiological
   sample of people of Mexican origin in Mexico and the US. Data come from
   the Mexico National Comorbidity Survey, National Comorbidity Survey
   Replication, and National Latino and Asian American Survey (N = 2268).
   Diagnoses were assessed with the WMH-CIDI. Six groups were compared:
   Mexicans with no migrant family members, Mexicans with at least one
   migrant family member, Mexican return-migrants, Mexican-born migrants in
   the US, and two successive generations of Mexican-Americans in the US.
   The lifetime prevalence of BED was 1.6% in Mexico and 2.2% among
   Mexican-Americans. Compared with Mexicans in families with migrants,
   risk for BED was higher in US-born Mexican-Americans with two US-born
   parents (aHR = 2.58, 95% CI 1.12-5.93). This effect was attenuated by
   24% (aHR = 1.97, 95% CI 0.84-4.62) with adjustment for prior-onset
   depressive or anxiety disorder. Adjustment for prior-onset conduct
   disorder increased the magnitude of association (aHR = 2.75, 95% CI
   1.22-6.20). A similar pattern was observed for binge eating. Among
   respondents reporting binge eating, onset in the US (vs. Mexico) was not
   associated with prevalence of further eating disorder symptoms.
   Migration from Mexico to the US is associated with an increased risk for
   BED that may be partially attributable to non-specific influences on
   internalizing disorders. Among respondents reporting binge eating in
   either country, similar levels of further symptoms were endorsed,
   suggesting some cross-cultural generalizability of criteria. (C) 2011

AB The authors explore the challenges inherent in traversing the multiple
   boundaries between sociology and social work, and the academy and the
   community, by examining a service learning course on hunger and
   homelessness taught by two sociology professors and two social workers
   on the staff of a community service organization. The authors draw on
   instructional team meetings and correspondence, observation of class
   sessions, and formal and informal course evaluations to analyze three
   "moments": the planning process, a pivotal class session, and students'
   final presentations. They found that both their teaching and students'
   learning were enriched by disciplinary differences in knowledge claims,
   the design and utility of qualitative research, and the process of
   drawing conclusions from, and making arguments using, qualitative data.
   The authors conclude that experiential learning has value beyond
   providing students hands-on experiences. It can also provide a
   laboratory in which students and instructors can explore the
   similarities and differences between sociology, social work, and other
   disciplines.

AB This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be
   through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a
   three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination
   despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department.
   In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into
   racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into
   institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and
   their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the
   phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not
   to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the
   authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to
   learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the
   classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting
   students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for
   related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public
   sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the
   traditional classroom environment.

   learning outcomes continues as an elusive endeavor fraught with

   student learning assessment plan for the University of Wyoming's Chicano
   Studies Program. An initial program assessment facilitated the
   development of a faculty agreed-upon mission, goals, and learning
   outcomes. A summative course embedded assessment strategy provides
   direct evidence for determining student learning achievement. Student
   exit interviews provide additional evidence suggesting that Chicana/o
   Studies curricula help in cultivating a critical cultural thinking
   framework oriented toward social justice and activism. Current
   anti-immigrant and anti-Latina/o sentiments provide the context for a

   students' quiz and exam scores, students learn the basics of
   interpreting regression analyses in a manner that is relevant to their

AB Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is poorly understood in patients
   with chronic kidney disease (CKD) prior to end-stage renal disease. The
   association between psychosocial measures and HRQOL has not been fully
   explored in CKD, especially in African Americans. We performed a
   cross-sectional analysis of HRQOL and its association with
   sociodemographic and psychosocial factors in African Americans with
   hypertensive CKD. There were 639 participants in the African American
   Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension Cohort Study. The Short Form-36
   was used to measure HRQOL. The Diener Satisfaction with Life Scale
   measured life satisfaction, the Beck Depression Inventory-II assessed
   depression, the Coping Skills Inventory-Short Form measured coping, and
   the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-16 was used to measure social
   support. The mean participant age was 60 years at enrollment, and men
   comprised 61% of participants. Forty-two percent reported a house-hold
   income less than $15,000/year. Higher levels of social support, coping
   skills, and life satisfaction were associated with higher HRQOL, whereas
   unemployment and depression were associated with lower HRQOL (P < 0.05).
   A significant positive association between higher estimated glomerular
   filtration rate (eGFR) was observed with the Physical Health Composite
   (PHC) score (P = 0.004) but not in the Mental Health Composite (MHC)
   score (P = 0.24). Unemployment was associated with lower HRQOL, and
   lower eGFR was associated with lower PHC. African Americans with
   hypertensive CKD with better social support and coping skills had higher
   HRQOL. This study demonstrates an association between CKD and low HRQOL,
   and it highlights the need for longitudinal studies to examine this
   association in the future. (Translational Research 2012;159:4-11)

AB This study examined factors that influence mammography use and breast
   cancer detection, including education, health insurance, and
   acculturation, among Mexican-American (MA) and African-American (AA)
   women.
   The study included 670 breast cancer cases (388 MAs and 282 AAs), aged
   40-86 years at diagnosis. Data on mammography use, detection, and delay
   in seeking care were collected via questionnaires and medical records.
   Using a language-based bidimensional acculturation measure, MAs were
   classified as English-dominant (n = 67), bilingual (n = 173), and
   Spanish-dominant (n = 148). Mammography prior to diagnosis was assessed
   by racial/ethnic acculturation subgroup using logistic regression.
   In age-adjusted models, mammography use was non-significantly lower
   among English-dominant (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.45-1.59) and bilingual (OR
   = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.55-1.35) MAs and significantly lower among
   Spanish-dominant MAs (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.83) than among AA women.
   After adjustment for education or insurance, there was no difference in
   mammography use by race/ethnicity and acculturation subgroup. Despite
   high self-reported mammography use (75%), a large proportion of cases
   reported self-detection (59%) and delay in seeking care > 90 days (17%).
   These findings favor promoting culturally appropriate messaging about
   the benefits and limitations of mammography, education about breast
   awareness, and prompt reporting of findings to a health professional.

AB A leading hypothesis to explain the social dysfunction in people with
   autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is that they exhibit a deficit in reward
   processing and motivation specific to social stimuli. However, there
   have been few direct tests of this hypothesis to date. Here we used an
   instrumental reward learning task that contrasted learning with social
   rewards (pictures of positive and negative faces) against learning with
   monetary reward (winning and losing money). The two tasks were
   structurally identical except for the type of reward, permitting direct
   comparisons. We tested 10 high functioning people with ASD (7M, 3F) and
   10 healthy controls who were matched on gender, age, and education. We
   found no significant differences between the two groups in terms of
   overall ability behaviorally to discriminate positive from negative slot
   machines, reaction-times, and valence ratings, However, there was a
   specific impairment in the ASD group in learning to choose social
   rewards, compared to monetary rewards: they had a significantly lower
   cumulative number of choices of the most rewarding social slot machine,
   and had a significantly slower initial learning rate for the socially
   rewarding slot machine, compared to the controls. The findings show a
   deficit in reward learning in ASD that is greater for social rewards
   than for monetary rewards, and support the hypothesis of a
   disproportionate impairment in social reward processing in ASD.

AB Deception is an essentially social act, yet little is known about how
   social consequences affect the decision to deceive. In this study,
   participants played a computerized game of deception without constraints
   on whether or when to attempt to deceive their opponent. Participants
   were questioned by an opponent outside the scanner about their knowledge
   of the content of a display. Importantly, questions were posed so that,
   in some conditions, it was possible to be deceptive, while in other
   conditions it was not. To simulate a realistic interaction, participants
   could be confronted about their claims by the opponent. This design,
   therefore, creates a context in which a deceptive participant runs the
   risk of being punished if their deception is detected. Our results show
   that participants were slower to give honest than to give deceptive
   responses when they knew more about the display and could use this
   knowledge for their own benefit. The condition in which confrontation
   was not possible was associated with increased activity in subgenual
   anterior cingulate cortex. The processing of a question which allows a
   deceptive response was associated with activation in right caudate and
   inferior frontal gyrus. Our findings suggest the decision to deceive is
   affected by the potential risk of social confrontation rather than the
   claim itself.

AB Sensory and social inputs interact with underlying gene suites to
   coordinate social behavior. Here we use a naturally complex system in
   sexual selection studies, the swordtail, to explore how genes associated
   with mate preference, receptivity, and social affiliation interact in
   the female brain under specific social conditions. We focused on 11
   genes associated with mate preference in this species (neuroserpin,
   neuroligin-3, NMDA receptor, tPA, stathmin-2, beta-1 adrenergic
   receptor) or with female sociosexual behaviors in other taxa (vasotocin,
   isotocin, brain aromatase, alpha-1 adrenergic receptor, tyrosine
   hydroxylase). We exposed females to four social conditions, including
   pairings of differing mate choice complexity (large males, large/small
   males, small males), and a social control (two females). Female mate
   preference differed significantly by context. Multiple discriminant
   analysis (MDA) of behaviors revealed a primary axis (explaining 50.2%
   between-group variance) highlighting differences between groups
   eliciting high preference behaviors (LL, LS) vs. other contexts, and a
   secondary axis capturing general measures distinguishing a non-favored
   group (SS) from other groups. Gene expression MDA revealed a major axis
   (68.4% between-group variance) that distinguished amongst differential
   male pairings and was driven by suites of "preference and receptivity
   genes"; whereas a second axis, distinguishing high affiliation groups
   (large males, females) from low (small males), was characterized by
   traditional affiliative-associated genes (isotocin, vasotocin). We found
   context-specific correlations between behavior and gene MDA, suggesting
   gene suites covary with behaviors in a socially relevant context.
   Distinct associations between "affiliative" and "preference" axes
   suggest mate preference may be mediated by distinct clusters from those
   of social affiliation. Our results highlight the need to incorporate
   natural complexity of mating systems into behavioral genomics.

   the method, the author presents two validity checks of the approach: the
   first uses the 20 largest Add Health networks while the second uses the

   random ego network samples from the known networks and use my method to
   make global network inference. The method successfully reproduces the
   properties of the networks, such as distance and main component size.
   The results also suggest that simpler, baseline models provide
   considerably worse estimates for most network properties. The paper
   concludes with a discussion of the bounds/limitations of ego network

AB Despite being a relatively safe nation, Sweden has four different

   discuss how these centers and programs survive within the current
   organizational environment. The sociology of science or the sociology of
   scientific knowledge perspectives should provide a theoretical guide.
   Yet, scholars of these perspectives have produced no research on these
   related topics. Thus, the population ecology model and the notion of
   organizational niche provide my theoretical foundation. My data come
   from 26 interviews from those four institutions, the gathering of
   documents, and observations. I found that each institution has found its
   own niche with little or no competition - with one exception. Three of
   the universities do have an international focus. Yet, their foci have
   minimal overlap. Finally, I suggest that key aspects of Swedish culture,
   including safety, and a need aid to the poor, help explain the extensive
   funding these centers and programs receive to survive.

AB Background: Although nearly 112 million residents of the United States
   belong to a non-white ethnic group, the literature about differences in
   health indicators across ethnic groups is limited almost exclusively to
   Hispanics. Features of the social experience of many ethnic groups
   including immigration, discrimination, and acculturation may plausibly
   influence mortality risk. We explored life expectancy and age-adjusted
   mortality risk of Arab-Americans (AAs), relative to non-Arab and
   non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan, the state with the largest per capita
   population of AAs in the US.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Data were collected about all deaths to
   AAs and non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites in Michigan between 1990 and
   2007, and year 2000 census data were collected for population
   denominators. We calculated life expectancy, age-adjusted all-cause,
   cause-specific, and age-specific mortality rates stratified by ethnicity
   and gender among AAs and non-Arab and non-Hispanic Whites. Among AAs,
   life expectancies among men and women were 2.0 and 1.4 years lower than
   among non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men and women, respectively. AA
   men had higher mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White men due to
   infectious diseases, chronic diseases, and homicide. AA women had higher
   mortality than non-Arab and non-Hispanic White women due to chronic
   diseases.
   Conclusions/Significance: Despite better education and higher income,
   AAs have higher age-adjusted mortality risk than non-Arab and
   non-Hispanic Whites, particularly due to chronic diseases. Features
   specific to AA culture may explain some of these findings.

   is not surprising; grasslands flourish in places coveted by humans,
   primed for agriculture, plantations, and settlements that nearly always
   trump conservation efforts. The Umgano grassland conservation and
   poverty reduction project in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa uses
   community-based spatial planning to balance the conversion of its
   lower-conservation value grasslands to a timber plantation, while
   conserving higher-value grasslands for heritage purposes and managed
   livestock grazing. Ten years after project launch, we measured the
   ecological and socioeconomic impacts of the project using Normalized
   Differential Vegetation Index remote sensing data and over 500 household
   interviews, as compared with similar non-conserved areas. Zoned
   management of the Umgano area had resulted in between 9% and 17% greater
   average peak production in the grassland areas compared to control
   sites. There was also a 21% gain in incomes for the roughly one hundred
   people employed by the forestry efforts, when compared to others in
   their village. Community-based spatial zoning is an overlooked tool for
   balancing conservation and development but may require, as we found in
   Umgano, certain critical factors including strong local leadership, an
   accountable financial management mechanism to distribute income, outside
   technical expertise for the zoning design, and community support.

AB Human dynamical social networks encode information and are highly
   adaptive. To characterize the information encoded in the fast dynamics
   of social interactions, here we introduce the entropy of dynamical
   social networks. By analysing a large dataset of phone-call interactions
   we show evidence that the dynamical social network has an entropy that
   depends on the time of the day in a typical week-day. Moreover we show
   evidence for adaptability of human social behavior showing data on
   duration of phone-call interactions that significantly deviates from the
   statistics of duration of face-to-face interactions. This adaptability
   of behavior corresponds to a different information content of the
   dynamics of social human interactions. We quantify this information by
   the use of the entropy of dynamical networks on realistic models of
   social interactions.

AB Pessimism, a general tendency toward negative expectancies, is a risk
   factor for depression and also heart disease, stroke, and reduced cancer
   survival. There is evidence that individuals with higher lead exposure
   have poorer health. However, low socioeconomic status (SES) is linked
   with higher lead levels and greater pessimism, and it is unclear whether
   lead influences psychological functioning independently of other social
   factors. The authors considered interrelations among childhood and adult
   SES, lead levels, and psychological functioning in data collected on 412
   Boston area men between 1991 and 2002 in a subgroup of the VA Normative
   Aging Study. Pessimism was measured by using the Life Orientation Test.
   Cumulative (tibia) lead was measured by x-ray fluorescence. Structural
   equation modeling was used to quantify the relations as mediated by
   childhood and adult SES, controlling for age, health behaviors, and
   health status. An interquartile range increase in lead quartile was
   associated with a 0.37 increase in pessimism score (P < 0.05). Low
   childhood and adult SES were related to higher tibia lead levels, and
   both were also independently associated with higher pessimism. Lead
   maintained an independent association with pessimism even after
   childhood and adult SES were considered. Results demonstrate an
   interrelated role of lead burden and SES over the life course in
   relation to psychological functioning in older age.

AB Objectives: We prospectively examined whether socioeconomic status (SES)
   predicts incident type II diabetes (diabetes), a cardiovascular risk
   equivalent and burgeoning public health epidemic among women.
   Methods: Participants include 23,992 women with Hb(A1c) levels <6% and
   no CVD or diabetes at baseline followed from February 1993 to March
   2007. SES was measured by education and income while diabetes was
   self-reported.
   Results: Over 12.3 years of follow-up, 1,262 women developed diabetes.
   In age and race adjusted models, the relative risk of diabetes decreased
   with increasing education (<2 years of nursing, 2 to <4 years of
   nursing, bachelor's degree, master's degree, and doctorate: 1.0, 0.7
   [95% Confidence Interval (CI), 0.6-0.8], 0.6 (95% CI, 0.5-0.7), 0.5 (95%
   CI, 0.4-0.6), 0.4 (95% CI, 0.3-0.5); p(trend)<0.001). Adjustment for
   traditional and non-traditional cardiovascular risk factors attenuated
   this relationship (education: p(trend)=0.96). Similar associations were
   observed between income categories and diabetes.
   Conclusion: Advanced education and increasing income were both inversely
   associated with incident diabetes even in this relatively well-educated
   cohort. This relationship was largely explained by behavioral factors,
   particularly body mass index.

   used an action-oriented approach from 2000 to 2004 to build capacity
   among thousands of pastoralists to diversify livelihoods, improve living
   standards, and enhance livestock marketing. The process included
   collective action, microfinance, and participatory education. Poor women
   previously burdened by domestic chores became leaders and rapidly
   changed their communities. Drought occurred from 2005 to 2008. We
   assessed intervention effects on household drought resilience with a
   quasiexperimental format that incorporated survey-based comparisons of
   treatment groups with ex post controls. Interventions led to major
   improvements in trends for quality of life, wealth accumulation, hunger
   reduction, and risk management. Human capacity building can be a driver
   for change, generating hope and aspirations that set the stage for the
   use of new information and technology.

AB How does the composition of a population affect the adoption of health
   behaviors and innovations? Homophily-similarity of social contacts-can
   increase dyadic-level influence, but it can also force less healthy
   individuals to interact primarily with one another, thereby excluding
   them from interactions with healthier, more influential, early adopters.
   As a result, an important network-level effect of homophily is that the
   people who are most in need of a health innovation may be among the
   least likely to adopt it. Despite the importance of this thesis,
   confounding factors in observational data have made it difficult to test
   empirically. We report results from a controlled experimental study on
   the spread of a health innovation through fixed social networks in which
   the level of homophily was independently varied. We found that homophily
   significantly increased overall adoption of a new health behavior,
   especially among those most in need of it.

AB Introduction. Eligibility for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT)
   requires careful selection of the best possible candidate. The aim of
   this study was to identify factors associated with transplantation
   ineligibility.
   Method. This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients evaluated
   for OLT at our center (2004-2006) and deemed not eligible. We identified
   all patients who were evaluated using information from our
   transplantation database. We extracted demographic data, insurance
   status, laboratory data, and clinical information including psychosocial
   evaluations.
   Results. During the study period 242 evaluated candidates were not
   listed for transplantation. The most common reason for ineligibility for
   transplantation listing was early referral (n = 59; 24.4%), followed by
   psychosocial (18.6%), medical contraindications (17.3%), death during
   evaluation (n = 32; 13.2%), malignancy (n = 22; 9.1%), declined
   evaluation or transfer to other transplantation center (n = 21; 8.7%),
   and other reasons (8.7%). In contrast to whites, psychosocial factors
   were the most common reason among African American candidates.
   Conclusion. This study provides insight into factors contributing to OLT
   ineligibility among candidates of various ethnic backgrounds.

AB Parents of gender variant children routinely negotiate their child's
   gender with social institutions, from schools to churches to
   neighborhood associations. These interactions require that parent
   develop narratives about why their particular child violates gender
   norms. In this paper, I argue that over the last century, there has been
   a proliferation within biomedicine, psychiatry and popular culture of
   the ways in which we can "know" gender; and as a result, ever more
   emotional work is required to account for the "self" that inhabits the
   gendered body. This analysis of the work parents of gender variant
   children do to explain their children to others demonstrates that these
   identities require a distinctly modern form of accounting. With that
   call to articulate the self comes an attendant proliferation of the ways
   in which gender can be regulated; yet, despite much sociological
   evidence that medicine, psychology and spirituality are often mechanisms
   for social control, they also provide ready tools for exploring,
   facilitating and embracing the multiplicity and plasticity of
   contemporary gender identities.

AB The author engages the theory of ecologically unequal exchange to assess

   emissions in Central and Eastern European (CEE) nations is a function of
   the "vertical flow" of exports to high income nations. Initial results
   of cross-national fixed effects panel model estimates for 1992 to 2005
   indicate that growth in such emissions in these transition economy
   nations is negatively associated with the vertical flow of exports,
   which contradicts the tested theoretical proposition. However,
   additional findings indicate that the effect of the vertical flow of
   exports on emissions have increased in magnitude through time, going
   from being environmentally beneficial for CEE nations to quickly
   becoming environmentally harmful and increasingly ecologically unequal.

AB William Cotton's foundational book in environmental sociology,
   Overshoot, published over 30 years ago, provides a valuable conceptual
   framework for understanding human-environment interactions. Despite the
   importance of this work, over the past three decades, environmental
   sociology has drifted away from many of Catton's core concerns,
   especially his focus on natural limits. Reminiscent of the context in
   the 1970s following the Energy Crisis in which Catton wrote Overshoot,
   we now appear to be entering a new age of economic and environmental
   crises, where the ecological contradictions of modern societies and the
   verity of resource constraints grow ever more apparent. Given the
   re-emergence of crises similar to those which spurred Cotton's work, we
   highlight some of Overshoot's most important conceptual contributions
   and argue that Overshoot deserves renewed attention, since it holds many
   insights that can help us to address the environmental and economic
   problems of the twenty-first century.

AB A striking feature of modern societies is the extent to which individual
   persons are culturally validated as equal and empowered actors. The
   expansion of a wide range of rights in recent decades, given prominence
   in current discussions of world society, supports an expanded conception
   of the individual. We examine the extent to which broad global changes
   promoting human empowerment are associated with expanded ideas of the
   status and capacities of students. We hypothesize that there are
   substantial increases in student-centered educational foci in countries
   around the world. First, the rights of students as children are directly
   asserted. Second, an emphasis on empowered human agency supports forms
   of socialization that promote active participation as well as the
   capacities and interests of the student. Examining a unique dataset of
   533 secondary school social science textbooks from 74 countries
   published over the past 40 years, we find that textbooks have indeed
   become more student-centered, and that this shift is associated with the
   rising status of individuals and children in global human rights
   treaties and organizations. Student-centered texts are more common in
   countries with greater individualism embodied in political and
   socio-economic institutions and ideologies, and with more links to world
   society. The study contributes to both political and educational
   sociology, examining how global changes lead to increased emphasis on
   empowered individual agency in intended curricula.

AB Background Social disparities in obesity are often more marked among
   women than men, possibly due to social factors. Taking a life-history
   perspective, we hypothesized that childhood infections could be relevant
   via sex-specific effects of immune system activation on sexual
   development and, hence, body shape.
   Methods We used multivariable linear regression to assess the
   sex-specific, adjusted associations of 'childhood' pathogens [0 (n =
   1002), 1 (n = 2199), 2 (n = 3442) or 3 (n = 4833) of HSV1, CMV and
   hepatitis A antibodies] and 'adult' pathogens [0 (n = 5836), 1 (n =
   3018) or epsilon 2 (n = 720) of HSV2, HHV8 and hepatitis B or C) with
   waist-hip ratio (WHR) and body mass index (BMI) standard deviations
   (SDs) using NHANES III (1988-94). As validation, we assessed
   associations with height.
   Results 'Childhood' pathogens were positively associated with WHR among
   women [0.18 SD, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.04-0.32 for 3,
   compared with 0], but not men (-0.04 SD, 95% CI -0.15 to 0.08), adjusted
   for age, education, race/ethnicity, smoking and alcohol. Further
   adjustments for leg length barely changed the estimates. There were no
   such sex-specific associations for BMI or for adult pathogens.
   'Childhood', but not 'adult', pathogens were negatively associated with
   height, adjusted for age, sex, education and race/ethnicity.
   Conclusions These observations are consistent with the lifecourse
   hypothesis that early exposure to infections makes women vulnerable to
   central obesity. This hypothesis potentially sheds new light on the
   developmental origins of obesity, and is consistent with the generally
   higher levels of central obesity among women than men in developing
   populations.

AB Background Depression is a major cause of disability, particularly among
   women; poverty heightens the risk for depression. Beyond its direct
   effects, maternal depression can harm children's health and development.
   This study aimed to assess the effects of a large-scale anti-poverty
   programme in Mexico (Oportunidades) on maternal depressive symptoms.
   Methods In 2003, 5050 women living in rural communities who had
   participated in Oportunidades since its inception were assessed and
   compared with a group of 1293 women from matched communities, whose
   families had received no exposure to Oportunidades at the time of
   assessment but were later enrolled. Self-reported depressive symptoms
   were measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression
   Scale (CES-D). Ordinary least squares regressions were used to evaluate
   the treatment effect of programme participation on depression while
   adjusting for covariates and clustering at the community level.
   Results Women in the treatment group had lower depressive symptoms than
   those in the comparison group (unadjusted mean CES-D scores: 16.9 +/-
   9.8 vs 18.6 +/- 10.2). In multivariable analyses, programme
   participation was associated with lower depression whilst controlling
   for maternal age, education and household demographic, ethnicity and
   socio-economic variables [beta = -1.7 points, 95% confidence interval
   (95% CI) -2.46 to -0.96, P < 0.001]. Reductions in perceived stress and
   increases in perceived control were mediators of programme effects on
   women.
   Conclusions Although Oportunidades did not target maternal mental health
   directly, we found modest but clinically meaningful effects on
   depressive symptoms. Our design permits stronger causal inference than
   observational studies that have linked poverty and depressive symptoms.
   Our results emphasize that the well-being of individuals is responsive
   to macro-level economic policies and programmes.

AB Climate change is an issue of great importance for human rights, public
   health, and socioeconomic equity because of its diverse consequences
   overall as well as its disproportionate impact on vulnerable and
   socially marginalized populations. Vulnerability to climate change is
   determined by a community's ability to anticipate, cope with, resist,
   and recover from the impact of major weather events. Climate change will
   affect industrial and agricultural sectors, as well as transportation,
   health, and energy infrastructure. These shifts will have significant
   health and economic consequences for diverse communities throughout
   California. Without proactive policies to address these equity concerns,
   climate change will likely reinforce and amplify current as well as
   future socioeconomic disparities, leaving low-income, minority, and
   politically marginalized groups with fewer economic opportunities and
   more environmental and health burdens. This review explores the
   disproportionate impacts of climate change on vulnerable groups in
   California and investigates the costs and benefits of the climate change
   mitigation strategies specified for implementation in the California

AB This study examined the hypotheses that (1) sociodemographic risk
   factors in young children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and/or
   intellectual disability (ID) significantly vary by disability type, and
   (2) measures of income (mean adjusted gross income, mean federal taxes
   paid, and mean tax exemptions) significantly increase between 1994 and
   2002, and are lower in families with a child with ASD and/or ID compared
   with the general population. A multiple source surveillance system
   utilizing a retrospective record review was used to identify ASD and ID
   cases from a population of 26,108 eight-year-old children born in 1994
   and living in Utah in 2002. ASD without ID (ASD-only, n = 99) cases were
   significantly more likely to be male (P<0.01) and have mothers of White
   non-Hispanic ethnicity (P = 0.02). ASD with ID (ASD/ID, n = 33) cases
   were significantly more likely to be male (P<0.01) and have mothers
   older than 34 years (P = 0.03). ID without ASD (ID-only, n = 113) cases
   were significantly more likely to have fathers older than 34 years
   (P<0.01) and were significantly less likely to have mothers with >13
   years education (P<0.01). Measures of income for cases at birth and at 8
   years of age were not significantly lower than the general population
   and mean adjusted income of cases significantly increased from birth to
   8 years of age. Investigations focused on defining early
   sociodemographic risk factors by different endophenotypes of ASD may
   assist in identifying risk factors for this complex group of
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Aggregate tax information may be a unique

AB Ecosystem-based fisheries management requires a holistic assessment of
   fisheries status that integrates fishery ecosystem indicators for
   several major objectives such as sustainability, biodiversity, habitat
   quality, and socioeconomic status. Scientists have already paid much
   attention to the first three objectives and to the development of their
   indicators. Although there have been some efforts to develop
   socioeconomic indicators, relatively less attention has been paid to
   socioeconomic status and the development of its indicators. In addition,
   the socioeconomic indicators developed to date are not firmly based on
   economic theory. We (i) discuss the problems with previous approaches to
   developing socioeconomic indicators; (ii) present theoretical
   foundations of a multi-attribute utility function (MAUF) approach in
   developing socioeconomic indicators; (iii) discuss the issues associated
   with implementing the MAUF approach for fisheries in Alaska; (iv)
   present, as an example, several socioeconomic indicators developed using
   the MAUF approach for a fishery off Alaska; and (v) present results from
   some sensitivity analyses for the form of utility functions and weights.
   Future directions are also discussed. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Huntington claimed that today's major conflicts are most likely to erupt
   between religiously defined civilizations, in particular between
   Christianity and Islam. Using World Values Surveys from 86 nations, we
   examine differences between Christians and Muslims in preferences for
   religious political leaders. The results suggest a marked difference
   between Muslims and Christians in their attitudes toward religious
   politicians, with Muslims more favorable by 20 points out of 100.
   Devoutness, education, degree of government corruption, and status as a
   formerly Communist state account for the difference. Little support is
   found for the clash-of-civilizations hypothesis. Instead, we find that a
   clash of individual beliefsbetween the devout and the secularalong with
   enduring differences between the more developed and less developed world
   explains the difference between Islam and Christianity with regards to
   preferences for religious political leaders.

AB OBJECTIVES: To characterize the social characteristics and physical,
   functional, mental, and cognitive health of exceptional survivors in the
   United States and how the experience of exceptional longevity differs
   according to social status. DESIGN: Nationally representative
   longitudinal study of older Americans. SETTING: United States.
   PARTICIPANTS: One thousand six hundred forty-nine men and women born
   from 1900 to 1911 from the Health and Retirement Study: 1,424
   nonsurvivors who died before reaching the age of 97 and 225 exceptional
   survivors who survived to age 97 and older. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported
   data on sociodemographic characteristics, social environment, physical
   and mental health, and physical and cognitive function. RESULTS: At
   baseline, exceptional survivors were more likely to live independently
   and had fewer diseases, better mental health, and better physical and
   cognitive function than those who did not survive to age 97. Exceptional
   survivors experienced declines from baseline in all health domains upon
   reaching 97 years of age, but between onefifth and one-third of
   exceptional survivors remained disease free, with no functional
   limitations or depressive symptoms, and one-fifth retained high
   cognitive function. Of exceptional survivors, men were healthier than
   women, and whites were generally healthier than nonwhites. Highly
   educated exceptional survivors had better cognitive function than their
   less-educated counterparts. CONCLUSION: On average, exceptional
   survivors are relatively healthy and high functioning for most of their
   lives and experience health declines only upon reaching maximum
   longevity. Heterogeneity in the population of exceptionally old adults
   indicates that, although many individuals reach maximum longevity in a
   state of poor health and functioning, a considerable portion of
   excep-tional survivors remain healthy and high-functioning even in very
   old age. J Am Geriatr Soc 59: 2241-2248, 2011.

AB Sociologists widely acknowledge that uncertainty matters for decision
   making, but they rarely measure it directly. In this article, we
   demonstrate the importance of theorizing about, measuring, and analyzing
   uncertainty as experienced by individuals. We adapt a novel
   probabilistic solicitation technique to measure personal uncertainty
   about HIV status in a high HIV prevalence area of southern Malawi. Using
   data from 2,000 young adults (ages 15 to 25 years), we demonstrate that
   uncertainty about HIV status is widespread and that it expands as young
   adults assess their proximate and distant futures. In conceptualizing
   HIV status as something more than sero-status itself, we gain insight
   into how what individuals know they don't know influences their lives.
   Young people who are uncertain about their HIV status express desires to
   accelerate their childbearing relative to their counterparts who are
   certain they are uninfected. Our approach and findings show that
   personal uncertainty is a measurable and meaningful phenomenon that can
   illuminate much about individuals' aspirations and behaviors.

   based on their degree of mass killing, unilateralism, and ethnic
   liability. The identification of the elements of genocide draws from a
   general theory of genocide (Campbell 2009, 2010) and from theories of
   social control employing Donald Black's (1995, 1998) theoretical
   approach, known as pure sociology. Because these theories identify the
   social features associated with each element of genocide, they can
   explain the form genocides take.

AB Interethnic marriage represents a major trend in the demographic history
   of American Indians. While the majority of these unions involved Indian
   women and Caucasian men, a sizeable number occurred between Indians and
   African Americans. The children of these bicultural marriages were
   "mixed bloods" who in turn typically married non-Indians or other mixed
   bloods. Using data from the 1910 Census on American Indians in the
   United States and Alaska, this article explores why American Indians
   with African ancestry enjoyed high fertility. Differential rates of
   fertility among American Indians in the past were due to a number of
   underlying genetic, cultural, and environmental factors. By identifying
   these factors, the paradox of why Indian women with African heritage did
   so well in terms of fertility largely disappears. African admixture,
   however, greatly complicates Indian social identity.

AB Religiousness has been observed to have a beneficial relationship with
   blood pressure, however, specific aspects of religiousness that interact
   with physiological mechanisms to influence this relationship are not
   known. This study explored laboratory cardiovascular reactivity (blood
   pressure, heart rate) to psychological stress among middle aged
   community dwelling individuals grouped by religious motivation
   (Intrinsic, Pro-religious, Non-religious). Measures of personality,
   cynical hostility, aggression, sense of coherence, and compassion were
   administered. Results indicated that the Pro-religious group
   demonstrated dampened reactivity compared to the other research groups.
   However, the Pro-religious also demonstrated a less positive
   psychological profile (e.g., greater cynicism, aggression, and
   neuroticism; less compassion and sense of coherence) and poorer
   self-reported health compared with the Intrinsic group and behavioral
   observations demonstrated that the Pro-religious were unreliable in
   keeping appointments and appeared rushed during the experiment. These
   findings indicate a complicated interface between personality, coping,
   and religious motivation in response to stressors and emphasize the need
   for naturalistic and longitudinal investigations of individuals who vary
   in terms of religious motivation.

   mediators-in a sample of predominantly White, Christian, and female
   ambulatory cancer patients. In a cross-sectional design, 179 adult
   cancer outpatients completed measures of prayer, rumination, social
   support, depressive symptoms, and demographic variables. Type and stage
   of cancer were collected from electronic medical charts. Depressive
   symptoms were negatively correlated with adoration prayer (r = -.15),
   reception prayer (r = -.17), thanksgiving prayer (r = -.29), and prayer
   for the well-being of others (r = -.26). In the path analysis,
   rumination fully mediated the link between thanksgiving prayer and
   depressive symptoms (beta for indirect effect = -.05), whereas social
   support partially mediated the link between prayer for others and
   depressive symptoms (beta for indirect effect = -.05). These findings
   suggest that unique mechanisms may link different prayer types to lower
   depressive symptoms among cancer patients.

   sociologist's task and challenge. We agreed that any historical
   sociology concentrated upon particular events or single sports, but
   overlooking comparative cultural and social contexts, was narrow and
   over-focused. Recalling early contributions, Patterson notes how in
   cricket in the Caribbean there could be found an intense distillation of
   every kind of problem and emotional baggage carried by a society at a
   particular socio-historical moment. Patterson advocates the dual focus
   upon time/place and socio-cultural historical influence that is at the
   heart of the historical sociologist's enterprise; and that shows how
   cricket, for instance, is both constituted by the legacies of a specific
   historical past, and constituting of a potentially different future.

   pasteurized donor human milk, there is little discussion in the medical
   literature regarding the ethical considerations of collection and use of
   this resource. Key ethical considerations include issues surrounding

AB Psychiatry has its place in the ranks of social disciplines and the goal

   Failure leaves two archaic alternatives: either to fall apart and become
   a decadent civilization, or to concentrate on some focal point of
   fanaticism, radical or religious, rising on fabricated emotions with
   artificial wings like Icarus until they melt and then come tumbling
   down, leaving science like Daedalus to mourn.
   At the present time there is a flow of stimulating ideas between
   anthropology and psychiatry. Each of these two disciplines is growing
   more and more interested in the material of the other. Anthropology
   offers psychiatry a wide range of data valuable for comparison and
   control, much as comparative anatomy offers material to human anatomy.
   The whole panorama of overlapping interests, and a summary of the
   principal themes, will be considered here before the topic,

   American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) patients. The intervention was
   initiated at a Level I trauma center and aimed to link AI/AN patients to
   their distant tribal communities. Thirty AI/AN patients were randomized
   to the intervention or to usual care. Assessments at baseline, 3 months,
   and 6 months included self-reported lifetime cumulative trauma burden,
   Native healing requests, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress,
   depression, and alcohol use. Generalized estimating equations
   ascertained differences between groups over time. Ninety-four percent of
   eligible patients participated; follow-up at 3 and 6 months was 83%.
   Participants had high numbers of lifetime traumas (mean = 5.1, standard
   deviation = 2.6). No differences between the intervention and control
   groups were observed in posttraumatic stress symptoms, depression
   symptoms, or alcohol use at baseline or follow-up time points. Among
   intervention patients, 60% either requested or participated in
   traditional Native healing practices and 75% reported that the
   intervention was helpful. This effectiveness trial demonstrated the
   feasibility of recruiting and randomizing injured AI/AN patients. Future
   efforts could integrate evidence-based interventions and traditional
   Native healing into stepped collaborative care treatment programs.

AB The relationship between European sociology and European anti-Semitism
   in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries is investigated through
   a case study of one sociologist, Emile Durkheim, in a single country,
   France. Reactionary and radical forms of anti-Semitism are distinguished
   and contrasted to Durkheim's sociological perspective. Durkheim's
   remarks about the Jews directly addressed anti-Semitic claims about
   them, their role in French society, and their relationship to modernity.
   At the same time, Durkheim was engaged in a reinterpretation of the
   French Revolution and its legacies that indirectly challenged other
   tenets of French anti-Semitism. In sum, Durkheim's work contains direct
   and indirect responses to reactionary and radical forms of
   anti-Semitism, and together these responses form a coherent alternative
   vision of the relationship between modernity and the Jews.

   as a certain kind of socially recognized person, both within and across
   fields; (b) actions that actors experienceor that they expect others to
   perceiveas defining the actor both intersituationally and to a greater
   extent than other available definitions of self; and (c) actions to
   which actors either have themselves, or expect others to have, a
   predictable emotional reaction. Such a position avoids both a realist

AB Current research on guanxi (Chinese social connections) suffers from
   conceptual confusion. This article presents a new theoretical framework
   for understanding guanxi in the face of China's economic and social
   transformations. Guanxi is viewed as a purposive network behavior that
   can take different strategic forms, such as accessing, bridging, and
   embedding. Pairing this conceptualization with a social-evolutionary
   framework, I argue that the emergence and increasing or decreasing
   prevalence of each form over time result from (1) a combination of
   factors at three analytical levelsmicroagency, mesonetwork, and
   macroinstitutionaland (2) endogenous processes of selection. By focusing
   on behavioral forms and their evolution, this framework is able to
   bridge divides in the guanxi literature, provide a foundation for
   comparative studies of network behavior across societies, and connect
   the study of guanxi with economic sociology more broadly.

AB Background and Purpose-Neighborhood characteristics may influence the
   risk of stroke and contribute to socioeconomic disparities in stroke
   incidence. The objectives of this study were to examine the relationship
   between neighborhood socioeconomic status and incident ischemic stroke
   and examine potential mediators of these associations.
   Methods-We analyzed data from 3834 whites and 785 blacks enrolled in the
   Cardiovascular Health Study, a multicenter, population-based,
   longitudinal study of adults ages >= 65 years from 4 US counties. The
   primary outcome was adjudicated incident ischemic stroke. Neighborhood
   socioeconomic status was measured using a composite of 6 census tract
   variables. Race-stratified multilevel Cox proportional hazard models
   were constructed adjusted for sociodemographic, behavioral, and
   biological risk factors.
   Results-Among whites, in models adjusted for sociodemographic
   characteristics, stroke hazard was significantly higher among residents
   of neighborhoods in the lowest compared with the highest neighborhood
   socioeconomic status quartile (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.01-1.72)
   with greater attenuation of the hazard ratio after adjustment for
   biological risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.16; 0.88-1.52) than for
   behavioral risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.30; 0.99-1.70). Among blacks,
   we found no significant associations between neighborhood socioeconomic
   status and ischemic stroke.
   Conclusions-Higher risk of incident ischemic stroke was observed in the
   most disadvantaged neighborhoods among whites, but not among blacks. The
   relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and stroke among
   whites appears to be mediated more strongly by biological than
   behavioral risk factors. (Stroke. 2011;42:3363-3368.)

AB Background and Purpose-Black/white disparities in stroke incidence are
   well documented, but few studies have assessed the contributions to the
   disparity. Here we assess the contribution of "traditional" risk
   factors.
   Methods-A total of 25 714 black and white men and women, aged >= 45
   years and stroke-free at baseline, were followed for an average of 4.4
   years to detect stroke. Mediation analysis using proportional hazards
   analysis assessed the contribution of traditional risk factors to racial
   disparities.
   Results-At age 45 years, incident stroke risk was 2.90 (95% CI:
   1.72-4.89) times more likely in blacks than in whites and 1.66 (95% CI:
   1.34-2.07) times at age 65 years. Adjustment for risk factors attenuated
   these excesses by 40% and 45%, respectively, resulting in relative risks
   of 2.14 (95% CI: 1.25-3.67) and 1.35 (95% CI: 1.08-1.71). Approximately
   one half of this mediation is attributable to systolic blood pressure.
   Further adjustment for socioeconomic factors resulted in total mediation
   of 47% and 53% to relative risks of 2.01 (95% CI: 1.16-3.47) and 1.30
   (1.03-1.65), respectively.
   Conclusions-Between ages 45 to 65 years, approximately half of the
   racial disparity in stroke risk is attributable to traditional risk
   factors (primarily systolic blood pressure) and socioeconomic factors,
   suggesting a critical need to understand the disparity in the
   development of these traditional risk factors. Because half of the
   excess stroke risk in blacks is not attributable to traditional risk
   factors and socioeconomic factors, differential impact of risk factors,
   residual confounding, or nontraditional risk factors may also play a
   role. (Stroke. 2011;42:3369-3375.)

AB This article offers an alternative interpretation of the relationship
   between two social movement organizations (SMOs) with roots in the
   Catholic Church of Chicago: Catholic Action (CA), specifically the form
   that began in the 1940s and expanded as the Christian Family Movement,
   and Call to Action (CTA), an SMO that emerged during the 1970s. Using
   social movement theories combined with the sociology of place, this
   article analyzes periodicals, archival data, and interviews arguing that
   (1) the SMOs are closely related, (2) that the relationship between them
   is an excellent example of movement-to-movement transmission, and (3)
   that the role of "place"-in this case, Chicago-is significant in the
   movement-to-movement transmission process. This article adds to our
   awareness of social movements within religious organizations, by
   demonstrating CA's continuing influence and its relationship to the
   mobilization of CTA.

AB Potential upstream determinants of coronary heart disease (CHD) include
   life-course socioeconomic position (e.g., childhood socioeconomic
   circumstances, own education and occupation); however, several plausible
   biological mechanisms by which socioeconomic position (SEP) may
   influence CHD are poorly understood. Several CHD risk factors appear to
   be more strongly associated with SEP in women than in men; little is
   known as to whether any CHD risk factors may be more strongly associated
   with SEP in men. Objectives were to evaluate whether cumulative
   life-course SEP is associated with a measurement of subclinical
   atherosclerosis, the ankle-brachial index (ABI), in men and women. This
   study was a prospective analysis of 1,454 participants from the
   Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort (mean age 57 years, 53.8%
   women). Cumulative SEP was calculated by summing tertile scores for
   father's education, own education, and own occupation. ABI was
   dichotomized as low (<= 1.1) and normal (>1.1 to 1.4). After adjustment
   for age and CHD risk factors cumulative life-course SEP was associated
   with low ABI in men (odds ratio [OR] 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]
   1.22 to 3.42, for low vs high cumulative SEP score) but not in women (OR
   0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.33). Associations with low ABI in men were
   substantially driven by their own education (OR 4.13, 95% CI 1.86 to
   9.16, for lower vs higher than high school education). In conclusion,
   cumulative life-course SEP was associated with low ABI in men but not in
   women. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. (Am J Cardiol

AB Rationale: Bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) improves survival
   compared with single lung transplantation (SLT) for some individuals
   with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, it is
   unclear which strategy optimally uses this scarce societal resource.
   Objectives: To compare the effect of SLT versus BLT strategies for COPD
   on waitlist outcomes among the broader population of patients listed for
   lung transplantation.
   Methods: We developed a Markov model to simulate the transplant waitlist
   using transplant registry data to define waitlist size, donor frequency,
   the risk of death awaiting transplant, and disease-and
   procedure-specific post-transplant survival. We then applied this model
   to 1,000 simulated patients and compared the number of patients under
   each strategy who received a transplant, the number who died before
   transplantation, and total post-transplant survival.
   Measurements and Main Results: Under baseline assumptions, the SLT
   strategy resulted in more patients transplanted (809 vs. 758) and fewer
   waitlist deaths (157 vs. 199). The strategies produced similar total
   post-transplant survival (SLT = 4,586 yr vs. BLT = 4,577 yr). In
   sensitivity analyses, SLT always maximized the number of patients
   transplanted. The strategy that maximized post-transplant survival
   depended on the relative survival benefit of BLT versus SLT among
   patients with COPD, donor interval, and waitlist size.
   Conclusions: In most circumstances, a policy of SLT for COPD improves
   access to organs for other potential recipients without significant
   reductions in total post-transplant survival. However, there may be
   substantial geographic variations in the effect of such a policy on the
   balance between these outcomes.

AB Objective Previous studies have not examined potential interactions
   between meat intake and characteristics of the local environment on the
   risk of mortality. This study examined the impact of area socioeconomic
   deprivation on the association between meat intake and all-cause and
   cause-specific mortality after accounting for individual-level risk
   factors.
   Methods In the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, we analyzed
   data from adults, ages 50-71 years at baseline (1995-1996).
   Individual-level dietary intake and health risk information were linked
   to the demographic and socioeconomic context of participants' local
   environment based on census tract data. Deaths (n = 33,831) were
   identified through December 2005. Multilevel Cox models were used to
   estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for quintiles of
   area deprivation scores.
   Results Associations of red and processed meats with mortality were
   consistent across deprivation quintiles. Men residing in least-deprived
   neighborhoods had a stronger protective effect for white meat
   consumption. No differences by deprivation index were observed for
   women.
   Conclusion Red and processed meat intake increases mortality risk
   regardless of level of deprivation within a given neighborhood
   suggesting biological mechanisms rather than neighborhood contextual
   factors may underlie these meat-mortality associations. The effect of
   white meat intake on cancer mortality was modified by area deprivation
   among men.
