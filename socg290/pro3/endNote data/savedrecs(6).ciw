AB Little is known about the effect of language preference, socioeconomic
   status, and health care access on human papillomavirus (HPV)
   vaccination. We examined these factors in Hispanic parents of daughters
   aged 11 to 17 years in California (n=1090). Spanish-speaking parents
   were less likely to have their daughters vaccinated than were English
   speakers (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.31,
   0.98). Adding income and access to multivariate analyses made language
   nonsignificant (OR = 0.68; 95% Cl = 0.35, 1.29). This confirms that
   health care use is associated with language via income and access.
   Low-income Hispanics, who lack access, need information about free HPV
   vaccination programs. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:270-272. doi:

AB Evidence shows that parental financial investments increase college
   attendance, but we know little about how these investments shape
   postsecondary achievement. Two theoretical frameworks suggest diametric
   conclusions. Some studies operate from a more-is-more perspective in
   which children use calculated parental allocations to make academic
   progress. In contrast, a more-is-less perspective, rooted in a different
   model of rational behavior, suggests that parental investments create a
   disincentive for student achievement. I adjudicate between these
   frameworks, using data from nationally representative postsecondary
   datasets to determine what effect financial parental investments have on
   student GPA and degree completion. The findings suggest seemingly
   contradictory processes. Parental aid decreases student GPA, but it
   increases the odds of graduating-net of explanatory variables and
   accounting for alternative funding. Rather than strategically using
   resources in accordance with parental goals, or maximizing on their
   ability to avoid academic work, students are satisficing: they meet the
   criteria for adequacy on multiple fronts, rather than optimizing their
   chances for a particular outcome. As a result, students with parental
   funding often perform well enough to stay in school but dial down their
   academic efforts. I conclude by highlighting the importance of life
   stage and institutional context for parental investment.

AB Racial/ethnic disparities in birth weight persist within the USA.
   The purpose of this study is to examine the association between maternal
   everyday discrimination and infant birth weight among young, urban women
   of color as well as mediators (depressive symptoms, pregnancy distress,
   and pregnancy symptoms) and moderators (age, race/ethnicity, and
   attributions of discrimination) of this association.
   A total of 420 women participated (14-21 years old; 62 % Latina, 38 %
   Black), completing measures of everyday discrimination and moderators
   during their second trimester of pregnancy and mediators during their
   third trimester. Birth weight was primarily recorded from medical record
   review.
   Path analysis demonstrated that everyday discrimination was associated
   with lower birth weight. Depressive symptoms mediated this relationship,
   and no tested factors moderated this relationship.
   Given the association between birth weight and health across the
   lifespan, it is critical to reduce discrimination directed at young,
   urban women of color so that all children can begin life with greater
   promise for health.

AB Few studies have examined the psychosocial mechanisms through which
   self-reported discrimination may influence the health status of Latinos.
   This study examined the mediating role of subjective social status in
   the USA and psychological distress on the relation between everyday
   discrimination and self-rated physical health, and the moderating role
   of gender and ethnicity.
   A US population-based sample of Latinos (N = 2,554) was drawn from the
   National Latino and Asian American Study. Respondents completed measures
   of everyday discrimination, subjective social status, psychological
   distress, and self-rated physical health.
   Path analysis revealed that among the total sample, subjective social
   status and psychological distress sequentially mediated the effect of
   everyday discrimination on self-rated physical health. Psychological
   distress was a more consistent mediator across Latino subgroups. Gender
   and ethnicity moderated the mediation model.
   This study provides a systematic examination of how psychosocial
   mechanisms may operate differently or similarly across Latino subgroups.

AB Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prevalence has increased dramatically in
   the United States since the early 1970s. Though T2DM is known to be
   associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), information on racial
   differences in the relationship between T2DM and CRC is limited.
   Using a retrospective cohort design, we compared the association between
   T2DM and CRC, including subsites of the colon, in African Americans
   (AAs) and European Americans (EAs) in South Carolina, a region with
   large racial disparities in rates of both diseases. A total of 91,836
   individuals who were a parts per thousand yen30 years old on 1 January
   1990 and had a parts per thousand yen12 months of South Carolina
   Medicaid eligibility between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1995 were
   included in the analyses. Cancer data from 1996 to 2007 included
   information on anatomic subsite.
   Subjects who had T2DM (n = 6,006) were > 50 % more likely to be
   diagnosed with colon cancer compared to those without T2DM (n = 85,681).
   The association between T2DM and colon cancer was higher in AAs [odds
   ratio (OR) = 1.72 (95 % confidence interval: 1.21, 2.46); n = 47,984]
   than among EAs (OR = 1.24; 0.73, 2.11; n = 43,703). Overall, individuals
   with T2DM were over twice as likely to be diagnosed with in situ or
   local colon cancer (OR = 2.12; 1.40, 3.22; n = 191) compared to those
   without T2DM, with a higher likelihood among AAs (OR = 2.49; 1.52, 4.09;
   n = 113).
   Results from a Medicaid population in a high-risk region of the United
   States showed an increased likelihood of CRC with T2DM and suggest a
   racial disparity that disfavors AAs and provides further impetus for
   efforts aimed at diabetes prevention in this group.

AB Higher socioeconomic status (SES) men are at higher risk of prostate
   cancer (PCa) diagnosis, an association commonly interpreted as a
   function of higher rates of prostate screening among higher SES men.
   However, the extent to which screening explains this association has not
   been well quantified.
   Within a Detroit area cohort of 6,692 men followed up after a benign
   prostate procedure, a case-control study was conducted of 494 PCa cases
   and controls matched on age, race, duration of follow-up, and date of
   initial benign finding; 2000 Census data were used in a principal
   component analysis to derive a single factor, labeled the neighborhood
   SES index (NSESI), representing zip code-level SES.
   Among cases, higher SES was associated with a younger age at initial
   biopsy: -1.48 years (95 % CI, -2.32, -0.64) per unit NSESI. After
   adjustment for confounders and duration of follow-up, higher SES was
   associated with more PSA tests and DRE during follow-up; 9 % (95 % CI,
   2, 16) and 8 % (95 % CI, 1, 15) more respectively, per unit NSESI.
   Higher SES was associated with a higher risk of PCa diagnosis during
   follow-up, multivariable adjusted OR = 1.26 per unit increase in NSESI
   (95 % CI, 1.04, 1.49). Further adjustment for screening frequency
   somewhat reduced the association between SES and PCa risk (OR = 1.19 per
   unit NSESI, 95 % CI, 0.98, 1.44).
   Differences in screening frequency only partially explained the
   association between higher zip code SES and PCa risk; other health
   care-related factors should also be considered as explanatory factors.

AB Social functioning was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist and

   in a randomized clinical trial (N = 161, aged 7-14). Significant
   relationships were found between severity of children's principal
   anxiety disorder and most measures of social functioning, such that
   poorer social functioning was associated with more severe anxiety. Among
   youth who received cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 111), significant
   associations were found between parent-reported social competence and
   both absence of principal anxiety disorder and lower anxiety severity at
   posttreatment and 1-year follow-up, controlling for the severity of the
   child's principal anxiety disorder at pretreatment. Findings support a
   relationship between anxiety severity and social difficulties, and
   suggest the importance of social competence for a favorable treatment
   response.

AB Research on negative thinking and mental health has been criticized as
   focusing exclusively on trait like individual differences, and ignoring
   potential social influences. Nonetheless, little progress has been made
   in studying social influences. We tested a new theory of social support
   that hypothesizes that day-to-day social interaction helps regulate
   thought and affect. In two studies, students rated negative thinking and
   affect when thinking about their mothers, fathers, and closest peers. We
   isolated trait like negative thinking (i.e., stable across support
   providers) from socially influenced negative thinking (i.e., varied
   across support providers). There were significant social influences on
   each type of negative thinking such that the providers that elicited
   negative thinking also elicited worse affect and low perceived support,
   beyond recipients' trait-like negative thinking. Some types of negative
   thinking were more trait like (worry and dysfunctional attitudes) and
   some were equally trait like and socially influenced (e.g., automatic
   negative thoughts).

AB Energized and productive faculty are critical to academic medicine, yet
   studies indicate a lack of advancement and senior roles for women.
   Using measures of key aspects of the culture of academic medicine, this
   study sought to identify similarity and dissimilarity between
   perceptions of the culture by male and female faculty.
   The C - Change Faculty Survey was used to collect data on perceptions of
   organizational culture.
   A stratified random sample of 4,578 full-time faculty at 26 nationally
   representative US medical colleges (response rate 52 %). 1,271 (53 %) of
   respondents were female.
   Factor analysis assisted in the creation of scales assessing dimensions
   of the culture, which served as the key outcomes. Regression analysis
   identified gender differences while controlling for other demographic
   characteristics.
   Compared with men, female faculty reported a lower sense of belonging
   and relationships within the workplace (T = -3.30, p < 0.01).
   Self-efficacy for career advancement was lower in women (T = -4.73, p <
   0.001). Women perceived lower gender equity (T = -19.82, p < 0.001), and
   were less likely to believe their institutions were making changes to
   address diversity goals (T = -9.70, p < 0.001). Women were less likely
   than men to perceive their institution as family-friendly (T = -4.06, p
   < 0.001), and women reported less congruence between their own values
   and those of their institutions (T = -2.06, p < 0.05). Women and men did
   not differ significantly on levels of engagement, leadership
   aspirations, feelings of ethical/moral distress, perception of
   institutional commitment to faculty advancement, or perception of
   institutional change efforts to improve support for faculty.
   Faculty men and women are equally engaged in their work and share
   similar leadership aspirations. However, medical schools have failed to
   create and sustain an environment where women feel fully accepted and
   supported to succeed; how can we ensure that medical schools are fully
   using the talent pool of a third of its faculty?.

AB Obesity is a stigmatizing condition associated with adverse psychosocial
   consequences. The relative importance of weight stigma in reducing
   health utility or the value a person places on their current health
   state is unknown.
   We conducted a telephone survey of patients with obesity. All were
   seeking weight loss surgery at two bariatric centers (70 % response
   rate). We assessed patients' health utility (preference-based quality
   life measure) via a series of standard gamble scenarios assessing
   patients' willingness to risk death to lose various amounts of weight or
   achieve perfect health (range 0 to 1; 0 = death and 1 = most valued
   health/weight state). Multivariable models assessed associations among
   quality of life domains from the Short-form 36 (SF-36) and Impact of
   Weight on Quality of Life-lite (IWQOL-lite) and patients' health
   utility.
   Our study sample (n = 574) had a mean body mass index of 46.5 kg/m(2)
   and a mean health utility of 0.87, reflecting the group's average
   willingness to accept a 13 % risk of death to achieve their most desired
   health/weight state; utilities were highly variable, however, with 10 %
   reporting a utility of 1.00 and 27 % reporting a utility lower than
   0.90. Among the IWQOL-lite subscales, Public Distress and Work Life were
   the only two subscales significantly associated with patients' utility
   after adjustment for sociodemographic factors. Among the SF-36
   subscales, Role Physical, Physical Functioning, and Role Emotional were
   significantly associated with patients' utility. When the leading
   subscales on both IWQOL-lite and SF-36 were considered together, Role
   Physical, Public Distress, and to a lesser degree Role Emotional
   remained independently associated with patients' health utility.
   Patients seeking weight loss surgery report health utilities similar to
   those reported for people living with diabetes or with laryngeal cancer;
   however, utility values varied widely with more than a quarter of
   patients willing to accept more than a 10 % risk of death to achieve
   their most valued health/weight state. Interference with role
   functioning due to physical limitations and obesity-related social
   stigma were strong determinants of reduced health utility.

AB Readmission and mortality after hospitalization for community-acquired
   pneumonia (CAP) and heart failure (HF) are publically reported. This
   systematic review assessed the impact of social factors on risk of
   readmission or mortality after hospitalization for CAP and HF-variables
   outside a hospital's control.
   We searched OVID, PubMed and PSYCHINFO for studies from 1980 to 2012.
   Eligible articles examined the association between social factors and
   readmission or mortality in patients hospitalized with CAP or HF. We
   abstracted data on study characteristics, domains of social factors
   examined, and presence and magnitude of associations.
   Seventy-two articles met inclusion criteria (20 CAP, 52 HF). Most CAP
   studies evaluated age, gender, and race and found older age and
   non-White race were associated with worse outcomes. The results for
   gender were mixed. Few studies assessed higher level social factors, but
   those examined were often, but inconsistently, significantly associated
   with readmissions after CAP, including lower education, low income, and
   unemployment, and with mortality after CAP, including low income. For
   HF, older age was associated with worse outcomes and results for gender
   were mixed. Non-Whites had more readmissions after HF but decreased
   mortality. Again, higher level social factors were less frequently
   studied, but those examined were often, but inconsistently,
   significantly associated with readmissions, including low socioeconomic
   status (Medicaid insurance, low income), living situation (home
   stability rural address), lack of social support, being unmarried and
   risk behaviors (smoking, cocaine use and medical/visit non-adherence).
   Similar findings were observed for factors associated with mortality
   after HF, along with psychiatric comorbidities, lack of home resources
   and greater distance to hospital.
   A broad range of social factors affect the risk of post-discharge
   readmission and mortality in CAP and HF. Future research on adverse
   events after discharge should study social determinants of health.

AB Physicians and patients increasingly use social media technologies, such
   as Facebook, Twitter, and weblogs (blogs), both professionally and
   personally. Amidst recent reports of physician misbehavior online, as
   well as concerns about social media's potential negative effect on trust
   in the medical profession, several national-level physician
   organizations have created professional guidelines on social media use
   by physicians. Missing from these guidelines is adequate attention to
   conflict of interest. Some guidelines do not explicitly mention conflict
   of interest; others recommend only disclosure. Recommending disclosure
   fails to appreciate the unique features of social media that make
   adequate disclosure difficult to accomplish. Moreover, in emphasizing
   disclosure alone, current guidelines are inconsistent with medicine's
   general trend toward management or elimination, not just disclosure, of
   potential conflicts. Because social media sites typically rely on
   physicians' voluntary compliance with professional norms, physicians
   necessarily play a major role in shaping these norms' content and scope.
   To achieve the benefits of social media and ensure the veracity of
   social media content while preserving trust in the profession,
   physicians must reaffirm their commitment to disclose potential
   conflicts; advocate for better electronic disclosure mechanisms; and
   develop concrete management strategies-including, where necessary, the
   elimination of conflicts altogether.

AB A key objective of the Medicare program is to reduce risk of financial
   catastrophe due to out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures. Yet little is
   known about cumulative financial risks arising from out-of-pocket
   healthcare expenditures faced by older adults, particularly near the end
   of life.
   Using the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study (HRS)
   cohort, we conducted retrospective analyses of Medicare beneficiaries'
   total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures over the last 5 years of
   life.
   We identified HRS decedents between 2002 and 2008; defined a 5 year
   study period using each subject's date of death; and excluded those
   without Medicare coverage at the beginning of this period (n = 3,209).
   We examined total out-of-pocket healthcare expenditures in the last 5
   years of life and expenditures as a percentage of baseline household
   assets. We then stratified results by marital status and cause of death.
   All measurements were adjusted for inflation to 2008 US dollars.
   Average out-of-pocket expenditures in the 5 years prior to death were
   $38,688 (95 % Confidence Interval $36,868, $40,508) for individuals, and
   $51,030 (95 % CI $47,649, $54,412) for couples in which one spouse dies.
   Spending was highly skewed, with the median and 90th percentile equal to
   $22,885 and $89,106, respectively, for individuals, and $39,759 and
   $94,823, respectively, for couples. Overall, 25 % of subjects'
   expenditures exceeded baseline total household assets, and 43 % of
   subjects' spending surpassed their non-housing assets. Among those
   survived by a spouse, 10 % exceeded total baseline assets and 24 %
   exceeded non-housing assets. By cause of death, average spending ranged
   from $31,069 for gastrointestinal disease to $66,155 for Alzheimer's
   disease.
   Despite Medicare coverage, elderly households face considerable
   financial risk from out-of-pocket healthcare expenses at the end of
   life. Disease-related differences in this risk complicate efforts to
   anticipate or plan for health-related expenditures in the last 5 years
   of life.

AB Objective: This study examined the contribution of perceived social
   support to the presence of anxiety in persons with chronic obstructive
   pulmonary disease (COPD).
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey sample of 452 persons with COPD (61.3%
   female; 53.5% older than 65; 70.8% without a college degree or higher
   educational achievement, and 54.8% with household income of $40,000 or
   less) completed a telephone survey. Measures included the anxiety
   subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A), 5 social
   support subscales from the Positive and Negative Social Exchanges
   (PANSE) Scale, a COPD Severity Score (CSS; a weighted algorithmic
   combination of symptoms and the need for various COPD medical
   interventions), and the Geriatric Depression Scale, Short Form (GDS-SF).
   Zero order correlations and a series of multiple regression analyses
   were calculated.
   Results: Multiple regression analysis revealed that the receipt of
   instrumental support, feeling let down by the failure of others to
   provide needed help, and unsympathetic or insensitive behavior from
   others each positively predicted a higher level of patient anxiety in
   COPD patients, after controlling for demographic variables, smoking
   status, comorbid depression (GDS) and severity of illness (CSS).
   Additionally, the control variable of depression was the strongest
   predictor of anxiety, suggesting a high degree of co-morbidity in this
   sample.
   Conclusion: Anxiety and depression are serious co-morbid mental health
   concerns for persons with COPD. It is important to examine both positive
   and negative aspects of perceived social support for COPD patients and
   how they may impact or interact with these mental health concerns. (C)

AB Social and ecologic factors, such as residential segregation, are
   determinants of health in the general population, but how these factors
   associate with outcomes among patients with ESRD is not well understood.
   Here, we examined associations of income inequality and residence, as
   social determinants of health, with survival among black and white
   patients with ESRD. We merged U.S. Renal Data System data from 589,036
   patients who started hemodialysis from 2000 through 2008 with
   race-specific median household income data from the Census Bureau. We
   used Gini Index coefficients to assess income distributional inequality
   and the Dissimilarity Index to determine residential segregation. Black
   patients lived in areas of lower median household income compared with
   white patients ($26,742 versus $41,922; P<0.001). Residence in areas
   with higher median household income was associated with improved
   survival. Among whites, income inequality was associated with mortality.
   Among blacks exclusively, residence in highly segregated areas was
   associated with increased mortality. In conclusion, black hemodialysis
   patients in the United States are particularly susceptible to gradients
   in income and residential segregation. Interventions directed at highly
   segregated black neighborhoods might favorably affect hemodialysis
   patient outcomes. J Am Soc Nephrol 24: 293-301, 2013. doi:

AB In the state of Michigan, people infected with HIV are required by law
   to disclose their HIV-positive status to their sexual partners. Michigan
   public health laws enacted in the 1980s provide guidance for health
   officials tasked with investigating and managing what are termed "health
   threat to others" cases. Based on interviews with local health officials
   responsible for managing "health-threat" cases, I argue that the
   surveillance strategies employed by officials to identify these cases
   can be understood as an important site of social control. The first,
   "formal" technique for controlling HIV-positive residents involves
   health officials in a minority of participating jurisdictions actively
   cross-referencing epidemiological surveillance technologies such as HIV
   testing and contact tracing in order to identify potential health-threat
   cases. The second, "informal" technique is characterized by "third
   party" phone reports received by health officials from local residents
   who accuse others in their community, who they suspect are HIV positive,
   of not disclosing. Through an original analysis of the strategies
   employed by health officials to control HIV-positive residents, this
   article brings the theoretical insights of the sociological literature
   on social control to bear on the field of public health.

AB What social and political conditions help explain the number of white
   supremacist groups? This study uses pooled time-series cross-sectional
   methods to assess the explanatory power of three racial threat accounts.
   First, since lynchings indicated intense animosity against blacks that
   may persist, anti-black hate groups should be especially numerous where
   lynching rates were substantial in the distant past. Second, where or
   when white political and cultural dominance is threatened by large or
   growing black populations, additional white supremacist groups should be
   present. And third, these anti-black movements often recruit by
   emphasizing the links between race and violent street crime. Since the
   public mistakenly believes that most violent crimes are committed by
   blacks who victimize whites, larger numbers of hate groups should be
   present where murder rates are most substantial. With other
   theoretically plausible determinants such as unemployment and college
   completion rates held constant, the results confirm these three threat
   theory predictions.

AB Childhood adversity can have powerful effects on health over the life
   course. Persistent changes in cell-mediated immune function may be one
   pathway linking adverse childhood experiences with later disease risk.
   However, limited research has examined childhood adversity in relation
   to cell-mediated immune function, and in particular, immune response to
   latent viruses in adulthood. The present study investigated the
   association of two types of childhood adversity, socioeconomic
   disadvantage during adolescence and abuse prior to age 18, with
   Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) antibody titers in a large nationally
   representative sample of young adults aged 24-32 years. Data were drawn
   from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health, Wave 4 (n =
   13,162). We examined the associations of three indicators of adolescent
   SES (parental education, household income, and occupational status) and
   frequency and timing of physical and sexual abuse with EBV antibodies,
   controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and presence of a smoker in
   the household during adolescence. Lower parental occupational status and
   some categories of lower education were associated with elevated EBV
   antibodies (p < .05), and individuals who reported sexual abuse that
   occurred more than 10 times had elevated EBV antibodies relative to
   individuals who were not sexually abused (p = 0.03). Among individuals
   exposed to physical abuse, those who were first abused at age 3-5 years
   had heightened EBV antibodies relative to those first abused during
   adolescence (p = 0.004). This study extends prior research linking early
   adversity and immune function, and provides initial evidence that
   childhood adversity has a persistent influence on immune responses to
   latent infection in adulthood. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Previous findings have linked lower socioeconomic status (SES) with
   elevated morbidity and mortality. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL), which
   also has been associated with age-related disease morbidity and
   mortality, is a marker of aging at the cellular level, making it a
   valuable early biomarker of risk and an indicator of biological age. It
   is hypothesized that SES will be associated with LTL, indicating that
   SES influences disease risk by accelerating biological aging. In the
   present sample we test for associations of childhood SES and adult SES
   (i.e. education, income, home ownership) with LTL, and examine whether
   these associations vary by racial/ethnic group. Analyses on 963 subjects
   (18.7% White, 53% Hispanics, and 28.5% African American) from the stress
   ancillary study of the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis revealed a
   significant difference in LTL between home owners and renters in
   Hispanic and White participants (p < .05), but not amongst African
   Americans (p = .98). There were no linear associations of adult
   education or family income with LTL, however, there was an inverse
   association between father's education and LTL (p = .03). These findings
   suggest that for Whites and Hispanics renting vs. owning a home is
   associated with an older biological age; however we did not replicate
   previous findings linking education with LTL. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

   This, combined with the observation that most children, including those

   led researchers to recognize the potential of computer technology as an
   effective and efficient tool in research and treatment. This paper
   reviews the use of computer-assisted technology (CAT), excluding
   strictly internet-based approaches, to enhance social, communicative,
   and language development in individuals with ASD by dividing the vast
   literature into four main areas: language, emotion recognition, theory
   of mind, and social skills. Although many studies illustrate the
   tremendous promise of CAT to enhance skills of individuals with ASD,
   most lack rigorous, scientific assessment of efficacy relative to

AB Current sociobiological thought suggests that significant components of
   mate selection are based on indicators that correlate with the ability
   to produce and support offspring. Theorists have suggested that men tend
   to be attracted to and marry younger women, while women tend to be
   attracted to and marry older men. This behavior is referred to as age
   hypergamy. I complicate this picture by using gay men as a population in
   which to explore alternative components of mate selection as reflected
   in our behavior. Analyses of 120 dating advertisements from gay men and
   heterosexual men and women indicated that there exists a good measure of
   hypergamic age preference that is comparable to the heterosexual
   population and that relates to subjects' gender presentation. Data
   suggest that the biological-reproductive theory of age hypergamy is
   incomplete and support a cultural reproduction model of gender role
   behavior and preference in both heterosexuals and homosexuals.

AB Objective The nature of interpersonal relationships, whether supportive
   or critical, may affect the association between health status and mental
   health outcomes. We examined the potential moderating effects of social
   support, as a buffer, and family criticism, as an exacerbating factor,
   on the association between illness burden, functional impairment and
   depressive symptoms. Methods Our sample of 735 older adults, 65?years
   and older, was recruited from internal and family medicine primary care
   offices. Trained interviewers administered the Hamilton Rating Scale for
   Depression, Duke Social Support Inventory, and Family Emotional
   Involvement and Criticism Scale. Physician-rated assessments of health,
   including the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale and Cumulative Illness
   Rating Scale, were also completed. Results Linear multivariable
   hierarchical regression results indicate that social interaction was a
   significant buffer, weakening the association between illness burden and
   depressive symptoms, whereas perceived social support buffered the
   relationship between functional impairment and depressive symptoms.
   Family criticism and instrumental social support were not significant
   moderators. Conclusions Type of medical dysfunction, whether illness or
   impairment, may require different therapeutic and supportive approaches.
   Enhancement of perceived social support, for those who are impaired, and
   encouragement of social interactions, for those who are ill, may be
   important intervention targets for treatment of depressive symptoms in
   older adult primary care patients. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons,

   slowed, even reversing with a decline in health ratings as of late ( =
   -.014, P = .001). Significant interactions between race and time
   indicated that the racial difference on this self-rated health measure
   has changed over time. The rate of change in the difference has slowed
   over time ( = -.010, P = .021), suggesting that the reduction in the
   racial difference in self-rated health may be decelerating.

AB Background In multilevel studies, strong correlations of neighbourhood
   exposures with individual and neighbourhood confounders may generate
   problems with non-positivity (ie, inferences that are 'off-support').
   The authors used propensity restriction and matching to (1) assess the
   utility of propensity restriction to ensure analyses are 'on-support'
   and (2) examine the relation between collective efficacy and violence in
   a previously unstudied city.
   Methods Associations between neighbourhood collective efficacy and
   violent victimisation were estimated in data from New York City in 2005
   (n=4000) using marginal models and propensity matching.
   Results In marginal models adjusted for individual confounders and
   limited to observations 'on-support', under conditions of high
   collective efficacy, the estimated prevalence of violent victimisation
   was 3.5/100, while under conditions of low collective efficacy, it was
   7.5/100, resulting in a difference of 4.0/100 (95% CI 2.6 to 5.8). In
   propensity-matched analysis, the comparable difference was 4.0/100 (95%
   CI 2.1 to 5.9). In analyses adjusted for individual and neighbourhood
   confounders and limited to observations 'on-support', the difference in
   violent victimisation associated with collective efficacy was 3.1/100
   (95% CI 1.2 to 5.2) in marginal models and 2.4/100 (95% CI 0.2 to 4.5)
   in propensity-matched analysis. Analyses without support restrictions
   produced surprisingly similar results.
   Conclusions Under conditions of high collective efficacy, there was
   about half the prevalence of violence compared with low collective
   efficacy. The results contribute to a growing body of evidence that
   suggests collective efficacy may shape violence, and illustrate how
   careful techniques can be used to disentangle exposures from highly
   correlated confounders without relying on model extrapolation.

   (31.5%) underwent radical prostatectomy at hospitals without robotic
   surgery. There was a marked increase in radical prostatectomy at
   hospital adopters from 55.8% in 2006 and 70.7% in 2007 to 76.1% in 2008
   (p < 0.001 for trend). After adjusting for patient and hospital
   features, lower odds of undergoing radical prostatectomy at hospitals
   with robotic surgery were seen in black patients (OR 0.81, p < 0.001)
   and Hispanic patients (OR 0.77, p < 0.001) vs white patients. Compared
   to having private health insurance, being primarily insured with
   Medicaid (OR 0.70, p < 0.001) was also associated with lower odds of
   being treated at hospitals with robotic surgery.
   Conclusions: Although there was a rapid shift of patients who underwent
   radical prostatectomy to hospitals with robotic surgery from 2006 to
   2008, black and Hispanic patients or those primarily insured by Medicaid
   were less likely to undergo radical prostatectomy at such hospitals.

AB Population aging and subsequent projected large increases in chronic
   conditions will be important health concerns in low- and middle-income
   countries. Although evidence is accumulating, little is known regarding
   the impact of poor early-life conditions on older adult (50 years and
   older) health in these settings. A systematic review of 1141 empirical
   studies was conducted to identify population-based and community studies
   in low- and middle-income countries, which examined associations between
   early-life conditions and older adult health. The resulting review of 20
   studies revealed strong associations between (1) in utero/early infancy
   exposures (independent of other early life and adult conditions) and
   adult heart disease and diabetes; (2) poor nutrition during childhood
   and difficulties in adult cognition and diabetes; (3) specific childhood
   illnesses such as rheumatic fever and malaria and adult heart disease
   and mortality; (4) poor childhood health and adult
   functionality/disability and chronic diseases; (5) poor childhood
   socioeconomic status (SES) and adult mortality, functionality/disability
   and cognition; and (6) parental survival during childhood and adult
   functionality/disability and cognition. In several instances,
   associations remained strong even after controlling for adult SES and
   lifestyle. Although exact mechanisms cannot be identified, these studies
   reinforce to some extent the importance of early-life environment on
   health at older ages. Given the paucity of cohort data from the
   developing world to examine hypotheses of early-life conditions and
   older adult health, population-based studies are relevant in providing a
   broad perspective on the origins of adult health.

   to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. This study
   examines the rates of HIV and syphilis infections and associated
   socio-demographic and behavioral factors among migrant MSM in China.
   Data from 307 migrant MSM were collected in Beijing, China. Blood
   specimens were collected to test for HIV and syphilis infections. HIV
   and syphilis rates were 5.9% and 20.2%, respectively. Multivariate
   logistic regression analyses showed that having ever been married,
   living a longer period in Beijing, having more sexual partners, and
   having a foreign MSM friend were significantly associated with HIV
   infection. Migrating from a rural area, experiencing one's sexual debut
   at an older age, having a male as first sexual partner, having more
   sexual partners, and being recruited from peer outreach and social
   network were associated with syphilis infection. Migrant MSM in China
   are at high risk for HIV and syphilis infections. HIV prevention
   programs targeting rural migrant MSM who have been married are needed.

AB With more than half of new infections occurring among youth, HIV/AIDS
   remains a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in Uganda.
   Semi-structured interviews were performed with 48 adolescents and 15
   adult key informants in a rural Ugandan community to identify influences
   on adolescent sexual decision-making. Inductive data analytic methods
   revealed five thematic influences: (1) social pressure, (2) decline of
   the Senga (a familial figure who traditionally taught female adolescents
   about how to run a household), (3) cultural barriers to condom use, (4)
   knowledge of HIV transmission and modes of prevention, and (5) a moral
   injunction against sex before marriage. Influences were classified as
   HIV/AIDS risk and protective factors and organized to form an
   explanatory framework of adolescent sexual risk-taking. Risk factors
   pull youth toward risky behavior, while protective factors push them
   away. Predominance of risk over protective influences explains
   persistent sexual risk-taking by Ugandan youth. HIV prevention programs
   designed for Ugandan adolescents should take competing factors and
   sociocultural and economic influences into account.

AB Objective: The primary goal was to test the hypothesis that limited
   social support (SS) is related to shorter leukocyte telomere length
   (LTL), particularly in an older adult population. Methods:
   Cross-sectional analyses were performed on 948 participants aged 45 to
   84 years at Examination 1 of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis
   (18.4% white, 53.1% Hispanics, and 28.5% African American). LTL was
   determined by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and SS was
   measured with the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease SS
   inventory. Results: Across the entire sample, SS was not associated with
   LTL (p = .87) after adjusting for demographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity,
   socioeconomic status), age x sex, age x race, health (body mass index,
   diabetes, pulse pressure), and life-style factors (smoking, physical
   activity, diet); however, the interaction term age (dichotomized) x SS
   was significant (p = .001). Stratification by age group revealed a
   positive association between SS (score range, 5-25) and LTL in the older
   (65-84 years; B[SE] = .005[.002]; p = .007) but not younger participants
   (45-64 years; p = .12) after adjusting for covariates. Conclusions:
   These results from a racially/ethnically diverse community sample of men
   and women provide initial evidence that low SS is associated with
   shorter LTL in adults aged 65 years and older and is consistent with the
   hypothesis that social environment may contribute to rates of cellular
   aging, particularly in late life.

AB This paper examines personal narratives in which homeless and formerly
   homeless people construct their companion animals as having changed or
   saved their lives. The analysis considers selfhood a narrative
   accomplishment, the strategic outcome rather than the source of the
   stories people tell. These particular stories employ the theme of
   redemption, in which tellers describe overcoming adversity to face a
   better future, with animals playing key roles. The analysis reveals the
   narrative elements through which animals become vehicles for redemption.
   As dependent others, animals encourage a sense of responsibility. As the
   providers of unconditional love, they reward the fulfillment of
   responsibility. And as silent witnesses, they keep the tellers from
   lapsing into risky behavior. Narratives that describe animals in these
   ways allow for the construction of a positive moral identity. They also
   indicate that commitment belongs among the recognized languages of
   redemption and highlight the social embeddedness of autobiographical
   experience.

AB Background: Physical inactivity is a growing public health problem, and
   the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality. Conversely,
   indigenous populations living traditional lifestyles reportedly engage
   in vigorous daily activity that is protective against non-communicable
   diseases. Here we analyze physical activity patterns among the Tsimane,
   forager-horticulturalists of Amazonian Bolivia with minimal heart
   disease and diabetes. We assess age patterns of adult activity among men
   and women, test whether modernization affects activity levels, and
   examine whether nascent obesity is associated with reduced activity.
   Methods and Findings: A factorial method based on a large sample of
   behavioral observations was employed to estimate effects of age, sex,
   body mass index, and modernization variables on physical activity ratio
   (PAR), the ratio of total energy expenditure to basal metabolic rate.
   Accelerometry combined with heart rate monitoring was compared to the
   factorial method and used for nighttime sampling. Tsimane men and women
   display 24 hr physical activity level (PAL) of 2.02-2.15 and 1.73-1.85,
   respectively. Little time was spent "sedentary'', whereas most activity
   was light to moderate, rather than vigorous. Activity peaks by the late
   twenties in men, and declines thereafter, but remains constant among
   women after the early teens. Neither BMI, fat free mass or body fat
   percentage are associated with PAR. There was no negative effect of
   modernization on physical activity.
   Conclusions: Tsimane display relatively high PALs typical of other
   subsistence populations, but of moderate intensity, and not outside the
   range of developed populations. Despite rapidly increasing socioeconomic
   change, there is little evidence that total activity has yet been
   affected. Overweight and obesity are more prevalent among women than
   men, and Spanish fluency is associated with greater obesity in women.
   The lack of cardiovascular disease among Tsimane is unlikely caused by
   activity alone; further study of diet, food intake and infectious
   disease is needed.

AB Wildland fire management in savanna landscapes increasingly incorporates
   indigenous knowledge to pursue strategies of controlled, prescriptive
   burning to control fuel loads. However, such participatory approaches
   are fraught with challenges because of contrasting views on the role of
   fire and the practices of prescribed burning between indigenous and
   state fire managers. Also, indigenous and state systems of knowledge and
   meanings associated with fire are not monolithic but instead
   characterized by conflicts and inconsistencies, which require new,
   communicative strategies in order to develop successful, intercultural
   approaches to fire management. This paper is based on long-term research
   on indigenous Pemon social constructs, rules and regulations regarding
   fire use, and traditional system of prescribed burning in the Gran
   Sabana, Venezuela. The authors review factors that act as constraints
   against successful intercultural fire management in the Gran Sabana,
   including conflicting perspectives on fire use within state agencies and
   in indigenous communities, and propose strategies for research and
   communicative planning to guide future efforts for more participatory
   and effective fire management. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB A common finding in social sciences is that member change hinders group
   functioning and performance. However, questions remain as to why member
   change negatively affects group performance and what are some ways to
   alleviate the negative effects of member change on performance? To
   answer these questions we conduct an experiment in which we investigate
   the effect of newcomers on a group's ability to coordinate efficiently.
   Participants play a coordination game in a four-person group for the
   first part of the experiment, and then two members of the group are
   replaced with new participants, and the newly formed group plays the
   game for the second part of the experiment. Our results show that the
   arrival of newcomers decreases trust among group members and this
   decrease in trust negatively affects group performance. Knowing the
   performance history of the arriving newcomers mitigates the negative
   effect of their arrival, but only when newcomers also know the oldtimers
   performance history. Surprisingly, in groups that performed poorly prior
   to the newcomers' arrival, the distrust generated by newcomers is mainly
   between oldtimers about each other rather than about the newcomers.

AB The complexity of chess matches has attracted broad interest since its
   invention. This complexity and the availability of large number of
   recorded matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of
   population-level learning of a complex system. We systematically
   investigate the move-by-move dynamics of the white player's advantage
   from over seventy thousand high level chess matches spanning over 150
   years. We find that the average advantage of the white player is
   positive and that it has been increasing over time. Currently, the
   average advantage of the white player is 0.17 pawns but it is
   exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic
   time scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move
   dependence of the white player's advantage and find that it is
   non-Gaussian, has long-ranged anti-correlations and that after an
   initial period with no diffusion it becomes super-diffusive. We find
   that the duration of the non-diffusive period, corresponding to the
   opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and exponentially
   approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time scale of
   130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning of
   the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent a
   characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value
   of 1.9, close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due
   to the increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players
   participating in major tournaments.

AB Background. Disparity in access to liver transplantation (LT) in the
   United States persists despite directives from the federal government to
   reduce geographic variation. We assessed the impact of socioeconomic
   status (SES) and traveling to alternative donation service areas (DSAs)
   on patient survival.
   Methods. A prospective cohort study integrating transplant registry and
   U. S. Census data was analyzed using multivariate linear Cox
   proportional hazards models. A separate matched-pairs analysis was used
   to assess the benefit of traveling on patient survival and
   transplantation rate.
   Results. High SES is associated with increased access to LT (adjusted
   hazard ratio [aHR], 1.05; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-1.08)
   and reduced mortality after waitlisting (aHR [95% CI], 0.88
   [0.85-0.93]). Increased access is mediated, in part, through inter-DSA
   travel. Travel was associated with high SES, white race, blood group O,
   private insurance, and residence in regions 1, 5, and 11. Transplant
   candidates in the highest SES quartile were approximately 70% more
   likely to travel (aHR [95% CI], 1.67 [1.43-1.97]) than those in the
   lowest SES quartile. Compared with matched control patients, travelers
   were 74% more likely to be transplanted (aHR [95% CI], 1.74 [1.56-1.94])
   and 20% less likely to die after listing (aHR [95% CI], 0.79
   [0.69-0.92]).
   Conclusion. High SES and inter-DSA travel are strongly associated with
   increased LT access and reduced mortality. Travelers are more likely to
   be sociodemographically advantaged and privately insured and to live in
   regions with reduced access to deceased-donor organs.

AB Objective: Pain without known pathology, termed "functional pain,"
   causes much school absenteeism, medication usage, and medical visits.
   Yet which adolescents are at risk is not well understood. Functional
   pain has been linked to childhood abuse, and sexual orientation minority
   youth (gay, lesbian, bisexual, "mostly heterosexual," and heterosexual
   with same-sex sexual contact) are more likely to be victims of childhood
   abuse than heterosexuals, thus may be at greater risk of functional
   pain.
   Methods: We examined sexual orientation differences in past-year
   prevalence of functional headache, pelvic, and abdominal pain and
   multiple sites of pain in 9,864 young adults (mean age = 23 years) from
   a large U. S. cohort. We examined whether childhood abuse accounted for
   possible increased risk of functional pain in sexual minority youth.
   Results: Sexual minority youth, except for gays and lesbians, were at
   higher risk of functional pelvic and abdominal pain and multiple sites
   of pain than heterosexuals. Gay and lesbian youth had elevated
   prevalence only of abdominal pain. Childhood abuse accounted for 14% to
   33% of increased experience of multiple sites of pain in minority youth.
   Conclusions: Youth who identify as "mostly heterosexual'' or bisexual or
   who identify as heterosexual and have had same-sex partners comprised
   18% of our sample. Clinicians should be aware that patients with these
   orientations are at elevated risk of functional pain and may be in need
   of treatment for sequelae of childhood abuse. Conventional
   categorization of sexual orientation as heterosexual or homosexual may
   fail to distinguish a large number of youth who do not wholly identify
   with either group and may be at elevated risk of health problems.

AB Wilson et al. provided a valuable systematic and meta-analytic review of
   the Triple P-Positive Parenting program in which they identified
   substantial problems in the quality of available evidence. Their review
   largely escaped unscathed after Sanders et al.'s critical commentary.
   However, both of these sources overlook the most serious problem with
   the Triple P literature, namely, the over-reliance on positive but
   substantially underpowered trials. Such trials are particularly
   susceptible to risks of bias and investigator manipulation of apparent
   results. We offer a justification for the criterion of no fewer than 35
   participants in either the intervention or control group. Applying this
   criterion, 19 of the 23 trials identified by Wilson et al. were
   eliminated. A number of these trials were so small that it would be
   statistically improbable that they would detect an effect even if it
   were present. We argued that clinicians and policymakers implementing
   Triple P programs incorporate evaluations to ensure that goals are being
   met and resources are not being squandered. Please see related articles

AB Social norms in humans constrain individual behaviors to establish
   shared expectations within a social group. Previous work has probed
   social norm violations and the feelings that such violations engender;
   however, a computational rendering of the underlying neural and
   emotional responses has been lacking. We probed norm violations using a
   two-party, repeated fairness game (ultimatum game) where proposers offer
   a split of a monetary resource to a responder who either accepts or
   rejects the offer. Using a norm-training paradigm where subject groups
   are preadapted to either high or low offers, we demonstrate that
   unpredictable shifts in expected offers creates a difference in
   rejection rates exhibited by the two responder groups for otherwise
   identical offers. We constructed an ideal observer model that identified
   neural correlates of norm prediction errors in the ventral striatum and
   anterior insula, regions that also showed strong responses to
   variance-prediction errors generated by the same model. Subjective
   feelings about offers correlated with these norm prediction errors, and
   the two signals displayed overlapping, but not identical, neural
   correlates in striatum, insula, and medial orbito-frontal cortex. These
   results provide evidence for the hypothesis that responses in anterior
   insula can encode information about social norm violations that
   correlate with changes in overt behavior (changes in rejection rates).
   Together, these results demonstrate that the brain regions involved in
   reward prediction and risk prediction are also recruited in signaling
   social norm violations.

AB The birth and decline of disciplines are critical to science and
   society. How do scientific disciplines emerge? No quantitative model to
   date allows us to validate competing theories on the different roles of
   endogenous processes, such as social collaborations, and exogenous
   events, such as scientific discoveries. Here we propose an agent-based
   model in which the evolution of disciplines is guided mainly by social
   interactions among agents representing scientists. Disciplines emerge
   from splitting and merging of social communities in a collaboration
   network. We find that this social model can account for a number of
   stylized facts about the relationships between disciplines, scholars,
   and publications. These results provide strong quantitative support for
   the key role of social interactions in shaping the dynamics of science.
   While several "science of science'' theories exist, this is the first
   account for the emergence of disciplines that is validated on the basis
   of empirical data.

AB Music moves us. Its kinetic power is the foundation of human behaviors
   as diverse as dance, romance, lullabies, and the military march. Despite
   its significance, the music-movement relationship is poorly understood.
   We present an empirical method for testing whether music and movement
   share a common structure that affords equivalent and universal emotional
   expressions. Our method uses a computer program that can generate
   matching examples of music and movement from a single set of features:
   rate, jitter (regularity of rate), direction, step size, and
   dissonance/visual spikiness. We applied our method in two experiments,
   one in the United States and another in an isolated tribal village in
   Cambodia. These experiments revealed three things: (i) each emotion was
   represented by a unique combination of features, (ii) each combination
   expressed the same emotion in both music and movement, and (iii) this
   common structure between music and movement was evident within and
   across cultures.

AB In the sociology of science and sociology of scientific knowledge, the
   decline of functionalism during the 1970s opened the field to a wide
   range of theoretical possibilities. However, a Marxist-influenced
   alternative to functionalism, interests analysis, quickly disappeared,
   and feminist-multicultural frameworks failed to achieved a dominant
   position in the field. Instead, functionalism was replaced by a variety
   of agency-based frameworks that focused on constructive or performative
   processes. The shift in the sociology of science from Mertonian
   functionalism to the poststrong program, agency-based sociology of
   scientific knowledge has parallels with the broader shift in political
   ideologies from social liberalism to neoliberalism. The argument is made
   in a way that is cognizant of the criticisms raised against interests
   analysis and avoids the "short circuit" of class imputation. Instead,
   the approach defends the potential for a more integrated approach to the
   structure-agency-meaning triangle in STS via the use of field sociology.

AB The sociology of language has been concerned primarily with the use of
   language in everyday interactions, resulting in important theoretical
   contributions, particularly to conversation analysis. In responding to
   Simon Susen's "Bourdieusian reflections on language: Unavoidable
   conditions of the real speech situation", which emphasizes the inherent
   "sociality" of symbolic forms, this article directs attention to an
   important location of language, namely to its role in public rituals or
   liturgies. Looking at the history of the Book of Common Prayer within
   the framework of symbolic violence, this article examines the power
   struggles over public rituals that over time came to shape the very
   notion of "Englishness" through shared, if contested, liturgical
   worship.

   Paso,Texas, and Juarez, Mexico to inform research on health-related
   stigma and interventions. Materials and methods. Semi-structured
   interviews to study TB-related stigma and the impact on access and
   health-seeking behaviors with 30 Mexican-origin adults (18 years and
   older) undergoing TB treatment. Results. Barriers to accessing health
   services for TB; emotional distress due to their deteriorated physical
   and emotional condition; reactions ranging from depression, sadness;
   doubt, anger, and fear of rejection; distancing, fear of contagion,
   stigma, and feeling of discriminated against, and isolation from loved
   ones were reported. Conclusion. Stigma associated with TB is a barrier
   to health care access and to quality of life in tuberculosis management.
   Stigma adversely shapes the experience of treatment and recovery. Stigma
   is not a naturally occurring phenomenon, but something created by people
   and as such it can be "un-done" by those people as part of a collective
   which comprises society.

AB Objective. To analyze menu labeling perception and food choices/health

   content were displayed in the food court of one of these markets.
   Materials and methods. Bivarate means analyses compared the surveyed
   population by market and by nativity status. The main predictors of
   menu-labeling influence were identified in the sample from the market
   that displayed labels. A separate analysis investigated food
   choices/health behaviors among immigrant cohorts by time of US
   residence. Results. Reading labels when shopping was one of the main
   predictors associated with menu labeling influence. Longer-stayed
   immigrants were more likely to afford "balanced meals", but they were
   also more likely to eat in fast food restaurants and less likely to
   engage into moderate/intense physical activity. Conclusions.While
   nativity was not a significant predictor of menu labeling influence on
   food choices, our findings suggest food choices/behaviors convergence
   among immigrant and US-born populations.

   with a consensus that the change would be feasible, result in improved

   specialists at CHC's and the continued barriers to hospital care for
   those without health insurance, the most effective way of improving the
   complete range of health services to undocumented immigrants is through
   immigration reform that will bring these workers under the other health

AB Purpose - The aim of this chapter is to argue that charisma is a
   collective representation, and that charismatic authority is a social
   status that derives more from the "recognition" of the followers than
   from the "magnetism" of the leaders. I contend further that a close
   reading of Max Weber shows that he, too, saw charisma in this light.
   Approach - I develop my argument by a close reading of many of the most
   relevant texts on the subject. This includes not only the renowned texts
   on this subject by Max Weber, but also many books and articles that
   interpret or criticize Weber's views.
   Findings - I pay exceptionally close attention to key arguments and
   texts, several of which have been overlooked in the past.
   Implications - Writers for whom charisma is personal magnetism tend to
   assume that charismatic rule is natural and that the full realization of
   democratic norms is unlikely. Authority, in this view, emanates from
   rulers unbound by popular constraint. I argue that, in fact, authority
   draws both its mandate and its energy from the public, and that rulers
   depend on the loyalty of their subjects, which is never assured. So
   charismatic claimants are dependent on popular choice, not vice versa.
   Originality - I advocate a "culturalist" interpretation of Weber, which
   runs counter to the dominant "personalist" account. Conventional
   interpreters, under the sway of theology or mass psychology, misread
   Weber as a romantic, for whom charisma is primal and undemocratic rule
   is destiny. This essay offers a counter-reading.

AB Purpose - To reexamine the Weber Thesis pertaining to the relationship
   between ascetic Protestantism - especially Calvinism - and modern
   capitalism, as between an economic "spirit" and an economic "structure,"
   in which the first is assumed to be the explanatory factor and the
   second the dependent variable.
   Design/methodology/approach - The chapter provides an attempt to combine
   theoretical-empirical and comparative-historical approaches to integrate
   theory with evidence supplied by societal comparisons and historically
   specific cases.
   Findings - The chapter identifies the general sociological core of the
   Weber Thesis as a classic endeavor in economic sociology (and thus
   substantive sociological theory) and separates it from its particular
   historical dimension in the form of an empirical generalization from
   history.
   I argue that such a distinction helps to better understand the puzzling
   double "fate" of the Weber Thesis in social science, its status of a
   model in economic sociology and substantive sociological theory, on the
   one hand, and its frequent rejection in history and historical
   economics, on the other. The sociological core of the Thesis,
   postulating that religion, ideology, and culture generally deeply impact
   economy, has proved to be more valid, enduring, and even paradigmatic,
   as in economic sociology, than its historical component establishing a
   special causal linkage between Calvinism and other types of ascetic
   Protestantism and the "spirit" and "structure" of modern capitalism in
   Western society at a specific point in history.
   Research limitations/implications - In addition to the two cases
   deviating from the Weber Thesis considered here, it is necessary to
   investigate and identify the validity of the Thesis with regard to
   concrete historical and empirical instances.
   Originality/value - The chapter provides the first effort to
   systematically analyze and distinguish between the sociological core and
   the historical components of the Weber Thesis as distinct yet
   intertwined components.

AB Purpose - Contemporary sociologists implicitly assume or explicitly
   state that classical social theorists shared the Enlightenment's
   optimistic vision that society would become more rational, free,
   ethical, and just overtime. I reexamine the primary works that laid the
   foundation for sociology and resituate them in their neo-Romantic
   origins.
   Design/methodology/approach - Close readings of formative texts are
   provided to revisit modernist critiques of social progress in turn of
   the century sociology. The works of Ferdinand Tonnies, Thorstein Veblen,
   Emile Durkheim, Georg Simmel, and Max Weber exemplify this tradition.
   Findings - Insights from social theory written during and around the
   neo-Romantic period mirrored the Zeitgeist, a time fascinated with
   irrationality, moral decay, unconsciousness, decadence, degeneration,
   cynicism, historical decline, and pessimism. However, classical
   sociology's pessimism should not be interpreted as anti-modern. Rather,
   it contributed to the Enlightenment's maturation.
   Research limitations/implications - Contemporary sociologists should
   recover the spirit of classical sociology's gloomy extension of the
   modern project and bring societal processes to consciousness through
   human reason, untainted by the fable of progress. Without rational
   grounds for optimism, the most honest and sincere way to preserve the
   hope for alternatives and emancipation is through the continuation and
   advancement of the pessimistic tradition. To formulate new disillusioned
   theories of society, sociology ought to draw from its ignored tragic
   legacy.
   Originality/value - Rather than accept accounts of classical
   sociologists as believers in progress, the tradition reveals a world of
   increasing disenchantment, atomization, anomie, alienation, confusion,
   quarrel, rationalization devoid of value, and unhappiness. Providing
   society thoughtful, systematic accounts of its own estrangement advances
   the project of modernity.

AB Purpose - The diversity of social forms both regionally and historically
   calls for a paradigmatic reassessment of concepts used to map human
   societies comparatively. By differentiating "social analytics" from
   "explanatory narratives," we can distinguish concept and generic model
   development from causal analyses of actual empirical phenomena. In so
   doing, we show how five heuristic models of " modes of social practices"
   enable such paradigmatic formation in sociology. This reinforces Max
   Weber's emphasis on the irreducible historicity of explanations in the
   social sciences.
   Methodology - Explanatory narrative.
   Findings - A paradigmatic consolidation of generalizing concepts, modes
   of social practices, ideal-type concepts, and generic models presents a
   range of "theoretical tools" capable of facilitating empirical analysis
   as flexibly as possible, rather than cramping their range with overly
   narrow conceptual strictures.
   Research implications - To render social theory as flexible for

   and methodological approaches in a highly pragmatic fashion.

AB Purpose - A synthesis of the various strands of macro-sociology that is
   commensurate with a more robust theory of evolutionary institutionalism.
   Design/methodology/approach - Drawing from what may be conceived of as
   classical institutionalism and from neo-evolutionary sociology and other
   related traditions, this chapter endeavors to provide a general theory
   of evolutionary institutionalism as an overview of institutions and
   institutional autonomy (along with the underlying forces driving the
   process of autonomy), to present a theory of institutional evolution
   that delineates the relevant units of selection and evolution, the types
   of mechanisms that facilitate institutional evolution, and a typology of
   the sources of variation.
   Findings - The chapter constitutes the attempt to provide a theoretical
   framework intended to engender an improved historical-comparative
   institutionalism inspired by the works of Max Weber and Herbert Spencer.
   Research limitations/implications - The purpose of the theoretical
   framework presented should not be misconstrued as a general, "grand"
   theory for the discipline of the sociology as a whole, but rather
   understood as the model of a common vocabulary for sociologists
   interested in macro-sociology, institutions, and socio-cultural
   evolution designed to complement other available models.
   Originality/value - As a synthesis, the originality of the theoretical
   framework presented lies in (1) elucidation of the idea that
   institutional autonomy as the "master" process of institutional
   evolution, (2) more precise delineation of the link between meso-level
   institutional entrepreneurs and institutional evolution, and (3)
   combination of a body of complementary - yet often loosely linked -
   bodies of scholarship.

AB A substantial and growing body of literature now exists on the
   socio-economic impacts of genetically engineered (GE) crops. While the
   bulk of literature has focused on the primary impacts of commercialised
   GE technology, in terms of changes in yields, costs and profitability,
   researchers have increasingly addressed a range of additional questions
   such as the distribution of impacts across groups, as well as secondary
   impacts on labour markets, non-pecuniary factors and social welfare.
   This review summarises the results of the literature on this broader set
   of socio-economic impacts. The primary findings include: adopters
   receive a substantial share of the benefits; consumers are also shown to
   benefit from increased production leading to lower prices; small farmers
   in developing countries are benefiting from GE crop technology; adopters
   report improvements in health, education, debt repayment, maternal care
   services and food security.

   law-focused movement, and reproductive justice, a social justice-aimed
   movement that emphasizes intersecting social identities (e. g., gender,
   race, and class) and community-developed solutions to structural
   inequalities. In examining the intertwining histories of the
   reproductive health, reproductive rights, and reproductive justice
   movements, we consider the relationship between law and social
   movements, including the limits of law to inform radical social
   movements. We highlight how the relationship between scholarship and
   activism on the right to not have children has expanded to include
   notions of the right to have children (e.g., for low-income people or
   with the aid of technology) and the right to parent with dignity (e. g.,
   for incarcerated people or in nonmedicalized settings). We end the
   article with a discussion of best practices and future directions for

AB Background: Emotional support has traditionally been conceived as
   something a breast cancer patient receives. However, this framework may
   obscure a more complex process, facilitated by the emerging social media
   environment, which includes the effects of composing and sending
   messages to others. Accordingly, this study explores the effects of
   expression and reception of emotional support messages in online groups
   and the importance of bonding as a mediator influencing the coping
   strategies of breast cancer patients.Methods: Data were collected as
   part of two National Cancer Institutefunded randomized clinical trials.
   Eligible subjects were within 2 months of diagnosis of primary breast
   cancer or recurrence. Expression and reception of emotionally supportive
   messages were tracked and coded for 237 breast cancer patients. Analysis
   resulted from merging 1) computer-aided content analysis of discussion
   posts, 2) action log analysis of system use, and 3) longitudinal survey
   data.Results: As expected, perceived bonding was positively related to
   all four coping strategies (active coping: beta = 0.251, P = .000;
   positive reframing: beta = 0.288, P = .000; planning: beta = 0.213, P =
   .006; humor: beta = 0.159, P = .009). More importantly, expression
   (gamma = -0.138, P = .027), but not reception (gamma = -0.018, P =
   .741), of emotional support increases perceived bonding, which in turn
   mediates the effects on patients positive coping strategies.Conclusion:
   There is increasing importance for scholars to distinguish the effects
   of expression from reception to understand the processes involved in
   producing psychosocial benefits. This study shows that emotional support
   is more than something cancer patients receive; it is part of an active,
   complex process that can be facilitated by social media.

   affect smokers selective exposure to and social sharing of those
   messages. Results from an experiment revealed that content features
   predicting smokers selection of antismoking messages are different from
   those predicting whether those messages are shared. Antismoking messages
   smokers tend to select are characterized by strong arguments (odds ratio
   = 2.02, P = .02) and positive sentiments (odds ratio = 3.08, P = .03).
   Once selected, the messages more likely to be retransmitted by smokers
   were those with novel arguments (B = .83, P = .002) and positive
   sentiments (B = 1.65, P = .005). This research adds to the literature
   about the content characteristics driving the social diffusion of
   antitobacco messages and contributes to our understanding of the role of
   persuasive messages about smoking cessation in the emerging public

   known about the usage and browsing patterns of those in poverty. We
   report on a randomized controlled trial that sheds light on the Internet
   use and browsing patterns among the urban poor.Methods The data come
   from 312 participants in Boston, Massachusetts, from Click to Connect, a
   study that examined the impact of an intervention that provided
   computers, Internet, and training to people from lower socioeconomic
   position (SEP). Data were gathered through pre- and posttest surveys and
   Internet use tracking software that generated approximately 13 million
   network activity files and more than 5.5 million records.Results
   Internet use increased among Intervention participants, with most of
   their time spent on social and participatory media sites or Internet
   portals. Differential patterns of use by gender and race/ethnicity were
   observed. Purposive searching for health information was low among all
   participants. Most of the visits to health-related sites were to local
   hospitals' sites suggesting the influence of possible preexisting
   relationships and trust. Social networking sites were frequently
   visited, with three sites enjoying similar popularity among all
   groups.Conclusions Our data show that the availability of Internet can
   lead to significant increase in its use among low SEP groups. Low SEP
   members used the Internet for participation and engagement, but the
   sites visited differed by group. Harnessing the power of social
   networking sites and shareware sites may be a way to increase access to
   health information.

AB Background An increasing number of behavioral and psychosocial cancer
   interventions incorporate new media elements that are digital,
   networked, and interactive. However, it is unclear to what extent new
   media is being leveraged to benefit underserved racial and ethnic groups
   who disproportionately bear the burden of cancer. This inquiry is timely
   in light of growing evidence that these groups are receptive to new
   media. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the
   inclusion of these groups in research on cancer-related new media
   interventions and use of new media to reduce racial and ethnic cancer
   disparities.Methods A systematic search of three databases was conducted
   for articles published between January 2000 and March 2012 that
   presented studies of user experience with a behavioral or psychosocial
   cancer-related intervention with at least one new media
   component.Results Thirty-six articles were included in the final review.
   In about one-quarter of the studies, less than 20% of participants were
   African American, Latino, Asian American, or American Indian. In less
   than 10% of the studies, 80% or more of the samples were members of the
   aforementioned groups. Almost one-third of the studies reviewed were
   categorized as disparity focused but limited data were available on
   racial and ethnic differences in responses to new media
   interventions.Conclusions Findings suggest that the promise and
   potential of new media cancer interventions are largely unrealized among
   the underserved. Additional research is needed to investigate a wide
   range of issues related to the development and delivery of such
   interventions in diverse racial and ethnic groups.

AB Public participation plays a role in the development and long-term
   maintenance of environmental institutions that are well-matched to local
   social-ecological conditions. However, the means by which public
   participation impacts such institutional fit remains unclear. We argue
   that one major reason for this lack of clarity is that analysts have not
   clearly outlined how humankind's sense of agency, or self-determination,
   influences institutional outcomes. Moreover, the concept of
   institutional fit is ambiguous as to what constitutes a good fit and how
   such fit could be diagnosed or improved. This is especially true for
   "social fit," or how well institutions match human expectations and
   local behavioral patterns. We develop an interdisciplinary framework
   based on principles of human agency and institutional analysis from
   social psychology to address these problems. Using the concept of
   "institutional acceptance" as an indicator of social fit, we show how
   analysts can define, diagnose, and improve social fit of participatory
   programs. We also show how such fit emerges and is sustained over time.
   This interdisciplinary perspective on fit and participation has
   important implications for participatory approaches to environmental
   management and the scientific study of institutional evolution.

AB Social-ecological resilience is an increasingly central paradigm for
   understanding sustainable resource management. In this study, we aimed
   to better understand the effect of environmental variability on the
   resilience of fishery systems, and the important role that social
   institutions and biophysical constraints play. To explore these issues,
   we built a dynamic model of the pen shell fishery of the indigenous Seri
   people in the Gulf of California, Mexico. This model included the
   dynamics of the two dominant species in the fishery (Atrina tuberculosa
   and Pinna rugosa), several institutional rules that the Seri use, and a
   number of ecological constraints, including key stochastic variables
   derived from empirical data. We found that modeling with multiple
   species, rather than the standard species model, uncovered more of the
   resilience that is present in the system. We also found that it is the
   combination of several social-ecological rules working in conjunction
   with the endogenous environmental variability that helps ensure the
   resilience of the system.

AB Fishing cooperatives (co-ops) and patron-client relationships are the
   most common cooperative and noncooperative strategies for
   self-governance for small-scale fisheries around the world. We studied
   what drives fishers to choose between these two self-governance
   arrangements in 12 communities in the Gulf of California, Mexico. The
   communities depend on similar fishing resources, are located in
   contiguous portions of the coast, fish roughly the same species, have
   similar socioeconomic characteristics, and sell to similar markets, yet
   half of the fisheries are organized around co-ops and the other half
   work through patron-client arrangements. Using participant observation,
   in-depth interviews of key informants between 1995-2008, and a survey of
   55% of the fisheries in the study area, we found that the presence of
   high transaction costs of commercialization, the desire to acquire
   fishing licenses, and the existence of traditions of successful
   collective action among fishing groups within each community strongly
   influence fishers' choices regarding membership in fishing co-ops. We
   also examined the implications of our findings for conservation of
   fishing resources. Given that the emergence of co-ops was associated
   with high transaction costs of commercialization, we hypothesize that
   cooperative strategies are more likely than patron-client strategies to
   emerge in communities in isolated locations. In an era of globalization,
   in which the rate of development and urbanization will increase in
   coastal areas, patron-client strategies are likely to become more
   prevalent among fisheries, but such self-governance strategies are
   thought to be less conducive to conservation behaviors.

AB Building models is an important way of integrating knowledge. Testing
   and updating models of social-ecological systems can inform management
   decisions and, ultimately, improve resilience. We report on the outcomes
   of a six-year, multidisciplinary model development process in the
   sagebrush steppe, USA. We focused on creating state-and-transition
   models (STMs), conceptual models of ecosystem change that represent
   nonlinear dynamics and are being adopted worldwide as tools for managing
   ecosystems. STM development occurred in four steps with four distinct
   sets of models: (1) local knowledge elicitation using semistructured
   interviews; (2) ecological data collection using an observational study;
   (3) model integration using participatory workshops; and (4) model
   simplification upon review of the literature by a multidisciplinary
   team. We found that different knowledge types are ultimately
   complementary. Many of the benefits of the STM-building process flowed
   from the knowledge integration steps, including improved communication,
   identification of uncertainties, and production of more broadly credible
   STMs that can be applied in diverse situations. The STM development
   process also generated hypotheses about sagebrush steppe dynamics that
   could be tested by future adaptive management and research. We conclude
   that multidisciplinary development of STMs has great potential for
   producing credible, useful tools for managing resilience of
   social-ecological systems. Based on this experience, we outline a
   streamlined, participatory STM development process that integrates
   multiple types of knowledge and incorporates adaptive management.

AB Anthropology has always had as one of its goals the explanation of human
   cultural diversity across space and through time. Over the past several
   decades, there has been a growing appreciation among anthropologists and
   other social scientists that the phylogenetic approaches that biologists
   have developed to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of species
   are useful tools for building and explaining patterns of human
   diversity. Phylogenetic methods offer a means of creating testable
   propositions of heritable continuity - how one thing is related to
   another in terms of descent. Such methods have now been applied to a
   wide range of cultural phenomena, including languages, projectile
   points, textiles, marital customs, and political organization. Here we
   discuss several cultural phylogenies and demonstrate how they were used
   to address long-standing anthropological issues. Even keeping in mind
   that phylogenetic trees are nothing more than hypotheses about
   evolutionary relationships, some researchers have argued that when it
   comes to cultural behaviors and their products, tree building is
   theoretically unwarranted. We examine the issues that critics raise and
   find that they in no way sound the death knell for cultural phylogenetic
   work.

AB Heritability, the fraction of phenotypic variance attributable to the
   action of genes, is usually derived from a linear statistical partition
   of variance. In this paper we study a dichotomous phenotype whose
   transmission from parents to offspring depends on the parents'
   phenotypes and the offspring's genotype. Each individual is then
   represented as a phenogenotype. We derive expressions for each component
   of phenotypic variance and for covariances between relatives of various
   degrees. The resulting heritability estimates vary with the rates of
   phenotypic transmission as well as with the genetic contribution to the
   phenotype. Assortative mating by phenotype in parents is also shown to
   contribute to the correlations between relatives. In addition, we show
   that the frequency of alleles at genes affecting the phenotypes strongly
   affects standard heritability measures. This is important because for
   most complex traits these allele frequencies cannot be ascertained.

   2010 with the aim of delineating socioecological constraints on and
   firesetter preferences for the timing and placement of ignitions.
   Unauthorized fires represent complex phenomena through which actors
   compete over social and ecological outcomes that transcend the
   spatiotemporal confines of individual fires themselves. Current
   classificatory systems define unauthorized firesetting behavior as
   irrational, destructive, and malicious. Because landscape fires cause
   both positive and negative consequences for biological diversity and
   ecosystems services, perceived costs and benefits of fires are
   contestable and relative to point of view. The locational and temporal
   patterns of unauthorized landscape fires examined in this study do not
   show firesetter preferences for maximizing damage to landscapes.
   Instead, unauthorized fires in Georgia potentially contribute to the
   maintenance of landscapes adapted to frequent, dormant-and early
   growing-season fire regimes.

AB The Anatomische Gesellschaft (anatomical society, AG) was founded in
   Germany in 1886 as an international society and remains the main
   organizing body of German anatomists to this day. A previous study of
   the history of the AG during National Socialism (NS) was based on the
   published proceedings of the AG and drew the preliminary conclusion that
   the "AG did not follow the path of preemptive obedience toward the new
   rulers" in contrast to some other professional societies. However, it
   was noted that archival sources were needed to support this conclusion
   and to illustrate the decision process within the society. Such sources
   are now available in the estate papers of Alfred Benninghoff, a leading
   anatomist at the time. His correspondence supports the previous finding
   that the AG was able to maintain its international character, thereby
   enabling it to avoid the active exclusion of "non-Aryan" members. The
   papers also confirm that the AG did not defend its vulnerable members as
   valiantly as the official narrative suggests, a fact illustrated in a
   controversy surrounding Martin Heidenhain. The interactions and
   conflicts between the leaders of the AG can now be reconstructed, i.e.
   between the secretary of the AG Heinrich von Eggeling, Benninghoff and
   Hermann Stieve. The Benninghoff documents also refer to a meeting of a
   subsection of the AG in November 1942, at which a disturbing
   radicalization of some anatomists developed. Finally, the papers reflect
   the political realities for German professionals trying to re-establish
   their science in a country divided into four occupation zones. (C) 2013

AB In complex social-ecological systems, human and physical processes
   mutually condition one another through co-adaptation at multiple scales
   from the local to the global. For this paper we modified a
   driver-response conceptual model of social-ecological interactions by
   considering the degree to which each binary set of processes (human or
   physical) is simultaneously a driver and a response to global change.
   Processes that we understood to be mutually conditioned offered greater
   potential compared to solely social or ecological communities to adapt
   to demographic and economic change, on the one hand, and to climate,
   water resources, and ecosystems dynamics, on the other. By considering
   case material from the United States-Mexico border region, we
   characterized social-ecological interactions along a continuum from
   those acting exclusively as drivers to others reacting to change
   primarily as responses. We considered water resources to integrate
   multiple global change processes including climate change and
   variability, ecosystem resilience, and human water demands for a variety
   of purposes. Thus, we examined in detail two watersheds in the
   Arizona-Sonora borderlands representing mutually conditioned
   social-ecological systems. First, the Rio Magdalena in Sonora
   represented an illustrative case of smallholder agriculture and rural
   livelihoods engaged in social-ecological interaction that exhibited both
   driver and response elements centered on reflexive, low-impact adaptive
   strategies. Second, in Ambos Nogales relying on the Santa Cruz River and
   its associated aquifers, urban growth, the equity of water access for
   human purposes, and environmental quality represented especially
   pressing challenges. Here, human impacts on ecosystems were the
   predominant drivers although there was growing concern for the
   medium-and longer-term implications of climate change. Adaption planning
   in Ambos Nogales was centered on infrastructure-based solutions
   including an inter-basin water transfer connection with the Rio
   Magdalena. Wastewater flows to riparian corridors posed a particular
   challenge for human-environment interactions. Cross-border collaboration
   represents an important opportunity for adaptation based on the mutually
   conditioned interactions presented here. We summarized the analysis of
   both cases by raising conceptual questions for further enquiry and for
   adaptation and planning that are generic for the borderlands and beyond.

AB The sociology of education has various traditions which examine the
   connections between education, culture, and inequality. Two of these
   traditions, symbolic interactionism and critical theory, tend to ignore
   each other. This paper creates a dialogue between these traditions by
   applying symbolic interactionist (SI) and radical interactionist (RSI)
   sensibilities to an important study for resistance theory, Paul Willis'
   classic ethnography Learning to Labor (1977). The SI reading of Learning
   to Labor emphasizes the importance of group interactions and the
   creation of meaning, while the RSI reading highlights how domination
   unfolds in social interaction. We argue that SI and RSI have much to
   offer Learning to Labor, as these readings can avoid some of the
   critiques commonly leveled on the book regarding the linkage between
   theory and data, structure and agency, and the book's conceptualization
   of culture. Likewise, we argue that the data in Learning to Labor have
   much to offer SI and RSI, as the material provides grist to further
   understand the role of symbols in domination while identifying
   escalating dominance encounters that create a set of patterned
   interactions that we describe as a "grinding'' social order.

   children and adults in detailed racial/ethnic, immigrant, and
   socioeconomic groups in the USA. Prevalence and adjusted odds derived
   from logistic regression were used to examine social inequalities.
   Disability rates varied from 1.4% for Japanese children to 6.8% for
   Puerto Rican children. Prevalence of disability in adults ranged from
   5.6% for Asian Indians to 22.0% among American Indians/Alaska Natives.
   More than 17% of Korean, Mexican, and American Indian children lacked
   health insurance, compared with 4.1% of Japanese and 5.9% of white
   children. Among adults, Mexicans (43.6%), Central/South Americans
   (41.4%), American Indians/Alaska Natives (32.7%), and Pakistanis (29.3%)
   had the highest health-uninsurance rates. Ethnic nativity disparities
   were considerable, with 58.3% of all Mexican immigrants and 34.0% of
   Mexican immigrants with disabilities being uninsured. Socioeconomic
   gradients were marked, with poor children and adults having 3-6 times
   higher odds of disability and uninsurance than their affluent
   counterparts. Socioeconomic differences accounted for 24.4% and 60.2% of
   racial/ethnic variations in child health insurance and disability and
   75.1% and 89.7% of ethnic inequality in adult health insurance and
   disability, respectively. Health policy programs urgently need to tackle
   these profound social disparities in disability and healthcare access.

AB Understanding socio-ecological characteristics associated with rivers
   and their catchments, and using that understanding to effectively manage
   and restore river ecosystems, is an increasingly complex challenge.
   While great strides have been made in the last half century in
   understanding rivers as ecological systems, human exploitation of river
   water and riparian zones have frustrated river management to the point
   that many native species are imperiled or have become extinct, invasive
   species are rampant, water and sediment quality are in significant
   decline, environmental flows are neglected, and economic pressures are
   placing unprecedented demands on remaining resources. At the same time,
   there are societal expectations that river resources be restored or
   rehabilitated(1) to functional states, even while climate change,
   population growth, flow diversion, and the proliferation of chemicals
   impose additional burdens in ways that are not adequately understood.
   Therein lies one of the great challenges of this century. Can river
   systems be realistically restored or rehabilitated and, if so, what are
   the approaches and scales that have a chance of being successful? The
   2013 E. Baldi lecture addresses these questions by examining 2 examples
   of river restoration: identifying socio-ecological attributes from those
   examples that have been successful as well as aspects needing
   improvement, and presenting principles for improving river restoration
   in highly complex situations. The principles are designed to enhance
   resilience and promote adaptive capacity within social-ecological
   systems-systems that continue to evolve.

AB Charles Tilly (1929-2008) was a pioneer in joining sociology and
   history. Throughout his career, he was especially concerned with the
   ways in which ordinary people made political claims, and how this was
   shaped by transformations in the state and in capitalism. Most often
   seen as a structuralist, Tilly was nevertheless deeply concerned with
   how to understand actors. This article traces Tilly's work from early
   research on French contention through his later, synthetic work on
   mechanisms and regimes to show how Tilly's understanding of actors,
   agency, culture, and social construction developed. Further, we show how
   this development went hand in hand with Tilly's development of
   distinctive methodological approaches to historical and sociological
   data.

   of the study of morality in cognate fields. We identify important
   treatments of morality, some of which are not explicitly so, and
   identify those treatments that build a distinctly sociological focus on
   morality: room for culturally divergent understandings of its content, a
   focus on antecedent social factors that shape it, and a concern with

AB Sociology frequently presumes interest-oriented action but deconstructs
   interests. Here, we argue for more inquiry into the social conditions
   under which interest-oriented action is generated. We analyze how
   interest-oriented action is understood in classical sociology, rational
   choice theory, social exchange theory, and cultural sociology. These
   perspectives vary in the extent to which interests are an explanatory
   principle, how interests are considered, and how emergent social
   formations are explained. However, they share an implicit recognition
   that the question of when interest-oriented action emerges needs more
   attention. Rather than naturalizing interest-oriented action, or
   investigating how interests are constructed, the most productive
   direction for future sociological research on interests is to specify
   better when action oriented to interests becomes normative.

   of sociology. We consider several of the key theories that define the
   core and boundaries of the field, calling attention to debates and
   unresolved questions. We contend that two of the defining features of
   this field are (a) attention to the inseparability of human and nonhuman
   natures and (b) attention to the role that power and social inequality
   play in shaping human/nonhuman interactions. These two characteristics
   of environmental sociology also reveal strong links between this field
   and the broader discipline, in light of recent reexaminations of
   classical sociological writings. We conclude with a consideration of new
   directions environmental sociologists might take toward building an even

AB Epigenetics is a burgeoning area of biomedical research into the
   mechanisms by which genes are regulated-how the activity of producing
   proteins is controlled. Although molecular epigenetic research is highly
   biochemical, it is of interest to sociologists because some epigenetic
   changes are environmentally mediated and can persist across the life
   span or into further generations. Environmental epigenetic research
   tracks mechanisms by which social forces-from pollution to nutrition to
   mothering to traumatic experience-become molecularly embodied, affect
   gene expression, and induce durable changes in behavior and health. We
   begin with an introduction to the science of environmental epigenetics
   focused on articulating the logic of experimentation and explanation in
   this field. Turning to sociologists' key interests, we review the
   growing literature on epigenetics of socioeconomic status. Finally, we
   consider how epigenetics offers opportunities and challenges for

   book Beyond a Boundary as a foundational text for the critical sociology
   of race and sport. Two paradigms of research on race and sport are
   sketched: the critical and the functionalist-evolutionary. The article
   then reviews the major contributions to the study of race and sport from
   three areas, namely mainstream American sociology, the sociology of
   race, and the sociology of sport, focusing primarily on the research
   published since 2000. The article concludes by looking at future
   directions of work in the field, suggesting that although sport remains
   marginal to mainstream American sociology and the insights of scholars
   such as James remain overlooked, the best work on race and sport will
   continue to emerge from the subfield of sport studies.

AB The study of housing has a long history in sociology, but since the
   1960s, it has been relatively hidden in a number of sociological
   subfields and scattered across a range of disciplines. The financial
   crisis of 2008 elevated housing issues to the level of national and
   international debate and protest, and it offers a framework for
   organizing the scholarship on housing into that which studies housing as
   a commodity, on one hand, and as a right, on the other. In the former
   category, I review the literature on mortgage financing; property values
   and wealth; and affordable rental housing, foreclosures, and evictions.
   In the latter category, I discuss the theoretical arguments for a right
   to housing and review the research on activist demands for that right.
   The tension between these two aspects of housing is discussed
   throughout. I conclude by proposing the actual home or apartment as a
   productive area for new sociological analysis.

   supportive caregivers go about navigating this state of affairs? What
   types of patient-doctor/healthcare professional relationships hinder or
   enhance effective patient decision making? These are the themes we
   explore in this study by following patients through the sequence of
   experiencing symptoms, seeking a diagnosis, evaluating treatment
   protocols, and receiving treatments. In general, three genres of
   culturally available narratives are revealed in the data: strategic,
   technoluxe, and unbearable health narratives.

AB Symbolical-interaction sociology is useful to mediators and relevant to
   mediation practice. It explores the elements of everyday social
   interaction including behavior of disputants during instances of
   conflict. In particular, Erving Goffman's frame analysis offers
   mediators a practical tool useful in assessing and managing both the
   intellectual and emotional responses of disputants during mediation.
   Moreover, frame analysis can effectively guide mediators in assisting
   disputants to reorient their respective responses to each other and to
   the dispute, thereby enhancing opportunities for meaningful dialogue. In
   addition, Goffman's game, drama, and ritual metaphors offer simple but
   powerful analytic tools guiding mediation clients through terrain which
   would otherwise be chaotic and overwhelming. Mediators committed to
   enhancing their practices and researchers in search of a sound
   theoretical base for effective dispute resolution can benefit
   substantially by applying these insights to the practice of mediation.

AB This piece is a review of the animal selfhood literature in sociology,
   organized into four main parts. First, I review the sociological
   literature of human-animal interactions, in which sociologists claim
   that animals possess selves. Second, I review how sociologists have
   referred to the self, from which I construct five criteria of selfhood,
   including self as attribution, self-awareness, intersubjectivity,
   self-concept/reflexivity, and narration. Third, I address how animals
   have selves using these criteria, drawing on sociological and
   ethological evidence. Fourth, I critique the animal interaction
   sociologists' specific claims of animal selfhood, including their
   epistemological failure to distinguish between human accounts of animal
   subjectivities and animal subjectivities, and their empirical failure to
   show how animals act toward themselves. Ultimately, I conclude that
   animal selves, particularly in an elemental Meadian sense, are
   potentially real, but in most cases are unobservable or unverifiable
   phenomena.

AB There has been some tendency to view decision science and resilience
   theory as opposing approaches, or at least as contending perspectives,
   for natural resource management. Resilience proponents have been
   especially critical of optimization in decision science, at least for
   those cases where it is focused on the aggressive pursuit of efficiency.
   In general, optimization of resource systems is held to reduce spatial,
   temporal, or organizational heterogeneity that would otherwise limit
   efficiency, leading to homogenization of a system and making it less
   able to cope with unexpected changes or disturbances. For their part,
   decision analysts have been critical of resilience proponents for not
   providing much practical advice to decision makers. We believe a key
   source of tension between resilience thinking and application of
   decision science is the pursuit of efficiency in the latter (i.e.,
   choosing the "best" management action or strategy option to maximize
   productivity of one or few resource components), vs. a desire in the
   former to keep options open (i.e., maintaining and enhancing diversity).
   It seems obvious, however, that with managed natural systems, there must
   be a principle by which to guide decision making, which at a minimum
   allows for a comparison of projected outcomes associated with decision
   alternatives. This is true even if the primary concern of decision
   making is the preservation of system resilience. We describe how a
   careful framing of conservation problems, especially in terms of
   management objectives and predictive models, can help reduce the
   purported tension between resilience thinking and decision analysis. In
   particular, objective setting in conservation problems needs to be more
   attuned to the dynamics of ecological systems and to the possibility of
   deep uncertainties that underlie the risk of unintended, if not
   irreversible, outcomes. Resilience thinking also leads to the suggestion
   that model development should focus more on process rather than pattern,
   on multiple scales of influence, and on phenomena that can create
   alternative stability regimes. Although we acknowledge the inherent
   difficulties in modeling ecological processes, we stress that
   formulation of useful models need not depend on a thorough mechanistic
   understanding or precise parameterization, assuming that uncertainty is
   acknowledged and treated in a systematic manner.

AB Globalization, the process by which local social-ecological systems
   (SESs) are becoming linked in a global network, presents policy
   scientists and practitioners with unique and difficult challenges.
   Although local SESs can be extremely complex, when they become more
   tightly linked in the global system, complexity increases very rapidly
   as multi-scale and multi-level processes become more important. Here, we
   argue that addressing these multi-scale and multi-level challenges
   requires a collection of theories and models. We suggest that the
   conceptual domains of sustainability, resilience, and robustness provide
   a sufficiently rich collection of theories and models, but overlapping
   definitions and confusion about how these conceptual domains articulate
   with one another reduces their utility. We attempt to eliminate this
   confusion and illustrate how sustainability, resilience, and robustness
   can be used in tandem to address the multi-scale and multi-level
   challenges associated with global change.

AB Interactions between distant places are increasingly widespread and
   influential, often leading to unexpected outcomes with profound
   implications for sustainability. Numerous sustainability studies have
   been conducted within a particular place with little attention to the
   impacts of distant interactions on sustainability in multiple places.
   Although distant forces have been studied, they are usually treated as
   exogenous variables and feedbacks have rarely been considered. To
   understand and integrate various distant interactions better, we propose
   an integrated framework based on telecoupling, an umbrella concept that
   refers to socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances.
   The concept of telecoupling is a logical extension of research on
   coupled human and natural systems, in which interactions occur within
   particular geographic locations. The telecoupling framework contains
   five major interrelated components, i.e., coupled human and natural
   systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects. We illustrate the framework
   using two examples of distant interactions associated with trade of
   agricultural commodities and invasive species, highlight the
   implications of the framework, and discuss research needs and approaches
   to move research on telecouplings forward. The framework can help to
   analyze system components and their interrelationships, identify
   research gaps, detect hidden costs and untapped benefits, provide a
   useful means to incorporate feedbacks as well as trade-offs and
   synergies across multiple systems (sending, receiving, and spillover
   systems), and improve the understanding of distant interactions and the
   effectiveness of policies for socioeconomic and environmental
   sustainability from local to global levels.

AB Generating new understandings of the contributions of W. E. B. Du Bois's
   The Philadelphia Negro (1899) for sociology and social science more
   generally, this article posits that the urban analysis provided in the
   book demonstrates how interwoven cultural and economic factors undergird
   the social organization of urban communities more so than any pragmatic
   economic pattern or logic. It is the interwoven nature of these factors
   (defined in this article as the counterintuitive economic logics of the
   study) that have been insufficiently acknowledged in recent decades of
   social scientific urban studies research. Exploring the interwoven
   nature of cultural and economic factors in the sustenance of
   Philadelphia's Black Seventh Ward, this article suggests that the agency
   of African Americans is a critical, yet undervalued, aspect of their
   urban living. This article situates W. E. B. Du Bois as the first of
   some later voices (mostly within urban ethnography) that offer a
   corrective and alternative to urban spatial conceptual frameworks that
   did not and do not fully account for the persistent influence of race
   and the agency of racial minorities on the landscape of American cities.

AB Altruistic behavior has been defined in economic terms as ". costly acts
   that confer economic benefits on other individuals"(Fehr & Fischbacher,
   2003). In a prisoner's dilemma game, cooperation benefits the group but
   is costly to the individual (relative to defection), yet a significant
   number of players choose to cooperate. We propose that people do value
   rewards to others, albeit at a discounted rate (social discounting), in
   a manner similar to discounting of delayed rewards (delay discounting).
   Two experiments opposed the personal benefit from defection to the
   socially discounted benefit to others from cooperation. The benefit to
   others was determined from a social discount function relating the
   individual's subjective value of a reward to another person and the
   social distance between that individual and the other person. In
   Experiment 1, the cost of cooperating was held constant while its social
   benefit was varied in terms of the number of other players, each gaining
   a fixed, hypothetical amount of money. In Experiment 2, the cost of
   cooperating was again held constant while the social benefit of
   cooperating was varied by the hypothetical amount of money earned by a
   single other player. In both experiments, significantly more
   participants cooperated when the social benefit was higher.

   biologic mechanisms linking SEP and mental health remain poorly
   understood. Recent work suggests that social exposures influence DNA
   methylation in a manner salient to mental health. We conducted a pilot
   investigation to assess whether SEP, measured as educational attainment,
   modifies the association between genomic methylation profiles and
   traumatic stress in a traumaexposed sample. Results show that
   methylationxSEP interactions occur preferentially in genes pertaining to
   nervous system function, suggesting a plausible biological pathway by
   which SEP may enhance sensitivity to stress and, in turn, risk of

   adults. Using the Social Ecological model, an expert panel participated
   in online discussions and an Analytic Hierarchy Process survey to
   identify the most important and changeable environmental settings and
   enabling factors that promote healthy eating in older adults. Food
   stores were rated most important when considering accessibility and
   affordability. Congregate nutrition sites were important for social
   support along with supporting access and affordability of healthful
   foods and living accommodations. Senior housing, health care, and
   religious settings also contributed to the goal of promoting healthful
   eating in aging adults. Restaurants were rated of lower importance.
   Based on these results, it is recommended that community food policies
   include the nutritional needs of older adults by addressing food
   accessibility and affordability, social support, and living
   accommodations, with a focus on congregate nutrition sites, food stores,
   senior housing, health care, and religious organizations.

AB Resilience studies build on the notion that phenomena in the real world
   should be understood as dynamic social-ecological systems. However, the
   scholarly community may not be fully aware that social ecology, as a
   conceptual framework, has a long intellectual history, nor fully
   cognizant of its foundational theory. In this article, we trace the
   intellectual roots and core principles of social ecology and demonstrate
   how these principles enable a broader conceptualization of resilience
   than may be found in much of the literature. We then illustrate how the
   resulting notion of resilience as transactional process and
   multi-capital formation affords new perspectives on diverse phenomena
   such as global financial crises and adaptation to environmental stresses
   to communities and ecosystems. A social-ecological analysis of
   resilience enables the study of people-environment transactions across
   varying dimensions, time periods, and scales. Furthermore, in its
   openness to experiential knowledge and action research, the social
   ecology framework coheres well with participative-collaborative modes of
   inquiry, which traverse institutional, epistemological, and
   scale-related boundaries.

   facilitating or constraining collaborative arrangements that can enhance
   resource governance and adaptability in complex social-ecological
   systems. Nonetheless, the effect of ethnicity on social network
   structure in an ethnically diverse common-pool resource system is
   virtually unknown. We characterize the entire social network of Hawaii's
   longline fishery, an ethnically diverse competitive pelagic fishery, and
   investigate network homophily, network structure, and cross-scale
   linkages. Results show that ethnicity significantly influences social
   network structure and is responsible for a homophily effect, which can
   create challenges for stakeholder collaboration across groups. Our
   analysis also suggests that ethnicity influences the formation of
   diverse network structures, and can affect the level of linkages to
   outside industry leaders, government or management officials, and
   members of the scientific community. This study provides the first
   empirical examination of the impact of ethnic diversity on resource
   user's social networks in the common-pool resource literature, having

   shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the

   making-protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes-that actors
   need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a
   wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of
   future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although
   they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in
   interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those
   three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a

   through which other theoretical or empirical constructs-such as racism
   or late modernity-operate; and open a window into the ways in which
   people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its

AB Both theoretical and empirical work in a variety of disciplines has
   resulted in a recent turn away from Cartesian and Meadian
   anthropocentrism in the direction of a radical reconsideration of
   nonhuman animal mind and agency. Central to sociology's role in
   envisioning a repopulated social world is the analysis of nonhuman-human
   social interaction. Because all social action is predicated on certain
   assumptions regarding the minds of others, a theory of intersubjectivity
   must be at the core of any such project. It is argued here that the key
   elements employed in Alfred Schutz's conceptualization of
   intersubjectivity among humans are also demonstrated in the routine
   communicative projects of humans and their companion animals. After
   presenting a Schutzian theory of intersubjectivity, this article
   analyzes, from an ethnographic perspective, elements of the everyday
   lifeworld Rocky-a deaf, paraplegic cat-cohabits with the author and
   other family members. Through that analysis, the paper demonstrates that
   the dynamics of everyday interactions through which Rocky actively
   participates in the creation of meaning and the achievement of
   understanding is highly consistent with Schutz's theory of human
   intersubjectivity.

AB Background: The Pathobiology of Prediabetes in a Biracial Cohort
   (POP-ABC) study is a prospective evaluation of the natural history
   impaired glucose regulation.
   Design and Methods: The eligibility requirements include age 18-65 yr,
   history of type 2 diabetes in one or both parents, normal fasting plasma
   glucose (FPG) or normal glucose tolerance, and African-American or
   Caucasian status. Participants underwent assessments (including dietary
   and exercise behavior, clinical examination, glucose tolerance, insulin
   sensitivity, beta-cell function, body composition, energy expenditure)
   during 2.25-5.5 yr of quarterly follow-up. The primary outcome is the
   occurrence of prediabetes. Baseline data are presented for the 376
   enrolled participants. The cohort was also compared with National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007/2008 participants meeting the age
   and glycemic criteria for the POP-ABC study.
   Results: The POP-ABC cohort [mean (+/- SD) age was 44.2 +/- 10.6 yr] was
   57.7% African-Americans, 42.3% Caucasians, and 70.7% females; 86% had
   one parent with diabetes and 14% had both parents affected. Although
   greater than 70% of the cohort were employed and 75% had more than 13 yr
   of education, more African-Americans reported incomes less than $20,000
   and fewer reported incomes more than $75,000 compared with Caucasians.
   Compared with Caucasians, African-Americans had a higher body mass index
   (31.3 +/- 7.8 vs. 28.8 +/- 7.8 kg/m(2), P = 0.001), a lower FPG (90.0
   +/- 7.72 vs. 92.2 +/- 7.60 mg/dl, P = 0.008), higher glycosylated
   hemoglobin, lower triglycerides, and similar blood pressure, and
   homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, homeostasis model
   assessment of beta-cell function, high-density lipoprotein, and
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Compared with a
   cross-section of U.S. subjects (National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey 2007/2008) with normal FPG and normal glucose
   tolerance, participants in the POP-ABC study had similar lipid profile
   but were more educated and had higher body mass index, glycosylated
   hemoglobin, and blood pressure.
   Conclusions: The POP-ABC study has successfully enrolled healthy
   African-American and Caucasian adults with parental type 2 diabetes
   mellitus. The study will generate novel data on incidence rates and
   predictors of prediabetes, and clarify the role of race/ethnicity on
   early dysglycemia. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 98: 120-128, 2013)

AB The interaction of drugs with biologic targets is a critical area of
   research, particularly for the development of medications to treat
   substance use disorders. In addition to understanding these drug-target
   interactions, however, there is a need to understand more fully the
   psychosocial influences that moderate these interactions. The first
   section of this review introduces some examples from human behavioral
   pharmacology that illustrate the clinical importance of this research.
   The second section covers preclinical evidence to characterize some of
   the key individual differences that alter drug sensitivity and abuse
   vulnerability, related primarily to differences in response to novelty
   and impulsivity. Evidence is presented to indicate that critical
   neuropharmacological mechanisms associated with these individual
   differences involve integrated neurocircuits underlying stress, reward,
   and behavioral inhibitory processes. The third section covers social
   influences on drug abuse vulnerability, including effects experienced
   during infancy, adolescence, and young adulthood, such as maternal
   separation, housing conditions, and social interactions (defeat, play,
   and social rank). Some of the same neurocircuits involved in individual
   differences also are altered by social influences, although the precise
   neurochemical and cellular mechanisms involved remain to be elucidated
   fully. Finally, some speculation is offered about the implications of
   this research for the prevention and treatment of substance abuse.

AB Extensive social choice theory is used to study the problem of measuring
   group fitness in a two-level biological hierarchy. Both fixed and
   variable group size are considered. Axioms are identified that imply
   that the group measure satisfies a form of consequentialism in which
   group fitness only depends on the viabilities and fecundities of the
   individuals at the lower level in the hierarchy. This kind of
   consequentialism can take account of the group fitness advantages of
   germ-soma specialization, which is not possible with an alternative
   social choice framework proposed by Okasha, but which is an essential
   feature of the index of group fitness for a multicellular organism
   introduced by Michod, Viossat, Solari, Hurand, and Nedelcu to analyze
   the unicellular-multicellular evolutionary transition. The new framework
   is also used to analyze the fitness decoupling between levels that takes
   place during an evolutionary transition.

AB How do stewardship groups contribute to the management of urban
   ecosystem services? In this paper, we integrate the research on
   environmental stewardship with the social-ecological systems literature
   to explain how stewardship groups serve as bridge organizations between
   public agencies and civic organizations, working across scales and
   sectors to build the flexible and multi-scaled capacity needed to manage
   complex urban ecosystems. Analyzing data collected from a survey of
   stewardship groups in New York City, combined with open-ended
   semi-structured interviews with representatives from the most connected
   civic "hub" organizations, we use a mixed-method approach to understand
   the specific activities of bridge organizations in the process of
   preserving local ecosystem services. This paper concludes that the role
   of bridge organizations in the management of urban ecosystem services in
   New York City is increasing, that these groups have a specific bi-modal
   role in the network, and that an initial presence of heterarchic
   organizational relations was crucial in their development. The paper
   ends with a discussion of the implications of these results. (C) 2012

AB Postcolonial theory has enjoyed wide influence in the humanities but it
   has left sociology comparatively unscathed. Does this mean that
   postcolonial theory is not relevant to sociology? Focusing upon social
   theory and historical sociology in particular, this article considers if
   and how postcolonial theory in the humanities might be imported into
   North American sociology. It argues that postcolonial theory offers a
   substantial critique of sociology because it alerts us to sociology's
   tendency to analytically bifurcate social relations. The article also
   suggests that a postcolonial sociology can overcome these problems by
   incorporating relational social theories to give new accounts of
   modernity. Rather than simply studying non-Western postcolonial
   societies or only examining colonialism, this approach insists upon the
   interactional constitution of social units, processes, and practices
   across space. To illustrate, the article draws upon relational theories
   (actor-network theory and field theory) to offer postcolonial accounts
   of two conventional research areas in historical sociology: the
   industrial revolution in England and the French Revolution.

AB As with other aspects of natural-resource management, the approach to
   managing wildland fires has evolved over time as scientific
   understanding has advanced and the broader context surrounding
   management decisions has changed. Prior to 2000 the primary focus of
   most fire research was on the physical and ecological aspects of fire;
   social science research was limited to a small number of studies.
   However, as more people moved into fire-prone areas interest grew in
   understanding relevant social dynamics. This growing interest was
   supported by increased funding for fire research overall with the
   creation of the Joint Fire Science Program in 1998 and the National Fire
   Plan in 2000. In subsequent years, a significant body of research has
   developed on the human dimensions of wildland fire covering diverse
   topics including: attitudes towards pre-fire mitigation, social
   acceptability of fire and fuels management, community preparedness,
   public response during fires, citizen-agency communications and
   post-fire recovery. This paper reports on two aspects of a Joint Fire
   Science Program project intended to take stock of the key social science
   lessons provided to date: a basic review of findings in the non-economic
   fire social science literature and identification of future research
   needs.

AB Context: A better understanding of why students leave an undergraduate
   athletic training education program (ATEP), as well as why they persist,
   is critical in determining the future membership of our profession.
   Objective: To better understand how clinical experiences affect student
   retention in undergraduate ATEPs.
   Design: Survey-based research using a quantitative and qualitative
   mixed-methods approach.
   Setting: Three-year undergraduate ATEPs across District 4 of the
   National Athletic Trainers' Association.
   Patients or Other Participants: Seventy-one persistent students and 23
   students who left the ATEP prematurely.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected using a modified
   version of the Athletic Training Education Program Student Retention
   Questionnaire. Multivariate analysis of variance was performed on the
   quantitative data, followed by a univariate analysis of variance on any
   significant findings. The qualitative data were analyzed through
   inductive content analysis.
   Results: A difference was identified between the persister and dropout
   groups (Pillai trace = 0.42, F-1,F-92 = 12.95, P = .01). The follow-up
   analysis of variance revealed that the persister and dropout groups
   differed on the anticipatory factors (F-1,F-92 = 4.29, P = .04),
   clinical integration (F-1,F-92 = 6.99, P = .01), and motivation
   (F-1,F-92 = 43.12, P = .01) scales. Several themes emerged in the
   qualitative data, including networks of support, authentic experiential
   learning, role identity, time commitment, and major or career change.
   Conclusions: A perceived difference exists in how athletic training
   students are integrated into their clinical experiences between those
   students who leave an ATEP and those who stay. Educators may improve
   retention by emphasizing authentic experiential learning opportunities
   rather than hours worked, by allowing students to take on more
   responsibility, and by facilitating networks of support within clinical
   education experiences.

AB There has been little evidence of a decline in the global burden of
   cholera in recent years as the number of cholera cases reported to WHO
   continues to rise. Cholera remains a global threat to public health and
   a key indicator of lack of socioeconomic development. Overall
   socioeconomic development is the ultimate solution for control of
   cholera as evidenced in developed countries. However, most research has
   focused on cross-county comparisons so that the role of individual-or
   small area-level socioeconomic status (SES) in cholera dynamics has not
   been carefully studied. Reported cases of cholera in Matlab, Bangladesh
   have fluctuated greatly over time and epidemic outbreaks of cholera
   continue, most recently with the introduction of a new serotype into the
   region. The wealth of longitudinal data on the population of Matlab
   provides a unique opportunity to explore the impact of socioeconomic
   status and other demographic characteristics on the long-term temporal
   dynamics of cholera in the region. In this population-based study we
   examine which factors impact the initial number of cholera cases in a
   bari at the beginning of the 0139 epidemic and the factors impacting the
   number of cases over time. Cholera data were derived from the ICDDR,B
   health records and linked to socioeconomic and geographic data collected
   as part of the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System.
   Longitudinal zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) multilevel regression models
   are used to examine the impact of environmental and socio-demographic
   factors on cholera counts across baris. Results indicate that baris with
   a high socioeconomic status had lower initial rates of cholera at the
   beginning of the 0139 epidemic (gamma(01) = -0.147, p = 0.041) and a
   higher probability of reporting no cholera cases (alpha(01) = 0.156, p =
   0.061). Populations in baris characterized by low SES are more likely to
   experience higher cholera morbidity at the beginning of an epidemic than
   populations in high SES baris.

AB Background Spillane and Smith (2007, Psychol Bull 133:395418) postulated
   that high levels of problem drinking in some First Nation (FN)
   communities resulted in part from the perception that there is low
   access to alternative reinforcers (e.g., jobs, friendships, family
   relationships, and financial security), that many alternative
   reinforcers are less contingent on sobriety, and that others are
   available regardless of drinking status for reserve-dwelling FN members.
   Methods This study examined perceptions of access to alternative
   reinforcers and the extent to which access varied as a function of
   drinking in 211 FN members living on 1 reserve in Canada, 138 middle
   socioeconomic status Caucasians (MCCs), and 98 low socioeconomic status
   Caucasians (LCCs). Results The FN group expected less access to
   employment, quality family and friend relationships, and financial
   security compared with the MCC group. After controlling for perceived
   access in general, gender, and age, the FN group reported that drinking
   would not cause a decrease in access to employment, family
   relationships, friendships, and finances as compared to the MCC group.
   The FN group did not differ from the LCC group in the degree to which
   they expected drinking to cost access to family relationships or
   finances, but the LCC group expected drinking to have less of an impact
   on access to jobs and friendships as compared to the FN group.
   Conclusions The results provide initial support for the Spillane and
   Smith theory of problem drinking among this 1 FN group. The results
   suggest that increasing access to these reinforcers may reduce
   problematic drinking in this FN group.

AB Two young men met on a quay at the port in Conakry, Guinea in 1946. One,
   waiting dockside, was Mamadou Madeira Keita, a low-level civil servant
   and archivist. Years later, when he was a political prisoner in the
   Malian Sahara, some would argue that he was "the first francophone
   African ethnographer." The other, descending the gangplank, was the
   Frenchman Keita had come to meet. Georges Balandier was unknown then,
   but would soon become a leading figure in the fields of sociology and
   anthropology. The encounter between Keita and Balandier was foundational
   for both men. Conakry incubated a canonical intervention-Balandier's
   1951 article "La Situation Coloniale"-that some attribute an ancestral
   role in a particular francophone tradition of post-colonial thought.
   Conakry, and Guinea at large, was also the crucible in which a powerful
   anti-colonial politics were forged by Madeira Keita and his allies. In
   this particular corner of West Africa, anti-colonial politics and an
   emergent, politically engaged social science conditioned each other,
   like the two strands of a double helix, each a necessary yet ultimately
   contingent element of the other's structure. Though these links did not
   last long, they had important effects. This article, by emphasizing the
   contingencies of the two men's intertwined biographies, seeks to carry
   out Balandier's dictate to emphasize the "concrete" nature of this
   particular situation in order to understand how and why anti-colonial
   politics and an innovative sociology converged and ultimately diverged.

AB Objective. To examine associations between social support and ties
   (family, friend, and neighbors) individually and jointly with diet and
   physical activity among an ethnically-diverse, low-income population.
   Methods. The Health in Common study (2005-2009) was designed to examine
   risk factors among individuals residing in low-income housing in the
   Boston, MA area. Cross-sectional surveys (n=828) were administered in
   residents' homes. Linear/logistic multivariable analyses were employed
   with clustering of individuals within housing sites controlled as a
   random effect.
   Results. In multivariable analyses, total social support was
   significantly associated with higher red meat consumption per day
   (p=0.029). Having more friends was significantly associated with more
   daily fruit and vegetable intake (p=0.007) and higher levels of daily
   vigorous physical activity (p=0.011). Those who reported having a
   greater number of family ties also reported higher daily consumption of
   sugary drinks (p=0.013) and fast food (p=0.011). More neighbor social
   ties were associated with more fast food per day (p=0.024).
   Conclusions. Social relationships can have both positive and negative
   associations with health behaviors. Understanding these relationships
   could help to inform the design of interventions that promote healthy
   behavior change among vulnerable populations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Welfare states enact a range of policies aimed at reducing work-family
   conflict. While welfare state policies have been assessed at the
   macro-level and work-family conflict at the individual-level, few
   studies have simultaneously addressed these relationships in a
   cross-national multi-level model. This study addresses this void by
   assessing the relationship between work-family and family-work conflict
   and family-friendly policies in 10 countries. Applying a unique
   multi-level data set that couples country-level policy data with
   individual-level data (N = 7,895) from the 2002 International Social
   Survey Programme, the author analyzes the relationship between
   work-family and family-work conflict and four specific policy measures:
   family leave, work scheduling, school scheduling, and early childhood
   education and care. The results demonstrate that mothers and fathers
   report less family-work and mothers less work-family conflict in
   countries with more expansive family leave policies. Also, in countries
   with longer school schedules mothers report less and women without
   children more work-family conflict.

AB OBJECTIVE: In the United States, young and middle-aged black men have
   significantly higher total mortality than any other racial or ethnic
   group. We describe the characteristics of US counties with low
   non-Hispanic Black or African American male mortality (ages 25-64 years,
   1999-2007).
   METHODS: Information was accessed through public data, the US Census,
   the US Compressed Mortality File, and the Native American Graves
   Repatriation Act military database.
   RESULTS: Of 1307 counties with black mortality rates classified as
   reliable by the National Center for Health Statistics (at least 20
   deaths), 66 recorded lower mortality among black men than corresponding
   US whites. Most notable, 97% of the 66 counties were home to or adjacent
   a military installation versus 37% of comparable US counties (P < .001).
   Blacks in these counties had less poverty, higher percentages of elderly
   civilian veterans, and higher per capita income. Within these counties,
   national black: white disparities in mortality were eliminated for
   ischemic heart disease, accidents, diseases of the liver, chronic lower
   respiratory diseases, and mental disorder from psychoactive substance
   use. Application of age-, race-, ethnicity-, gender-, and
   urbanization-specific mortality rates from counties with relatively low
   mortality would reduce the black: white mortality rate ratio for black
   men aged 25 to 64 years from 1.67 to 1.20 nationally and to 1.00 in
   areas outside large central metropolitan areas.
   CONCLUSIONS: These descriptive data demonstrate a small number of
   communities with low mortality rates among young and middle-aged
   black/African American men. Their characteristics may provide clinical
   and public health insights to reduce these higher mortality rates in the
   US population. Analytic epidemiologic studies are necessary to test
   these hypotheses. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. . The American

AB Objectives. We used the fundamental cause hypothesis as a framework for
   understanding the creation of health disparities in colorectal cancer
   mortality in the United States from 1968 to 2005.
   Methods. We used negative binomial regression to analyze trends in
   county-level gender-, race-, and age-adjusted colorectal cancer
   mortality rates among individuals aged 35 years or older.
   Results. Prior to 1980, there was a stable gradient in colorectal cancer
   mortality, with people living in counties of higher socioeconomic status
   (SES) being at greater risk than people living in lower SES counties.
   Beginning in 1980, this gradient began to narrow and then reversed as
   people living in higher SES counties experienced greater reductions in
   colorectal cancer mortality than those in lower SES counties.
   Conclusions. Our findings support the fundamental cause hypothesis: once
   knowledge about prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer became
   available, social and economic resources became increasingly important
   in influencing mortality rates. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:99-104.

AB Objectives. We estimated rates and determinants of hepatitis C virus
   (HCV) testing, infection, and linkage to care among US racial/ethnic
   minorities.
   Methods. We analyzed the Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community
   Health Across the US Risk Factor Survey conducted in 2009-2010 (n =
   53896 minority adults).
   Results. Overall, 19% of respondents were tested for HCV. Only 60% of
   those reporting a risk factor were tested, with much lower rates among
   Asians reporting injection drug use (40%). Odds of HCV testing decreased
   with age and increased with higher education. Of those tested, 8.3%
   reported HCV infection. Respondents with income of $75000 or more were
   less likely to report HCV infection than those with income less than
   $25000. College-educated non-Hispanic Blacks and Asians had lower odds
   of HCV infection than those who did not finish high school. Of those
   infected, 44.4% were currently being followed by a physician, and 41.9%
   had taken HCV medications.
   Conclusions. HCV testing and linkage to care among racial/ethnic
   minorities are suboptimal, particularly among those reporting HCV risk
   factors. Socioeconomic factors were significant determinants of HCV
   testing, infection, and access to care. Future HCV testing and
   prevention activities should be directed toward racial/ethnic
   minorities, particularly those of low socioeconomic status. (Am J Public

AB Objectives. We examined the association between socioeconomic position
   (SEP) and HIV diagnosis rates in the United States and whether
   racial/ethnic disparities in diagnosis rates persist after control for
   SEP.
   Methods. We used cases of HIV infection among persons aged 13 years and
   older, diagnosed 2005 through 2009 in 37 states and reported to national
   HIV surveillance through June 2010, and US Census data, to examine
   associations between county-level SEP measures and 5-year average annual
   HIV diagnosis rates overall and among race/ethnicity sex groups.
   Results. The HIV diagnosis rate was significantly higher for individuals
   in the low-SEP tertile than for those in the high-SEP tertile (rate
   ratios for low- vs high-SEP tertiles range = 1.68-3.38) except for White
   males and Hispanic females. The SEP disparities were larger for
   minorities than for Whites. Racial disparities persisted after we
   controlled for SEP, urbanicity, and percentage of population aged 20 to
   50 years, and were high in the low-SEP tertile for males and in low- and
   high-SEP tertiles for females.
   Conclusions. Findings support continued prioritization of HIV testing,
   prevention, and treatment to persons in economically deprived areas, and
   Blacks of all SEP levels. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:120-126.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether high gender role conflict (GRC;
   internal conflict with traditional gender-role stereotypes and an
   individual's perceived need to comply with these roles) is associated
   with psychological distress and HIV-related risk behaviors in a sample
   of African American men who have sex with men and women (MSMW).
   Methods. We analyzed baseline data collected from questionnaires
   completed by 400 MSMW participating in the Men of African American
   Legacy Empowering Self project in Los Angeles, California, in 2007 to
   2010 for associations between participants' GRC and experiences of poor
   mental health and HIV risk outcomes.
   Results. MSMW who reported higher levels of GRC than other participants
   also reported more psychological distress, lower self-esteem, greater
   internalized homophobia, less HIV knowledge, lower risk reduction
   skills, less disclosure of same-sex behaviors to others, and more
   unprotected vaginal or anal intercourse with female partners.
   Conclusions. Future research should consider how high GRC affects
   African American MSMW's lives and identify specific approaches to help
   alleviate the psychological distress and other negative behavioral
   outcomes associated with internal conflict caused by rigid gender role
   socialization. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:127-133.

AB Objectives. We examined whether social norms toward spousal violence in
   Nigeria, at the state level, are associated with a woman's exposure to
   physical and sexual violence perpetrated by her husband.
   Methods. Using data from the 2008 Demographic and Health Survey, we fit
   four 3-level random intercepts models to examine contextual factors
   associated with spousal violence while accounting for individual-level
   predictors.
   Results. Of the 18 798 ever-married Nigerian women in our sample, 18.7%
   reported exposure to spousal sexual or physical violence. The prevalence
   was geographically patterned by state and ranged from 3% to 50%.
   Permissive state-level social norms toward spousal violence were
   positively associated with a woman's report of physical and sexual
   violence perpetrated by her husband (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.17, 2.77), after adjusting for
   individual-level characteristics. A number of individual-level variables
   were significantly associated with victimization, including a woman's
   accepting beliefs toward spousal violence (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 1.09,
   1.14). Women living in states with Sharia law were less likely to report
   spousal violence (OR =0.58; 95% CI = 0.35, 0.95).
   Conclusions. Efforts to end violence against women, particularly spousal
   violence, should consider broader social and contextual determinants of
   violence including social norms. (Am J Public Health. 2013;103:148-155.

AB To understand how parents of adolescents attempt to regulate their
   children's eating behaviors, the prevalence of specific food-related
   parenting practices (restriction, pressure-to-eat) by sociodemographic
   characteristics (parent gender, race/ethnicity, education level,
   employment status, and household income) were examined within a
   population-based sample of parents (n = 3709) of adolescents. Linear
   regression models were fit to estimate the association between parent
   sociodemographic characteristics and parental report of food restriction
   and pressure-to-eat. Overall, findings suggest that use of controlling
   food-related parenting practices, such as pressuring children to eat and
   restricting children's intake, is common among parents of adolescents,
   particularly among parents in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, parents
   with less than a high school education, and parents with a low household
   income. Results indicate that that social or cultural traditions, as
   well as parental access to economic resources, may contribute to a
   parent's decision to utilize specific food-related parenting practices.
   Given that previous research has found that restriction and
   pressure-to-eat food-related parenting practices can negatively impact
   children's current and future dietary intake, differences in use of
   these practices by sociodemographic characteristics may contribute, in
   part, to the disparities that exist in the prevalence of overweight and
   obesity among adolescents by their race/ethnicity and socioeconomic
   status. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Epigenetic modifications may be one mechanism linking early life
   factors, including parental socioeconomic status (SES), to adult onset
   disease risk. However, SES influences on DNA methylation patterns remain
   largely unknown. In a US birth cohort of women, we examined whether
   indicators of early life and adult SES were associated with white blood
   cell methylation of repetitive elements (Sat2, Alu and LINE-1) in
   adulthood. Low family income at birth was associated with higher Sat2
   methylation (beta = 19.7, 95% CI: 0.4, 39.0 for lowest vs. highest
   income quartile) and single parent family was associated with higher Alu
   methylation (beta = 23.5, 95% CI: 2.6, 44.1), after adjusting for other
   early life factors. Lower adult education was associated with lower Sat2
   methylation (beta = -16.7, 95% CI: -29.0, -4.5). There were no
   associations between early life SES and LINE-1 methylation. Overall, our
   preliminary results suggest possible influences of SES across the
   life-course on genomic DNA methylation in adult women. However, these
   preliminary associations need to be replicated in larger prospective
   studies.

AB Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder primarily
   characterized by hyperphagia and food preoccupations, is caused by the
   absence of expression of the paternally active genes in the proximal arm
   of chromosome 15. Although maladaptive behavior and the cognitive
   profile in PWS have been well characterized, social functioning has only
   more recently been systematically examined. Findings to date indicate
   the social impairment exhibited may reflect specific difficulty
   interpreting and using social information effectively. In addition,
   evidence suggests that there is an increased risk of social deficits in
   people with the maternally-derived uniparental disomy (mUPD) subtype of
   PWS in comparison to those with 15q11-13 paternal deletion (DEL). Using
   the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Social Competence
   Inventory, our goal was to compare social functioning in PWS to
   individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Participants with mUPD
   scored similarly to the ASD group across most SRS domains. All groups
   had difficulty with social competence, although the DEL group scored
   highest on prosocial behavior. Findings suggest further characterization
   of social behavior in PWS is necessary to aid in advancing the
   understanding of the contributions of genes in the 15q11-13 critical
   region to ASD susceptibility, particularly with respect to the
   overexpression of maternally expressed genes in this region, as well as
   aiding in awareness and development/implementation of interventions.

AB People with high-functioning Autism (HFA) can accurately identify social
   categories from speech, but they have more difficulty connecting
   linguistic variation in the speech signal to social stereotypes
   associated with those categories. In the current study, the perception
   and evaluation of talker age by young adults with HFA was examined. The
   participants with HFA performed similarly to a typically-developing
   comparison group in age classification and estimation tasks. Moreover,
   the participants with HFA were able to differentiate among talkers of
   different ages in a language attitudes task and rated older talkers as
   more intelligent than younger talkers. These results suggest that people
   with HFA are able to make reasonable social judgments about talkers

AB The main aim of this research was to assess the relevance and impact of
   wellness recovery action planning (WRAP) as a tool for self-management
   and wellness planning by individuals with mental health problems from
   pre-existing and newly formed groups, where the possibilities for
   continued mutual support in the development of WRAPs could be explored.
   Interviews and focus groups were conducted and pre-post recovery outcome
   measures completed (Recovery Assessment Scale and Warwick Edinburgh
   Mental Well Being Scale). 21 WRAP group participants took part in the
   research. The WRAP approach, used in groups and delivered by trained
   facilitators who could also share their lived experience, was very
   relevant and appeared to have a positive impact on many of the
   participants. The impact on participants varied from learning more about
   recovery and developing improved self-awareness to integrating a WRAP
   approach into daily life. The apparent positive impact of WRAP delivered
   in the context of mutual support groups indicates that it should be
   given serious consideration as a unique and worthwhile option for
   improving mental health. WRAP groups could make a significant
   contribution to the range of self-management options that are available
   for improving mental health and well-being.

AB OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic status (SES) is inversely related to pediatric
   mortality in the community. However, it is unknown if this association
   exists for in-hospital pediatric mortality. Our objective was to
   determine the association of SES with in-hospital pediatric mortality
   among children's hospitals and to compare observed mortality with
   expected mortality generated from national all-hospital inpatient data.
   METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from 2009 to 2010 of all 1
   053 101 hospitalizations at 42 tertiary care, freestanding children's
   hospitals. The main exposure was SES, determined by the median annual
   household income for the patient's ZIP code. The main outcome measure
   was death during the admission. Primary outcomes of interest were
   stratified by income and diagnosis-based service lines.
   Observed-to-expected mortality ratios were created, and trends across
   quartiles of SES were examined.
   RESULTS: Death occurred in 8950 (0.84%) of the hospitalizations.
   Overall, mortality rates were associated with SES (P < .0001) and
   followed an inverse linear association (P < .0001). Similarly,
   observed-to-expected mortality was associated with SES in an inverse
   association (P = .014). However, mortality overall was less than
   expected for all income quartiles (P < .05). The association of SES and
   mortality varied by service line; only 3 service lines (cardiac,
   gastrointestinal, and neonatal) demonstrated an inverse association
   between SES and observed-to-expected mortality.
   CONCLUSIONS: Within children's hospitals, SES is inversely associated
   with in-hospital mortality, but is lower than expected for even the
   lowest SES quartile. The association between SES and mortality varies by
   service line. Multifaceted interventions initiated in the inpatient
   setting could potentially ameliorate SES disparities in in-hospital
   pediatric mortality. Pediatrics 2013;131:e182-e190

AB Background and Purpose-This study evaluated clustering of stroke
   hospitalization rates, patterns of the clustering over time, and
   associations with community-level characteristics.
   Methods-We used Medicare hospital claims data from 1995-1996 to
   2005-2006 with a principal discharge diagnosis of stroke to calculate
   county-level stroke hospitalization rates. We identified statistically
   significant clusters of high- and low-rate counties by using local
   indicators of spatial association, tracked cluster status over time, and
   assessed associations between cluster status and county-level
   socioeconomic and healthcare profiles.
   Results-Clearly defined clusters of counties with high-and low-stroke
   hospitalization rates were identified in each time. Approximately 75% of
   counties maintained their cluster status from 1995-1996 to 2005-2006. In
   addition, 243 counties transitioned into high-rate clusters, and 148
   transitioned out of high-rate clusters. Persistently high-rate clusters
   were located primarily in the Southeast, whereas persistently low-rate
   clusters occurred mostly in New England and in the West. In general,
   persistently low-rate counties had the most favorable socioeconomic and
   healthcare profiles, followed by counties that transitioned out of or
   into high-rate clusters. Persistently high-rate counties experienced the
   least favorable socioeconomic and healthcare profiles.
   Conclusions-The persistence of clusters of high-and low-stroke
   hospitalization rates during a 10-year period suggests that the
   underlying causes of stroke in these areas have also persisted. The
   associations found between cluster status (persistently high,
   transitional, persistently low) and socioeconomic and healthcare

AB Background Declines in case fatality post-myocardial infarction (MI)
   have been observed over the past 3 decades. Few studies report
   socioeconomic disparities in survival post-MI.
   Methods We assessed 1-year case fatality among 9,116 incident MI
   patients included in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities community
   surveillance from 1992 to 2002. Addresses of hospitalized MI patients
   were geocoded by a commercial vendor and linked to year 2000 United
   States Census tract-level neighborhood income (nINC) data. We estimated
   case fatality odds ratios and 95% CIs with a multinomial logistic model
   to quantify the association between nINC tertile and case fatality,
   comparing short- (within 28 days) and long-term (29-365 days) case
   fatality to no death 1 year post-MI.
   Results Overall, 1-year age-adjusted case fatality rates were highest
   among MI patients living in low-nINC areas, followed by medium- and
   high-nINC areas, respectively. We found significant odds ratio
   modification by race (P < .10) and formed race-nINC strata with
   high-nINC whites as the referent group. In multivariable models
   adjusting for age, gender, study community, and year of MI, low-nINC
   whites and low- and medium- nINC blacks had higher short- term case
   fatality than high-nINC whites. Low- and medium- nINC blacks had higher
   long-term case fatality compared with high-nINC whites.
   Conclusions Differences in short- and long-term case fatality by
   neighborhood socioeconomic factors have not been systematically studied
   in the United States. Surveillance efforts can be expanded to
   incorporate measures of the neighborhood context to examine these
   associations over time. (Am Heart J 2013;165:102-7.)

AB Morbidity and mortality are greater among socially disadvantaged
   racial/ethnic groups and those of lower socioeconomic status (SES).
   Greater chronic stress exposure in disadvantaged groups may contribute
   to this by accelerating cellular aging, indexed by shorter age-adjusted
   telomere length. While studies consistently relate shorter leukocyte
   telomere length (LTL) to stress, the few studies, mostly from the UK,
   examining associations of LTL with SES have been mixed. The current
   study examined associations between educational attainment and LTL among
   2599 high-functioning black and white adults age 70-79 from the Health,
   Aging and Body Composition Study. Multiple regression analyses tested
   associations of race/ethnicity, educational attainment and income with
   LTL, adjusting for potential confounders. Those with only a high school
   education had significantly shorter mean LTL (4806 basepairs) than those
   with post-high school education (4926 basepairs; B = 125, SE = 47.6, p
   =.009). A significant interaction of race and education (B = 207.8, SE =
   98.7, p =.035) revealed more beneficial effects of post-high school
   education for blacks than for whites. Smokers had shorter LTL than
   non-smokers, but the association of education and LTL remained
   significant when smoking was covaried (B = 119.7, SE = 47.6, p = 012).
   While higher income was associated with longer LTL, the effect was not
   significant (p > .10). This study provides the first demonstration of an
   association between educational attainment and LTL in a US population
   where higher education appears to have a protective effect against
   telomere shortening, particularly in blacks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

AB BACKGROUND: The impact of race and ethnicity on the biologic features
   and outcome variables of women who are diagnosed with preinvasive breast
   cancerductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)has not been addressed widely in
   the published literature. METHODS: Patient demographic, clinical, and
   pathologic features and outcome variables were analyzed with respect to
   the patient's initial self-reported race/ethnicity among women who
   received treatment for a diagnosis of pure DCIS from 1996 to 2009.
   RESULTS: Of 1902 patients, 1411 were white (74.2%), 214 were African
   American (11.3%), 175 were Hispanic (9.1%), and 102 were Asian/Pacific
   Islander (5.4%). The majority of patients were between ages 41 and 70
   years (83%). Patients of Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander descent
   were significantly younger than white and African American patients (P <
   .001). DCIS size and grade, the presence of necrosis, and the frequency
   of breast-conserving surgery did not differ significantly between
   groups. African American patients aged >70 years and Hispanic patients
   aged <50 years were significantly more likely to have estrogen
   receptor-positive DCIS than patients of other races in the same age
   categories (P < .001). Adjuvant radiotherapy and tamoxifen were received
   significantly less often by white women (P < .001). At a median
   follow-up of 4.8 years (range, 1-14 years), recurrence rates and the
   development of contralateral breast cancer did not differ significantly
   among racial/ethnic groups when stratified by treatments received.
   CONCLUSIONS: There was variation in age at presentation, biologic
   features, and treatment of DCIS among the different ethnic groups.
   Additional studies with larger numbers of ethnic minority patients are
   needed to confirm whether the consistent application of evidence-based
   treatment practices presents an opportunity for reducing disparities in
   patients with DCIS. Cancer 2013. (c) 2012 American Cancer Society.

AB Background: Findings from existing research exploring whether positive
   social exchanges can help to offset (or 'buffer' against) the harmful
   effects of negative social exchanges on mental health have been
   inconsistent. This could be because the existing research is
   characterized by different approaches to studying various contexts of
   'cross-domain' and 'within-domain' buffering, and/or because the nature
   of buffering effects varies according to sociodemographic
   characteristics that underlie different aspects of social network
   structure and function. Objective: The purpose of this study was to
   examine whether the buffering effects of global perceptions of positive
   exchanges on the link between global negative exchanges and mental
   health varied as a function of age and gender. Method: We used a series
   of regressions in a sample of 556 Australian older adults (ages 55-94)
   to test for three-way interactions among gender, positive social
   exchanges, and negative social exchanges, as well as age and positive
   and negative social exchanges, in predicting mental health, controlling
   for years of education, partner status, and physical functioning.
   Results: We found that positive exchanges buffered against negative
   exchanges for younger old adults, but not for older old adults, and for
   women, but not for men. Conclusions: Our findings are interpreted in
   light of research on individual differences in coping responses and
   interpersonal goals among late middle-aged and older adults. Our
   findings are in line with gerontological theories (e.g. socioemotional
   selectivity theory), and imply that an intervention aimed at using
   positive social exchanges as a means of coping with negative social
   exchanges might be more successful among particular populations (i.e.
   women, 'younger' old adults). Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

   from public (63.3%) and private (36.7%) schools in Brazil. Adolescents
   ranged in age from 11 to 14 years (M = 12.81). Perceptions of parent
   support moderated concurrent associations between youth reports of peer
   victimization and depressive symptoms such that youth with high levels
   of support reported less depression when victimized than youth with low
   levels of support. Perceptions of parent support also moderated
   concurrent nonlinear associations between youth reports of family
   conflict and depressive symptoms. Moderate levels of family conflict
   were associated with heightened depressive symptoms in youth who
   reported low levels of support from parents, whereas youth who perceived
   high levels of support from parents reported heightened depressive
   symptoms only in conjunction with elevated family conflict.

AB Aims and scope: This article reviews the available quantitative research
   on psychosocial adjustment and mental health among children (age <18
   years) associated with armed forces and armed groups (CAAFAG) commonly
   referred to as child soldiers. Methods: PRISMA standards for systematic
   reviews were used to search PubMed, PsycInfo, JSTOR, and Sociological
   Abstracts in February 2012 for all articles on former child soldiers and
   CAAFAG. Twenty-one quantitative studies from 10 countries were analyzed
   for author, year of publication, journal, objectives, design, selection
   population, setting, instruments, prevalence estimates, and associations
   with war experiences. Opinion pieces, editorials, and qualitative
   studies were deemed beyond the scope of this study. Quality of evidence
   was rated according to the Systematic Assessment of Quality in
   Observational Research (SAQOR). Findings: According to SAQOR criteria,
   among the available published studies, eight studies were of high
   quality, four were of moderate quality, and the remaining nine were of
   low quality. Common limitations were lack of validated mental health
   measures, unclear methodology including undefined sampling approaches,
   and failure to report missing data. Only five studies included a
   comparison group of youth not involved with armed forces/armed groups,
   and only five studies assessed mental health at more than one point in
   time. Across studies, a number of risk and protective factors were
   associated with postconflict psychosocial adjustment and social
   reintegration in CAAFAG. Abduction, age of conscription, exposure to
   violence, gender, and community stigma were associated with increased
   internalizing and externalizing mental health problems. Family
   acceptance, social support, and educational/economic opportunities were
   associated with improved psychosocial adjustment. Conclusions: Research
   on the social reintegration and psychosocial adjustment of former child
   soldiers is nascent. A number of gaps in the available literature
   warrant future study. Recommendations to bolster the evidence base on
   psychosocial adjustment in former child soldiers and other war-affected
   youth include more studies comprising longitudinal study designs, and
   validated cross-cultural instruments for assessing mental health, as
   well as more integrated community-based approaches to study design and
   research monitoring.

AB Many researchers have attempted to uncover the precise contribution of
   fathers to childrearing in relation to both young and older childrens
   development during the past five decades (Lamb, 1975), including during
   the infancy period (Parke & OLeary. S, 1975). However, few have been
   able to isolate precise mechanisms by which specific types of paternal
   childrearing practices may be linked to specific types of prosocial and
   problem behavior. The current paper by Ramchandani et al. (2013) breaks
   new ground in identifying a precise dimension of paternal parenting
   during early infancy - engagement - and linking it to maternal reports
   of infant externalizing problem behavior. Importantly, this association
   was found after accounting for the influence of several child, paternal,
   and maternal characteristics, including observed maternal sensitivity.
   Specifically, the authors found that fathers observed to be less
   engaging with their 3-month olds were reported by mothers to show fewer
   disruptive problems 9 months later.

AB Current theoretical arguments highlight a dilemma faced by actors who
   either adopt a weak or strong commitment strategy for managing their
   alliances and partnerships. Actors who pursue a weak commitment
   strategythat is, immediately abandon current partners when a more
   profitable alternative is presentedare more likely to identify the most
   rewarding alliances. On the other hand, actors who enact a strong
   commitment approach are more likely to take advantage of whatever
   opportunities can be found in existing partnerships. Using agent-based
   modeling, we show that actors who adopt a moderate commitment strategy
   overcome this dilemma and outperform actors who adopt either weak or
   strong commitment approaches. We also show that avoiding this dilemma
   rests on experiencing a related tradeoff: moderately-committed actors
   sacrifice short-term performance for the superior knowledge and
   information that allows them to eventually do better. [Supplementary

AB Sociologists have long recognized that cultural differences help explain
   the perpetuation of inequality by invisibly limiting access to elite
   cultural norms. However, there has been little investigation of the ways
   students reconcile shifts in habitus gained in educational settings with
   existing, nonelite habitus. The authors use both qualitative and
   quantitative data to examine the ways students navigate what Bourdieu
   called a "cleft habitus." In particular, the authors examine how
   students of low socioeconomic status experience contacts with their
   families and hometown friends, arguing that these moments are crucial to
   understanding whether and how their habitus is changing and whether that
   change creates a divide between those students and their origins.
   Interview and survey data both show that social mobility does not come
   without sacrifice and that these sacrifices warrant more serious study
   in the sociology of stratification.

AB The scholarly literature on teaching sociology contains relatively
   little about improving courses from one semester to the next. In this
   article, I describe a method for continual teaching improvement that is
   based on writing, the well-established practice of teacher reflection,
   and classical sociological principles. This method was developed through
   the analysis of nine semesters of autoethnographic data that I collected
   in the form of daily reflective notes. The benefits of this
   sociologically informed reflective practice include grounding
   evaluations of individual class periods and entire courses in empirical
   data, becoming more efficient with course preparation, providing one
   with a stronger sense of mastery as a teacher, and developing as a
   sociologist by using the classroom as a key site for engaging in praxis.
   This practice can help teachers refine individual courses, improve as an
   instructor in an overall sense and more deeply connect sociology to the
   scholarship of teaching and learning.

AB Sociologists and scholars of composition have long argued that in order
   to get students to improve the quality of what they write, they need to
   change how they write. Here, the authors assess whether students'
   participation in writing-intensive first-year seminars leads to changes
   in their writing process. Data collected via pretest and posttest
   interviews of 34 students show that writing-intensive seminars help
   first-year students become better planners and revisers yet have little
   effect on the ways that they prewrite and draft. Additionally, students
   in their first semester of college demonstrate higher order writing
   processes at the beginning of their seminar than their second-semester
   counterparts and show more improvement over the course of the semester
   as well. We analyze the conditions that foster these patterns and
   suggest that increasing quantitative course requirements (i.e., page
   counts) may hamper students' ability to adopt qualitatively better
   writing strategies.

AB In this article, we examine common practices and attitudes surrounding
   writing pedagogy in the sociology classroom based on an analysis of
   interviews with 19 sociologists at seven institutions in the Northeast.
   Our discussion is centered on two distinct approaches to writing that
   faculty identified: writing as cognitive development and writing as
   skill development. We observe that when they teach writing, sociologists
   shift their attention back and forth between these two essential
   features of good writing. Our analysis contextualizes writing as a form
   of distributed cognition (Salomon 1993), because it is taught and
   learned across multiple experiences in the academy. In conclusion, we
   suggest that a greater attentiveness to the underlying cognitive
   features of writing will broaden opportunities for campus-wide dialogue
   about writing across the disciplines and enhance our students' ability
   to transfer and build upon their writing experiences across courses.

AB We analyzed undergraduate sociology course syllabi to determine how
   prevalent writing is, the types of writing used, and whether assignment
   of writing and specific types of writing vary by type of course goals,
   gender of instructor, institutional type, or type of course. Almost all
   courses represented in these syllabi incorporate writing, with
   traditional (transactional) writing being the most common. Writing is
   more likely in courses that seek to enhance students' critical thinking;
   transactional writing is used in courses stating critical thinking and
   sociological imagination/thinking as goals; and expressive writing is
   used more often in courses specifying critical thinking as a goal.
   Female instructors incorporate more writing, especially expressive
   types, than their male counterparts. Implications for disciplinary
   writing practices are discussed.

AB Following American Sociological Association's recommendations for a
   cumulative curriculum in sociology, sociology faculty at Pacific
   Lutheran University created cumulative writing competencies to integrate
   writing into the curriculum on a department level. In this article, I
   explore the rationale for this programmatic approach to writing,
   describe the process by which we developed cumulative writing
   competencies in our major, discuss implementation, and describe our
   plans for assessment. The writing competencies emphasize that good
   writing is about more than good grammar; it also requires clear and
   complex thinking. This model of writing instruction offers students an
   opportunity to develop their writing skills in a sequential,
   intentional, discipline-specific way.

AB Both "theory" and "writing" engender a great deal of anxiety for the
   typical undergraduate sociology major. Writing-intensive theory courses
   increase this feeling exponentially. Active learning approaches to
   teaching theory are often advocated as a way to combat these fears, but
   few studies have tested whether these innovations effectively reduce
   student anxiety. This article describes and evaluates the Film Analysis
   Papers writing assignment designed to reduce student anxiety in an
   undergraduate theory course. I present data from a questionnaire that
   asked students to assess the effect of writing about film on theory
   anxiety. Findings show that the film assignment reduced anxiety about
   writing theoretically and improved student confidence in their ability
   to theorize. This study is unique in that it isolates the effect of
   active learning approaches on theory anxiety in order to understand
   whether anxiety mediates the relationship between active learning and
   learning outcomes in theory classes.

AB Little is known about the effect of the social environment on HIV risk

   qualitative research study conducted 4 key informant interviews and 30
   in-depth interviews of men in two northern Vietnamese cities: Hanoi, a
   large city, and Thai Nguyen, a smaller town. Hanoi has experienced a
   growth in the number of places where gay men can socialize, access HIV
   prevention services, and discuss health issues. Thai Nguyen lacks these
   open venues. However, homosexuality is still highly stigmatized in the
   general population in both cities. This stigma affects the number of
   partners and level of sexual risk of participants. Also, men generally
   reported little communication between partners about sexual risk. While
   stigma in the general community is difficult to change, social
   environments where gay men can openly communicate creates an opportunity
   for HIV prevention and social support.

AB Creative teamwork in multidisciplinary teams is a topic of interest to
   cognitive psychologists on the one hand, and to both social and
   organizational psychologists on the other. However, the interconnections
   between cognitive and social layers have been rarely explored. Drawing
   on mental models and dissonance theories, the current study takes a
   central variable studied by cognitive psychologists-analogy-and examines
   its relationship to a central variable examined by social
   psychologists-conflict. In an observational, field study, over 11 h of
   audio-video data from conversations of the Mars Exploration Rover
   scientists were coded for different types of analogy and micro-conflicts
   that reveal the character of underlying psychological mechanisms. Two
   different types of time-lagged logistic models applied to these data
   revealed asymmetric patterns of associations between analogy and
   conflict. Within-domain analogies, but not within-discipline or
   outside-discipline analogies, preceded science and work process
   conflicts, suggesting that in multidisciplinary teams, representational
   gaps in very close domains will be more likely to spark conflict. But
   analogies also occurred in reaction to conflict: Process and negative
   conflicts, but not task conflicts, preceded within-discipline analogies,
   but not to within-domain or outside-discipline analogies. This study
   demonstrates ways in which cognition can be bidirectionally tied to
   social processes and discourse. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Human adults will sometimes help without being asked to help, including
   in situations in which the helpee is oblivious to the problem and thus
   provides no communicative or behavioral cues that intervention is
   necessary. Some theoretical models argue that these acts of 'proactive
   helping' are an important and possibly human-specific form of
   prosociality. Two experiments examined whether young children
   proactively help in a situation where an adult did not provide any
   concurrent behavioral cues that help was needed. Specifically, in
   Experiment 1 an experimenter either dropped an object without noticing
   (experimental condition) or on purpose (control). Even though children
   were bystanders engaged in their own task, they spontaneously intervened
   by helping instrumentally in the experimental condition in the absence
   of concurrent behavioral cues from the actor (significantly more often
   than in the control condition). These acts increased significantly from
   21 to 31 months of age, probably reflecting children's emerging
   social-cognitive capacities to represent goal-directed action.
   Experiment 2 replicated proactive helping in 2-year-olds in a more
   closely matched comparison in which in both experimental and control
   conditions the actor did not notice the accident, and children thus had
   to infer whether help was needed from the actor's previous responses
   alone. This result shows that children are able to infer a need for
   intervention on concurrent situational cues, without behavioral or
   communicative cues by the helpee. These results indicate that proactive
   prosociality might be a characteristic of early human ontogeny, emerging
   in children as young as two years of age. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Background Determining the underlying causes of racial disparities in
   sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is important. In the USA, rates
   of the most common STIs range from 5 to 20 times higher for
   African-Americans compared to Caucasians, and the health consequences of
   STIs can be serious. Residential racial segregation results in very
   different contexts for individuals and may be an important determinant
   of sexual risk. The purpose of this study was to examine how segregation
   and race interact to impact the age trajectory of sexual risk
   behaviours.
   Methods Using 11 years of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
   Youth 1997 (1997-2007) and 2000 Census data, the authors performed
   three-level hierarchical linear regression to examine the associations
   between hypersegregation, race and a sexual risk behaviour index among
   black and white non-Hispanic adolescents as they transition to
   adulthood.
   Results Through most of the teenage years, African-Americans are at
   higher sexual risk than Caucasians. However, by age 19, Caucasians are
   at higher risk. Hypersegregation was not associated with increased
   sexual risk index score on average and did not impact the trajectory of
   the race-sexual risk association.
   Conclusions The authors did not find any evidence that hypersegregation
   was associated with the sex risk index or that it modified the race-sex
   risk association as individuals got older. Future studies should examine
   whether segregation is associated with other causes of STI/HIV
   acquisition risk, such as sexual network patterns.

   important in much of classical and neoclassical economics. The article
   identifies and considers certain elements and implications of irrational

AB In his later works Charles Tilly extended his analysis of contention by
   scrutinizing the dynamics of contentious performances and the enactment
   of identities through them. Complementing these investigations he
   analyzed the centrality of trust networks in sustained challenges to
   authority. On a somewhat detached track Tilly developed an examination
   of reason giving in social life and more particularly the ways in which
   people do critical transactional work through stories, often with the
   assessment of credit and blame. In this chapter, we quilt these various
   pieces to offer an analysis of how storytelling is vital to the
   construction of trust and blame in contentious performances, both in the
   face of threat and opportunity. We explain how these later works on
   storytelling, identities, and trust can be integrated fruitfully with
   his many writings on contention to expand the analysis of its culture
   dimensions. We draw on three years of field work with a chapter of the
   Voice of the Faithful, an organization of Catholics that formed in the
   wake of the priest sexual abuse crisis, to exemplify this integration of
   Tilly's work. Using data from field notes and interviews we demonstrate
   how chapter members engage in the telling standard stories of origin,
   legacy and transformation, and trust in their pursuit of change and in
   maintaining internal solidarity. We conclude that our integration of
   Tilly's later work can be added to other perspectives on narrative to
   broaden the cultural analysis of contention.

AB Purpose - I suggest that we conceptualize labor markets as observable
   social networks, in which workplaces are the nodes and people moving
   between workplaces are the edges. The movement of people delivers the
   actionable information as to what the supply, demand, and going wage for
   labor might be. Labor market networks are hypothesized to be quite thin
   thus leading to substantial wage setting autonomy within workplaces,
   consistent with contemporary observations in both economics and
   sociology as to the weakness of labor market signals.
   Method - This paper reviews theoretical and empirical work in economics,
   sociology, and network science and develops a network image of labor
   market structure and function. Hypotheses derived from economic,
   sociological, and network theories are proposed to explain
   workplace-level wage setting.
   Findings - Information flow, trust in information, information variance,
   collusion, and status beliefs are all proposed as important network
   properties of labor markets. The paper outlines an observational
   strategy to make labor markets scientifically observable.
   Originality - Economists and sociologists often refer to labor markets
   as mechanisms setting the price of labor but rarely observe them. This
   paper outlines a strategy for making the invisible hand of the market
   scientifically observable.

AB Purpose - This chapter examines the role of family resources and social
   networks during the admissions process, across the college years and
   into postgraduation plans, and considers how different forms of social
   capital contribute to the intergenerational transmission of advantage.
   Methodology/approach - I conduct an analysis of survey data from a panel
   study of students attending a highly selective, private university.
   First, I examine how social class is associated with admissions
   resources, including family legacy ties to the institution, and access
   to campus networks. Next, I test the effects of campus networks and
   activities on end-of-college outcomes with logistic regression
   predicting graduation honors and multinomial logistic regression
   predicting expected and actual occupation about five years after
   graduation.
   Findings - A key benefit of an abundance of social capital is the
   ability to convert resources into other forms of capital and to
   compensate for deficits in other areas. Extensive campus networks - an
   example of immediate social capital - are associated with higher levels
   of academic performance, plans to attend graduate school, and
   high-status career aspirations. Admission preferences for legacies - an
   example of institutionalized social capital - disproportionately benefit
   white students from affluent families and serve to advantage an already
   advantaged group.
   Research limitations - This study is restricted to matriculants at an
   elite university, and results should not be generalized to all
   postsecondary students. Although social class is associated with
   differences in family resources and ties to campus, few elite university
   students enter college from households with absolute deficits of
   economic, cultural, or social capital.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to advance the medical
   sociology literature on the relationship between social cohesion and
   SRHS on an individual level. There is little information about how
   neighborhood social characteristics affect seniors' SRHS. Guided by
   tenets of the collective efficacy theory, this chapter hypothesized that
   older individuals who perceived that their neighborhood has high levels
   of social cohesion around elderly issues will have better SRHS. A
   secondary hypothesis investigates whether the relationship was
   attenuated once their neighbors' actual, self-reported attitudes toward
   seniors were taken into account.
   Methodology - Data come from a telephone survey of Indianapolis, Indiana
   residents, court data, and census information.
   Findings - Logistic regression analyses indicated that both social
   cohesion and low income are statistically significant predictors of poor
   self-rated health status. Although both are statistically significant,
   the protective association between cohesion and poor SRHS (-0.69 log
   odds) is of similar magnitude to the risky association between income
   and poor health (-0.64 log odds).
   Research implications - Consistent with the classic work of Durkheim who
   found that individuals who were more socially integrated with society
   had lower rates of suicide, our study found a significant association
   between social cohesion and SRHS.
   Value of paper - Future research is needed to target other health status
   outcomes in other geographical locations. Even though the body of
   research exploring the predictors of SRHS among older individuals is
   quite robust, this chapter adds to a more recent growing body of
   research, which has articulated the importance of the social environment
   in which an individual lives, especially community-dwelling older
   adults, is associated with their health status.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this chapter is to use sociological theory and
   research to develop an explanation for how chronic illnesses are managed
   at home and to thereby suggest some ways in which a sociological
   perspective can be applied to improve health care for persons with
   chronic illnesses. Self-care illness management is crucial to the
   prevention of and reduction of morbidity and mortality from chronic
   illness.
   Methodology/approach - Review and synthesis of research literature.
   Findings - Sociological research and theory suggest two important
   insights that should inform health care services aimed at improving
   self-care; chronic illness care occurs in the context of the household,
   neighborhood, and community and, therefore, the "patient'' (i.e., the
   object of health services) is really the caregiving social network
   around the patient, and because the risk of chronic illness and the
   resources available to deal with it are socially (and unequally)
   distributed, "health care'' interventions need to take account of
   disparities in risks and resources that will affect the patient's
   ability to successfully comply with self-care regimens.
   Research limitations/implications - The review does not include an
   examination of the clinical research literature. It does, however,
   suggest that sociologists need to explicitly study chronic illness and
   health care related to it.
   Originality/value of chapter - The chapter links the long history of
   research on family caregiving to the concern with the success of
   self-management of chronic illness. It also links concerns about that
   success to social disparities in the distribution of social resources
   and hence to morbidity and mortality disparities.

   study was to develop an automatic method for classifying detailed urban

   attributes, derived from relevant remote-sensing data, were incorporated
   for classifying four land-use classes, namely office, industrial, civic,
   and transportation, which were reported as the most difficult ones to
   classify from previous studies. An experiment was carried out in a study
   site in Austin, Texas. An overall accuracy of 61.68% and a kappa
   coefficient of 0.54 were achieved with a decision tree method. Building
   area and building height turned out to be the most influential factors
   among all the adopted variables. In addition, the variable of floor area
   ratio played the second dominant role among the seven variables,
   demonstrating that synthesized horizontal and vertical properties of
   buildings and their relevant spatial characteristics are important in
   differentiating the four classes.

AB There is an increasing interest in applying fractal analysis to measure
   the spatial complexity of remotely sensed images. This study provides an
   evaluation of the effectiveness of three fractal algorithms (isarithm,
   triangular prism, and variogram) for characterizing urban landscapes in
   Indianapolis, USA, based on eight satellite images taken by five sensors
   (Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Landsat Thematic Mapper
   (TM)/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
   Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), and IKONOS). Fractal
   dimensions (FDs) were computed for both individual spectral bands and
   classified images to understand the fractal characteristics of land-use
   and land-cover (LULC) patterns. Results indicated that FD values were
   sensitive to the computational algorithms used. It was found that the
   performance of different FD algorithms varied by application. The red
   and the near-infrared bands were the most spatially complicated bands
   among all spectral bands of the Landsat and ASTER images as well as the
   IKONOS images. The most fragmented LULC type was grassland. FD analysis
   of Landsat-derived LULC maps revealed that the urban landscape in
   Indianapolis had experienced great change between 1975 and 1991 as well
   as between 1991 and 2000. It is concluded that the fractals were useful
   in discriminating the image spatial complexity of various types and show
   potential in characterizing the temporal changes of urban landscape.
   However, fractal analysis alone may not be sufficiently effective to
   characterize urban landscape changes. Detailed quantitative change
   information is needed to assist in the interpretation of resultant FD
   values.

AB The 2010 British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater Horizon oil spill highlighted
   long-standing questions about energy exploration and its social and
   environmental implications. Sociologists studying environmental
   disasters have documented the social impacts resulting from these events
   and dissatisfaction with government and industry responses. In this
   paper, we use data from a survey conducted during the Gulf of Mexico oil
   spill to examine how Louisiana and Florida residents' social
   backgrounds, experiences with the spill, and trust in information
   sources predict their perceptions of governmental and BP response
   efforts. We find that direct personal impacts and compensation strongly
   influence the evaluations of responding organizations. Age and place of
   residence also predict such assessments. Finally, levels of confidence
   in television news and BP as sources of information appear to shape Gulf
   Coast residents' opinions about the work of organizations responding to
   the Deepwater Horizon disaster. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Background: The main goal of this study is to examine the associations
   between illness conditions and out-of-pocket medical expenditure with
   other types of household consumptions. In November and December of 2011,
   a survey was conducted in three cities in western China, namely Lan
   Zhou, Gui Lin and Xi An, and their surrounding rural areas.
   Results: Information on demographics, income and consumption was
   collected on 2,899 households. Data analysis suggested that the presence
   of household members with chronic diseases was not associated with
   characteristics of households or household heads. The presence of
   inpatient treatments was significantly associated with the age of
   household head (p-value 0.03). The level of per capita medical expense
   was significantly associated with household size, presence of members
   younger than 18, older than 65, basic health insurance coverage, per
   capita income, and household head occupation. Adjusting for confounding
   effects, the presence of chronic diseases was negatively associated with
   the amount of basic consumption (p-value 0.02) and the percentage of
   basic consumption (p-value 0.01), but positively associated with the
   percentage of insurance expense (p-value 0.02). Medical expenditure was
   positively associated with all other types of consumptions, including
   basic, education, saving and investment, entertainment, insurance,
   durable goods, and alcohol/tobacco. It was negatively associated with
   the percentage of basic consumption, saving and investment, and
   insurance.
   Conclusions: Early studies conducted in other Asian countries and rural
   China found negative associations between illness conditions and medical
   expenditure with other types of consumptions. This study was conducted
   in three major cities and surrounding areas in western China, which had
   not been well investigated in published literature. The observed
   consumption patterns were different from those in early studies, and the
   negative associations were not observed. This study may complement the
   existing rural studies and provide useful information on western Chinese
   cities.

AB At the top of parents' many wishes is for their children to be happy, to
   be good, and to be well-liked. Our findings suggest that these goals may
   not only be compatible but also reciprocal. In a longitudinal experiment
   conducted in 19 classrooms in Vancouver, 9- to 11-year olds were
   instructed to perform three acts of kindness (versus visit three places)
   per week over the course of 4 weeks. Students in both conditions
   improved in well-being, but students who performed kind acts experienced
   significantly bigger increases in peer acceptance (or sociometric
   popularity) than students who visited places. Increasing peer acceptance
   is a critical goal, as it is related to a variety of important academic
   and social outcomes, including reduced likelihood of being bullied.
   Teachers and interventionists can build on this study by introducing
   intentional prosocial activities into classrooms and recommending that
   such activities be performed regularly and purposefully.

AB Matrilineal kinship organization is a human social system that
   emphasizes interactions between matrilineal kin, i.e. individuals
   related only through females. The 'matrilineal puzzle' refers to the
   potential for tension characteristic of this social system, owing to the
   conflict between the interests and responsibilities of men in their
   roles as brother/uncle versus husband/father. From an evolutionary
   perspective, matrilineal kinship organization is puzzling when it
   diverts investment of resources from the individuals who provide the
   potentially highest reproductive returns. I use a game-theoretic
   framework to investigate a particular form of matrilineal
   inheritance-the transfer of property from a maternal uncle to a sororal
   nephew. The analysis reveals two mechanisms that may make this strategy
   a stable evolutionary outcome. First, a polygynous male has multiple
   wives, and hence multiple brothers-in-law; with matrilineal inheritance,
   each additional brother-in-law may transfer resources to the male's
   wife's offspring, thus potentially contributing to the male's inclusive
   fitness. Second, the husband of a polyandrous female is effectively
   'sharing' paternity with other men; depending on the number of husbands,
   he may be better off investing in his sister's offspring. I conclude by
   discussing how these results address the challenges posed by the
   occurrence of matrilineal kinship organization.

AB Lifespan increases observed in the United States and elsewhere
   throughout the developed world, have been attributed in part to
   improvements in medical care access and technology and to healthier
   lifestyles. To differentiate the relative contributions of these two
   factors, we have compared lifespan in the Old Order Amish (OOA), a
   population with historically low use of medical care, with that of
   Caucasian participants from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), focusing
   on individuals who have reached at least age 30 years. Analyses were
   based on 2,108 OOA individuals from the Lancaster County, PA community
   born between 1890 and 1921 and 5,079 FHS participants born approximately
   the same time. Vital status was ascertained on 96.9% of the OOA cohort
   through 2011 and through systematic follow-up of the FHS cohort. The
   lifespan part of the study included an enlargement of the Anabaptist
   Genealogy Database to 539,822 individuals, which will be of use in other
   studies of the Amish. Mortality comparisons revealed that OOA men
   experienced better longevity (p<0.001) and OOA women comparable
   longevity than their FHS counterparts. We further documented all OOA
   hospital discharges in Lancaster County, PA during 2002-2004 and
   compared OOA discharge rates to Caucasian national rates obtained from
   the National Hospital Discharge Survey for the same time period. Both
   OOA men and women experienced markedly lower rates of hospital
   discharges than their non-Amish counterparts, despite the increased
   lifespan. We speculate that lifestyle factors may predispose the OOA to
   greater longevity and perhaps to lesser hospital use. Identifying these
   factors, which might include behaviors such as lesser tobacco use,
   greater physical activity, and/or enhanced community assimilation, and
   assessing their transferability to non-Amish communities may produce
   significant gains to the public health.

AB BACKGROUND: Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is one of the most common types of
   cancer among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) in the United States.
   Unfortunately, a greater percentage of AYAs are presenting with an
   advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis compared with their
   younger counterparts. METHODS: The objective of the current study was to
   examine the association between possible barriers and characteristics
   (including gender, race, birthplace, marital status, socioeconomic
   status [SES], and insurance status) that may increase the risk of
   advanced stage HL at the time of diagnosis in a large cohort of AYA
   patients with HL from the California Cancer Registry (7343 incident
   cases of HL diagnosed from 1988-2006, between ages 15 years-40 years).
   RESULTS: AYAs with advanced stage HL were more likely to be male, of
   Hispanic or black race/ethnicity, foreign born, single, of lower SES,
   and uninsured or to have only public health insurance (P < .05).
   Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that there was a
   significant increase in the odds of having advanced HL in males (odds
   ratio [OR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.42-1.74 [P <
   .0001]), those with the lowest SES (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.23-1.75 [P =
   .0003]), those without health insurance (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.34-2.31 [P
   < .0001]), and those with public health insurance (OR, 1.45; 95% CI,
   1.23-1.71 [P < .0001]). CONCLUSIONS: A strong association was found
   between male gender, lower SES, and lack of health insurance and
   advanced stage HL at the time of diagnosis in AYAs (See editorial on
   pages 000-000, this issue.) Cancer 2012;118:6179-87. (C) 2012 American

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) for both individuals and neighborhoods has
   been positively associated with incidence of breast cancer, although not
   consistently. The authors conducted an assessment of these factors among
   African-American women, based on data from the Black Womens Health
   Study, a prospective cohort study of 59,000 African-American women from
   all regions of the United States. Individual SES was defined as the
   participants self-reported level of education, and neighborhood SES was
   measured by a score based on census block group data for 6 indicators of
   income and education. Analyses included 1,343 incident breast cancer
   cases identified during follow-up from 1995 through 2009. In
   age-adjusted analyses, SES for both individuals and neighborhoods was
   associated with an increased incidence of estrogen receptor-positive
   breast cancer. The associations were attenuated by control for parity
   and age at first birth, and there was no association after further
   control for other breast cancer risk factors. These findings suggest
   that the observed associations of breast cancer with SES may be largely
   mediated by reproductive factors that are associated with both estrogen
   receptor-positive breast cancer and SES.

AB Human voice pitch research has focused on perceptions of attractiveness,
   strength, and social dominance. Here we examine the influence of pitch
   on selection of leaders, and whether this influence varies by leadership
   role. Male and female leaders with lower-pitched (i.e., masculine)
   voices are generally preferred by both men and women. We asked whether
   this preference shifts to favor higher-pitch (i.e., feminine) voices
   within the specific context of leadership positions that are typically
   held by women (i.e., feminine leadership roles). In hypothetical
   elections for two such positions, men and women listened to pairs of
   male and female voices that differed only in pitch, and were asked which
   of each pair they would vote for. As in previous studies, men and women
   preferred female candidates with masculine voices. Likewise, men
   preferred men with masculine voices. Women, however, did not
   discriminate between male voices. Overall, contrary to research showing
   that perceptions of voice pitch can be influenced by social context,
   these results suggest that the influence of voice pitch on perceptions
   of leadership capacity is largely consistent across different domains of
   leadership.

AB Many studies demonstrate that there is still a significant gender bias,
   especially at higher career levels, in many areas including science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We investigated
   field-dependent, gender-specific effects of the selective pressures
   individuals experience as they pursue a career in academia within seven
   STEM disciplines. We built a unique database that comprises 437,787
   publications authored by 4,292 faculty members at top United States
   research universities. Our analyses reveal that gender differences in
   publication rate and impact are discipline-specific. Our results also
   support two hypotheses. First, the widely-reported lower publication
   rates of female faculty are correlated with the amount of research
   resources typically needed in the discipline considered, and thus may be
   explained by the lower level of institutional support historically
   received by females. Second, in disciplines where pursuing an academic
   position incurs greater career risk, female faculty tend to have a
   greater fraction of higher impact publications than males. Our findings
   have significant, field-specific, policy implications for achieving
   diversity at the faculty level within the STEM disciplines.

   endorse the individual-focused moral concerns of compassion and fairness
   more than conservatives do, and conservatives endorse the group-focused

   Across the political spectrum, moral stereotypes about "typical"
   liberals and conservatives correctly reflected the direction of actual
   differences in foundation endorsement but exaggerated the magnitude of
   these differences. Contrary to common theories of stereotyping, the
   moral stereotypes were not simple underestimations of the political
   outgroup's morality. Both liberals and conservatives exaggerated the
   ideological extremity of moral concerns for the ingroup as well as the
   outgroup. Liberals were least accurate about both groups.

AB Complex traits can require the accumulation of multiple mutations that
   are individually deleterious. Their evolution requires a fitness valley
   to be crossed, which can take relatively long time spans. A new
   evolutionary mechanism is described that accelerates the emergence of
   complex phenotypes, based on a "division of labor'' game and the
   occurrence of cheaters. If each intermediate mutation leads to a product
   that can be shared with others, the complex type can arise relatively
   quickly as an emergent property among cooperating individuals, without
   any given individual having to accumulate all mutations. Moreover, the
   emergence of cheaters that destroy cooperative interactions can lead to
   the emergence of individuals that have accumulated all necessary
   mutations on a time scale that is significantly faster than observed in
   the absence of cooperation and cheating. Application of this mechanism
   to somatic and microbial evolution is discussed, including evolutionary
   processes in tumors, biofilms, and viral infections.

AB Objective: We examined the risk of depression as it relates to social
   support among individuals from African American, Caribbean Black, and
   non-Hispanic White backgrounds.
   Methods: 6,082 individuals participated in the National Survey of
   American Life (NSAL), a nationally representative, psychiatric
   epidemiological, cross-sectional survey of household populations. The
   survey is designed to explore racial and ethnic differences in mental
   disorders. NSAL survey questions were used as a proxy for social
   support. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the correlates
   between having a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder in the
   past year, demographic variables, and social support.
   Results: African American race/ethnicity was associated with decreased
   odds of depression when compared to non-Hispanic Whites, even when
   controlling for social support variables and demographics (OR = 0.51,
   95% CI = 0.43-0.60). We found a three-fold increase in risk of
   depression among individuals who reported feeling "not very close at
   all" with family members compared to those who reported feeling "very
   close" to family (OR = 3.35, 95% CI = 1.81-6.19).
   Conclusions: These findings reinforce previous research documenting the
   important relationship between social support and depression, and
   perhaps should lead us to re-examine the individualistic models of
   treatment that are most evaluated in United States. The lack of
   evidence-based data on support groups, peer counseling, family therapy,
   or other social support interventions may reflect a majority-culture
   bias toward individualism, which belies the extensive body of research
   on social support deficits as a major risk factor for depression.

AB Objective: To pilot test a culturally adapted behavioral weight loss
   intervention in obese and overweight Latino adults.
   Design: Pilot study.
   Setting: Latino community organization in Durham, North Carolina.
   Participants: Overweight and obese, self-identified Latinos >= 18 years
   old.
   Intervention: Intervention consisted of 20 weekly group sessions (90-120
   minutes each) incorporating motivational interviewing techniques. The
   intervention goal was weight loss by adopting the Dietary Approach to
   Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary pattern, increasing physical activity,
   and reducing caloric intake. The cultural adaptation included foods and
   physical activities commonly used in the Latino culture, using a
   Spanish-speaking interventionist, and conducting the intervention at a
   local Latino community organization.
   Main outcome measures: Weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure,
   dietary pattern, and physical activity were measured at baseline and at
   20 weeks.
   Results: A total of 56 participants are included in the final analysis.
   The average weight loss was 5.1 lbs (95% CI -8.7 to -1.5; P=.006); and
   there was a reduction in BMI of 1.3 kg/m(2) (95% CI -2.2 to -0.5;
   P=.002) at 20 weeks. Systolic blood pressure decreased by 2.6 mm Hg (95%
   CI -4.7 to -0.6; P=.013).
   Conclusion: A culturally adapted behavioral intervention for the
   treatment of overweight and obesity is potentially effective in a
   diverse group of Latino adults.

AB This study examined the influence of social distance upon the patients'
   perceptions of the quality of care delivered by their non-native
   international medical graduates (NNIMGs) in an inner-city primary care
   residency program. Within the inner city, there is a growing trend of
   NNIMGs providing health care services, thereby creating a situation of
   maximal social distance with respect to nativity, race, and
   socioeconomic status.
   Design: Two female NNIMG residents, one from India and one from China,
   were the focus of ten hour-long in-depth interviews with patients who
   participated in this exploratory qualitative research.
   Results and Conclusions: Structural supports, communication processes,
   and status equalization effects emerged as three self-reported
   influences on the assessment of care that were particular to their
   physician's NNIMG status. The physician's NNIMG status seemed to exert a
   status equalization effect that reduced social distance and subsequently
   increased the perception of the quality of care.

AB The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recently realigned its
   research enterprise around the concept of sustainability. Scientists
   from across multiple disciplines have a role to play in contributing the
   information, methods, and tools needed to more fully understand the
   long-term impacts of decisions on the social and economic sustainability
   of communities. Success will depend on a shift in thinking to integrate,
   organize, and prioritize research within a systems context. We used the
   Driving forces-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework as a
   basis for integrating social, cultural, and economic aspects of
   environmental and human health into a single framework. To make the
   framework broadly applicable to sustainability research planning, we
   provide a hierarchical system of DPSIR keywords and guidelines for use
   as a communication tool. The applicability of the integrated framework
   was first tested on a public health issue (asthma disparities) for
   purposes of discussion. We then applied the framework at a science
   planning meeting to identify opportunities for sustainable and healthy
   communities research. We conclude that an integrated systems framework
   has many potential roles in science planning, including identifying key
   issues, visualizing interactions within the system, identifying research
   gaps, organizing information, developing computational models, and
   identifying indicators.

EP 405
PD DEC 2012
PY 2012
AB Interviewing about death and loss can bring up unexpected emotions for
   respondents and interviewers. Positivist social scientific research
   methods often either ignore the emotions of the researcher, or argue
   that emotional expressions are to be avoided in research, even when the
   topic is thought to inspire intense feelings - like death and dying.
   This article argues for taking an alternative position toward emotions
   in death and dying research. Using data from over two years of
   participant observation and 34 semi-structured interviews with hospice
   workers, I illustrate one potential way to productively and ethically
   share emotions during a research interview. This approach includes
   learning and being open to the 'moderated cry', which involves minimal
   tears, the absence of sobbing, and an overt acknowledgment of the
   emotional reaction. This article illustrates the ways respondents in
   this research used the moderated cry as well as the value of
   reconsidering prohibitions on emotions in research.

AB Recent decades have seen an evolution in thinking on the sustainability
   of forest-dependent communities from community stability to community
   resilience, which seeks to enhance communities' ability to respond to
   drivers of change in ways that sustain the multiple dimensions of
   well-being. However, the process of community response to drivers of
   change is not well understood and methods for assessing community
   resilience are not fully developed. This paper proposes a theoretical
   model to understand the structures and processes influencing the
   adaptation of communities and households to drivers of change and which
   can serve as a guide to the development of indicators for assessing
   resilience across multiple scales. The model synthesizes the
   interactional community theory from rural sociology and the theory of
   resilience in social-ecological systems from the field of applied
   ecology. The implications of the model for theory and methods are
   discussed.

AB Cities are embedded within larger-scale engineered infrastructures (e.
   g., electric power, water supply, and transportation networks) that
   convey natural resources over large distances for use by people in
   cities. The sustainability of city systems therefore depends upon
   complex, cross-scale interactions between the natural system, the
   transboundary engineered infrastructures, and the multiple social actors
   and institutions that govern these infrastructures. These elements, we
   argue, are best studied in an integrated manner using a novel
   social-ecological-infrastructural systems (SEIS) framework. In the
   biophysical subsystem, the SEIS framework integrates urban metabolism
   with life cycle assessment to articulate transboundary infrastructure
   supply chain water, energy, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission footprints
   of cities. These infrastructure footprints make visible multiple
   resources (water, energy, materials) used directly or indirectly
   (embodied) to support human activities in cities. They inform
   cross-scale and cross-infrastructure sector strategies for mitigating
   environmental pollution, public health risks and supply chain risks
   posed to cities. In the social subsystem, multiple theories drawn from
   the social sciences explore interactions between three actor
   categories-individual resource users, infrastructure designers and
   operators, and policy actors-who interact with each other and with
   infrastructures to shape cities toward sustainability outcomes. Linking
   of the two subsystems occurs by integrating concepts, theories, laws,
   and models across environmental sciences/climatology, infrastructure
   engineering, industrial ecology, architecture, urban planning,
   behavioral sciences, public health, and public affairs. Such integration
   identifies high-impact leverage points in the urban SEIS. An
   interdisciplinary SEIS-based curriculum on sustainable cities is
   described and evaluated for its efficacy in promoting systems thinking
   and interdisciplinary vocabulary development, both of which are measures
   of effective frameworks.

AB Community-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting is confounded
   by the relatively small spatial size of cities compared to nations-due
   to which, energy use in essential infrastructures serving cities, such
   as commuter and airline transport, energy supply, water supply,
   wastewater infrastructures, and others, often occurs outside the
   boundaries of the cities using them. The trans-boundary infrastructure
   supply chain footprint (TBIF) GHG emissions accounting method, tested in
   eight U.S. cities, incorporates supply chain aspects of these
   trans-boundary infrastructures serving cities, and is akin to an
   expanded geographic GHG emissions inventory. This article shows the
   results from applying the TBIF method in the rapidly developing city of
   Delhi, India.
   The objectives of this research are to (1) describe the data
   availability for implementing the TBIF method within a rapidly
   industrializing country, using the case of Delhi, India; (2) identify
   methodological differences in implementation of the TBIF method between
   Indian versus U.S. cities; and (3) compare broad energy use metrics
   between Delhi and U.S. cities, demonstrated by Denver, Colorado, USA,
   whose energy use characteristics and TBIF GHG emissions have previously
   been shown to be similar to U.S. per capita averages.
   This article concludes that most data required to implement the TBIF
   method in Delhi are readily available, and the methodology could be
   translated from U.S. to Indian cities. Delhi's 2009 community-wide GHG
   emissions totaled 40.3 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide
   equivalents (t CO2-eq), which are normalized to yield 2.3 t CO2-eq per
   capita; nationally, India reports its average per capita GHG emissions
   at 1.5 t CO2-eq. In-boundary GHG emissions contributed to 68% of Delhi's
   total, where end use (including electricity) energy in residential
   buildings, commercial and industrial usage, and fuel used in surface
   transportation contributed 24%, 19%, and 21%, respectively. The
   remaining 4% of the in-boundary GHG emissions were from waste disposal,
   water and wastewater treatment, and cattle. Trans-boundary
   infrastructures were estimated to equal 32% of Delhi's TBIF GHG
   emissions, with 5% attributed to fuel processing, 3% to air travel, 10%
   to cement, and 14% to food production outside the city.

AB OBJECTIVES: Living in substandard housing may be one factor that
   increases the risk of fire and burn injuries in low-income urban
   environments. The purposes of this study are to (1) describe the
   frequency and characteristics of substandard housing in urban homes with
   young children and (2) explore the hypothesis that better housing
   quality is associated with a greater likelihood of having working smoke
   alarms and safe hot water temperatures.
   METHODS: A total 246 caregivers of children ages 0 to 7 years were
   recruited from a pediatric emergency department and a well-child clinic.
   In-home observations were completed by using 46 items from the Housing
   and Urban Development's Housing Quality Standards.
   RESULTS: Virtually all homes (99%) failed the housing quality measure.
   Items with the highest failure rates were those related to heating and
   cooling; walls, ceilings, and floors; and sanitation and safety domains.
   One working smoke alarm was observed in 82% of the homes, 42% had 1 on
   every level, and 62% had safe hot water temperatures. For every increase
   of 1 item in the number of housing quality items passed, the odds of
   having any working smoke alarm increased by 10%, the odds of having 1 on
   every level by 18%, and the odds of having safe hot water temperatures
   by 8%.
   CONCLUSIONS: Many children may be at heightened risk for fire and scald
   burns by virtue of their home environment. Stronger collaboration
   between housing, health care, and injury prevention professionals is
   urgently needed to maximize opportunities to improve home safety.

AB The food justice movement is a budding social movement premised on
   ideologies that critique the structural oppression responsible for many
   injustices throughout the agrifood system. Tensions often arise however
   when a radical ideology in various versions from multiple previous
   movements is woven into mobilization efforts by organizations seeking to
   build the activist base needed to transform the agrifood system. I
   provide a detailed case study of the People's Grocery, a food justice
   organization in West Oakland, California, to show how anti-oppression
   ideology provides the foundation upon which food justice activists
   mobilize. People's Grocery builds off of previous social justice
   movements within West Oakland, reflected in activist meaning making
   around ideas of social justice and autonomy. However, the ongoing
   mobilization process also faces complications stemming from diverse
   individual interpretations of food justice-that may not be reflected in
   the stated goals of food justice organizations-as well as structural
   constraints. Consequently, building a social movement premised on food
   justice opens up social spaces for new activism, but may not be a
   panacea for solving food-related racial and economic inequality. The
   findings have implications for newly forming food justice organizations,
   future research on the food justice movement, as well as for theories on
   social movement mobilization.

AB A wide literature in the sociology of agriculture has depicted the
   development of agricultural experiment stations at land grant colleges
   as part of a development project to improve agricultural productivity in
   particular commodities. Some experiment stations developed regional
   agricultural centers or stations to improve productivity and address
   local concerns, recognizing the importance of context in rural
   development. Through analysis of one such station, the Dixon Springs
   Agricultural Center in Southern Illinois, this paper describes how
   regional agricultural stations played a key role in the often
   conflicting agricultural programs of and following the New Deal. Changes
   in university structure from the 1970s to present and the current
   national recession have led to financial crises that have put these
   stations in a precarious position. Still, we argue that these
   institutions ought to be recognized as regional resources for a new era
   of agricultural development, and we suggest approaching that new era by
   building on the existing literature of community-university
   partnerships.

   members of Evangelical and established (Anglican and Catholic) churches
   do not differ significantly in terms of their adherence to dietary
   restrictions and members of Sabbatarian churches show a stronger
   tendency to adhere to dietary taboos than Evangelicals or members of
   established churches. Counter to expectations, we found no significant
   difference in avoidance of meat between households belonging to
   established and Evangelical churches. Furthermore, members of all church
   groups deviated in terms of dietary restrictions from indigenous norms
   as exemplified in dietary advice given by shamans. We conclude that,
   despite doctrinal opposition to shamanistic practices associated with
   indigenous taboos, there is continuity in terms of dietary practice
   among Makushi and Wapishana households that have converted to
   Evangelical and, to some degree, Sabbatarian forms of Christianity.

   integrate Simmel's late theory of the relational self into the formal

   forms of association among self-relating individuals. On this model,
   every "node" in an interaction has relations not only to others but also
   to itself, specifically between its ideality and its actuality. We go on
   to integrate this self-relation into a formal model of social relations.
   This model provides a way to describe configurations of social
   interactions defined by the forms according to which social relations
   realize participants' ideal selves. We examine four formal dimensions
   along which these self-relational relationships can vary: distance,
   symmetry, scope, and actualization.

AB Sociologists have argued that markets are politically constituted, yet

   used by economic sociologists-can be further developed to explain how
   mobilization reproduces markets in some moments while reorganizing them
   in others. Specifically, I link the concept of cultural framing to
   rent-seeking mobilization within markets to better explain when
   political contestation will lead to new market institutions and when it
   will fail to do so. I illustrate the value of this approach through an
   analysis of deregulation in the U. S. airline industry and conclude by
   discussing the consequences of the model and empirical case for the
   politics of markets, the rise of neoliberalism, and economic

PY 2012
AB I argue that the use of heritable modifications for psychology,
   personality, and behavior should be limited to the reversal or
   prevention of relatively unambiguous instances of pathology or likely
   harm (e.g. sociopathy). Most of the likely modifications of
   psychological personality would not be of this nature, however, and
   parents therefore should not have the freedom to make such modifications
   to future children. I argue by examining the viewpoints of both the
   individual and society. For individuals, modifications would interfere
   with their capacity for self-determination in a way that undermines the
   very concept of self-determination. I argue that modification of
   psychology and personality is unlike present parenting in morally

AB Impairment in social communication is one of the diagnostic hallmarks of
   autism spectrum disorders, and a large body of research has documented
   aspects of impaired social cognition in autism, both at the level of the
   processes and the neural structures involved. Yet one of the most common
   social communicative abilities in everyday life, the ability to judge
   somebody's emotion from their facial expression, has yielded conflicting
   findings. To investigate this issue, we used a sensitive task that has
   been used to assess facial emotion perception in a number of
   neurological and psychiatric populations. Fifteen high-functioning
   adults with autism and 19 control participants rated the emotional
   intensity of 36 faces displaying basic emotions. Every face was rated 6
   times-once for each emotion category. The autism group gave ratings that
   were significantly less sensitive to a given emotion, and less reliable
   across repeated testing, resulting in overall decreased specificity in
   emotion perception. We thus demonstrate a subtle but specific pattern of
   impairments in facial emotion perception in people with autism. (C) 2012

AB When interacting with someone from another social group, one's responses
   may be influenced by both stereotypes and evaluations. Given behavioral
   results suggesting that stereotypes and evaluative associations operate
   independently, we used fMRI to test whether these biases are mediated by
   distinct brain systems. White participants viewed pairs of Black or
   White faces and judged them based on an evaluation (who would you
   befriend?) or a stereotype-relevant trait (who is more likely to enjoy
   athletic activities?). Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed that a
   predominantly occipital network represented race in a context-invariant
   manner. However, lateral orbitofrontal cortex preferentially represented
   race during friendship judgments, whereas anterior medial prefrontal
   cortex preferentially represented race during trait judgments.
   Furthermore, representation of race in left temporal pole correlated
   with a behavioral measure of evaluative bias during friendship judgments
   and, independently, a measure of stereotyping during trait judgments.
   Whereas early sensory regions represent race in an apparently invariant
   manner, representations in higher-level regions are multi-componential
   and context-dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. Recent guidelines highlight the importance of improving
   cardiovascular health in the general population in addition to disease
   prevention among high risk individuals. We investigated factors
   associated with ethnic and nativity-related differences in the
   prevalence of low cardiovascular risk (optimal levels of all major
   cardiovascular risk factors).
   Methods. We used logistic regression to estimate differences in
   likelihood of being low risk (not currently smoking; no diabetes;
   untreated total cholesterol <200 mg/dL; untreated blood pressure
   <120/<80; and body mass index <25 kg/m(2)) among 8693 foreign- and
   U.S.-born Mexican-American and non-Hispanic White 2003-2008 U.S.
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants before and
   after adjustment for socioeconomic, lifestyle, and acculturation-related
   factors.
   Results. Foreign-born Mexican-Americans were more likely to be low risk
   than non-Hispanic Whites after adjustment for all covariates (Odds Ratio
   [OR]: 1.53; 95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.00, 2.34). In contrast,
   U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were less likely to be low risk compared to
   Whites (OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.84). Differences between foreign-born
   and U.S.-born Mexican-Americans were largely attenuated after adjustment
   for acculturation indicators.
   Conclusions. Our findings support the healthy migrant hypothesis and
   suggest that acculturation-related factors may be important drivers of
   ethnic and nativity-related differences in low cardiovascular risk. (C)

AB Purpose: To assess the association between self-reported racial
   discrimination and prenatal depressive symptoms among black women.
   Methods: Our study population consisted of two cohorts of pregnant
   women: the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress
   project (ACCESS) and Project Viva. We measured self-reported racial
   discrimination among black women using a modified Experiences of
   Discrimination scale (score 0-8). We assessed elevated depressive
   symptoms (EDS) with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (>= 13 on a
   0-30 scale).
   Results: Fifty-four percent of ACCESS and 78% of Viva participants
   reported experiencing racial discrimination. After adjusting for age,
   marital status, income, education, and nativity, a 1-U increment in
   Experiences of Discrimination score was associated with 48% increased
   odds of EDS (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.76) for
   ACCESS participants but was not significantly associated among Viva
   participants (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.37). In
   both cohorts, responding to unfair treatment by talking to others was
   associated with the lowest odds of EDS.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher levels of perceived racial
   discrimination may increase depressive symptoms during pregnancy among
   U.S. black women. Interventions involving talking to others may aid in
   reducing the risk of depressive symptoms among black women experiencing
   higher levels of racial discrimination. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

   Methods: We analyzed a sample of 2143 older individuals (60 years of age
   and over) from 49 distritos of the Municipality of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   Bayesian multilevel logistic models were performed with poor self-rated
   health as the outcome variable.
   Results: Income inequality (measured by the Gini coefficient) was found
   to be associated with poor self-rated health after controlling for age,
   sex, income and education (odds ratio, 1.19; 95% credible interval,
   1.01-1.38). When the practice of physical exercise and homicide rate
   were added to the model, the Gini coefficient lost its statistical
   significance (P>.05). We fitted a structural equation model in which
   income inequality affects elderly health by a pathway mediated by
   violence and practice of physical exercise.
   Conclusions: The health of older individuals may be highly susceptible
   to the socioeconomic environment of residence, specifically to the local
   distribution of income. We propose that this association may be mediated
   by fear of violence and lack of physical activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   self-reported diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Drawing on the 2009
   California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), the sample included 3,003
   adults (representative of N = 998,795) aged 60 and older from five
   racial and ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white (n = 2,153), African
   American (n = 213), Hispanic (n = 336), Asian (n = 306), and American
   Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) (n = 59). All self-reported a diagnosis
   of diabetes mellitus. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression
   analyses were conducted using weighted data. Results from adjusted
   logistic regressions indicated significant racial and ethnic differences
   between non-Hispanic white elderly and the other groups examined.
   Specifically, African Americans were significantly less likely than
   whites to see a doctor and to have a usual source of care, and were more
   likely to visit the emergency department (ED) for diabetes mellitus and
   to have their feet examined by a provider. Hispanics were significantly
   less likely to take medicine to lower cholesterol but were more likely
   to test their blood glucose regularly (following ADA guidelines). Asians
   were significantly less likely than whites to test their blood glucose
   regularly or have a foot examination. AI/ANs were significantly less
   likely than whites to see a doctor, visit an ED, and take medication to
   reduce heart attack risk but were more likely to use insulin, oral
   diabetic medication, or both. The findings suggest the need for racial-
   and ethnic-specific interventions for managing diabetes mellitus to help
   reduce existing racial and ethnic disparities among elderly adults. J Am

AB Over the past 10 years, despite a slight increase in life expectancy and
   a decrease in all causes of deaths, the percentage of the US population
   with heart disease, cancer, diabetes, hypertension and obesity has
   increased. So even though Americans are living longer, they are plagued
   by increasing incidences of morbidities. This trend is also reflective
   of the global population, where 17.3 million people died from
   cardiovascular disease in 2008, and an estimated 23.6 million are
   expected to die from this disease in 2030. Whereas access to medical
   care and management of certain diseases has improved, it is clear that
   the incidence and treatment of chronic disease has not kept pace. The
   discovery of nitric oxide (NO) production in the human body is a
   relatively new advancement of modern medicine. Unfortunately, NO is
   still not at the forefront of therapy. In the clinical setting, there
   are no standard laboratory diagnostics for NO status and no prescription
   therapies to safely and effectively restore NO homeostasis, despite
   being recognized as the earliest indicator for a number of different
   chronic diseases. This review will reveal how many modern therapies and
   western lifestyles actually lead to a decrease in NO homeostasis in
   patients, from pediatrics to geriatrics. The findings outlined here
   highlight why nitric oxide homeostasis should be accounted for and
   considered in the treatment of patients and in the development of new
   therapies. Understanding NO homeostasis in each patient and how
   treatments and procedures affect NO homeostasis should allow for better
   medical care and improved outcomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Contrary to common perceptions of Simmel's work as dividing into three
   stages of Darwinism, Kantianism, and Goethean/Bergsonian
   Life-Philosophy, consideration of the full scope of the Georg Simmel
   Gesamtausgabe demonstrates Simmel's concern with both Kant and Goethe as
   life-long, just as was his engagement with core principles respectively
   associated with them: Form and Life. What changed in his mind over time
   was how those two principles were construed and related. In this view,
   Simmel's Soziologie can be read as a treatise on the properties of
   social forms that emerge out of vital processes - following a dynamic
   akin to Blumenbach's Bildungstrieb, whereas the Lebensanschauung puts
   more emphasis on the ways in which forms channel, constrain, and inspire
   the streams of life. This opens the door for creative work pursuing
   lines of connection between the two disciplines - a sociology of
   authentic individuality and a kind of existentialized sociology - and,
   beyond that, to a unified theory of action and evolution.

AB Georg Simmel's final work, The View of Life, concludes his lifelong
   engagement with Immanuel Kant by 'inverting' Kant's Categorical
   Imperative to produce an ethics of authentic individuality. While Kant's
   moral imperative is universal to all individuals but particular to their
   discrete acts, Simmel's Law of the Individual is particular to each
   individual but universal to all the individual's acts. We assess the
   significance of Simmel's formulation of the Law of the Individual in
   three steps: First, as an articulation of an ethical moment consonant
   with his relational approach to formal sociology, hinted at earlier in
   Sociology but not developed as such. Second, as a completion of the
   framework for Simmel's formal sociology: the Law of the Individual
   conceptualizes a decisive but under-theorized relationship in Simmel's
   vision of 'society' that is a woven fabric of social relationships,
   namely one's relationship with oneself. We follow with a third proposal
   about how Simmel might have continued the line of thought he opens in
   The View of Life, suggesting that we can take the Law of the Individual
   as an invitation to fold the self-relation back into analysis of social
   relations, and to theorize how forms of association are shaped by forms
   of self-relation. We thus narrow the theoretical gulf between Simmel's
   vitalism and his sociology, which commentators usually hold apart. And
   in so doing, we sketch a distinctively Simmelian approach to an ethics
   of individuality in sociological inquiry.

AB In large part, Max Weber's essay 'Church and sect in America' was
   intended as a contrast between European and American societies at the
   turn of the 20th century. This could be pushed so far as to say that in
   fact the essay was not about religions at all but rather about the
   relationship between an old-order class system and a new-order class
   system in which sectarian religion provided a conduit to validate
   worldly success (i.e. the Protestant ethic), which directly contrasted
   with the institutional 'style' of the established churches of Europe,
   into whose membership one was born and through whose structures (e.g.
   church schools, including the universities) one's social position was
   established. 'Church,' then, is in some respects a residual category for
   Weber, more of a background that would enable him to foreground what he
   saw as a new basis for ordering class/status within the new world. Over
   time, denominationalism in America hybridized churchly and sectarian
   elements to create a new socio-religious dynamic by which a central core
   of 'nonsectarian' religious affirmations created a variant mode of
   religious participation in which multiple religious options served
   functions historically associated with national churches in Europe.
   Postmodern globalization, however, has created new opportunities and
   challenges as institutionalized religions reach beyond historic
   geopolitical borders.

   and the prevalence of overweight was 17.6. In multivariate models, the
   odds of being obese as compared with normal weight were higher for boys
   versus girls (odds ratio (OR) 1.39, 95 confidence interval (CI): 1.36,

AB Social networks are typically seen as conduits for the spread of disease
   and disease risk factors. However, social relationships also reduce the
   incidence of chronic disease and potentially infectious diseases. Seldom
   are these opposing effects considered simultaneously. We have shown how
   and why diarrheal disease spreads more slowly to and in rural Ecuadorian
   villages that are more remote from the area's population center. Reduced
   contact with outside individuals partially accounts for remote villages'
   relatively lower prevalence of diarrheal disease. But equally or more
   important is the greater density of social ties between individuals in
   remote communities, which facilitates the spread of individual and
   collective practices that reduce the transmission of diarrheal disease.

   These results were only partially mediated by peer substance use.
   Conclusions: Social network influences may extend beyond the homogeneous
   dimensions of own peer or own parent to include extradyadic influences
   of the wider network. The value of parenting interventions should be
   reassessed to take into account these spillover effects in the greater
   network.

TI Paternal age at birth is associated with offspring leukocyte telomere
   length in the nurses' health study

AB Is the association between paternal age at birth and offspring leukocyte
   telomere length (LTL) an artifact of early life socioeconomic status
   (SES)?
   Indicators of early life SES did not alter the relationship between
   paternal age at birth and offspring LTL among a population of white
   female nurses.
   Telomere length is considered a highly heritable trait. Recent studies
   report a positive correlation between paternal age at birth and
   offspring LTL. Maternal age at birth has also been positively associated
   with offspring LTL, but may stem from the strong correlation with
   paternal age at birth.
   The Nurses Health Study (NHS) is an ongoing prospective cohort study of
   121 700 female registered nurses who were enrolled in 1976. Great effort
   goes into maintaining a high degree of follow-up among our cohort
   participants (95 of potential person-years). In 19891990, a subset of 32
   826 women provided blood samples from which we selected participants for
   several nested casecontrol studies of telomere length and incident
   chronic disease. We used existing LTL data on a total of 4250
   disease-free women who also reported maternal and paternal age at birth
   for this study.
   Nested casecontrol studies of stroke, myocardial infarction, cancers of
   the breast, endometrium, skin, pancreas and colon, as well as colon
   adenoma, were conducted within the blood sub-cohort. Each study used the
   following study design: for each case of a disease diagnosed after blood
   collection, a risk-set sampling scheme was used to select from one to
   three controls from the remaining participants in the blood sub-cohort
   who were free of that disease when the case was diagnosed. Controls were
   matched to cases by age at blood collection (1 year), date of blood
   collection (3 months), menopausal status, recent postmenopausal hormone
   use at blood collection (within 3 months, except for the myocardial
   infarction casecontrol study), as well as other factors carefully chosen
   for each individual study. The current analysis was limited to healthy
   controls. We also included existing LTL data from a small random sample
   of women participating in a cognitive sub-study. LTL was measured using
   the quantitative PCR-based method. Exposure and covariate information
   are extracted from biennial questionnaires completed by the
   participants.
   We found a strong association between paternal age at birth and
   participant LTL (P 1.6 10(5)) that remained robust after controlling for
   indicators of early life SES. Maternal age at birth showed a weak
   inverse association with participant LTL after adjusting for age at
   blood collection and paternal age at birth (P 0.01). We also noted a
   stronger association between paternal age at birth and participant LTL
   among premenopausal than among postmenopausal women (P-interaction
   0.045). However, this observation may be due to chance as premenopausal
   women represented only 12.6 (N 535) of the study population and LTL was
   not correlated with age at menopause, total or estrogen-only hormone
   therapy (HT) use suggesting that changes in in vivo estrogen exposure do
   not influence telomere length regulation.
   The women in our study are not representative of the general US female
   population, with an underrepresentation of non-white and low social
   class groups. Although the interaction was not significant, we noted
   that the paternal age at birth association with offspring LTL appeared
   weaker among women whose parents did not own their home at the time of
   the participants birth. As telomere dynamics may differ among
   individuals who are most socioeconomically deprived, SES indicators may
   have more of an influence on the relationship between paternal age at
   birth and offspring LTL in such populations.
   As of yet, our and prior studies have not identified childhood or adult
   characteristics that confound the paternal age at birth association with
   offspring LTL, supporting the hypothesis that offspring may inherit the
   longer telomeres found in sperm of older men. The biological
   implications of the paternal age effect are unknown. A recent theory
   proposed that the inheritance of longer telomere from older men may be
   an adaptive signal of reproductive lifespan, while another theory links
   telomere length attrition to female reproductive senescence. However, we
   are unaware of any data to substantiate a relationship between paternal
   age at birth and daughters fertility. Generalizability of our study
   results to other white female populations is supported by prior reports
   of paternal age at birth and offspring telomere length. Furthermore, a
   confounding relationship between paternal or maternal age at birth and
   SES was not observed in a study of SES and telomere length.

AB Historians typically describe the 3000 World War II conscientious
   objectors who served in American psychiatric hospitals and training
   schools in the Civilian Public Service (CPS) as "people of conscience.''
   This phrase captures the diverse motivations of the conscientious
   objectors but neglects the differences among these motivations. Members
   of several communities served in the CPS, but half of all volunteers in
   mental health facilities were Mennonites. After the war, only Mennonite
   CPS veterans engaged their own community in a discussion about their
   responsibilities to people with mental illness, which led directly to
   the foundation of eight mental health facilities, seven of which
   continue to serve people with mental illness. In this review of
   materials published by Mennonites, we explore the difference that
   Mennonite religious ideology, especially the ideas of discipleship and
   nonresistance, made in their response to people with mental illness.
   Understanding these differences is critical for any attempts to
   replicate their success in engendering community care, in which direct
   conversation and encounter are critical.

AB Background and Purpose-Minorities in the United States have less access
   to healthcare system resources, especially preventative treatments. We
   sought to determine whether racial and sex disparities existed in the
   treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms.
   Methods-Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, hospitalizations for
   clipping and coiling of intracranial aneurysms from 2001 to 2009 were
   identified by cross-matching International Classification of Diseases,
   9th Revision codes for diagnosis of unruptured aneurysm and subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (SAH) with procedure codes for clipping or coiling of
   cerebral aneurysms. Demographic information analyzed included age (<50,
   50-64, 65-79, and >= 80 years), race (white, black, Hispanic,
   Asian/Pacific Islander), sex, income quartile, primary payer (Medicare,
   Medicaid, private insurance, self-pay, no charge, other), and Charlson
   comorbidity index.
   Results-When compared with patients treated for SAH, those treated for
   unruptured intracranial aneurysm were significantly more likely to be
   women (75.0% versus 69.0%; P<0.0001). In all, 9.7% of patients receiving
   treatment for SAH were self-payers versus 3.0% of patients being treated
   for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (P<0.0001). In all, 62.2% of
   patients receiving treatment for SAH were white compared with 76.4% of
   patients being treated for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (P<0.0001).
   There was a higher proportion of black, Hispanic, and Asian patients in
   the SAH treatment group when compared with the unruptured aneurysm
   treatment group (P<0.0001 for all groups).
   Conclusions-When compared with patients undergoing treatment for SAH,
   patients undergoing surgical and endovascular treatment for unruptured
   intracranial aneurysm are generally from higher socioeconomic strata and
   are more likely to be insured, women, and white. Future studies are
   needed to determine the underlying causes and solutions for this
   disparity. (Stroke. 2012; 43: 3200-3206.)

AB The religious economies model has been influential in the sociology of
   religion. Yet, propositions drawn from the model have been difficult to
   test in the comparative and historical study of religion, generally for
   lack of appropriate data. We develop a general theory of religious
   disestablishment and apply it to the Reformation in 16th-century Europe
   to explain variation in the abolition of the Catholic monopoly. We
   suggest three principal factorschanges in demand, entry control
   mechanisms, and political incentivesthat explain why incumbent religious
   firms may lose their monopoly. We then analyze the resulting hypotheses
   in a systematic analysis of cities in the Holy Roman Empire. Our
   analysis yields mixed support for demand-side factors and entry control
   mechanisms, and firm support for political incentives in the institution
   of reform.

AB Aims This study assesses how race/ethnicity and socio-economic status
   modify the relationship between exposure to movie smoking and having
   tried smoking in adolescents. Design Data come from a cross-sectional
   telephone survey and were analyzed using logistic regression models. A
   respondent reporting ever having tried smoking was regressed on exposure
   to movie smoking, race, socio-economic status, the interactions of these
   variables and family and background characteristics. Setting National
   sample of US adolescents. Participants A total of 3653 respondents aged
   1318 years. Measurements Outcome was if subjects reported ever having
   tried smoking. Movie smoking exposure was assessed through respondents'
   reporting having watched a set of movie titles, which were coded for
   smoking instances. Findings The proportion having tried smoking was
   lower for blacks (32%) compared to Hispanics (41%) and whites (38%). The
   relationship between movie smoking and having tried smoking varied by
   race/ethnicity. Among whites and Hispanics exposure to movie smoking
   positively predicted smoking behavior, but movie smoking had no impact
   on blacks. Socio-economic status further modified the relation among
   whites; high socio-economic status white adolescents were more
   susceptible to movie smoking than low socio-economic status white
   adolescents. Conclusions Exposure to movie smoking is not experienced
   uniformly as a risk factor for having ever tried smoking among US
   adolescents. Whites and Hispanics are more likely to try smoking as a
   function of increased exposure to movie smoking. In addition, higher
   socio-economic status increases susceptibility to movie smoking among
   whites. Youth with fewer risk factors may be more influenced by media
   messages on smoking.

AB Background: Building upon previous work describing declining rates and
   socioeconomic disparities in sexual and reproductive health (SRH)
   service use among young women in the United States, we reexamined
   patterns and determinants of SRH service use in 2006-2010.
   Study Design: We used the latest data from the National Survey of Family
   Growth to evaluate SRH service use including contraceptive, sexually
   transmitted infection (STI) and other gynecological exam services among
   3780 women ages 15-24 years. We compared proportions of service use
   across survey years and employed multiple logistic regression to
   estimate the influence of time and women's sociodemographic
   characteristics on the likelihood of SRH service use.
   Results: The proportion of women using SRH services increased from 50%
   (2006-2007) to 54% (2007-2008) and 57% (2008-2010) [all year odds ratios
   (ORs) 1.4, p values<.03]. Among sexually experienced women, the
   proportions using SRH and contraceptive services were unchanged, while
   STI service use increased from 22% (2006-2007) to 33% (2008-2009) (OR
   1.7, confidence interval 1.1-2.4, p=.009). Differentials in service use
   existed across sociodemographic groups, largely with lower proportions
   of service use among women of social disadvantage.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest a reversal of negative trends but
   continuing social disparities in young women's use of SRH services in
   the United States. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   cohort study. We restricted analyses to 539 mother-infant pairs; 294
   were Black, 127 Hispanic, 110 Asian and 8 from additional racial/ethnic
   groups. During pregnancy, mothers completed the Experiences of
   Discrimination survey that measured lifetime experiences of racial
   discrimination in diverse domains. We categorized responses as 0, 1-2 or
   >= 3 domains. Main outcomes were birth weight for gestational age
   z-score; weight for age (WFA) z-score at 6 months of age; and at 3 years
   of age, body mass index (BMI) z-score. In multivariable analyses, we
   adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity, nativity, education, age,
   pre-pregnancy BMI, household income and child sex and age. Among this
   cohort of mostly (58.2%) US-born and economically non-impoverished
   mothers, 33% reported 0 domains of discrimination, 33% reported
   discrimination in 1-2 domains and 35% reported discrimination in >= 3
   domains. Compared with children whose mothers reported no
   discrimination, those whose mothers reported >= 3 domains had lower
   birth weight for gestational age z-score (beta -0.25; 95% CI: -0.45,
   -0.04), lower 6 month WFA z-score (beta -0.34; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.03) and
   lower 3-year BMI z-score (beta -0.33; 95% CI: -0.66, 0.00). In
   conclusion, we found that among this cohort of US racial/ethnic minority
   women, mothers' report of experiencing lifetime discrimination in >= 3
   domains was associated with lower fetal growth, weight at 6 months and
   3-year BMI among their offspring.

   Study design We analyzed data from the 2007 National Survey of
   Children's Health for 40 752-41 988 children. The effects of dental
   problems and maternal-rated dental health on school performance and
   psychosocial wellbeing outcomes were evaluated using regression models
   adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and health characteristics.
   Results Dental problems were significantly associated with reductions in
   school performance and psychosocial well-being. Children with dental
   problems were more likely to have problems at school (OR = 1.52; 95% CI:
   1.37-1.72) and to miss school (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 1.23-1.64) and were
   less likely to do all required homework (OR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.68-0.85).
   Dental problems were associated with shyness, unhappiness, feeling of
   worthlessness, and reduced friendliness. The effects of dental problems
   on unhappiness and feeling of worthlessness were largest for adolescents
   between 15 and 17 years.
   Conclusion Preventing and treating dental problems and improving dental
   health may benefit child academic achievement and cognitive and
   psychosocial development. (J Pediatr 2012;161:1153-9).

   The aim of this study was to examine whether dyadic adjustment and
   network support moderate the association between blame and distress in
   couples affected by lung cancer.
   Patients and their spouses completed questionnaires within 1 month of
   treatment initiation (baseline) and at 6-month follow-up.
   Multilevel modeling of data from 158 couples revealed that, at baseline,
   dyadic adjustment moderated the association between blame and distress
   for patients but not spouses (p < 0.05). Controlling for baseline
   distress, baseline blame predicted later distress (p < 0.05) for both
   patients and spouses regardless of dyadic adjustment. Network support
   moderated this association at follow-up.
   For patients experiencing low dyadic adjustment, blame was associated
   with increased distress. Not initially but later, network support may
   protect against low levels but not high levels of blame in patients and
   spouses.

   and (3) leisure-walking. Conceptually matched built environment
   variables were analyzed for domain-specific outcomes.
   With leisure walking as the outcome, built environment x psychosocial
   interactions were significant in 7 of 20 models tested. Directions of
   interactions were consistent, indicating a stronger built
   environment-leisure walking association in adults with less favorable
   psychosocial status. Little evidence supported such interactions with
   objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity or transport
   walking as outcomes.
   The results imply that the built environment may exert stronger

   This study investigated socioeconomic status (SES) as a predictor of BP

   separately for higher and lower acculturated women.
   Mexican-American women (N = 291; 40-65 years) reported demographics and
   completed psychosocial assessments and 36-h ambulatory BP monitoring.
   Lower SES related to reduced BP dipping in the overall sample and in
   more US-acculturated women (r's = .17-.30, p's < .05), but not in
   less-acculturated women (r's = .07, p's > .10). An indirect effect model
   from SES to BP dipping via psychosocial resources/risk fits well across

   In Mexican-American women, the nature of SES gradients in BP dipping and

   wildfire events. Wildfire education efforts encourage homeowners to
   manage their property to decrease wildfire risk. Such programs may be
   more effective with a better understanding of the factors related to
   homeowners' decisions to undertake wildfire risk-reduction actions. In
   this study, we measured whether homeowners had implemented 12 wildfire
   risk-mitigation measures in 2 Colorado Front Range counties. We found
   that wildfire information received from local volunteer fire departments
   and county wildfire specialists, as well as talking with neighbors about
   wildfire, were positively associated with higher levels of mitigation.
   Firsthand experience in the form of preparing for or undertaking an
   evacuation was also associated with a higher level of mitigation.
   Finally, homeowners who perceived higher levels of wildfire risk on
   their property had undertaken higher levels of wildfire-risk mitigation
   on their property.

AB Weber argued that human suffering creates the demand for theodicies:
   cultural vocabularies, religious or secular, that explain perceived
   injustices. This article combines an interpretive analysis of rhetoric
   commemorating the events of September 11, 2001 with an effort to
   construct generalizable cultural theory, demonstrating how the Weberian
   concept of theodicy adds to our understanding of commemorative rhetoric.
   In the case of September 11 commemorations, the theodicies deployed
   exhibit a clear fracture. Speakers at the Pentagon and in Shanksville,
   Pennsylvania, have taken a dualistic approach to the problem of
   theodicy, while speakers in Manhattan have taken a tragic approach. This
   variation can be explained through a four-part model that argues
   theodicies are structured by (1) events, (2) carrier groups, (3)
   audiences, and (4) genre memory. More broadly, I argue for explicit
   attention to theodicy in cultural sociology, demonstrating that the
   quest for theodicy is a crucial driving force behind the impulse to
   commemorate in the first place.

AB Urban sociology has tended to study interactions between passersby and
   street persons with an emphasis on the ways street persons become
   bothersome, harassing, or dangerous. This article moves away from the
   focus on the ways interactions in public go awry and focuses on how
   individuals account for the mundane, everyday exchanges they have with
   strangers who seek their help. Based on interview data (N = 31) and
   qualitative analysis of data from an Internet survey (N = 110), this
   article suggests that the presence of beggars does not inherently
   symbolize urban decay to passersby and does not necessarily elicit
   anxiety, but instead provides a valuable texture of urban life. Further,
   the article argues that individuals, when justifying their responses to
   requests for help from needy persons (beggars) in urban spaces, use a
   variety of cultural strategies to maintain their perception of
   themselves as moral persons, both when they choose to help and when they
   refuse. Drawing from these findings, the article suggests that urban
   sociology and the sociology of risk would benefit from sensitizing their
   studies of public interactions to the diverse meanings individuals
   assign to them, rather than presupposing annoyance, anxiety, or fear as
   their predominant characteristic.

AB Democratic theorists and social scientists suggest that a deliberative
   public sphere would be good for democracy by maximizing emancipatory
   possibilities and providing broad legitimacy to political decision
   making. But do ordinary Americans actually want a deliberative public
   sphere? I examine this question in the context of four contentious
   religion and science debates. Through a multidimensional evaluation
   exercise with 62 ordinary respondents, I find that evaluation of public
   representatives in these debates tends to favor open-mindedness and
   ongoing debate. Further, respondents explicitly discount elected
   representatives who participate in public debate precisely because they
   are seen as violating deliberative norms through their affiliation with
   electoral politics. Respondents want a deliberative public sphere.
   However, this desire reflects an understanding of the public sphere and
   institutional politics as disconnected arenas with incompatible rules
   and objectives, raising multiple questions for democratic theory and for
   political sociology.

AB Much research has concluded that human rights treaties have a null or
   negative effect on governments human rights practices. This article
   reexamines the influence of human rights treaties, with a focus on two
   kinds of treaty effects: directthe effect of treaties on the countries
   that ratified them; and diffusethe effect of treaties on countries
   regardless of ratification. My analysis of two prominent human rights
   treaties finds that they often reduce levels of repression and abuse
   over time and independently of ratification. Some of these effects are
   nonlinear, reversing direction as time elapses or as more countries
   become party to the treaties. These findings are interpreted with
   reference to world polity institutionalism in sociology, and especially
   the Durkheimian strains of this approach. Human rights norms as embodied
   in treaties operate as a kind of civil religion for world society. These
   norms not only have long-term direct effects among countries that
   ritualistically ratify human rights treaties, but they also diffusely
   impact countries irrespective of formal endorsement.

AB Sociology once debated 'the social' and did so with a public readership.
   Even as late as the Second World War, sociologists commanded a wide
   public on questions about the nature of society, altruism and the
   direction of social evolution. As a result of several waves of
   professionalization, however, these issues have vanished from academic
   sociology and from the public writings of sociologists. From the 1960s
   onwards sociologists instead wrote for the public by supporting social
   movements. Discussion within sociology became constrained both by
   'professional' expectations and political taboos. Yet the original
   motivating concerns of sociology and its public, such as the
   compatibility of socialism and Darwinism, the nature of society, and the
   process of social evolution, did not cease to be of public interest.
   With sociologists showing little interest in satisfying the demand, it
   was met by non-sociologists, with the result that sociology lost both
   its intellectual public, as distinct from affinity groups, and its claim
   on these topics.

   recognizing the many achievements of professional sociology, I argue
   that the modern auditing frameworks by which the careers of academic
   sociologists are measured have had the effect of standardizing teaching
   and research in sociology to the point of marginalizing the discipline
   in many institutions. Such marginalization has occasionally encouraged
   creativity, but it has nonetheless left many sociology offerings in a
   fragile position. As part of my historical overview I challenge the
   stereotypical contrast between American empiricism and European

AB Unmasking is a recurrent feature of modern sociology and cultural
   criticism. While false consciousness is imputed by intellectuals to
   religious groups and to certain social classes, unmasking is, or claims
   to be, a corrective performed by intellectuals themselves. Unmasking
   supposes that enlightened enquirers are able to help the less rational
   to understand their real interests; a type of exposure, it offers a
   cognitive tool of emancipation. This article (a) examines unmasking; and
   (b) contrasts it with an approach to understanding that we call
   disclosure. Our claim is that disclosure is more attuned to the full
   keyboard of social action, and less demeaning of its players, than
   unmasking is. Disclosure attempts to grasp what actions are like for
   those who enact them. Nothing has been more often or consistently
   unmasked and with more venom than religion. It is the main example
   explored in this article.

AB Despite the existence of effective screening, colorectal cancer remains

   Identification of disparities in colorectal cancer screening will allow
   for targeted interventions to achieve national goals for screening. The
   objective of this study was to contrast colorectal cancer screening
   rates in urban and rural populations in the United States. The study
   design comprised a cross-sectional study in the United States 1998-2005.
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data from 1998 to 2005 were
   the method and data source. The primary outcome was self-report
   up-to-date colorectal cancer screening (fecal occult blood test in last
   12 months, flexible sigmoidoscopy in last 5 years, or colonoscopy in
   last 10 years). Geographic location (urban vs. rural) was used as
   independent variable. Multivariate analysis controlled for demographic
   and health characteristics of respondents. After adjustment for
   demographic and health characteristics, rural residents had lower
   colorectal cancer screening rates (48%; 95% CI 48, 49%) as compared with
   urban residents (54%, 95% CI 53, 55%). Remote rural residents had the
   lowest screening rates overall (45%, 95% CI 43, 46%). From 1998 to 2005,
   rates of screening by colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy increased in
   both urban and rural populations. During the same time, rates of
   screening by fecal occult blood test decreased in urban populations and
   increased in rural populations. Persistent disparities in colorectal
   cancer screening affect rural populations. The types of screening tests
   used for colorectal cancer screening are different in rural and urban
   areas. Future research to reduce this disparity should focus on
   screening methods that are acceptable and feasible in rural areas.

AB Recently, scholars have analyzed phenomena like punk, hip-hop, and rave
   as "scenes," networks of individuals who converge in local, translocal,
   and virtual spaces. While researchers conceptualize scenes as
   collectively produced entities, they have not closely explored the
   micro-processes by which they develop, as well as how those processes
   affect participants. In this article, I ask how members "do scene" by
   coming together to construct these settings. Drawing on ethnographic
   research on a punk scene in a small college town, I argue that members
   produce a scene through the establishment, transformation, and
   management of scene space. The construction of space in turn shaped the
   identities of participants, including differing levels of power among
   them. This case further underscores the interactional and
   context-specific groundings of scenes, scene space, and the identities
   of participants.

AB The debate concerning whether to legalize and regulate the global market
   in human organs is hindered by a lack of adequate bioethical language.
   The author argues that the preferential option for the poor, a
   theological category, can provide the grounding for an inductive moral
   epistemology adequate for reforming the use of culturally Western
   bioethical language. He proposes that the traditional, Western concept
   of bioethical coercion ought to be modified and expanded because the
   conditions of the market system, as viewed from the perspective of organ
   vendors systemically deprived of access to sufficient resources, are
   sufficiently exploitative as to diminish the possibility of these
   vendors giving informed consent. Moreover, empirical studies conducted
   by professionals in medicine, sociology, psychiatry, economics, and
   medical anthropology continue to contribute support to the growing
   interdisciplinary consensus that functionally coercive structural
   factors exert the most significant influence upon a vendor's decision to
   sell an organ within any market, regardless of legality or degree of
   regulation. Therefore any proposal to legalize and regulate the organ
   market remains patently unethical because doing so would likely function
   to constrain further the agency of poor potential vendors.

   the latter who has achieved world recognition. At the time of their
   assassination Moscone was the more well-known figure, an American
   politician with a national reputation. The theories of social drama and
   cultural trauma are applied in this explanatory process. These theories
   provide a framework for analyzing how this incident became a significant
   event locally and nationally. The fact that Milk was one of the first
   openly gay people to hold public office in the United States meant that
   his life and death would have significance for a wide group of people.
   Individuals and organizations associated with gay liberation became

AB Despite increasing awareness of the ways in which non-epistemic values
   play roles in science, many scientists remain reluctant to acknowledge
   values at stake in their own work. Even when research clearly relates to
   risk assessment and establishing public policy, contexts in which the
   presence of values is less likely to be contentious, scientists tend to
   present such research as merely involving empirical questions about what
   the evidence is. As a result, debates over policy-related science tend
   to be framed as purely epistemic debates over the state of the evidence.
   We argue that this neglects the important ways that ethical and social
   values play legitimate roles in judgments about what we take to be
   evidence for a particular policy. Using the case of recent disputes
   about the relative safety of home birth, we argue that although the
   debate has been framed as a purely scientific one about the empirical
   evidence for home birth, it actually involves disagreements about
   underlying value assumptions. If our claims are correct, then in order
   to move the debate forward, scientists will need to engage in a critical
   discussion about the values at stake.

   Participants were assessed in community-based dental clinics and
   evaluated by trained clinicians using physical and psychosocial
   measures. A total of 207 subjects were evaluated. Patients' high-risk
   versus low-risk status for potentially developing chronic TMD was also
   determined. Analyses of variance and chi-square analyses were applied to
   these data. Results: Participants' characteristic pain intensity
   differed among RDC/TMD Axis I diagnoses. They also significantly varied
   in their self-reported graded chronic pain, depression, somatization
   (pain inclusive), somatization (pain excluded), and physical well-being.
   In addition, participants with differing RDC/TMD Axis I diagnoses varied
   in self-reported pain during their chewing performance. Finally, there
   were also significant differences in chewing performance between
   high-risk versus low-risk (for developing chronic TMD) patients.
   Conclusion: Participants with multiple diagnoses reported higher pain,
   as well as other symptoms, relative to participants without a TMD
   diagnosis. For chewing performance, participants with mutual diagnoses
   reported more pain compared to other participants. Finally, the
   risk-status of patients significantly affected chewing performance.

AB Recently admixed populations offer unique opportunities for studying
   human history and for elucidating the genetic basis of complex traits
   that differ in prevalence between human populations. Historical records,
   classical protein markers, and preliminary genetic data indicate that
   the Cape Verde islands in West Africa are highly admixed and primarily
   descended from European males and African females. However, little is
   known about the variation in admixture levels, admixture dynamics and
   genetic diversity across the islands, or about the potential of Cape
   Verde for admixture mapping studies. We have performed a detailed
   analysis of phenotypic and genetic variation in Cape Verde based on
   objective skin color measurements, socio-economic status (SES)
   evaluations and data for 50 autosomal, 34 X-chromosome, and 21
   nonrecombinant Y-chromosome (NRY) markers in 845 individuals from six
   islands of the archipelago. We find extensive genetic admixture between
   European and African ancestral populations (mean West African ancestry =
   0.57, sd = 0.08), with individual African ancestry proportions varying
   considerably among the islands. African ancestry proportions calculated
   with X and Y-chromosome markers confirm that the pattern of admixture
   has been sex-biased. The high-resolution NRY-STRs reveal additional
   patterns of variation among the islands that are most consistent with
   differentiation after admixture. The differences in the autosomal
   admixture proportions are clearly evident in the skin color distribution
   across the islands (Pearson r = 0.54, P-value<2e-16). Despite this
   strong correlation, there are significant interactions between SES and
   skin color that are independent of the relationship between skin color
   and genetic ancestry. The observed distributions of admixture, genetic
   variation and skin color and the relationship of skin color with SES
   relate to historical and social events taking place during the
   settlement history of Cape Verde, and have implications for the design
   of association studies using this population.

AB Background: The unmet needs for health care have been used as an
   alternative measurement to monitor equity in health services. We sought
   to examine contextual influences on unmet needs for health care whereas
   precedent studies have been focused on individual characteristics on
   them.
   Methods and Findings: The current study conducted multilevel logistic
   regression analysis to assess the effects of individual-and
   contextual-level predictors in meeting individual health care needs in
   South Korea. We sampled 7,200 individuals over the age of 19 in the
   Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2009.
   Included in the regression model were individual predictors such as
   demographic variables, socio-economic status, and self-rated health; the
   density of beds and physicians in public and private sectors within
   different regions were used as contextual-level predictors. This study
   showed the inverse association between unmet needs and regional
   resources in private sectors after controlling for the effects of
   individual-level predictors.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that increasing regional resources in
   private sectors might produce inefficiency in the health care system and
   inequity in access to health services, particularly where the
   competition in private health care sectors was highly stimulated under
   the fee-for-service reimbursement scheme. Policies for the reallocation
   of health care resources and for reduction of individual health care
   costs are needed in Korea.

AB We identify robust statistical patterns in the frequency and severity of
   violent attacks by terrorist organizations as they grow and age. Using
   group-level static and dynamic analyses of terrorist events worldwide
   from 1968-2008 and a simulation model of organizational dynamics, we
   show that the production of violent events tends to accelerate with
   increasing size and experience. This coupling of frequency, experience
   and size arises from a fundamental positive feedback loop in which
   attacks lead to growth which leads to increased production of new
   attacks. In contrast, event severity is independent of both size and
   experience. Thus larger, more experienced organizations are more deadly
   because they attack more frequently, not because their attacks are more
   deadly, and large events are equally likely to come from large and small

AB Discussions about the underrepresentation of women in science are
   challenged by uncertainty over the relative effects of the lack of
   assertiveness by women and the lack of recognition of them by male
   colleagues because the two are often indistinguishable. They can be
   distinguished at professional meetings, however, by comparing symposia,
   which are largely by invitation, and posters and other talks, which are
   largely participant-initiated. Analysis of 21 annual meetings of the
   American Association of Physical Anthropologists reveals that within the
   subfield of primatology, women give more posters than talks, whereas men
   give more talks than posters. But most strikingly, among symposia the
   proportion of female participants differs dramatically by the gender of
   the organizer. Male-organized symposia have half the number of female
   first authors (29%) that symposia organized by women (64%) or by both
   men and women (58%) have, and half that of female participation in talks
   and posters (65%). We found a similar gender bias from men in symposia
   from the past 12 annual meetings of the American Society of
   Primatologists. The bias is surprising given that women are the
   numerical majority in primatology and have achieved substantial peer
   recognition in this discipline.

AB Background: Income disparities in mortality are profound in the United
   States, but reasons for this remain largely unexplained. The objective
   of this study was to assess the effects of health behaviors, and other
   mediating pathways, separately and simultaneously, including health
   insurance, health status, and inflammation, in the association between
   income and mortality.
   Methods: This study used data from 9925 individuals aged 20 years or
   older who participated in the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (NHANES) and were followed up through December 31,
   2006 for mortality. The outcome measures were all-cause and CVD/diabetes
   mortality. During follow-up 505 persons died, including 196 deaths due
   to CVD or diabetes.
   Results: After adjusting for age, sex, education, and race/ethnicity,
   risk of death was higher in low-income than high-income group for both
   all-cause mortality (Hazard ratio [HR], 1.98; 95% confidence interval
   [CI]: 1.37, 2.85) and cardiovascular disease (CVD)/diabetes mortality
   (HR, 3.68; 95% CI: 1.64, 8.27). The combination of the four pathways
   attenuated 58% of the association between income and all-cause mortality
   and 35% of that of CVD/diabetes mortality. Health behaviors attenuated
   the risk of all-cause and CVD/diabetes mortality by 30% and 21%,
   respectively, in the low-income group. Health status attenuated 39% of
   all-cause mortality and 18% of CVD/diabetes mortality, whereas, health
   insurance and inflammation accounted for only a small portion of the
   income-associated mortality (<= 6%).
   Conclusion: Excess mortality associated with lower income can be largely
   accounted for by poor health status and unhealthy behaviors. Future
   studies should address behavioral modification, as well as possible
   strategies to improve health status in low-income people.

AB Background: Although poverty is widely recognized as an important risk
   factor for tuberculosis (TB) disease, the specific proximal risk factors
   that mediate this association are less clear. The objective of our study
   was to investigate the mechanisms by which poverty increases the risk of
   TB.
   Methods: Using individual level data from 198,754 people from the 2006
   Demographic Health Survey (DHS) for India, we assessed self-reported TB
   status, TB determinants and household socioeconomic status. We used
   these data to calculate the population attributable fractions (PAF) for
   each key TB risk factor based on the prevalence of determinants and
   estimates of the effect of these risk factors derived from published
   sources. We conducted a mediation analysis using principal components
   analysis (PCA) and regression to demonstrate how the association between
   poverty and TB prevalence is mediated.
   Results: The prevalence of self-reported TB in the 2006 DHS for India
   was 545 per 100,000 and ranged from 201 in the highest quintile to 1100
   in the lowest quintile. Among those in the poorest population, the PAFs
   for low body mass index (BMI) and indoor air pollution were 34.2% and
   28.5% respectively.
   Conclusion: TB control strategies should be targeted to the poorest
   populations that are most at risk, and should address the most important
   determinants of disease-specifically low BMI and indoor air pollution.

AB Rationale: Although previous studies suggest that access to care for
   patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) does not vary appreciably by
   socioeconomic status (SES), disparities with respect to access to lung
   transplantation for patients with CF are largely unknown.
   Objectives: To determine whether access to lung transplantation for
   patients with CF differs according to SES.
   Methods: Observational study involving 2,167 adult patients with CF from
   the CF Foundation Patient registry who underwent their first lung
   transplant evaluation between 2001 and 2009. The primary outcome was
   acceptance for lung transplant after initial evaluation. The main SES
   indicator was Medicaid status. Alternate SES indicators included race,
   educational attainment, ZIP code-level median household income, and
   driving time from residence to closest lung transplant center.
   Measurements and Main Results: The odds that Medicaid recipients were
   not accepted for lung transplant were 1.56-fold higher (95% confidence
   interval [CI], 1.27-1.92) than patients without Medicaid, after
   multivariate adjustment for demographic characteristics, disease
   severity, and potential contraindications to lung transplant, and before
   or after use of the lung allocation score. This association was
   independent of other SES indicators, including race, educational
   attainment, ZIP code-level median household income, and driving time to
   closest transplant center (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.10-1.72).
   Patients not completing high school (OR = 2.37; 95% CI, 1.49-3.79) and
   those residing in the lowest (vs. highest) ZIP code median household
   income category (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.01-1.93) also experienced a higher
   odds of not being accepted for lung transplant in multivariate analysis.
   Conclusions: In this nationally representative study of adult patients
   with CF, multiple indicators of low SES were associated with higher odds
   of not being accepted for lung transplant.

AB Background: Breast and Cervical cancer are the two most common cancers
   among women in developing countries. Regular screening is the most
   effective way of ensuring that these cancers are detected at early
   stages; however few studies have assessed factors that predict cancer
   screening in developing countries.
   Purpose: To assess the influence of household socio-economic status
   (SES), healthcare access and country level characteristics on breast and
   cervical cancer screening among women in developing countries.
   Methods: Women ages 18-69 years (cervical cancer screening) and 40-69
   years (breast cancer screening) from 15 developing countries who
   participated in the 2003 World Health Survey provided data for this
   study. Household SES and healthcare access was assessed based on
   self-reported survey responses. SAS survey procedures (SAS, Version 9.2)
   were used to assess determinants of breast and cervical cancer screening
   in separate models.
   Results: 4.1% of women ages 18-69 years had received cervical cancer
   screening in the past three years, while only 2.2% of women ages 40-69
   years had received breast cancer screening in the past 5 years in
   developing countries. Cancer screening rates varied by country; cervical
   cancer screening ranged from 1.1% in Bangladesh to 57.6% in Congo and
   breast cancer screening ranged from 0% in Mali to 26% in Congo.
   Significant determinants of cancer screening were household SES, rural
   residence, country health expenditure (as a percent of GDP) as well as
   healthcare access.
   Discussion: A lot more needs to be done to improve screening rates for
   breast and cervical cancer in developing countries, such as increasing
   health expenditure (especially in rural areas), applying the increased
   funds towards the provision of more, better educated health providers as
   well as improved infrastructure.

PD NOV 13 2012
PY 2012
AB Biologists have devoted much attention to assortative mating or
   homogamy, the tendency for sexual species tomate with similar others. In
   contrast, there has been little theoretical work on the broader
   phenomenon of homophily, the tendency for individuals to interact with
   similar others. Yet this behaviour is also widely observed in nature.
   Here, we model how natural selection can give rise to homophily when
   individuals engage in social interaction in a population with multiple
   observable phenotypes. Payoffs to interactions depend on whether or not
   individuals have the same or different phenotypes, and each individual
   has a preference that determines how likely they are to interact with
   others of their own phenotype (homophily) or of opposite phenotypes
   (heterophily). The results show that homophily tends to evolve under a
   wide variety of conditions, helping to explain its ubiquity in nature.

AB Background: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) aims to
   alleviate hunger among its beneficiaries by providing benefits to
   purchase nutritious foods.
   Objective: We conducted a comprehensive dietary analysis of low-income
   adults and examined differences in dietary intake between SNAP
   participants and nonparticipants.
   Design: The study population comprised 3835 nonelderly adults with a
   household income <= 130% of the federal poverty level from the 1999-2008
   NHANES. The National Cancer Institute method was used to estimate the
   distributions of usual intake for dietary outcomes. Relative differences
   in dietary intake by SNAP participation were estimated with adjustment
   for sociodemographic characteristics and household food security.
   Results: Few low-income adults consumed recommended amounts of whole
   grains, fruit, vegetables, fish, and nuts/seeds/legumes. Conversely,
   many low-income adults exceeded recommended limits for processed meats,
   sweets, and bakery desserts and sugar-sweetened beverages. Approximately
   13-22% of low-income adults did not meet any food and nutrient
   guidelines; virtually no adults met all of the guidelines. Compared with
   nonparticipants, SNAP participants consumed 39% fewer whole grains (95%
   CI: -57%, -15%), 44% more 100% fruit juice (95% CI: 0%, 107%), 56% more
   potatoes (95% CI: 18%, 106%), 46% more red meat (95% CI: 4%, 106%), and,
   in women, 61% more sugar-sweetened beverages (95% CI: 3%, 152%). SNAP
   participants also had lower dietary quality scores than did
   nonparticipants, as measured by a modified Alternate Healthy Eating
   Index.
   Conclusion: Although the diets of all low-income adults need major
   improvement, SNAP participants in particular had lower-quality diets
   than did income-eligible nonparticipants. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96:977-88.

AB Molefi Kete Asante is one of the most important scholars in the field of
   communication studies in the late twentieth century. His general
   interests range from intercultural communication, rhetoric, media and
   public communication to Africana studies. He has taught at several
   universities, led several organizations and is recognized as a leader
   within the communication discipline and in the broader national and
   global society; especially within Africa and the African diaspora.
   Asante is credited with the development and eventual emergence of what
   is referred to as the Afrocentric Idea, a theoretical perspective
   focusing on the agency of African peoples. Asante's groundbreaking work
   in the 1970s and 1980s would foreshadow and frame many of the debates of
   not only communication studies, but in the fields of education,
   sociology, literary, and cultural studies, as well as history from the
   1990s and early twenty first century. The current article focuses on
   Asante's important contributions to intercultural communication in the
   areas of rhetoric, media and public communication, Africana Studies, and
   intercultural/interracial communication. Asante's emergence corresponded
   with the American multiracial struggle against domestic racism and
   segregation; and the international fight against imperialism and
   advanced stages of colonialism. Many of Asante's ideas reflect the
   spirit of the 1955 Bandung conference that helped launch intellectual
   and political opposition to oppression by people of color. (C) 2012

AB Objectives. I systematically examined income gradients in health in the
   United States and England across the life span (ages birth to 80 years),
   separately for females and males, for a number of health conditions.
   Methods. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey for the United States (n = 36 360) and the Health Survey for
   England (n = 55783), I calculated weighted prevalence rates and risk
   ratios by income level for the following health risk factors or
   conditions: obesity, hypertension, diabetes, low high-density
   lipoprotein cholesterol, high cholesterol ratio, heart attack or angina,
   stroke, and asthma.
   Results. In the United States and England, the income gradients in
   health are very similar across age, gender, and numerous health
   conditions, and are robust to adjustments for race/ethnicity, health
   behaviors, body mass index, and health insurance.
   Conclusions. Health disparities by income are pervasive in England as
   well as in the United States, despite better overall health, universal
   health insurance, and more generous social protection spending in
   England. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:2049-2056.

AB Objectives. We investigated early childhood disparities in high body

   Methods. We compared differences in Black and White children's
   prevalence of sociodemographic, prenatal, perinatal, and early life risk
   and protective factors; fit logistic regression models predicting high
   BMI (>= 95th percentile) at age 4 to 5 years to 2 nationally
   representative samples followed from birth; and performed separate and
   pooled-survey estimations of these models.
   Results. After adjustment for sample design related variables, models
   predicting high BMI in the 2 samples were statistically
   indistinguishable. In the pooled-survey models, Black children's odds of
   high BMI were 59% higher than White children's (odds ratio [OR] = 1.59;
   95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.32, 1.92). Sociodemographic predictors
   reduced the racial disparity to 46% (OR = 1.46; 95% CI = 1.17, 1.81).
   Prenatal, perinatal, and early life predictors reduced the disparity to
   nonsignificance (OR = 1.18; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.49). Maternal prepregnancy
   obesity and short-duration or no breastfeeding were among predictors for
   which racial differences in children's exposures most disadvantaged
   Black children.
   Conclusions. Racial disparities in early childhood high BMI were largely
   explained by potentially modifiable risk and protective factors. (Am J

AB Objectives. We examined the association between discrimination and
   mental health distress, focusing specifically on the relative importance
   of discrimination because of particular demographic domains (i.e.,
   race/ethnicity, socioeconomic position [SEP]).
   Methods. The research team surveyed a sample of gay and bisexual men
   (n=294) at a community event in New York City. Participants completed a
   survey on demographics, discrimination experiences in the past 12
   months, attributed domains of discrimination, and mental health
   distress.
   Results. In adjusted models, discrimination was associated with higher
   depressive (B=0.31; P<.01) and anxious (B=0.29; P<.01) symptoms. A
   statistically significant quadratic term (discrimination-squared; P<.01)
   fit both models, such that moderate levels of discrimination were most
   robustly associated with poorer mental health. Discrimination because of
   SEP was associated with higher discrimination scores and was predictive
   of higher depressive (B=0.22; P<.01) and anxious (B=0.50; P<.01)
   symptoms. No other statistically significant relationship was found
   between discrimination domains and distress.
   Conclusions. In this sample, SEP emerged as the most important domain of
   discrimination in its association with mental health distress. Future
   research should consider intersecting domains of discrimination to
   better understand social disparities in mental health. (Am J Public

AB Context: Career opportunities for athletic training students (ATSs) have
   increased substantially over the past few years. However, ATSs commonly
   appear to be opting for a more diversified professional experience after
   graduation. With the diversity in available options, an understanding of
   career decision is imperative.
   Objective: To use the theoretical framework of socialization to
   investigate the influential factors behind the postgraduation decisions
   of senior ATSs.
   Design: Qualitative study.
   Setting: Web-based management system and telephone interviews.
   Patients or Other Participants: Twenty-two ATSs (16 females, 6 males;
   age = 22 +/- 2 years) who graduated in May 2010 from 13 different
   programs accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic
   Training Education.
   Data Collection and Analysis: All interviews were transcribed verbatim,
   and the data were analyzed inductively. Data analysis required
   independent coding by 2 athletic trainers for specific themes.
   Credibility of the results was confirmed via peer review, methodologic
   triangulation, and multiple analyst triangulation.
   Results: Two higher-order themes emerged from the data analysis:
   persistence in athletic training (AT) and decision to leave AT. Faculty
   and clinical instructor support, marketability, and professional growth
   were supporting themes describing persistence in AT. Shift of interest
   away from AT, lack of respect for the AT profession, compensation, time
   commitment, and AT as a stepping stone were themes sustaining the
   reasons that ATSs leave AT. The aforementioned reasons to leave often
   were discussed collectively, generating a collective undesirable outlook
   on the AT profession.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of faculty support,
   professional growth, and early socialization into AT. Socialization of
   pre-AT students could alter retention rates by providing in-depth
   information about the profession before students commit in their
   undergraduate education and by helping reduce attrition before entrance
   into the workforce.

   Objective: To understand the challenges and obstacles faced by young
   female ATs working in National Collegiate Athletic Association Division
   I athletics.
   Design: Exploratory study using semistructured interviews.
   Setting: Division I clinical setting.
   Patients or Other Participants: A total of 14 female ATs were included
   in the study, using both criterion and snowball-sampling techniques.
   Their mean age was 27 +/- 2 years, with 5 +/- 2 years of overall
   clinical experience. Criteria included employment at the Division I
   clinical setting, being a full-time assistant AT, and at least 3 years
   of working experience but no more than 9 years to avoid role
   continuance.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Analysis of the interview data followed
   inductive procedures as outlined by a grounded theory approach.
   Credibility was established by member checks, multiple-analyst
   triangulation, and peer review.
   Results: Clear communication with both coaches and players about
   expectations and philosophies regarding medical care, a supportive head
   AT in terms of clinical competence, and having and serving as a role
   model were cited as critical tools to alleviate gender bias in the
   workplace.
   Conclusions: The female ATs in this study stressed the importance of
   being assertive with coaches early in the season with regard to the AT's
   role on the team. They reasoned that these actions brought forth a
   greater perception of congruity between their roles as ATs and their
   gender and age. We suggest that female athletic training students seek
   mentors in their field while they complete their coursework and
   practicums. The ATs in the current study indicated that a mentor,
   regardless of sex, helped them feel empowered to navigate the
   male-centric terrain of athletic departments by encouraging them to be
   assertive and not second-guess their decisions.

AB Purpose: Preterm birth (PTB) is a major problem in the United States,
   and black women have greater risk of PTB than white women. The etiology
   of PTB and the racial disparity in preterm outcomes are poorly
   understood. Diminished life satisfaction is associated with adult
   health, but there are no studies of life satisfaction and PTB. In the
   research reported in this article, the relationship between life
   satisfaction and PTB among black women was studied.
   Methods: Women were enrolled in this prospective study at the time of
   the first visit to 5 prenatal clinics in Baltimore. Life satisfaction
   was assessed at the time of the first prenatal visit. Data on PTB were
   obtained from medical records.
   Results: The final sample consisted of 922 women. Among women who were
   somewhat or not at all satisfied with their lives, 16% had preterm
   births, whereas among women who were very satisfied with their lives,
   10.7% had preterm births (unadjusted odds ratio = 1.6; 95% Cl 1.1-2.4).
   The adjusted odds ratio was 1.6 (95% Cl 1.00-2.5).
   Conclusions: Women who reported being somewhat or not at all satisfied
   with their lives had a greater risk of PTB than women who reported being
   very satisfied with their lives. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Purpose: Clinical trials are important tools for advancing cancer
   treatment, prevention, and control. To identify and describe clinical
   effects relevant to underserved groups, their representation in clinical
   trials is necessary. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people have been
   identified as a medically underserved group and their representation in
   cancer clinical trials is unknown. This study sought to examine LGB
   cancer survivor representation in cancer clinical trials.
   Methods: Data were from the 2010, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System, Cancer Survivorship Module. Data were from five states that
   included both the Cancer Survivorship module and an item asking
   self-identified LGB status.
   Results: Participation in cancer clinical trials was higher among LGB
   cancer survivors (12.5%) than among heterosexual cancer survivors (6.0%)
   (p = .005). In the multivariate, adjusted model, LGB cancer survivors
   were more than twice as likely, as heterosexual cancer survivors, to
   report participation in a clinical trial (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.21-3.90).
   Conclusion: LGB cancer survivors had greater likelihood of cancer
   clinical trial participation than heterosexual cancer survivors and this
   was not explained by demographics. The finding was unexpected given the
   historic marginalization of this group. The small number of LGB cancer
   survivors limits the generalizability and statistical power. Findings
   should be interpreted cautiously, and further research is needed to
   clarify explanatory mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB Due to their homebound state, lack of financial resources, and/or other
   life demands, a significant proportion of depressed, low-income
   homebound older adults experience depression. Because of their limited
   access to psychotherapy, most of these older adults self-manage their
   depressive symptoms. The purposes of this study were to examine (1) the
   relationship between homebound older adults' coping responses to
   depressed mood and the severity of their depressive symptoms at baseline
   (n = 121), and (2) the moderating effect of passive coping responses on
   the relationship between participation in problem-solving therapy (PST:
   in-person or telehealth delivery) and depressive symptoms at 12- and
   24-week follow-ups. Controlling for the effects of demographic and
   disability characteristics, cognitive passive coping was significantly
   associated with baseline depressive symptoms, while behavioral passive
   coping was not. The main effect of baseline cognitive passive coping
   response was also significant in mixed-effects regression analysis, but
   the interaction between coping pattern and group was not significant.
   The results point to a possibility that cognitive passive copers may
   have benefited as much from PST as the rest of the PST participants.
   Further research needs to examine the moderating effect of coping
   responses to depressive symptoms on treatment efficacy of PST and other
   psychosocial interventions for late-life depression. (C) 2012 Elsevier

AB Background: Disparities in lung cancer treatment and palliative care are
   well documented. However, the mechanisms underlying these disparities
   are not fully understood. In this study, we evaluated racial and ethnic
   differences in beliefs and attitudes about lung cancer treatment and
   palliative care among patients receiving a new diagnosis of lung cancer.
   Methods: Patients were recruited from four medical centers in New York
   City and surveyed about their beliefs regarding lung cancer care,
   including disease-directed treatments, palliative and end-of-life care,
   and fatalistic and spiritual beliefs. We used univariate and multiple
   regression analyses to compare the distribution of beliefs among
   minority (black and Hispanic) and nonminority patients.
   Results: Of the 335 patients, 21% were black, 20% were Hispanic, and 59%
   were nonminority. Beliefs about chemotherapy and radiotherapy were
   similar across the three groups (P>.05), whereas black patients were
   more likely to believe that surgery might cause lung cancer to spread (P
   = .008). Fatalistic beliefs potentially affecting cancer treatment were
   more common among both minority groups (P <= .02). No significant
   differences were found in attitudes toward clinician communication about
   cancer prognosis (P>.05). However, both blacks and Hispanics were more
   likely to have misconceptions about advance directives and hospice care
   (P <= .02).
   Conclusions: Similarities and differences in beliefs about
   disease-directed treatment were observed between minority and
   nomninority patients with lung cancer. Minority patients hold more
   fatalistic views about the disease and misperceptions about advance care
   planning and hospice care. Further research is needed to assess the
   impact of these beliefs on decisions about lung cancer care and patient
   outcomes. CHEST 2012; 142(5):1251-1258

AB BACKGROUND: The emerging consensus that exposure to near-roadway
   traffic-related pollution causes asthma has implications for compact
   urban development policies designed to reduce driving and greenhouse
   gases. OBJECTIVES: We estimated the current burden of childhood
   asthma-related disease attributable to near-roadway and regional air
   pollution in Los Angeles County (LAC) and the potential health impact of
   regional pollution reduction associated with changes in population along
   major traffic corridors.
   METHODS: The burden of asthma attributable to the dual effects of
   near-roadway and regional air pollution was estimated, using nitrogen
   dioxide and ozone as markers of urban combustion-related and secondary
   oxidant pollution, respectively. We also estimated the impact of
   alternative scenarios that assumed a 20% reduction in regional pollution
   in combination with a 3.6% reduction or 3.6% increase in the proportion
   of the total population living near major roads, a proxy for
   near-roadway exposure.
   RESULTS: We estimated that 27,100 cases of childhood asthma (8% of
   total) in LAC were at least partly attributable to pollution associated
   with residential location within 75 m of a major road. As a result, a
   substantial proportion of asthma-related morbidity is a consequence of
   near-roadway pollution, even if symptoms are triggered by other factors.
   Benefits resulting from a 20% regional pollution reduction varied
   markedly depending on the associated change in near-roadway proximity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there are large and previously
   unappreciated public health consequences of air pollution in LAC and
   probably in other metropolitan areas with dense traffic corridors. To
   maximize health benefits, compact urban development strategies should be
   coupled with policies to reduce near-roadway pollution exposure.

AB Objectives. To estimate the prevalence and distribution of chronic
   migraine (CM) in the US population and compare the age- and sex-specific
   profiles of headache-related disability in persons with CM and episodic
   migraine.
   Background. Global estimates of CM prevalence using various definitions
   typically range from 1.4% to 2.2%, but the influence of sociodemographic
   factors has not been completely characterized.
   Methods. The American Migraine Prevalence and Prevention Study mailed
   surveys to a sample of 120,000 US households selected to represent the
   US population. Data on headache frequency, symptoms, sociodemographics,
   and headache-related disability (using the Migraine Disability
   Assessment Scale) were obtained. Modified SilbersteinLipton criteria
   were used to classify CM (meeting International Classification of
   Headache Disorders, second edition, criteria for migraine with a
   headache frequency of =15 days over the preceding 3 months).
   Results. Surveys were returned by 162,756 individuals aged =12 years;
   19,189 individuals (11.79%) met International Classification of Headache
   Disorders, second edition, criteria for migraine (17.27% of females;
   5.72% of males), and 0.91% met criteria for CM (1.29% of females; 0.48%
   of males). Relative to 12 to 17 year olds, the age- and sex-specific
   prevalence for CM peaked in the 40s at 1.89% (prevalence ratio 4.57; 95%
   confidence interval 3.13-6.67) for females and 0.79% (prevalence ratio
   3.35; 95% confidence interval 1.99-5.63) for males. In univariate and
   adjusted models, CM prevalence was inversely related to annual household
   income. Lower income groups had higher rates of CM. Individuals with CM
   had greater headache-related disability than those with episodic
   migraine and were more likely to be in the highest Migraine Disability
   Assessment Scale grade (37.96% vs 9.50%, respectively). Headache-related
   disability was highest among females with CM compared with males. CM
   represented 7.68% of migraine cases overall, and the proportion
   generally increased with age.
   Conclusions. In the US population, the prevalence of CM was nearly 1%.
   In adjusted models, CM prevalence was highest among females, in
   mid-life, and in households with the lowest annual income. Severe
   headache-related disability was more common among persons with CM and
   most common among females with CM.

AB Background: Research comparing the effects of culturally targeted and
   generic but linguistically appropriate intervention programs is limited.
   We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of a
   culturally targeted video, a generic video, and a fact sheet (control)
   in promoting mammography screening among Chinese-American immigrants.
   Methods: We randomized 664 Chinese-American women from the Washington,
   DC, and New York City areas who were older than 40 years and nonadherent
   to annual mammography screening guidelines to three study arms (each
   with similar to 221 women). The outcome was self-reported mammography
   screening 6 months post intervention. Measures of knowledge, Eastern
   cultural views, and health beliefs were administered before and after
   the intervention.
   Results: The culturally targeted video, the generic video, and the fact
   sheet increased mammography use by 40.3%, 38.5%, and 31.1% from
   baseline, respectively. A significant intervention effect was observed
   only in one subgroup: The culturally targeted video significantly
   increased mammography screening among low-acculturated women over the
   fact sheet [OR, 1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-2.78]. Overall,
   women who obtained a mammogram during the follow-up period reported
   significantly fewer barriers to screening after intervention than those
   who had not obtained screening. Both of the video groups reported fewer
   barriers after intervention than the control group.
   Conclusions: Both theoretically guided videos increased the likelihood
   of mammography use to a similar extent. Cultural targeting was only
   effective for low-acculturated women. Both videos reduced perceived
   barriers to screening and consequently increased screening behavior.
   Impact: The results of this study provide empirical evidence on the
   efficacy of cultural targeting for minority immigrants. Cancer Epidemiol

AB China has undergone large-scale urban expansion and rapid loss of

   examine the relative importance of socioeconomic and policy factors
   across different administrative levels on urban expansion and associated
   cultivated land conversion. We conduct the analysis for urban hotspot
   counties across the entire country. We use multi-level modeling
   techniques to examine how socioeconomic and policy factors at different
   administrative levels affect cultivated land conversion across three
   time periods, 1989-1995, 1995-2000, and 2000-2005. Our results show that
   at the county level, both urban land rent and urban wages contribute to
   total cultivated land conversion. Contrary to expectations, agricultural
   investment drives farmland conversion. suggesting a policy failure with
   unintended consequences. At the provincial level, urban wages and
   foreign direct investment both positively contribute to cultivated land
   conversion. We also find that higher GDP correlates with more urban
   expansion but the relationship is nonlinear. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Culture is often cited as an underlying cause of the undue burden of
   disease borne by communities of color along the entire life cycle.
   However, culture is rarely defined or appropriately measured.
   Scientifically, culture is a complex, integrated, and dynamic conceptual
   framework that is incongruent with the way it is operationalized in
   health behavior theories: as a unidimensional, static, and immutable
   character element of a homogeneous population group. This paper lays out
   this contradiction and proposes a more scientifically grounded approach
   to the use of culture. The premise is that if the concept of culture
   were better operationalized, results from studies of diverse population
   groups would produce findings that are more scientifically valid and
   relevant to the community. Practitioners could then use these findings
   to develop more effective strategies to reduce health disparities and
   improve the health of all population groups. Six steps are proposed to
   increase our ability to achieve greater clarity on what culture is and
   to identify how it impacts health behavior and ultimately health
   outcomes, enabling researchers to build a stronger science of cultural
   diversity. (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

   Method. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to determine

   incorporated aspects of cultural beliefs.
   Results. This review of 166 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
   prevention and risk reduction interventions, published between 1988 and
   2010, identified 34 interventions that varied in cultural definitions
   and the integration of cultural concepts.
   Conclusion, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) interventions need to
   move beyond targeting specific populations based upon race/ethnicity,
   gender, sexual, drug and/or risk behaviors and incorporate cultural
   beliefs and experiences pertinent to an individual's risk. Theory based
   interventions that incorporate cultural beliefs within a contextual
   framework are needed if prevention and risk reduction messages are to
   reach targeted at risk populations. Implications for the lack of
   uniformity of cultural definitions, measures and related theories are
   discussed and recommendations are made to ensure that cultural beliefs
   are acknowledged for their potential conflict with safer sex skills and

AB Introduction. Increases in the availability, affordability, and
   promotion of high-calorie foods and beverages and decreased obligations
   for routine physical activity have fostered trends of increased obesity
   worldwide. In high-income, plural societies, above average obesity
   prevalence is often observed in ethnic minority communities, suggesting
   that obesity-promoting influences are more prevalent or potent in these
   communities.
   Methods. An interdisciplinary group of scholars engaged in multiple
   rounds of focused discussion and literature review to develop a
   Community Energy Balance Framework (CEB). The objective was to explore
   the nature of the excess obesity risk in African descent and other
   ethnic minority populations and identify related implications for
   planning and evaluating interventions to prevent obesity.
   Results. A key principle that emerged is that researchers and
   programmers working with ethnic minority communities should
   contextualize the food- and physical activity-related sociocultural
   perspectives of these communities, taking into account relevant
   historical, political, and structural contexts. This perspective
   underscores the fallacy of approaches that place the entire burden of
   change on the individual, particularly in circumstances of social
   disadvantage and rapid cultural shifts.
   Conclusion. The CEB framework is proposed for use and further
   development to aid in understanding potential health-adverse effects of
   cultural-contextual stresses and accommodations to these stresses. (c)

AB Targeting high-risk populations for public health interventions is a
   classic tool of public health promotion programs. This practice becomes
   thornier when racial groups are identified as the at-risk populations. I
   present the particular ethical and epistemic challenges that arise when
   there are low-risk subpopulations within racial groups that have been
   identified as high-risk for a particular health concern. I focus on two
   examples. The black immigrant population does not have the same
   hypertension risk as US-born African Americans. Similarly, Finnish
   descendants have a far lower rate of cystic fibrosis than other
   Caucasians. In both cases the exceptional nature of these subpopulations
   has been largely ignored by the designers of important public health
   efforts, including the recent US government dietary recommendations. I
   argue that amending the publicly-disseminated risk information to
   acknowledge these exceptions would be desirable for several reasons.
   First, recognizing low-risk subpopulations would allow more efficient
   use of limited resources. Communicating this valuable information to the
   subpopulations would also promote truth-telling. Finally, presenting a
   more nuanced empirically-supported representation of which groups are at
   known risk of diseases (not focusing on mere racial categories) would
   combat harmful biological race essentialist views held by the public.

AB Objectives. National estimates of race differences in alcohol use
   suggest that whites are more likely to be current and binge users of
   alcohol. These findings fail to account for race differences in the
   social and environmental context where people live. This study aims to
   determine whether race disparities persist in alcohol use among
   individuals who share similar social and environmental conditions.
   Methods. We compared race disparities between individuals living in a
   low-income racially integrated urban community without race differences
   in socioeconomic status (EHDIC-SWB) to individuals from the National
   Health Interview Survey (NHIS 2003) to determine if race disparities in
   alcohol use were attenuated in the integrated environment.
   Results. In the NHIS 2003 sample, compared to whites, African Americans
   had lower odds of being a current drinker (OR = 0.56, 95% CI =
   0.49-0.64) and binge drinker (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.58-0.80) independent
   of covariates. However in the EHDIC-SWB sample, African Americans had
   similar odds of being a current drinker (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.67-1.33)
   and binge drinker (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.77-1.35) compared to whites.
   Conclusions. Among individuals who share similar social and
   environmental risk exposures, race group differences in alcohol use
   patterns are similar. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a highly specialized,
   expensive and resource-intense medical procedure that can be associated
   with racial disparities. We review the prevailing literature on racial
   disparities in HCT in the United States and describe areas for future
   research and interventions. We discuss the complexity of interpreting
   race as a biological and social determinant of disease in biomedical
   research, especially as it relates to HCT. In the United States, race is
   often a surrogate for socioeconomic, education and health insurance
   status. We also discuss some of the nuances to consider while reviewing
   the literature on racial disparities. Disparities by race exist in three
   areas related to HCT: donor availability, access to HCT and outcomes of
   HCT. African-Americans/Blacks have a lower likelihood of finding an
   unrelated donor. Race and ethnicity definitions are country-specific and
   reconciling race data can represent significant challenges to unrelated
   donor registries worldwide. African-Americans/Blacks do not have the
   same access to autologous and allogeneic HCT as Whites. Racial
   disparities in outcomes of HCT are more prevalent among allogeneic HCT
   than autologous HCT recipients. More research is required to understand
   the biological, social, cultural, medical and financial aspects of race
   that may influence access to HCT and survival after transplantation.
   Better understanding of racial disparities will minimize inequities,
   inform health policy, guide development of interventions targeted to
   eliminate disparities and ensure equitable access to HCT for all
   populations. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2012) 47, 1385-1390;

   strategies for increasing PA among African American women using a
   cluster randomized, controlled trial. Underactive adult women from 30
   churches (n=15 participants/church) were recruited. Churches were
   randomized to a faith-based intervention, a non-faith based
   intervention, or an information only control group. Intervention groups
   will meet 25 times in group sessions with other women from their church
   over a 10-month period. Control group participants will receive standard
   educational material promoting PA All participants will be followed for
   an additional 12 months to assess PA maintenance. Data will be collected
   at baseline, 10, and 22 months. The primary outcome is PA (steps/day,
   daily moderate-to-vigorous PA). We expect treatment effects indicating
   that assignment to either of the active interventions is associated with
   greater magnitude of change in PA compared to the control group. In
   exploratory analyses, we will test whether changes in the faith-based
   intervention group are greater than changes in the non-faith-based
   intervention group. LADIES. focuses on a significant issue increasing PA
   levels in a segment of the population most in need of successful
   strategies for improving health. If successful, L.A.D.I.E.S. will
   advance the field by providing an approach that is successful for
   initiating and sustaining change in physical activity, which has been
   shown to be a primary risk factor for a variety of health outcomes,
   using churches as the point of delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Introduction: Although it is federally-mandated that racial/ethnic
   minorities be included in research studies, recruiting diverse
   populations remains a challenge. This is particularly difficult when
   research involves children. The purpose of this study was to assess
   attitudes and beliefs toward medical research among a racially and
   socioeconomically diverse population of parents of school children.
   Methods: A cross-sectional parent-report survey was conducted in New
   York City public elementary schools using stratified random selection to
   obtain a diverse population. Fear of medical research and likelihood to
   participate in medical research were assessed using a validated
   questionnaire. Differences in fear/likelihood to participate in research
   across race/ethnicity and socioeconomic characteristics were evaluated.
   Results: In general, parents were afraid of their child "being treated
   as a guinea pig", but were willing to allow their child to participate
   in research if asked by their own doctor. Factors associated with a
   lower score on fear toward research were: primary language other than
   English (OR=0.59), access to an interpreter (OR=0.73) and access to
   medical service within a day (OR=0.51). Latinos had the highest fear
   score (OR=1.87) compared to Whites. Asians were the ethnic group most
   likely to participate in research (OR=1.71). Low education level
   (OR=2.18) and public health insurance (OR=1.37) were associated with a
   higher score for likelihood of allowing one's child to participate in
   medical research.
   Conclusion: Minority parents reported more fear of allowing their
   children to participate in medical research, but were as likely to
   consent their children's participation, especially if asked by their own
   physician. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective American Indian-Europeans, Asians, and African Americans have
   an excess morbidity from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a higher
   prevalence of lupus nephritis than do Caucasians. The aim of this study
   was to analyze the relationship between genetic ancestry and
   sociodemographic characteristics and clinical features in a large cohort
   of American Indian-European SLE patients.
   Methods A total of 2,116 SLE patients of American Indian-European origin
   and 4,001 SLE patients of European descent for whom we had clinical data
   were included in the study. Genotyping of 253 continental
   ancestry-informative markers was performed on the Illumina platform.
   Structure and Admixture software were used to determine genetic ancestry
   proportions of each individual. Logistic regression was used to test the
   association between genetic ancestry and sociodemographic and clinical
   characteristics. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated with 95% confidence
   intervals (95% CIs).
   Results The average American Indian genetic ancestry of 2,116 SLE
   patients was 40.7%. American Indian genetic ancestry conferred increased
   risks of renal involvement (P < 0.0001, OR 3.50 [95% CI 2.63- 4.63]) and
   early age at onset (P < 0.0001). American Indian ancestry protected
   against photosensitivity (P < 0.0001, OR 0.58 [95% CI 0.44-0.76]), oral
   ulcers (P < 0.0001, OR 0.55 [95% CI 0.42-0.72]), and serositis (P <
   0.0001, OR 0.56 [95% CI 0.41-0.75]) after adjustment for age, sex, and
   age at onset. However, age and sex had stronger effects than genetic
   ancestry on malar rash, discoid rash, arthritis, and neurologic
   involvement.
   Conclusion In general, American Indian genetic ancestry correlates with
   lower sociodemographic status and increases the risk of developing renal
   involvement and SLE at an earlier age.

   adolescents, ages 16-18, were initially trained with video modeling.
   Audio cuing was then used by an attendant who delivered prompts
   regarding when to perform job skills. The two interventions were
   evaluated in an interrupted time series withdrawal design during
   training and then again in an actual job setting. Results show video
   modeling was not effective. However, the audio cuing produced job
   performances well above the designated criteria during training and when
   on the job. These changes were replicated with each participant,
   demonstrating clear experimental control. The changes proved
   statistically significant as well. Participants and parents reported
   high job satisfaction. The challenges of competitive employment for

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There is a documented connection between the
   home environment and health. Medical-legal partnerships (MLPs) can
   address social and environmental determinants of health. Our objective
   was to describe a cluster of substandard housing identified and treated
   by an MLP based in a pediatric primary care setting.
   METHODS: Potential cases of poor-quality housing were identified during
   outpatient primary care. A case was defined as any rented housing unit
   with a reported unaddressed housing risk within a defined building
   portfolio (owned by a single developer) in which >= 1 child lived. An
   on-site MLP offered affected families legal services including ordinance
   enforcement and connection to resources. They also initiated
   portfolio-wide advocacy. Legal advocates reported case outcomes. Medical
   history and household demographics were collected from the medical
   record and compared with clinic-wide data by using Fisher's exact test
   or chi(2) statistics.
   RESULTS: After identification of a single case, an additional 15 cases
   were identified. Pest infestation was the most common initial risk
   identified. Of 14 units with outcome data, repairs were completed in 10
   (71%). Of the 19 building complexes with the same owner, 11 received
   significant systemic repairs. Of the 45 children living within the 16
   identified case units, 36% had asthma, 33% had developmental delay or
   behavioral disorder, and 9% had an elevated lead level. Affected
   children were more likely to have one of these diagnoses than the
   general clinic population (all P < .01).
   CONCLUSIONS: An MLP identified and improved home environmental
   conditions for children living in a cluster of substandard housing.

AB The present article develops a new approach to intellectual history and
   sociology of knowledge. Its point of departure is to investigate the
   conditions under which social thinkers assume the iconic reputation.
   What does it take to become 'a founding father' of a humanistic
   discipline? How do social thinkers achieve the status of a
   trans-disciplinary star? Why some intellectuals attract tremendous
   attention and 'go down in history' despite personal and professional
   failures, while others enjoy only limited recognition or simply sink
   into oblivion, even if they have met all the standards of their day?
   Quite a few sociologists have tackled this elusive issue. Pierre
   Bourdieu, Michele Lamont and Randall Collins are among those who fleshed
   out strong explanatory frameworks. This project adds to this body of
   knowledge by emphasizing cultural factors that these authors down-played
   in their seminal accounts, despite being aware of their significance. By
   showing why these underdeveloped aspects of their works need to be
   incorporated into the debate and how this can be achieved, this article
   introduces a new theorization of the iconic, lasting intellectual
   reputation substantiated by evidence from the lifeworks of Bronislaw
   Malinowski and Michel Foucault. As such, it aims, minimally, to make
   sociology of knowledge decisively 'cultural'. Maximally, it seeks to
   demonstrate that the iconic success of intellectual intervention in
   social theory depends on carefully performed and contingently mediated
   engagement with the binary systems of symbolic classification.

   be encouraged to teach this topic in introductory college survey courses
   (e.g., psychology and sociology), although negative reactions by White
   students can affect student evaluations of an instructor's teaching
   skills. We decided to further explore college students' cognitive and
   emotional reactions to this topic. Principal components analysis
   revealed four factors. Agreement with items related to the factor
   Societal (e.g., American society is not a meritocracy) was associated
   with understanding White privilege. Agreement with items associated with
   the factor Personal (e.g., feeling personally attacked) was associated
   with failure to understand this concept. The remaining two factors,
   Denial and The Bad Guys (feeling like one of "the bad guys" in society),
   were not significantly associated with understanding White privilege.
   These findings are discussed in the context of successfully teaching

AB Objective: We examined whether relationships of neighborhood
   disadvantage with drinker status, heavy drinking, alcoholrelated
   consequences, and dependence differed by race and/or gender. We
   hypothesized that neighborhood disadvantage would be negatively
   associated with drinker status but positively associated with heavy and
   problem drinking, with more pronounced relationships among African
   American and Hispanic men than other groups. Method: Data consisted of
   nationally representative, randomly selected, cross-sectional samples of
   White, African American, and Hispanic adults (N = 13,864, of which 52%
   were female; with 7,493 drinkers, of which 48% were female) from the
   2000 and 2005 National Alcohol Surveys merged with 2000 Census data.
   Analyses included logistic and linear regression using weights to adjust
   for sampling and nonresponse. Results: Hypotheses were partly supported.
   Bivariate relationships were in the expected direction. Multivariate
   main effect models showed that neighborhood disadvantage was
   significantly associated with increased abstinence and marginally
   associated with increased negative consequences experienced by drinkers,
   but race/ethnicity and gender modified these associations. Disadvantage
   was significantly associated with increased abstinence for all groups
   except African American and Hispanic men. Among drinkers, disadvantage
   was significantly negatively associated with heavy drinking by Whites
   but significantly positively associated with heavy drinking by African
   Americans. Disadvantage also was associated with elevated
   alcohol-related consequences for White women and African American men.
   Conclusions: The findings have implications for the development of
   targeted interventions to reduce the unequal impacts of neighborhood
   disadvantage on alcohol outcomes. Future research should examine the
   contribution of multiple types of disadvantage to heavy drinking and
   alcohol problems. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73. 865-873, 2012)

   for attention to racial differences in networks that may affect drinking
   behavior. This study investigates differences in network characteristics
   by the racial background of homeless youth, and associations of network
   characteristics with heavy drinking. (Heavy drinking was defined as
   having five or more drinks of alcohol in a row within a couple of hours
   on at least one day within the past 30 days.) Method: A probability
   sample of 235 Black and White homeless youths ages 13-24 were
   interviewed in Los Angeles County. We used chi-square or one-way
   analysis of variance tests to examine network differences by race and
   logistic regressions to identify network correlates of heavy drinking
   among Black and White homeless youth. Results: The networks of Black
   youth included significantly more relatives and students who attend
   school regularly, whereas the networks of White youth were more likely
   to include homeless persons, relatives who drink to intoxication, and
   peers who drink to intoxication. Having peers who drink heavily was
   significantly associated with heavy drinking only among White youth. For
   all homeless youth, having more students in the network who regularly
   attend school was associated with less risk of heavy drinking.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to investigate
   racial differences in network characteristics and associations of
   network characteristics with heavy drinking among homeless youth. White
   homeless youth may benefit from interventions that reduce their ties
   with peers who drink. Enhancing ties to school-involved peers may be a
   promising intervention focus for both Black and White homeless youth.

AB Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine whether the
   clustering of underage risky drinking and its consequences within
   communities might arise from shared perceptions regarding underage
   drinking as well as the social context of drinking. Method: The
   Enforcing Underage Drinking Laws Randomized Community Trial provided
   data from repeated cross-sectional samples of 5,017 current drinkers
   (2,619 male) ages 14-20 years from 68 communities surveyed in 2004,
   2006, and 2007. Alternating logistic regressions were used to estimate
   the influence of social factors on the clustering of getting drunk,
   heavy episodic drinking, nonviolent consequences, and driving after
   drinking or riding with a drinking driver. Results: The clustering of
   getting drunk, heavy episodic drinking, and nonviolent consequences was
   no longer statistically significant after adjustment for drinking with
   friends and drinking with parents. Parents providing alcohol explained
   the clustering of heavy episodic drinking and nonviolent consequences,
   whereas drinking with other underage drinkers and friends providing
   alcohol explained the clustering of nonviolent consequences. Drinking
   with friends or other underage drinkers and friends providing alcohol
   increased the risk of these behaviors, whereas drinking with parents and
   parents providing alcohol were protective. Perceptions regarding peer
   drinking, community norms, consequences for drinking, and drinking at a
   party did not influence clustering. Conclusions: These findings suggest
   that interventions to reduce underage risky drinking in communities
   should focus on the differential effects of the social context in which
   drinking occurs. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 890-898, 2012)

AB Objective: The present study examined sex differences in lifetime Axis I
   and II psychiatric comorbidity of DSM-1V alcohol use disorders (AUDs)
   and drug use disorders (DUDS) among general population U.S. adults.
   Method: Using data from Waves 1 and 2 of the National Epidemiologic
   Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, Wave 2 lifetime prevalences of
   each disorder comorbid with alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug
   abuse, and drug dependence were compared between men and women.
   Sex-specific associations of alcohol, any drug, and cannabis- and
   cocaine-specific abuse and dependence with each comorbid disorder were
   examined using logistic regression, first with adjustment for
   sociodemographic variables and then with additional adjustment for all
   other psychiatric disorders. Results: Prevalences of most comorbid
   disorders differed significantly by sex among respondents with each AUD
   and DUD. However, after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics
   and additional co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses, there were few sex
   differences in unique comorbid associations of specific AUDs and DUDs
   with specific psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: Rates of psychiatric
   disorders comorbid with AUDs and DUDs indicate large burdens of
   morbidity in both sexes, highlighting the need for careful assessment
   and appropriate treatment of both substance use and mental health
   disorders. The unique comorbid associations with AUDs and DUDs
   identified in this study further indicate the need for prospective
   etiological research to characterize these associations, their
   underlying mechanisms, and the possible sex specificity of those
   mechanisms. (J Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 938-950, 2012)

AB Objective: The present study aimed to extend previous research examining
   the relationships among perceived drinking norms, alcohol use, and
   related negative consequences by examining the moderating influence of
   social comparison orientation. Method: A sample of 481 college students
   (44% male) completed a Web-based survey that assessed perceptions of
   drinking behavior, social comparison orientation, and alcohol use.
   Results: The results suggested that social comparison orientation
   moderated the norm-behavior relationship such that the association
   between perceived drinking norms and alcohol-related negative
   consequences was stronger for those higher in social comparison. Results
   also showed that there was no moderation effect for alcohol consumption
   as the dependent variable. Conclusions: The findings of the present
   study are potentially important when developing efficacious alcohol
   prevention and intervention programs at colleges and universities and in
   considering more complex models of social influences on drinking. (J.

AB Objective: Young adults are increasingly interacting with their peer
   groups online through social networking sites. These online interactions
   may reinforce or escalate alcohol and other drug (AOD) use as a result
   of more frequent and continuous exposure to AOD promotive norms;
   however, the influence of young adults' virtual networks on AOD use
   remains untested. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   association between the presence of AOD use content in online social
   networking, perceived norms (online norms regarding AOD use and
   anticipated regret with AOD use postings), and alcohol and marijuana use
   in a sample of 18- to 24-year-olds. Method: Using an adapted web version
   of respondent-driven sampling (webRDS), we recruited a sample of 18- to
   24-year-olds (N = 3,448) in the United States. Using multivariate
   regression, we explored the relationship between past-30-day alcohol and
   marijuana use, online norms regarding AOD use, peer substance use, and
   online and offline peer support. Results: Alcohol use was associated
   with more alcohol content online. Anticipated regret and online peer
   support were associated with less alcohol use. Anticipated regret was
   negatively associated with marijuana use. Peer AOD use was positively
   associated with both alcohol and marijuana use. Conclusions: Peers play
   an important role in young adult alcohol and marijuana use, whether
   online or in person. Our findings highlight the importance of promoting
   online network-based AOD prevention programs for young adults in the
   United States. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 968-975, 2012)

AB Objective: American students studying in foreign countries represent a
   unique group at risk for increased and problematic drinking. Examination
   of risk and protective factors for negative alcohol-related consequences
   can lead to the development of efficacious preventive interventions for
   reducing high-risk drinking while abroad. The present study examined the
   relationship between sojourner adjustment (i.e., the sociocultural and
   psychological adjustment of short-term residents in foreign
   environments), drinking motives, and alcohol-related consequences.
   Method: Participants were 248 college students (81% women) who recently
   completed study-abroad trips and completed online surveys about their
   drinking motives and behavior, alcohol-related consequences, and
   sojourner adjustment. Results: In general, positive sojourner adjustment
   (i.e., social interaction with host nationals, language development and
   use, and host culture identification) was protective against negative
   consequences, whereas negative sojourner adjustment (i.e., social
   interaction with co-nationals and home-sickness/feeling out of place)
   was associated with increased reporting of consequences. Unexpectedly,
   the positive sojourner adjustment factor of cultural understanding and
   participation was associated with greater alcohol-related consequences.
   Social motives for drinking also predicted consequences. Drinking
   motives moderated several of the relationships between sojourner
   adjustment and consequences. Conclusions: Interest in and adoption of
   the host country culture may protect against problematic alcohol use;
   however, this may vary based on students' reasons for drinking. These
   findings support the need for further examination of sojourner
   adjustment in college students abroad and indicate potential areas for
   development of preventive interventions. (J Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73,

AB Objectives To investigate the mechanisms through which marital status
   exerts long-term effects on depressive symptoms among women and to
   evaluate the relative importance of psychological, social and financial
   resources in mediating this relationship.
   Methods Data came from 6107 female respondents to a nationally
   representative longitudinal data set from the USA (National Survey of
   Families and Households 1987-1988/1992-1994). Mediation was investigated
   using semi-longitudinal structural equation modelling and bias-corrected
   bootstrapped CIs. Latent constructs with multiple indicators were used
   to measure depressive symptoms, primary and secondary social integration
   and self-esteem.
   Results The total effect of marital status on subsequent depressive
   symptoms was statistically significant for all marital statuses relative
   to those in first marriages controlling for age, education, race, number
   of children younger than 5 in the household, T1 depressive symptoms and
   marital status transitions between waves; all groups experienced higher
   levels of depressive symptoms than those in first marriages. These
   effects were completely mediated for never-married women and partially
   mediated for separated/divorced, widowed and cohabiting women. Adjusted
   household income was the largest mediator for the separated/divorced,
   widowed and never-married, but primary social integration also played a
   role. Self-esteem was the only significant mediator for the remarried
   and cohabiting and was also important in explaining differences between
   the first-married and separated/divorced.
   Conclusion This study demonstrates that the reasons why marital status
   has an influence on subsequent depressive symptoms varies depending on
   the specific marital status being compared with the married.

AB Social factors are important determinants of drug dependence and
   relapse.
   We reviewed pre-clinical literature examining the role of social
   experiences from early life through the development of drug dependence
   and relapse, emphasizing two aspects of these experiences: (1) whether
   the social interaction is appetitive or aversive and (2) whether the
   social interaction occurs within or outside of the drug-taking context.
   The models reviewed include neonatal care, isolation, social defeat,
   chronic subordination, and prosocial interactions. We review results
   from these models in regard to effects on self-administration and
   conditioned place preference established with alcohol, psychostimulants,
   and opiates.
   We suggest that in general, when the interactions occur outside of the
   drug-taking context, prosocial interactions are protective against drug
   abuse-related behaviors, whereas social stressors facilitate these
   behaviors. By contrast, positive or negative social interactions
   occurring within the drug-taking context may interact with other risk
   factors to enhance or inhibit these behaviors.
   Despite differences in the nature and complexity of human social
   behavior compared to other species, the evolving animal literature
   provides useful models for understanding social influences on drug
   abuse-related behavior that will allow for research on the behavioral
   and biological mechanisms involved. The models have contributed to
   understanding social influences on initiation and maintenance of drug
   use, but more research is needed to understand social influences on drug
   relapse.

   analyst combines preexisting generalizations with specific observations

   Process tracing tests can be used to help establish that (1) an initial
   event or process took place, (2) a subsequent outcome also occurred, and
   (3) the former was a cause of the latter. The article focuses on the
   logic of different process tracing tests, including hoop tests, smoking
   gun tests, and straw in the wind tests. New criteria for judging the
   strength of these tests are developed using ideas concerning the
   relative importance of necessary and sufficient conditions. Similarities

AB This article approaches work talk, a neglected but vital object of
   sociological inquiry, as a possible key to unlocking the mystery of the
   contemporary work ethic as it appears among male professionals living
   and working in the United States and Western Europe. This analytical
   task is carried out through a close examination of the contrasting
   rhetorics, scripts, and vocabularies anchoring French, Norwegian, and
   American forms of hard work talk. This comparative exercise capitalizes
   on material from over one hundred in-depth interviews with comparable
   French, Norwegian, and American male business professionals working in
   finance, law, consulting, engineering and other professional fields.
   Scrutinizing the scripts that members of these three groups use to
   address their motives for working hard in demanding jobs, this article
   maps a legitimation divide between the American respondents and their
   French and Norwegian counterparts. The hard work commentaries of the
   French and Norwegian respondents feature script repertoires that focus
   exclusively on the stimulating and enriching character of their work
   activities. By contrast, the commentaries of the American respondents
   incorporate overachievement scripts addressing both the extrinsic
   rewards of work and the personality traits that make hard work a natural
   expression of personality. These hard work commentaries invoke career
   success and moneymaking as inducements to hard work. But they also
   invoke personality traits such as drive and the innate aversion to
   leisure. This transatlantic divide reflects the greater cultural
   resonance of self-realization in the two European contexts and the fact
   that the French and Norwegians have embraced a more Maslowian approach
   to working life. As I argue in the article's conclusion, these
   transatlantic differences in script repertoires can be viewed as the
   product of the societally specific cultural configurations at work in
   the three countries. Such cultural configurations define what it
   means-in terms of status and authenticity-to work hard in a remunerative
   and rewarding job.

AB As the world continues to urbanize, ensuring that urban residents have
   access to green infrastructure and the ecosystem services it provides
   will be critical. Furthermore, the distribution of green infrastructure
   within cities should be equitable so that no socioeconomic group is
   underserved in terms of the benefits derived from ecosystem services.
   Our goal was to test whether there were any differences among
   socioeconomic groups in terms of (1) proximity to open space, (2)
   proximity to Lake Michigan, (3) tree canopy cover, or (4) bird
   biodiversity in census tracts across Chicago, IL (USA). These four
   variables were used as proxies for a number of different ecosystem
   services. We characterized the first three variables with GIS operations
   using classified Quickbird imagery and other datasets that describe the
   urban and natural environment. We used MaxEnt to model suitable bird
   habitat for 52 species that are regularly observed in the area and
   combined the habitat maps to estimate bird biodiversity in a spatially
   explicit manner. Our results suggest that census tracts with more low-to
   mid-income Hispanic residents were farther away from both open space and
   Lake Michigan, and had less tree canopy cover and bird biodiversity than
   other census tracts. Tracts characterized mostly by low-income African
   Americans were not statistically different in terms of proximity to open
   space, nor in terms of tree canopy cover or bird biodiversity, than
   those characterized by higher income residents. Those tracts were,
   however, significantly farther from Lake Michigan compared to the higher
   income census tracts. This research suggests the potential for
   environmental injustice in Chicago and we discuss some possible causes
   and implications of our findings.

AB African American women are faced with many challenges regarding their
   historical, cultural, and social structural position in the United
   States that may heighten their vulnerability for depression, one of the
   most prevalent disorders that can engender poor functionality. The
   purpose of this cross-sectional pilot study was to foster greater
   understanding about the occurrence and correlates of depressive symptoms
   among a diverse convenience sample of 63 African American women
   recruited from a comprehensive primary health care clinic (n = 23), a
   small private academic institution (n = 25), and an urban community
   setting (n = 15). Self-report data concerning selected psychological,
   sociocultural, and biological factors were collected. Descriptive
   statistics, Pearson product moment correlation, and analysis of variance
   were used to analyze data. Results indicated several similarities and
   differences among the 3 groups of women concerning levels of depressive
   symptoms and their correlates. Among the total sample, symptoms of
   depression were mild among 65% of the women. Depressive symptoms were
   significant and positively associated with negative and ruminative
   thinking (r = 0.79, p < .01), low self-esteem (r = 0.58, p < .01),
   stressful life events (r = 0.43, p < .05), low social support (r = 0.46,
   p < .01), depression stigma (r = 0.36, p < 01), and indication of
   chronic diseases (r = 0.34, p < .01). Depressive symptoms were
   significant and negatively associated with resiliency (r = -0.48, p <
   .01) and spiritual well-being (r = -.47, p < .01). This research adds to
   the empirical data concerning contributors to depressive symptoms for
   African American women.

TI Beliefs and Attitudes Toward Obstructive Sleep Apnea Evaluation and

AB Objective: Although blacks are at higher risk for obstructive sleep
   apnea (OSA), they are not as likely as their white counterparts to
   receive OSA evaluation and treatment. This study assessed knowledge,
   beliefs, and attitudes towards OSA evaluation and treatment among blacks
   residing in Brooklyn, New York.
   Methods: Five focus groups involving 39 black men and women (aged >= 18
   years) were conducted at State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate
   Medical Center in Brooklyn to ascertain barriers preventing or delaying
   OSA evaluation and treatment.
   Results: Misconceptions about sleep apnea were a common theme that
   emerged from participants' responses. Obstructive sleep apnea was often
   viewed as a type of insomnia, an age-related phenomenon, and as being
   caused by certain bedtime activities. The major theme that emerged about
   barriers to OSA evaluation was unfamiliarity with the study environment.
   Barriers were categorized as: problems sleeping in a strange and
   unfamiliar environment, unfamiliarity with the study protocol, and fear
   of being watched while sleeping. Barriers to continuous positive airway
   pressure (CPAP) treatment adoption were related to the confining nature
   of the device, discomfort of wearing a mask while they slept, and
   concerns about their partner's perceptions of treatment.
   Conclusion: Results of this study suggest potential avenues for
   interventions to increase adherence to recommended evaluation and
   treatment of OSA. Potential strategies include reducing misconceptions
   about OSA, increasing awareness of OSA in vulnerable communities,
   familiarizing patients and their partners with laboratory procedures
   used to diagnose and treat OSA. We propose that these strategies should
   be used to inform the development of culturally and linguistically
   tailored sleep apnea interventions to increase awareness of OSA among
   blacks who are at risk for OSA and associated comorbidities.

AB This paper applies interpretative phenomenological analysis as a tool to
   understand ways African American families discuss and make sense of
   their knowledge, awareness, and commitment of the organ donation
   process. African American families (n = 20) participated in
   self-directed conversations based on the organ donor model, which is
   grounded in the theory of reasoned action and the theory of motivated
   information management. Results indicate that the media strongly
   influences an individual's willingness to participate in the organ
   donation process and their commitment to further discuss their decisions
   with close family members. Greater attention should be given to
   cultural-specific campaigns to increase the number of African American
   donors.

AB This article examines how the sex composition of women's current
   children at the start of a pregnancy interval influences both fertility
   desires and the full range of reproductive actions women may take to
   realize them, including temporary contraception, abortion and
   sterilization, in Madhya Pradesh, India, where popular notions of ideal
   family size and sex composition are dominated by son preference. The
   analysis is conducted using a dataset of 9127 individual pregnancy
   intervals from a 2002 statewide representative survey of 2444 women aged
   15-39 with at least one child. The results indicate that women's
   preferences go beyond a singular preference for male children, with the
   preferred composition of children being two boys and one girl. Women
   with this composition are 90% less likely to report having wanted
   another pregnancy (OR 0.097, p < 0.01) relative to those with two girls.
   These preferences have significant implications for reproductive
   actions. While sex composition has no statistically significant effect
   on the use of temporary contraception, those with the preferred sex
   composition are twice as likely to attempt abortion (OR 2.436, p < 0.01)
   and twelve times more likely to be sterilized (OR 12.297, p < 0.01)
   relative to those with two girls only.

AB Civil unrest is a powerful form of collective human dynamics, which has
   led to major transitions of societies in modern history. The study of
   collective human dynamics, including collective aggression, has been the
   focus of much discussion in the context of modeling and identification
   of universal patterns of behavior. In contrast, the possibility that
   civil unrest activities, across countries and over long time periods,
   are governed by universal mechanisms has not been explored. Here,
   records of civil unrest of 170 countries during the period 1919-2008 are
   analyzed. It is demonstrated that the distributions of the number of
   unrest events per year are robustly reproduced by a nonlinear, spatially
   extended dynamical model, which reflects the spread of civil disorder
   between geographic regions connected through social and communication
   networks. The results also expose the similarity between global social
   instability and the dynamics of natural hazards and epidemics.

AB Background. Studies have demonstrated that African American race is a
   strong predictor of nondonation. However, it is often and correctly
   argued that African American race is a crude explanatory variable that
   is a surrogate marker of socioeconomic status, education, and access to
   health care. We hypothesized that, when controlling for these factors,
   African American race would cease to be a predictor of organ donation.
   Methods. A retrospective review of 1292 Alabama decedents who were
   approached for organ donation between 2006 and 2009 was performed.
   Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify
   the most parsimonious model that could explain the variation in the log
   odds of obtaining consent.
   Results. Consent for donation was obtained from 49% of the decedents'
   families. Household income was a predictor of organ donor consent only
   in whites. Surprisingly, household income was not statistically
   different between consented and nonconsented African American decedents
   (U. S. $25,147 vs. U. S. $26,137, P=0.90). On multivariable analysis,
   education, urban residence, and shorter distance between the decedent's
   residence and donor hospital were significantly associated with
   obtaining consent for organ donation. On univariate analysis, the odds
   ratio of donor consent in whites compared with African Americans was
   2.76 (95% confidence interval, 2.17-3.57). When controlling for
   socioeconomic status and access to health care variables, the odds ratio
   of donor consent increased to 4.36 (95% confidence interval, 2.88-6.61).
   Conclusions. We interpret this result to indicate that there remains
   unknown but important factor(s) associated with both race and obtaining
   organ donor consent. Further studies are required to isolate and
   determine whether this factor(s) is modifiable.

AB We evaluated whether black race is associated with higher incidence of
   End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) among a cohort of blacks and whites of
   similar, generally low socioeconomic status, and whether risk factor
   patterns differ among blacks and whites and explain the poorly
   understood racial disparity in ESRD. Incident diagnoses of ESRD among
   79,943 black and white participants in the Southern Community Cohort
   Study (SCCS) were ascertained by linkage with the United States Renal
   Data System (USRDS) from 2002 through 2009. Person-years of follow up
   were calculated from date of entry into the SCCS until date of ESRD
   diagnosis, date of death, or September 1, 2009, whichever occurred
   first. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard
   ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for incident ESRD among
   black and white participants in relation to baseline characteristics.
   After 329,003 person-years of follow-up, 687 incident cases of ESRD were
   identified in the cohort. The age-adjusted ESRD incidence rate was 273
   (per 100,000) among blacks, 3.5-fold higher than the rate of 78 among
   whites. Risk factors for ESRD included male sex (HR = 1.6; 95% CI
   1.4-1.9), low income (HR = 1.5; 95% CI 1.2-1.8 for income below vs.
   above $15,000), smoking (HR = 1.2; 95% CI 1.02-1.4) and histories of
   diabetes (HRs increasing to 9.4 (95% CI 7.4-11.9) among those with >= 20
   years diabetes duration) and hypertension (HR = 2.9; 95% CI 2.3-3.7).
   Patterns and magnitudes of association were virtually identical among
   blacks and whites. After adjustment for these risk factors, blacks
   continued to have a higher risk for ESRD (HR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.9-3.0)
   relative to whites. The black-white disparity in risk of ESRD was
   attenuated but not eliminated after control for known risk factors in a
   closely socioeconomically matched cohort. Further research
   characterizing biomedical factors, including CKD progression, in ESRD
   occurrence in these two racial groups is needed.

AB Recent research suggests that the genotype of one individual in a
   friendship pair is predictive of the genotype of his/her friend. These
   results provide tentative support for the genetic homophily perspective,
   which has important implications for social and genetic epidemiology
   because it substantiates a particular form of gene-environment
   correlation. This process may also have important implications for
   social scientists who study the social factors related to health and
   health-related behaviors. We extend this work by considering the ways in
   which school context shapes genetically similar friendships. Using the
   network, school, and genetic information from the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health, we show that genetic homophily for the TaqI
   A polymorphism within the DRD2 gene is stronger in schools with greater
   levels of inequality. Our results suggest that individuals with similar
   genotypes may not actively select into friendships; rather, they may be
   placed into these contexts by institutional mechanisms outside of their
   control. Our work highlights the fundamental role played by broad social
   structures in the extent to which genetic factors explain complex
   behaviors, such as friendships.

AB Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of positive screens for
   social-emotional problems among preschool-aged children in a low-income
   clinical population and to explore the family context and receptivity to
   referrals to help guide development of interventions.
   Design: Observational, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: Two urban primary care clinics.
   Participants: A total of 254 parents of 3-and 4-year-old children at 2
   urban primary care clinics.
   Main Outcome Measures: Score on a standardized screen for
   social-emotional problems (Ages and Stages Questionnaire:
   Social-Emotional) and answers to additional survey questions about child
   care arrangements, parental depressive symptoms, and attitudes toward
   preschool and behavioral health referrals.
   Results: Twenty-four percent (95% CI, 16.5%-31.5%) of children screened
   positive for social-emotional problems. Among those screening positive,
   45% had a parent with depressive symptoms, and 27% had no nonparental
   child care. Among parents of children who screened positive for
   social-emotional problems, 79% reported they would welcome or would not
   mind a referral to a counselor or psychologist; only 16% reported a
   prior referral.
   Conclusions: In a clinical sample, 1 in 4 low-income pre-school-aged
   children screened positive for social-emotional problems, and most
   parents were amenable to referrals to preschool or early childhood
   mental health. This represents an opportunity for improvement in primary
   prevention and early intervention for social-emotional problems.

AB Health disparities research spans multiple fields and methods and
   documents strong links between social disadvantage and poor health.
   Associations between socioeconomic status (SES) and health are often
   taken as evidence for the causal impact of SES on health, but
   alternative explanations, including the impact of health on SES, are
   plausible. Studies showing the influence of parents' SES on their
   children's health provide evidence for a causal pathway from SES to
   health, but have limitations. Health disparities researchers face
   tradeoffs between "rigor" and "vigor" in designing studies that
   demonstrate how social disadvantage becomes biologically embedded and
   results in poorer health. Rigorous designs aim to maximize precision in
   the measurement of SES and health outcomes through methods that provide
   the greatest control over temporal ordering and causal direction. To
   achieve precision, many studies use a single SES predictor and single
   disease. However, doing so oversimplifies the multifaceted, entwined
   nature of social disadvantage and may overestimate the impact of that
   one variable and underestimate the true impact of social disadvantage on
   health. In addition, SES effects on overall health and functioning are
   likely to be greater than effects on any one disease. Vigorous designs
   aim to capture this complexity and maximize ecological validity through
   more complete assessment of social disadvantage and health status, but
   may provide less-compelling evidence of causality. Newer approaches to
   both measurement and analysis may enable enhanced vigor as well as
   rigor. Incorporating both rigor and vigor into studies will provide a
   fuller understanding of the causes of health disparities.

AB Executive function (EF) abilities are increasingly recognized as an
   important protective factor for children experiencing adversity,
   promoting better stress and emotion regulation as well as social and
   academic adjustment. We provide evidence that early life adversity is
   associated with significant reductions in EF performance on a
   developmentally sensitive battery of laboratory EF tasks that measured
   cognitive flexibility, working memory, and inhibitory control. Animal
   models also suggest that early adversity has a negative impact on the
   development of prefrontal cortex-based cognitive functions. In this
   study, we report EF performance 1 y after adoption in 2.5- to 4-y-old
   children who had experienced institutional care in orphanages overseas
   compared with a group of age-matched nonadopted children. To our
   knowledge, this is the youngest age and the soonest after adoption that
   reduced EF performance has been shown using laboratory measures in this
   population. EF reductions in performance were significant above and
   beyond differences in intelligence quotient. Within the adopted sample,
   current EF was associated with measures of early deprivation after
   controlling for intelligence quotient, with less time spent in the birth
   family before placement in an institution and lower quality of
   physical/social care in institutions predicting poorer performance on
   the EF battery.

   electrical activity (alpha power) on these skills. Participants included
   children randomized to an intervention involving foster care [Foster

   As Usual Group (CAUG)], and never-institutionalized children living with
   their families in the Bucharest community [Never-Institutionalized Group
   (NIG)]. A continuous rating of children's attachment security to their
   primary caregiver was assessed at 42 mo of age. When children were 8 y
   old, teachers rated their social skills, and the children's resting
   electroencephalogram alpha power was recorded. Teachers rated social
   skills of FCG children who were placed into foster care before 20 mo of
   age as no different from NIG children, and both of these groups were
   higher than CAUG children and FCG children placed after 20 mo.
   Electroencephalogram alpha power at age 8 significantly moderated the
   relations between attachment security and social skills. These findings
   characterize institutionalized children's social skills in middle
   childhood within the context of a randomized intervention while

AB Gradients across socio-economic position exist for many measures of
   children's health and development in higher-income countries. These
   associations may not be consistent, however, among the millions of
   children living in lower-and middle-income countries. Our objective was
   to examine child development and growth in young children across
   socio-economic position in four developing countries. We used
   cross-sectional surveys, child development assessments, measures of
   length (LAZ), and home stimulation (Family Care Index) of children in
   India, Indonesia, Peru, and Senegal. The Extended Ages and Stages
   Questionnaire (EASQ) was administered to parents of all children ages
   3-23 mo in the household (n = 8,727), and length measurements were taken
   for all children 0-23 mo (n = 11,102). Household wealth and maternal
   education contributed significantly and independently to the variance in
   EASQ and LAZ scores in all countries, while controlling for child's age
   and sex, mother's age and marital status, and household size. Being in
   the fifth wealth quintile in comparison with the first quintile was
   associated with significantly higher EASQ scores (0.27 to 0.48 of a
   standardized score) and higher LAZ scores (0.37 to 0.65 of a
   standardized score) in each country, while controlling for maternal
   education and covariates. Wealth and education gradients increased over
   the first two years in most countries for both EASQ and LAZ scores, with
   larger gradients seen in 16-23-mo-olds than in 0-7 mo-olds. Mediation
   analyses revealed that parental home stimulation activities and LAZ were
   significant mediating variables and explained up to 50% of the wealth
   effects on the EASQ.

AB BACKGROUND: The impact of race and socioeconomic status (SES) in
   prostate cancer (CaP) outcomes has been well-studied, but controversy
   remains. The associations of race/SES with intermediate CaP outcomes,
   including positive surgical margin (PSM) and biochemical recurrence
   (BCR), were explored in an equal-access setting. METHODS: Data were
   retrospectively collected from 2502 men in the Shared Equal Access
   Regional Cancer Hospitals (SEARCH) database who underwent radical
   prostatectomy from 1989 to 2010. SES (income, education, employment, and
   poverty) was estimated from linkage of home ZIP code to census data.
   Logistic regression with adjustment for pre- and postoperative
   covariates estimated risk for associations between race/SES and
   pathologic outcomes. Cox proportional hazards models estimated risk for
   associations between race/SES and time to BCR. RESULTS: Black men were
   more likely to have lower SES than white men (P < .001). On multivariate
   analysis, race was not associated with PSM, but higher SES was
   associated with less PSM and fewer Gleason sum >= 7 pathologic tumors
   when SES was assessed by education, employment, or poverty (P trend <=
   .051) and income, employment, or poverty (P trend <= 0.059),
   respectively. Crude Cox models showed black men had higher BCR risk
   (hazards ratio = 1.20, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.38, P = .009) that
   persisted after adjustment for covariates including SES (hazards ratio
   >= 1.18, P <= .040). Higher SES measured by income and poverty were
   associated with less BCR, but only for black men (P trend <= .048).
   CONCLUSIONS: Even in an equal-access setting, higher SES predicted lower
   PSM risk, and race persisted in predicting BCR despite adjustment for
   SES. Low SES black patients may be at greatest risk for
   postprostatectomy BCR. Cancer 2012;118:4999-5007. (C) 2012 American

AB BACKGROUND: Despite substantial declines in cervical cancer mortality
   because of widespread screening, socioeconomic status (SES) disparities
   persist. The authors examined trends in cervical cancer mortality rates
   and the risk of late-stage diagnoses by SES. METHODS: Using data from
   the National Vital Statistics System, trends in age-standardized
   mortality rates among women ages 25 to 64 years (1993-2007) by education
   level (<= 12 years, 13-15 years, and >= 16 years) and race/ethnicity for
   non-Hispanic white (NHW) women and non-Hispanic black (NHB) women in 26
   states were assessed using log-linear regression. Rate ratios (RRs) and
   95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess disparities between
   those with <= 12 years versus >= 16 years of education during 1993 to
   1995 and 2005 to 2007. Avertable deaths were calculated by applying
   mortality rates from the most educated women to others in 48 states.
   Trends in the risk of late-stage diagnosis by race/ethnicity and
   insurance status were evaluated in the National Cancer Data Base.
   RESULTS: Declines in mortality were steepest for those with the highest
   education levels (3.2% per year among NHW women and 6.8% per year among
   NHB women). Consequently, the education disparity widened between the
   periods 1993 to 1995 and 2005 to 2007 from 3.1 (95% CI, 2.4-3.9) to 4.4
   (95% CI, 3.5-5.6) for NHW women and from 3.8 (95% CI, 2.0-7.0) to 5.6
   (95% CI, 3.1-10.0) for NHB women. The risk of late-stage diagnosis
   increased for uninsured versus privately insured women over time. During
   2007, 74% of cervical cancer deaths in the United States may have been
   averted by eliminating SES disparities. CONCLUSIONS: SES disparities in
   cervical cancer mortality and the risk of late-stage diagnosis increased
   over time. Most deaths in 2007 may have been averted by eliminating SES
   disparities. Cancer 2012;118:5110-6. (C) 2012 American Cancer Society.

AB BACKGROUND: Studies examining the impact of lower socioeconomic status
   (SES) on the outcomes of patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
   are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to clearly elucidate
   the association between SES, education, and clinical outcomes among
   patients with NSCLC. METHODS: The study population was derived from a
   consecutive, retrospective cohort of patients with NSCLC who received
   treatment within the Duke Health System between 1995 and 2007. SES
   determinants were based on the individual's census tract and
   corresponding 2000 Census data. Determinants included the percentage of
   the population living below poverty, the median household income, and
   the percentages of residents with at least a high school diploma and at
   least a bachelor's degree. The SES and educational variables were
   divided into quartiles. Statistical comparisons were performed using the
   25th and 75th percentiles. RESULTS: Individuals who resided in areas
   with a low median household income or in which a high percentage of
   residents were living below the poverty line had a shorter
   cancer-specific 6-year survival than individuals who resided in converse
   areas (P = .0167 and P = .0067, respectively). Those living in areas in
   which a higher percentage of residents achieved a high school diploma
   had improved disease outcomes compared with those living in areas in
   which a lower percentage attained a high school diploma (P = .0033). A
   survival advantage also was observed for inhabitants of areas in which a
   higher percentage of residents attained a bachelor's degree (P = .0455).
   CONCLUSIONS: Low SES was identified as an independent prognostic factor
   for poor survival in patients with both early and advanced stage NSCLC.
   Patients who lived in areas with high poverty levels, low median
   incomes, and low education levels had worse mortality. Cancer

AB Mexico is reaching universal health coverage in 2012. A national health
   insurance programme called Seguro Popular, introduced in 2003, is
   providing access to a package of comprehensive health services with
   financial protection for more than 50 million Mexicans previously
   excluded from insurance. Universal coverage in Mexico is synonymous with
   social protection of health. This report analyses the road to universal
   coverage along three dimensions of protection: against health risks, for
   patients through quality assurance of health care, and against the
   financial consequences of disease and injury. We present a conceptual
   discussion of the transition from labour-based social security to social
   protection of health, which implies access to effective health care as a
   universal right based on citizenship, the ethical basis of the Mexican
   reform. We discuss the conditions that prompted the reform, as well as
   its design and inception, and we describe the 9-year, evidence-driven
   implementation process, including updates and improvements to the
   original programme. The core of the report concentrates on the effects
   and impacts of the reform, based on analysis of all published and
   publically available scientific literature and new data. Evidence
   indicates that Seguro Popular is improving access to health services and
   reducing the prevalence of catastrophic and impoverishing health
   expenditures, e specially for the poor. Recent studies also show
   improvement in effective coverage. This research then addresses
   persistent challenges, including the need to translate financial
   resources into more effective, equitable and responsive health services.
   A next generation of reforms will be required and these include systemic
   measures to complete the reorganisation of the health system by
   functions. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of
   the Mexican quest to achieve universal health coverage and its relevance
   for other low-income and middle-income countries.

AB We examine if social and economic factors, fuelwood availability, market
   and media access are associated with owning a modified stove and
   variation in household emissions from biomass combustion, a significant
   environmental and health concern in rural India. We analyze
   cross-sectional household socio-economic data, and PM2.5 and particulate
   surface area concentration in household emissions from cookstoves (n =
   100). This data set combines household social and economic variables
   with particle emissions indexes associated with the household stove. The
   data are from the Foundation for Ecological Society, India, from a field
   study of household emissions. In our analysis, we find that less access
   to ready and free fuelwood and higher wealth are associated with owning
   a replacement/modified stove. We also find that additional kitchen
   ventilation is associated with a 12% reduction in particulate emissions
   concentration (p < 0.05), after we account for the type of stove used.
   We did not find a significant association between replacement/modified
   stove on household emissions when controlling for additional
   ventilation. Higher wealth and education are associated with having
   additional ventilation. Social caste, market and media access did not
   have any effect on the presence of replacement or modified stoves or
   additional ventilation. While the data available to us does not allow an
   examination of direct health outcomes from emissions variations, adverse
   environmental and health impacts of toxic household emissions are well
   established elsewhere in the literature. The value of this study is in
   its further examination of the role of social and economic factors and
   available fuelwood from commons in type of stove use, and additional
   ventilation, and their effect on household emissions. These associations
   are important since the two direct routes to improving household air
   quality among the poor are stove type and better ventilation.

AB Purpose: In this study, the authors examined the influences of selected
   social (gender, employment status, educational achievement level) and
   style variables (race of examiner, interview topic) on the production of
   African American English (AAE) by adults.
   Method: Participants were 50 African American men and women, ages 20-30
   years. The authors used Rapid and Anonymous Survey (RAS) methods to
   collect responses to questions on informal situational and formal
   message-oriented topics in a short interview with an unacquainted
   interlocutor.
   Results: Results revealed strong systematic effects for academic
   achievement, but not gender or employment status. Most features were
   used less frequently by participants with higher educational levels, but
   sharp declines in the usage of 5 specific features distinguished the
   participants differing in educational achievement. Strong systematic
   style effects were found for the 2 types of questions, but not race of
   addressee. The features that were most commonly used across
   participants-copula absence, variable subject-verb agreement, and
   appositive pronouns-were also the features that showed the greatest
   style shifting.
   Conclusions: The findings lay a foundation with mature speakers for
   rate-based and feature inventory methods recently shown to be
   informative for the study of child AAE and demonstrate the benefits of
   the RAS.

   cross-sectional study design, we assessed factors associated with uptake
   and adherence to intermittent preventive treatment for malaria in

   Kano, northern Nigeria (n=239). A total of 137 respondents (57.3%)
   reported receiving preventive antimalarials, but only 88 respondents
   (36.8%) [95% confidence interval (CI): 30.7-43.3%] reported ingesting
   pills in the clinic under supervision. Factors associated with adherence
   to IPTp after adjustment for potential confounding included: advanced
   maternal age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) (95%CI) = 2.1 (1.3-6.37)],
   higher educational attainment [AOR (95%CI) = 3.2 (1.32-6.72)], higher

   [AOR (95% CI) = 1.72 (1.24-3.91)], and use of insecticide-treated nets
   [AOR (95%CI) = 2.03 (1.13-3.26)]. There is a need for strengthening
   health systems and addressing cultural factors that impede efforts at
   expanding coverage of malaria prevention strategies in Nigeria.

AB Fifty years after serious scientific research began in the field of
   exobiology, and forty years after serious historical research began on
   the subject of extraterrestrial life, this paper identifies and examines
   some of the most important issues in the history, philosophy, and
   sociology of what is today known as astrobiology. As in the philosophy
   of science in general, and in the philosophies of particular sciences,
   critical issues in the philosophy and sociology of astrobiology are both
   stimulated and illuminated by history. Among those issues are (1)
   epistemological issues such as the status of astrobiology as a science,
   the problematic nature of evidence and inference, and the limits of
   science; (2) metaphysical/scientific issues, including the question of
   defining the fundamental concepts of life, mind, intelligence, and
   culture in a universal context; the role of contingency and necessity in
   the origin of these fundamental phenomena; and whether or not the
   universe is in some sense fine-tuned for life and perhaps biocentric;
   (3) societal issues such as the theological, ethical, and worldview
   impacts of the discovery of microbial or intelligent life; and the
   question of whether the search for extraterrestrial life should be
   pursued at all, and with what precautions; and (4) issues related to the
   sociology of scientific knowledge, including the diverse attitudes and
   assumptions of different scientific communities and different cultures
   to the problem of life beyond Earth, the public "will to believe," and
   the formation of the discipline of astrobiology. All these overlapping
   issues are framed by the concept of cosmic evolution-the 13.7 billion
   year Master Narrative of the Universe-which may result in a physical,
   biological, or postbiological universe and determine the long-term
   destiny of humanity.

   and social sciences along with astrobiologists to consider the cultural,
   societal, and psychological implications of astrobiology research and
   exploration. We began by convening a workshop to draft a research
   roadmap on astrobiology's societal implications and later formed a Focus
   Group on Astrobiology and Society under the auspices of the NASA
   Astrobiology Institute (NAI). Just as the Astrobiology Science Roadmap
   and various astrobiology science focus groups have helped researchers
   orient and understand their work across disciplinary contexts, our
   intent was to apply the same approach to examine areas beyond the
   physical and life sciences and expand interdisciplinary interaction and
   scholarly understanding. These efforts continue as an experiment in
   progress, with an open invitation to interested
   researchers-astrobiologists as well as scholars in the humanities and
   social sciences-to become involved in research, analysis, and proactive
   discussions concerning the potential impacts of astrobiology on society
   as well as the possible impacts of society on progress in astrobiology.

AB This analysis examines the social construction of authority,
   credibility, and legitimacy for exobiology/astrobiology and, in
   comparison, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI),
   considering English-language conceptions of these endeavors in
   scientific culture and popular culture primarily in the United States.
   The questions that define astrobiology as a scientific endeavor are
   multidisciplinary in nature, and this endeavor is broadly appealing to
   public audiences as well as to the scientific community. Thus, it is
   useful to examine astrobiology in culture-in scientific culture,
   official culture, and popular culture. A researcher may explore science
   in culture, science as culture, by analyzing its rhetoric, the primary
   means that people use to construct their social realities-their cultural
   environment, as it were. This analysis follows this path, considering
   scientific and public interest in astrobiology and SETI and focusing on
   scientific and official constructions of the two endeavors. This
   analysis will also consider whether and how scientific and public
   conceptions of astrobiology and SETI, which are related but at the same
   time separate endeavors, converge or diverge and whether and how these
   convergences or divergences affect the scientific authority,
   credibility, and legitimacy of these endeavors.

AB The authors examined the impact of cumulative neighborhood risk of
   psychosocial stress on allostatic load (AL) among adolescents as a
   mechanism through which life stress, including neighborhood conditions,
   may affect health and health inequities. They conducted multilevel
   analyses, weighted for sampling and propensity score-matched, among
   adolescents aged 1220 years in the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey (19992006). Individuals (first level, n 11,886) were
   nested within families/households (second level, n 6,696) and then
   census tracts (third level, n 2,191) for examination of the contextual
   effect of cumulative neighborhood risk environment on AL. Approximately
   35 of adolescents had 2 or more biomarkers of AL. A significant amount
   of variance in AL was explained at the neighborhood level. The
   likelihood of having a high AL was approximately 10 higher for
   adolescents living in medium-cumulative-risk neighborhoods (adjusted
   odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95 confidence interval (CI): 1.08, 1.09), 28
   higher for those living in high-risk neighborhoods (adjusted OR 1.28, 95
   CI: 1.27, 1.30), and 69 higher for those living in very-high-risk
   neighborhoods (adjusted OR 1.69, 95 CI: 1.68, 1.70) as compared with
   adolescents living in low-risk areas. Effect modification was observed
   by both individual- and neighborhood-level sociodemographic factors.
   These findings offer support for the hypothesis that neighborhood risks
   may culminate in a range of biologically mediated negative health
   outcomes detectable in adolescents.

AB The importance of ethnic diversity in determining social outcomes and
   reducing generalized cooperation is increasingly well documented. Theory
   suggests that cooperation in human groups may depend on reciprocal
   altruism and frequency of contact, yet these factors have not been
   linked with ethnic diversity. This study explores how fine-scale
   components of cooperation-social exclusivity and reciprocity-relate to
   broad-scale social conditions-ethnic diversity and ethnic
   stratification-in villages in Tamil Nadu's Palani hills. Both ethnic
   diversity and ethnic stratification are associated with declines in
   indirect reciprocity, although stratification has a larger effect. In
   addition, stratification is linked to increased social exclusivity.
   Moreover, measures of direct reciprocity in the form of agricultural
   labor exchanges are uncorrelated with both diversity and stratification.
   These results imply (1) that ethnic stratification is more detrimental
   to cooperation than is ethnic diversity, (2) that social exclusivity and
   ethnic stratification are mutually reinforcing, and (3) that direct
   reciprocity is more robust to cooperative failure across ethnic
   boundaries than is indirect reciprocity. These results confirm and
   extend current theory of human cooperative regimes and may be of value
   for community development in multiethnic settings.

AB Adolescent parents and their children are at increased risk for adverse
   short- and long-term health and social outcomes. Effective interventions
   are needed to support these young families.
   We studied the evidence base and found a dearth of rigorously evaluated
   programs. Strategies from successful interventions are needed to inform
   both intervention design and policies affecting these adolescents. The
   lack of rigorous evaluations may be attributable to inadequate emphasis
   on and sufficient funding for evaluation, as well as to challenges
   encountered by program evaluators working with this population.
   More rigorous program evaluations are urgently needed to provide
   scientifically sound guidance for programming and policy decisions.

AB Purpose: Although eliminating health disparities by race, ethnicity, and
   socioeconomic status (SES) is a top public health priority
   internationally and in the United States, weight-related racial/ethnic
   and SES disparities persist among adults and children in the United
   States. Few studies have examined how these disparities have changed
   over time; these studies are limited by the reliance on rate differences
   or ratios to measure disparities. We sought to advance existing research
   by using a set of disparity metrics on both the absolute and relative
   scales to examine trends in childhood obesity disparities over time.
   Methods: Data from 7066 children, ages 2 to 18 years, in the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys were used to explore trends in
   racial/ethnic and SES disparities in pediatric obesity from 2001 to 2010
   using a set of different disparity metrics.
   Results: Racial/ethnic and SES-related disparities in pediatric obesity
   did not change significantly from 2001 to 2010 and remain significant.
   Conclusions: Disparities in obesity have not improved during the past
   decade. The use of different disparity metrics may lead to different
   conclusions with respect to how disparities have changed over time,
   highlighting the need to evaluate disparities using a variety of
   metrics. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: To determine the role of type, timing, and cumulative childhood
   hardships on age at menarche in a prospective cohort study.
   Methods: A longitudinal analysis was undertaken of 4524 female
   participants of the National Child Development Study cohort (1958-2003).
   Six types of childhood hardships were identified with a factor analysis
   methodology. Paternal absence/low involvement in childhood was an a
   priori hardship. Retrospective reports of abuse in childhood also were
   explored in relation to age at menarche. Generalized logit regression
   analyses explored the impact of type, timing, and cumulative hardships
   on age at menarche (<= 11, 12-13, >= 14 years).
   Results: Cumulative childhood hardships were associated with a graded
   increase in risk for later menarche with adjusted odds ratio [AOR] of
   1.37 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.10-1.70), 1.50 (95% CI,
   1.18-1.91), and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.29-1.92) among those with two, three,
   and four or more adversities, respectively. More than two hardships in
   early life had the strongest association with late menarche (AOR, 2.32;
   95% CI, 1.12-4.80). Sexual abuse was most strongly associated with early
   menarche (AOR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.40-4.81).
   Conclusions: Cumulative childhood hardships increased risk for later age
   at menarche. Child abuse was associated with both early and late
   menarche, although associations varied by type of abuse. (C) 2012

AB Purpose: This study examines the association between marriage and
   colorectal endoscopy exam, and whether this association varies by gender
   and financial benefits of marriage including improved access to health
   insurance and pooled family income. Methods: Representative survey data
   of the non-institutionalized United States population were used from the
   2000, 2005, and 2008 National Health Interview Survey. Analyses targeted
   persons 50-85 years of age without a personal history of cancer and with
   complete information on all study variables (n = 21,760). Multivariate
   logistic regression was used to model marital status differences in the
   probability of undergoing a colorectal endoscopy exam with interaction
   effects used to model variation over time by gender, health insurance,
   and poverty level. Results: Married persons were more likely than
   unmarried persons to report ever having undergone a colorectal endoscopy
   exam (odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.29),
   and the difference between married and unmarried persons in the
   probability of undergoing a colorectal endoscopy exam remained stable
   over time. Married persons were more likely than unmarried persons to
   report having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam within the past 10
   years (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15-1.95). For each survey year, married men
   were significantly more likely than women and unmarried men to report
   having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. For example, in 2008, 56%
   of married men reported having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam,
   compared to 49% of unmarried men, 52% of married women, and 50% of
   unmarried women. Among persons with health insurance, married persons
   were significantly more likely than unmarried persons to have undergone
   a colorectal endoscopy exam. Among persons who were poor, there was no
   difference by marital status in the likelihood of having undergone a
   colorectal endoscopy exam. However, among persons who were not poor,
   married persons were more likely than unmarried persons to have
   undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. Conclusion: Given that colorectal
   endoscopy exams are a potentially life-saving procedure, persistently
   higher uptake of colorectal endoscopy for married persons over time may
   be an important health promoting benefit of marriage. Therefore,
   clinicians and policy makers should focus on improving the use of cancer
   prevention services among unmarried persons. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Folk wisdom asserts that "the eyes are the window to the soul," and
   empirical science corroborates a prominent role for the eyes in the
   communication of emotion. Herein we examine variation in the ability to
   "read" the eyes of others as a function of social group membership,
   employing a widely used emotional state decoding task: "Reading the Mind
   in Eyes." This task has documented impaired emotional state decoding
   across racial groups, with cross-race performance on par with that
   previously reported as a function of autism spectrum disorders. The
   present study extended this work by examining the moderating role of
   social identity in such impairments. For college students more highly
   identified with their university, cross-race performance differences
   were not found for judgments of "same-school" eyes but remained for
   "rival-school" eyes. These findings suggest that impaired emotional
   state decoding across groups may thus be more amenable to remediation
   than previously realized.

   negative predictors of intrapersonal and eudaimonic well-being in the
   United States and were negative predictors of interpersonal and

AB The management of residential landscapes occurs within a complex
   socio-ecological system linking household decision-making with
   ecological properties, multi-scalar human drivers, and the legacy
   effects of past management. Conventional wisdom suggests that
   resource-intensive turf grass yards are the most common landscaping
   outcome, resulting in a presumed homogeneous set of residential
   landscaping practices throughout North America. We examine this
   homogenization thesis through an interview-based, cross-site study of
   residential landscape management in Boston, Phoenix, and Miami. Counter
   to the homogeneity thesis, we find that yard management practices often
   exhibit heterogeneity, for example, in groundcover choice or use of
   chemical inputs. The degree of heterogeneity in management practices
   varies according to the scale of analysis, and is the outcome of a range
   of constraints and opportunities to which households respond differently
   depending on their existing yard and landscaping preferences. This study
   highlights the importance of multi-scalar and cross-site analyses of
   decision-making in socio-ecological systems, and presents opportunities
   for longitudinal and cross-site research to examine the extent to which
   homogeneity is actually present in the management of residential
   landscapes over time and in diverse places.

AB Background Current estimates from objective accelerometer data suggest
   that American adults are sedentary for similar to 7.7h/day.
   Historically, sedentary behaviour was conceptualized as one end of the
   physical activity spectrum but is increasingly being viewed as a
   behaviour distinct from physical activity.
   Methods Prospective studies examining the associations between screen
   time (watching television, watching videos and using a computer) and
   sitting time and fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) were
   identified. These prospective studies relied on self-reported sedentary
   behaviour.
   Results The majority of prospective studies of screen time and sitting
   time has shown that greater sedentary time is associated with an
   increased risk of fatal and non-fatal CVD. Compared with the lowest
   levels of sedentary time, risk estimates ranged up to 1.68 for the
   highest level of sitting time and 2.25 for the highest level of screen
   time after adjustment for a series of covariates, including measures of
   physical activity. For six studies of screen time and CVD, the summary
   hazard ratio per 2-h increase was 1.17 (95% CI: 1.13-1.20). For two
   studies of sitting time, the summary hazard ratio per 2-h increase was
   1.05 (95% CI: 1.01-1.09).
   Conclusions Future prospective studies using more objective measures of
   sedentary behaviour might prove helpful in quantifying better the risk
   between sedentary behaviour and CVD morbidity and mortality. This
   budding science may better shape future guideline development as well as
   clinical and public health interventions to reduce the amount of
   sedentary behaviour in modern societies.

AB Background. The role of socioeconomic factors that affect survival,
   particularly for hepatocellular cancer (HCC), has yet to be fully
   analyzed. This study attempts to elucidate those racial and
   socioeconomic factors that affect differences in survival for patients
   with HCC.
   Methods. In a retrospective cohort study of 206 patients with HCC
   diagnosed in an inner-city urban center from 2003 to 2011, outcomes by
   race (African Americans versus white) were analyzed. Additional
   attention was paid to socioeconomic factors. Continuous variables were
   compared with the Student t-test, and categorical variables were
   compared with the chi(2) or Fisher exact test. Multivariate analysis was
   conducted using a logistic regression model. Patient death and survival
   data were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards.
   Results. Comparison of 138 white and 68 African-American patients
   revealed that African-American patients were, more likely to present
   with larger tumor size at the time of diagnosis (4.7 vs 3.7 cm; P <
   .05). African-American patients were also more likely to be intravenous
   drug users (25.4% vs 11.6%; P < .05) and have cirrhosis from hepatitis C
   (81% vs 60%; P < .01). African-American patients were less likely to
   have private insurance compared with white patients (68% vs 92%; P <
   .01). Despite these findings in our inner-city practice, there was no
   difference in liver transplantation rates or survival rates between the
   2 groups.
   Conclusion. Despite presentation with less-favorable tumor
   characteristics, African-American patients are able to achieve survival
   that is comparable with their white counterparts when treated in a
   program that is attuned to the challenges faced by their specific
   population. (Surgery, 2012;152:661-7.)

AB Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality rates vary
   across race/ethnicity. Socioeconomic status (SES) also influences CRC
   rates; however, these associations might be inconsistent across
   racial/ethnic groups and tumor subsite. We examined associations between
   area-level SES and CRC incidence and mortality in a population-based
   registry study of non-Hispanic Whites, African Americans, Hispanics, and
   Asians/Pacific Islanders from California.
   Methods: Data on 52,608 incident CRC cases (1998-2002) and 14,515 CRC
   deaths (1999-2001) aged >= 50 years were obtained from the California
   Cancer Registry. Based on 2000 U. S. Census data, each cancer case and
   death was assigned a multidimensional census tract-level SES index.
   SES-specific quintiles of CRC incidence and mortality rates, incidence
   rate ratios (IRR) and mortality rate ratios, and 95% confidence
   intervals (CI) were estimated. Analyses were stratified by anatomical
   site, including left- versus right-sided tumors, race/ethnicity, and
   stage of disease.
   Results: Overall CRC incidence and SES did not show a clear association,
   yet patterns of associations varied across tumor subsite and
   race/ethnicity. Positive associations between SES and CRC incidence were
   found in Hispanics [ SES Q5 v. Q1:IRR = 1.54, CI = 1.39-1.69],
   irrespective of the subsite. For Whites [SES Q5 v. Q1: IRR = 0.80, CI =
   0.77-0.83], and African Americans [SES Q5 v. Q1: IRR = 0.83, CI =
   0.70-0.97] inverse associations were observed, predominantly for
   left-sided tumors. Mortality rates declined with increasing SES in
   Whites, whereas in Hispanics mortality rates significantly increased
   with SES.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that SES differences in CRC incidence and
   mortality vary considerably across anatomical subsite and
   race/ethnicity.
   Impact: Studies combining area-and individual-level SES information are
   warranted. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 21(10); 1814-22. (c) 2012

AB Objective: To evaluate the association of three levels of gainful
   employment with the risk of mortality after traumatic spinal cord injury
   (SCI) while controlling for known predictors of mortality status
   (including education and income).
   Study design: Prospective cohort study
   Setting: A total of 20 federally funded SCI Model Systems of care in the
   United States.
   Methods: Participants included 7955 adults with traumatic SCI.
   Preliminary assessments were conducted between 1995 and 2006. Mortality
   status was determined by the Social Security Death Index (1308 deaths).
   A two-stage logistic regression model was used to estimate the chance of
   dying in any given year. Life expectancy was calculated under different
   economic assumptions.
   Results: Compared with those who were working 30 + h per week, the odds
   of mortality was 1.37 for those who worked 1-29 h and 1.67 for those who
   were unemployed. The addition of gainful employment only modestly
   reduced the effects of household income and education, both of which
   remained significant. For instance, the odds of mortality for household
   income (referent $75 000 +) decreased from 1.50 to 1.38 for $25 000-$75
   000 and from 2.10 to 1.82 for <$25 000. Life expectancy varied widely
   depending on socioeconomic characteristics more than doubling under
   certain assumptions.
   Conclusion: Substantial variation in mortality is attributable to
   employment, above and beyond the effects of previously established
   demographic, injury and socioeconomic predictors. Although some excess
   mortality may be the inevitable consequence of SCI, risk is
   substantially increased with poor socioeconomic characteristics. Spinal

   Agriculture's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,
   and Children (WIC) food packages in 2009 had the potential to expand
   neighborhood FV availability.
   Purpose: This study examined changes in availability and selection of
   commonly consumed and culturally specific FV at authorized retailers
   (WIC vendors) before and after implementation of the revised WIC food
   packages.
   Methods: Quasi-experimental, one-group design with two pre-policy
   observations and one post-policy observation. Trained observers assessed
   a list of fresh, frozen, and canned FV at each vendor in seven northern
   Illinois counties. Eight indices of FV availability and selection were
   derived. Multiple regression estimated relationships. Data were
   collected in 2008-2010 and analyzed in 2011.
   Results: Overall, availability and selection of commonly consumed fresh
   FV and availability of African-American culturally specific fresh FV
   improved after implementation of the new policy. Modest improvements in
   the overall availability of canned low-sodium vegetables and frozen FV
   were observed. Changes differed by vendor type (large vendor, small
   vendor, and pharmacy). Changes in availability or selection did not
   differ by neighborhood characteristics (population density, median
   household income, racial/ethnic composition).
   Conclusions: Expansion of WIC foods was associated with small positive
   externalities on the food environment. Larger subsidies to create more
   demand and more-substantial stocking requirements for retailers may
   yield significantly larger improvements and thus warrant further
   investigation. Approaches targeting rural, low-income, and racial/ethnic
   minority neighborhoods also may be needed. (Am J Prev Med

AB Attitudes to natural foods and genetically modified organisms, assessed
   by multiple choice items, definitions of natural, and free associations
   to the word "natural" were determined for a representative sample of
   adults from France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, the U.K., and the
   U.S.A. Individuals in all countries had a very positive attitude to
   natural. There is a surprising degree of similarity in conceptions of
   natural across the six countries, with a focus of food (and beverages)
   as central to the idea of natural, and links to the ideas of biological,
   healthy, plants, and the environment. Demographic differences (e.g.,
   sex, education) were also small. Analysis of definitions and free
   associations suggests, and other data confirm, that across all
   countries, natural is defined principally by the absence of certain
   "negative" features (e.g., additives, pollution, human intervention),
   rather than the presence of certain positive features. Across all
   countries, plants, and in particular, plant foods, are more frequent
   exemplars of "natural" than are animals, with green the dominant color
   associated with natural. There is opposition to genetic engineering,
   which can be thought to be the opposite of natural, in all countries,
   but it is highest in continental Europe and lowest in the U.S.A. (C)

AB Background Recently, late-life disability rates have declined in several
   countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation, but no
   national-level trend analysis for England has been available. The
   authors provide such analysis, including measures both early and late in
   the disablement process, and the authors investigate the extent to which
   temporal trends are associated with population changes in socioeconomic
   position (SEP).
   Methods The authors fit logistic models of trends in self-reports and
   nurse measures of 16 health indicators, based on cross-sectional data
   from those aged 65 years and older from the 1992 to 2007 Health Survey
   for England.
   Results Overall, prevalence rates of limitations in seeing, hearing and
   usual activities declined (p < 0.05); ever smoking, measured high blood
   pressure, high cholesterol, and high C reactive protein decreased (p <
   0.05); and the proportion with limitations in self-care activities
   remained stable. But obesity and limitations in walking 200 yards and
   climbing stairs increased (p < 0.05). Increases over time in education
   and non-manual social class membership were associated with declines in
   smoking, C reactive protein and problems with usual activities. Had the
   changes in SEP not occurred, the increases in problems walking and
   climbing would have been greater. People with less education or of
   manual social classes experienced relatively worse trends for hearing,
   mobility functions and usual activities. The opposite was true for
   seeing.
   Conclusions Recent trends in late-life health and functioning in England
   have been mixed. A better understanding of which specific activities
   pose challenges, how the environment in which activities are conducted
   influences functioning and the causes of relatively worse trends for
   some SEP groups is needed.

AB Little is known about how best to target cardiovascular health promotion
   messages to minorities. This study describes key lessons that emerged
   from a community and culture-centered approach to developing a
   multimedia, coronary heart disease (CHD) patient education program (PEP)
   for medically underserved South Asian immigrants.
   The prototype PEP integrated the surface structures (e.g. language) and
   deeper structures (e.g. explanatory models (EMs), values) of South
   Asians' socio-cultural context. Seven focus groups and 13 individual
   interviews were used to investigate South Asians' reactions and obtain
   qualitative feedback after viewing the culturally targeted PEP.
   Qualitative data were organized into emergent thematic constructs.
   Participants (n = 56) mean age was 51 years and 48 % were Hindi
   speakers. Community members had a strong, negative reaction to some of
   the targeted messages, "This statement is a bold attack. You are
   pin-pointing one community." Other important themes emerged from focus
   groups and interviews about the PEP: 1) it did not capture the
   community's heterogeneity; 2) did not sufficiently incorporate South
   Asians' EMs of CHD; and 3) did not address economic barriers to CHD
   prevention. Feedback was used to revise the PEP.
   A community and culture-centered approach to developing cardiovascular
   health promotion messages revealed tensions between the researcher's
   vantage point of "cultural targeting" and the community's perceptions
   and reactions to these messages. Engaging communities in every phase of
   message design, incorporating their EMs, recognizing community
   heterogeneity, and addressing economic and structural barriers, are
   critical steps to ensuring that health promotion messages reach their
   intended audience and achieve true cultural appropriateness.

AB Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) affects 1 in 2500 Americans and is
   associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The recent
   development of SLE quality measures provides an opportunity to
   understand gaps in clinical care and to identify modifiable factors
   associated with variations in quality.
   To evaluate performance on SLE quality measures as well as differences
   in quality of care by demographic, socioeconomic, disease, and health
   system characteristics.
   Cross-sectional analysis of data derived from the Lupus Outcomes Study,
   a prospective, longitudinal study of 814 individuals. Principal data
   collection was through annual structured telephone surveys between
   2009-2010. Data on 13 SLE quality measures was collected. We used
   regression models to estimate demographic, socioeconomic, disease, and
   health system characteristics associated with performance on individual
   and overall quality measures.
   Performance on each quality measure and overall performance on all
   measures for which participants were eligible (pass rate).
   Participants were eligible for a mean of five measures (range 2-12).
   Performance varied from 29 % (assessment of cardiovascular risk factors)
   to 90 % (sun avoidance counseling). The overall pass rate was 65 % (95 %
   CI 64 %, 65 %). In unadjusted analyses, younger age, minority
   race/ethnicity, poverty, shorter disease duration, fewer physician
   visits, and lack of health insurance, were associated with lower pass
   rates. Receiving care in public sector managed care organizations was
   associated with higher pass rates. After adjustment, younger age, having
   fewer physician visits and lacking health insurance remained
   significantly associated with lower performance; receiving care in
   public sector managed care organizations remained associated with higher
   performance.
   We identified a number of gaps in clinical care for SLE. Factors
   associated with the health care system, including presence and type of
   health insurance, were the primary determinants of performance on
   quality measures in SLE.

AB It is unclear how lack of health insurance or otherwise being
   underinsured contributes to observed racial disparities in health
   outcomes related to cardiovascular disease.
   To determine the relative risk of death associated with insurance and
   race after hospital admission for an acute cardiovascular event.
   Prospective cohort study in three hospitals in Maryland representing
   different demographics between 1993 and 2007.
   Patients with an incident admission who were either white or black, and
   had either private insurance, state-based insurance or were uninsured.
   4,908 patients were diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, 6,759
   with coronary atherosclerosis, and 1,293 with stroke.
   Demographic and clinical patient-level data were collected from an
   administrative billing database and neighborhood household income was
   collected from the 2000 US Census. The outcome of all-cause mortality
   was collected from the Social Security Death Master File.
   In an analysis adjusted for race, disease severity, location,
   neighborhood household income among other confounders, being
   underinsured was associated with an increased risk of death after
   myocardial infarction (relative hazard, 1.31 [95 % CI: 1.09, 1.59]),
   coronary atherosclerosis (relative hazard, 1.50 [95 % CI: 1.26, 1.80])
   or stroke (relative hazard, 1.25 [95 % CI: 0.91, 1.72]). Black race was
   not associated with an increased risk of death after myocardial
   infarction (relative hazard, 1.03 [95 % CI: 0.85, 1.24]), or after
   stroke (relative hazard, 1.18 [95 % CI: 0.86, 1.61]) and was associated
   with a decreased risk of death after coronary atherosclerosis (relative
   hazard, 0.82 [95 % CI: 0.69, 0.98]).
   Race was not associated with an increased risk of death, before or after
   adjustment. Being underinsured was strongly associated with death among
   those admitted with myocardial infarction, or a coronary atherosclerosis
   event. Our results support growing evidence implicating insurance status
   and socioeconomic factors as important drivers of health disparities,
   and potentially racial disparities.

AB In this article, I ask for whom is our teaching developed? Although we
   typically think that it is developed for our students, there appears to
   be a considerable gap between how our curriculum, especially
   Introductory Sociology is organized, and what we know about current
   college students. Drawing on data on enrollment in sociology and overall
   in colleges and universities along with recent scholarly portraits of
   college students by Nathan (2005), Clydesdale (2007), and Arum and Roska
   (2011), I offer the following argument: (1) Our "students" are primarily
   those who take Introductory Sociology, and this class, indeed, is our
   public face for most nonacademics; (2) given where U.S. college students
   matriculate, all too often, Introductory Sociology is likely being
   taught by someone not as well connected as we might like to our main
   professional organization; (3) comprehensive textbooks dominate the
   Introductory Sociology market and contain more information that can
   reasonably be covered in one semester; (4) college students are
   "practical credentialists" who spend relatively little time outside of
   the classroom on their studies; and (5) whether or not we as
   sociologists agree on what needs to be covered in Introductory Sociology
   and other courses, we have derived these understandings among ourselves,
   paying little attention to what skills and knowledge our students want
   and/or need. If Introductory Sociology really is our public face, we
   clearly need to spend a considerable amount of time in making sure that
   this is how we want to be seen.

   consistent between the two delivery formats. The investigators compare
   student satisfaction and student performance on midterm exams and an

   is used to evaluate the effect of the different course settings,
   independent of a number of demographic and control variables. Results
   indicate that differences in student performance between the two
   settings may be accounted for by the presence of a selection effect and
   that student satisfaction does not significantly differ across the two

   quantitative data, gathered from students enrolled in three sections of

   enhancing students' sociological imaginations by helping students see
   how their own consumption habits are shaped by larger social forces and
   how they, along with most Americans, tend toward overconsumption. To a
   more limited extent, it may help enhance cognitive understanding of
   consumption. Teaching about consumption in general, and the Not Buying
   It project in particular, offers instructors an excellent pedagogical
   means by which students can acquire a sociological imagination,
   reinforces key sociological principles, and links to broader goals

   material within the context of their everyday lived experiences.
   Examples from projects and a content analysis of 87 anonymous reflection

   socioeconomic status (SES). Inflammation may be one pathway through
   which SES influences health. Using 2658 participants in the Coronary
   Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study, we examine
   whether two measures of SES assessed at baseline (mean age, 32 +/- 4
   years)-years of education and household income-predict change in
   C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations over the course of 13 years. We
   also examine whether four health-related behaviors-smoking, fruit and
   vegetable consumption, physical activity, and alcohol
   consumption-mediate the prospective association of SES with CRP. Both
   higher education and household income predicted smaller increases in CRP
   over the 13 years of follow-up independent of age, sex, race, CARDIA
   center, body mass, medical diagnoses, medications, and hormone use
   (among women). Associations did not differ by race or sex. When examined
   in separate analyses, smoking and fruit and vegetable intake each
   accounted for a significant proportion of the respective effects of
   education and household income on CRP change, and physical activity a
   significant proportion of the effect of household income. These findings
   suggest that poor health behaviors among persons of lower socioeconomic
   status can have long-term effects on inflammation. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   behaviors. For physical activity, a similar trend emerged, but support
   variables did not explain any variance above that explained by
   demographic variables. These findings offer a unique contribution to the
   literature, as they suggest that certain types of supportive behaviors
   are important in encouraging positive health behaviors.

AB Benefits of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) depend on consistent HIV care
   attendance. However, appointment non-adherence (i.e. missed
   appointments) is common even in programs that reduce financial barriers.
   Demographic, health/treatment, and psychosocial contributors to
   appointment non-adherence were examined among men who have sex with men
   (MSM) attending HIV primary care. Participants (n = 503) completed
   questionnaires, and HIV biomarker data were extracted from medical
   records. At 12 months, records were reviewed to assess HIV primary care
   appointment non-adherence. Among MSM, 31.2% missed without cancellation
   at least one appointment during 12-month study period. Independent
   predictors (P < 0.05) were: low income (OR = 1.87); African American (OR
   = 3.00) and Hispanic/Latino (OR = 4.31) relative to non-Hispanic White;
   depression (OR = 2.01); and low expectancy for appointments to
   prevent/treat infection (OR = 2.38), whereas private insurance (OR =
   0.48) and older age (OR = 0.94) predicted lower risk. Low self-efficacy
   predicted marginal risk (OR = 2.74, P = 0.10). The following did not
   independently predict risk for non-adherence: education, relationship
   status, general health, time since HIV diagnosis, ART history,
   post-traumatic stress disorder, HIV stigma, or supportive clinic staff.
   Appointment non-adherence is prevalent, particularly among younger and
   racial/ethnic minority MSM. Socioeconomic barriers, depression and low
   appointment expectancy and self-efficacy may be targets to increase care
   engagement.

AB Individuals with schizophrenia have significant deficits in premorbid
   social and academic adjustment compared to individuals with
   non-psychotic diagnoses. However, it is unclear how severity and
   developmental trajectory of premorbid maladjustment compare across
   psychotic disorders. This study examined the association between
   premorbid functioning (in childhood, early adolescence, and late
   adolescence) and psychotic disorder diagnosis in a first-episode sample
   of 105 individuals: schizophrenia (n = 68), schizoaffective disorder (n
   = 22), and mood disorder with psychotic features (n = 15). Social and
   academic maladjustment was assessed using the Cannon-Spoor Premorbid
   Adjustment Scale. Worse social functioning in late adolescence was
   associated with higher odds of schizophrenia compared to odds of either
   schizoaffective disorder or mood disorder with psychotic features,
   independently of child and early adolescent maladjustment. Greater
   social dysfunction in childhood was associated with higher odds of
   schizoaffective disorder compared to odds of schizophrenia. Premorbid
   decline in academic adjustment was observed for all groups, but did not
   predict diagnosis at any stage of development. Results suggest that
   social functioning is disrupted in the premorbid phase of both
   schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, but remains fairly stable in
   mood disorders with psychotic features. Disparities in the onset and
   time course of social dysfunction suggest important developmental
   differences between schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. (C) 2012

   framed by a health-services conceptual model, we examine the extent that
   culture-specific versus common characteristics are associated with
   treatment seeking and drinking outcome. Swedish (n = 997) and U.S. (n =
   501) alcohol-dependent individuals were interviewed at baseline and
   1-year (n = 635 and n = 384 respectively). Both studies gathered
   comparable background, help-seeking, and drinking data. Regression
   models tested predictors of 1-year follow-up drinking defined as
   abstinence or moderate drinking versus heavy drinking. Swedish
   individuals were older and had social networks comprised mostly of
   substance abusers compared to U.S. individuals who reported higher
   problem severity and greater drug involvement. Whereas U.S. individuals
   reported greater prior mutual-help attendance, Swedish individuals
   reported greater prior treatment involvement. Better 1-year drinking
   outcomes were reported by women, younger age groups and those with an
   abstinence goal in both samples. Cultural and institutional differences
   were apparent. For example, with Swedish individuals having a mostly
   non-using network predicted better outcomes, whereas lower problem
   severity was a predictor for U.S. individuals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Previous studies on the Chinese suicide found some life
   events prior to the suicide different from those in the West, but there
   is a lack of summary of the Chinese life event patterns to better
   understand the effects of the social structure on Chinese suicide.
   Aim: We tried to identify the life events that precede the Chinese rural
   youth suicides and compare them with what are found in the West, so as
   to find the patterns that are particularly true in the Chinese culture
   contexts.
   Methods: Suicide cases were investigated with a psychological autopsy
   study in rural China, and local community living controls were also
   interviewed with the same protocol. Results: We collapsed 64 negative
   life events into six categories: (1) Marriage/Love, (2) Family/Home, (3)
   Work/Business, (4) Health/Hospital, (5) Law/Legal, (6)
   Friend/Relationship. About 92.3% of the suicides studied had experienced
   at least one type of negative life events. The three most common
   negative life events categories in the past one year were Family/Home
   (60.7%), Health/Hospital (53.8%) and Marriage/Love (51.3%) in the rural
   young suicide victims.
   Conclusions: Among the negative life events, those related to family
   relations, love affairs, and marital issues were most likely to precede
   a suicide of rural suicides in China, and it is especially true of rural
   young women. Family is an important social institution in rural China
   for suicide prevention efforts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   empirical research investigating what it means to experience
   humiliation. We studied the affective characteristics of humiliation,
   comparing the emotional experience of intergroup humiliation to two
   other emotions humiliation is often confused with: anger and shame. The
   defining characteristics of humiliation were low levels of guilt and
   high levels of other-directed outrage (like anger and unlike shame), and
   high levels of powerlessness (like shame and unlike anger). Reasons for
   the similarities and differences of humiliation with anger and shame are
   discussed in terms of perceptions of undeserved treatment and injustice.
   Implications for understanding the behavioral consequences of
   humiliation and future work investigating the role of humiliation in

AB Background: Increasingly studies have identified socioeconomic factors
   adversely affecting healthcare outcomes for a multitude of diseases. To
   date, however, there has not been a study correlating socioeconomic
   details from nationwide databases on the prevalence of advanced coronary
   artery disease. We seek to identify whether socioeconomic factors
   contribute to advanced coronary artery disease prevalence in the United
   States.
   Methods and Findings: State specific prevalence data was queried form
   the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample for 2009. Patients
   undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass
   graft were identified as principal procedures. Non-cardiac related
   procedures, lung lobectomy and hip replacement (partial and total) were
   identified and used as control groups. Information regarding prevalence
   was then merged with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance
   System, the largest, on-going telephone health survey system tracking
   health conditions and risk behaviors in the United States. Pearson's
   correlation coefficient was calculated for individual socioeconomic
   variables including employment status, level of education, and household
   income. Household income and education level were inversely correlated
   with the prevalence of percutaneous coronary angioplasty (-0.717;
   -0.787) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (-0.541; -0.618). This
   phenomenon was not seen in the non-cardiac procedure control groups. In
   multiple linear regression analysis, socioeconomic factors were
   significant predictors of coronary artery bypass graft and percutaneous
   transluminal coronary angioplasty (p < 0.001 and p=0.005, respectively).
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status is related to the prevalence of
   advanced coronary artery disease as measured by the prevalence of
   percutaneous coronary angioplasty and coronary artery bypass graft
   surgery.

AB Background: Childhood socioeconomic status is linked to adult
   cardiovascular disease and disease risk. One proposed pathway involves
   inflammation due to exposure to a stress-inducing neighborhood
   environment. Whether CRP, a marker of systemic inflammation, is
   associated with stressful neighborhood conditions among children is
   unknown.
   Methods and Results: The sample included 385 children 5-18 years of age
   from 255 households and 101 census tracts. Multilevel logistic
   regression analyses compared children and adolescents with CRP levels >3
   mg/L to those with levels <= 3 mg/L across neighborhood environments.
   Among children living in neighborhoods (census tracts) in the upper
   tertile of poverty or crime, 18.6% had elevated CRP levels, in contrast
   to 7.9% of children living in neighborhoods with lower levels of poverty
   and crime. Children from neighborhoods with the highest levels of either
   crime or poverty had 2.7 (95% CI: 1.2-6.2) times the odds of having
   elevated CRP levels when compared to children from other neighborhoods,
   independent of adiposity, demographic and behavioral differences.
   Conclusions: Children living in neighborhoods with high levels of
   poverty or crime had elevated CRP levels compared to children from other
   neighborhoods. This result is consistent with a psychosocial pathway
   favoring early development of cardiovascular risk that involves chronic
   stress from exposure to socially- and physically-disordered
   neighborhoods characteristic of poverty.

AB Children of depressed mothers have impaired cognitive, behavioral, and
   health outcomes from infancy through adulthood, and are especially at
   risk when maternal depression persists over multiple years. But there
   are several important limitations to our current descriptive knowledge
   about maternal depression, especially depression among unmarried
   mothers. Data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a
   recent cohort of children born in urban areas to mostly unmarried
   parents (N = 4,366), was used to examine the prevalence and correlates
   of maternal depression when children were about 1, 3, 5, and 9 years
   old. Results show that, at any given survey wave, between 16% and 21% of
   mothers reported depression. Nearly two-fifths (38%) of mothers reported
   depression at least once during the eight-year period, and 7% reported
   persistent depression (depression at three or four of the four survey
   waves). Employment status, relationship status, and fathers' depression
   were among the sociodemographic characteristics most robustly associated
   with both stability and change in maternal depression. Given the
   important social consequences of maternal depression, not least of which
   is impaired wellbeing among children of depressed mothers, prevention
   and treatment of maternal depression should be an imperative for
   researchers, clinicians, and policymakers alike.

AB The integrated study of energy and urban systems has recently become a
   critical component of sustainability research and policy. Increasing
   urbanization of human societies combined with intense energy demands of
   modern economies have driven a recognition that sustainable practices
   require a systems approach to both the study and application of
   sustainability principles. Urban metabolism has emerged as a leading
   methodology for quantifying energy consumption and use patterns in urban
   environments. Though typically applied as a method of accounting for
   total energy and materials inputs and outputs into cities, its
   interdisciplinary history and methods allow urban metabolism to be
   expanded in ways that will allow more comprehensive and integrated
   assessment of the patterns and processes of urban energy systems. In
   this article, we review the concept of urban metabolism-including its
   two typical approaches: mass balance and "emergy" methods-and offer a
   means to expand urban metabolism into a platform that incorporates
   socioeconomic analysis, policy analysis, and additional quantitative
   methodologies (such as life cycle assessment). This expanded urban
   metabolism framework is more comprehensive analytically and builds upon
   the documented capacity of traditional urban metabolism to account for
   total energy and materials flows of cities to provide an integrated
   platform for analysis of both energy patterns and the causal processes
   that govern energy in contemporary cities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   networks operate in the same way(14-19). Here we report results from a
   randomized controlled trial of political mobilization messages delivered
   to 61 million Facebook users during the 2010 US congressional elections.
   The results show that the messages directly influenced political
   self-expression, information seeking and real-world voting behaviour of
   millions of people. Furthermore, the messages not only influenced the
   users who received them but also the users' friends, and friends of
   friends. The effect of social transmission on real-world voting was
   greater than the direct effect of the messages themselves, and nearly
   all the transmission occurred between 'close friends' who were more
   likely to have a face-to-face relationship. These results suggest that
   strong ties are instrumental for spreading both online and real-world
   behaviour in human social networks.

AB Punishment offers a powerful mechanism for the maintenance of
   cooperation in human and animal societies, but the maintenance of costly
   punishment itself remains problematic. Game theory has shown that
   corruption, where punishers can defect without being punished
   themselves, may sustain cooperation. However, in many human societies
   and some insect ones, high levels of cooperation coexist with low levels
   of corruption, and such societies show greater wellbeing than societies
   with high corruption. Here we show that small payments from cooperators
   to punishers can destabilize corrupt societies and lead to the spread of
   punishment without corruption (righteousness). Righteousness can prevail
   even in the face of persistent power inequalities. The resultant
   righteous societies are highly stable and have higher wellbeing than
   corrupt ones. This result may help to explain the persistence of costly
   punishing behavior, and indicates that corruption is a sub-optimal tool
   for maintaining cooperation in human societies.

AB Social connections are essential for the survival of a social species
   like humans. People differ in the degree to which they are sensitive to
   perceived deficits in their social connections, but evidence suggests
   that they nevertheless construe the nature of their social connections
   similarly. This construal can be thought of as a mental representation
   of a multi-faceted social experience. A three-dimensional mental
   representation has been identified with the UCLA Loneliness Scale and
   consists of Intimate, Relational, and Collective Connectedness
   reflecting beliefs about one's individual, dyadic, and collective
   (group) social value, respectively. Moreover, this mental representation
   has been replicated with other scales and validated across age, gender,
   and racial/ethnic lines in U.S. samples. The purpose of this study is to
   evaluate the extent to which this three-dimensional representation
   applies to people whose social lives are experienced in a collectivistic
   rather than individualistic culture. To that end, we used confirmatory
   factor analyses to assess the fit of the three-dimensional mental
   structure to data collected from Chinese people living in China. Two
   hundred sixty-seven young adults (16-25 yrs) and 250 older adults (5065
   yrs) in Beijing completed the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale and
   demographic and social activity questionnaires. Results revealed
   adequate fit of the structure to data from young and older Chinese
   adults. Moreover, the structure exhibited equivalent fit in young and
   older Chinese adults despite changes in the Chinese culture that exposed
   these two generations to different cultural experiences. Social activity
   variables that discriminated among the three dimensions in the Chinese
   samples corresponded well with variables that discriminated among the
   three dimensions in the U. S.-based samples, indicating cultural
   commonalities in the factors predicting dimensions of people's
   representations of their social connections. Equivalence of the
   three-dimensional structure is relevant for an understanding of cultural
   differences in the sources of loneliness and social connectedness.

AB This study contributes to the literature on child adoption by providing
   an analysis of how conceptions of kinship and constructions of race
   shape how families are sorted and matched in an adoption marketplace.
   Drawn from a national sample of adoptive households (n = 63,681), the
   author analyzes whether there is significant variation in the likelihood
   of white married, single, divorced, and same-sex couples choosing
   transracial adoption. Results indicate that "nontraditional" same-sex
   and single adoptive parents are the most likely to adopt non-white
   children, even when controlling for additional market variables.
   Although white adoptive parents, in general, are more likely to
   transracially adopt Hispanic and Asian children, white single and
   same-sex adoptive parents are significantly more likely to adopt black
   children. The author's findings underscore the importance of considering
   how market forces shape even the most intimate aspects of family
   building decisions.

AB Women are at special risk for HIV/AIDS infection and disease progression
   due to an inter-related set of biopolitical factors. Biological factors
   that contribute to women's special vulnerability include hormonal,
   developmental, and immunological characteristics. Social and political
   factors such as poverty, gendered power relationships, and violence
   interact with biological factors to create an HIV risk profile among
   women. The approach of this paper is to review literatures that describe
   components of women's risks for HIV in order to create an integrated
   model of vulnerability. We present a syndemic model that calls attention
   to the importance of understanding the pathways of adverse interaction
   among interacting diseases and the social and political environments of
   sufferers. This paper synthesises known risk factors and analyses them
   through the lens of syndemics theory in order to demonstrate the
   biopolitical vulnerability of women to HIV. Applying a syndemic approach
   offers important implications for prevention and treatment of HIV among
   women.

AB Research in the sociology of education has shown that noncognitive
   traits are important predictors of educational outcomes and a mechanism
   of the intergenerational transmission of status. However, previous
   research on this topic typically posits that there is a constant effect
   of these traits with variable prevalences of these traits by
   socioeconomic status. Using time spent on homework as an example, I
   analyze income-based heterogeneity in homework efficacy, defined as the
   individual effect of study time on academic achievement, using a
   national U.S. probability sample of secondary students. Higher income
   students gain more knowledge from their homework time than their
   counterparts in all grades and all subjects except history, with greater
   group differences for math than for science and reading. These results
   are confirmed by models accounting for time-invariant unobserved
   heterogeneity in the 8th-10th, but not 10th-12th, grade windows. These
   results imply that increases in the amount of homework assigned may
   increase the socioeconomic achievement gap in math, science, and reading
   in secondary school. (C) 2012 International Sociological Association

AB The political breakdown of the Soviet Union in 1991 provides a rare case
   of drastic changes in social and economic conditions, and as such a
   great opportunity to investigate the impacts of socioeconomic changes on
   the rates and patterns of forest harvest and regrowth. Our goal was to
   characterize forest-cover changes in the temperate zone of European
   Russia between 1985 and 2010 in 5-year increments using a stratified
   random sample of 12 Landsat footprints. We used Support Vector. Machines
   and post-classification comparison to monitor forest area, disturbance
   and reforestation. Where image availability was sub-optimal, we tested
   whether winter images help to improve classification accuracy. Our
   approach yielded accurate mono-temporal maps (on average > 95% overall
   accuracy), and change maps (on average 93.5%). The additional use of
   winter imagery improved classification accuracy by about 2%. Our results
   suggest that Russia's temperate forests underwent substantial changes
   during the observed period. Overall, forested areas increased by 4.5%,
   but the changes in forested area varied over time: a decline in forest
   area between 1990 and 1995 (- 1%) was followed by an increase in overall
   forest area in recent years (+ 1.4%, 2005-2010), possibly caused in part
   by forest regrowth on abandoned farmlands. Disturbances varied greatly
   among administrative regions, suggesting that differences in
   socioeconomic conditions strongly influence disturbance rates. While
   portions of Russia's temperate forests experienced high disturbance
   rates, overall forest area is expanding. Our use of a stratified random
   sample of Landsat footprints, and of summer and winter images, allowed
   us to characterize forest dynamics across a large region over a long
   time period, emphasizing the value of winter imagery in the free Landsat
   archives, especially for study areas where data availability is limited.

AB Growing Latino populations in midwestern cities of the United States are
   leading to the creation of contested ethnic spaces and urban landscapes.
   In this article we examine the historical, demographic, and social
   contexts associated with a growing sense of Latinidad and the
   countervailing Latino threat narrative in Kansas City and St. Louis, the
   two largest metropolitan areas in Missouri. Latinidad, or a notion of
   belonging based on ethnic identity in Missouri, is being challenged by
   nativist discourses that frame the growing Latino population as a
   threat. We highlight the different historical trajectories and
   geographical characteristics that have created distinct demographic
   profiles among the emerging Latino populations of Kansas City and St.
   Louis. These demographic profiles reflect the historical and geographic
   specificities of each city, but also highlight the ways that the Latino
   populations in two geographically proximate urban areas in the Midwest
   can have different trajectories. Finally, we outline three instances of
   Latino struggles for social and/or political recognition in Missouri,
   and suggest that the meaning of Latino population growth for both cities
   will be contested through the conflicting discourses of Latinidad and
   Latino threat.

   Household Labor, Gender Roles, and Family Satisfaction: A Cross-national
   Comparison
   Data from the 2002 International Social Survey Program: Family and
   Changing Gender Roles (III) are analyzed for 25,750 married or
   cohabiting adults from 31 countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and
   the United States. We examine the associations between gender role
   attitudes, household labor, and family satisfaction. In addition, we
   include a measure of incongruence between ideology and behavior. We
   estimate individual, couple, and country factors and their association
   with family satisfaction in regression models, as well as variation
   within and between countries based on multi-level models. Overall, we
   find that involvement in housework and childcare is positively
   associated with family satisfaction. Family satisfaction is higher among
   those in more traditional relationships (man breadwinner, woman
   homemaker) relative to other family forms; yet interaction terms
   indicate that men report higher family satisfaction the more involved
   they are in housework and childcare, and the more they agree they ought
   to share housework and childcare. Although those in traditional
   partnerships report higher family satisfaction, nontraditional partners
   experience less incongruence between their attitudes regarding the
   division of labor in the home and actual behavior. Multi-level models
   indicate that only about 4 percent of the variation in family
   satisfaction is between countries, and satisfaction is associated with
   increased country development. Development and family policies that
   encourage and support father involvement in household responsibilities
   are likely to increase family satisfaction, even among couples in more
   traditional family roles; and this relationship appears to be consistent
   cross-nationally.

AB BACKGROUND: Pediatric penetrating injuries plague inner cities. Based on
   our clinical observations, we hypothesized that pediatric penetrating
   trauma (PPT) is increasing with the major increase occurring in
   communities with lower socioeconomic status.
   METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the trauma databases between 2000
   and 2009 of the three major trauma centers in Alameda and San Francisco
   counties. Patients with PPT aged 16 years or younger were included.
   Demographics, Injury Severity Score, probability of survival, and length
   of hospital stay were collected. Median family incomes (MFI) were
   obtained from US Census data.
   RESULTS: We identified 598 patients with PPT: 432 gunshot wounds (GSWs),
   141 stabbings, and 25 other. The rate of PPT increased by 138% from 2000
   to 2009 (p = 0.003). The mean (SEM) age of the patients was 13.8 (0.1)
   years, which did not change during the study period (p = 0.12). The
   incidence of single GSW to the head increased from 3% to 7% (p = 0.01)
   and carried a 63% mortality rate. Blacks and Hispanics sustained 82.5%
   of PPT. The MFI of PPT victims was $39,209. PPT was more prevalent in
   zip codes with an MFI below the Bay Area MFI of $68,954, (mean [SEM],
   8.0 [1.5] victims per zip code below MFI vs. 1.9 [0.3] victims per zip
   code above MFI; p = < 0.001).
   CONCLUSION: PPT in the Bay Area increased during the last decade, and
   the increased PPT was associated with lower MFIs. Black and Hispanic
   children experienced the greatest proportion of penetrating injuries and
   had the lowest MFIs. The prevalence of single GSW to the head is
   increasing, which may suggest a deliberate attempt to fatally injure
   these children. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2012; 73: 721-725. Copyright

AB OBJECTIVE: Leverage an experimental study to determine whether gender or
   recent crime victimization modify the mental health effects of moving to
   low-poverty neighborhoods.
   METHODS: The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) study randomized low-income
   families in public housing to an intervention arm receiving vouchers to
   subsidize rental housing in lower-poverty neighborhoods or to controls
   receiving no voucher. We examined 3 outcomes 4 to 7 years after
   randomization, among youth aged 5 to 16 years at baseline (n = 2829):
   lifetime major depressive disorder (MDD), psychological distress (K6),
   and Behavior Problems Index (BPI). Treatment effect modification by
   gender and family's baseline report of recent violent crime
   victimization was tested via interactions in covariate-adjusted
   intent-to-treat and instrumental variable adherence-adjusted regression
   models.
   RESULTS: Gender and crime victimization significantly modified treatment
   effects on distress and BPI (P < .10). Female adolescents in families
   without crime victimization benefited from MTO treatment, for all
   outcomes (Distress B = -0.19, P = .008; BPI B = -0.13, P = .06; MDD B =
   -0.036, P = .03). Male adolescents in intervention families experiencing
   crime victimization had worse distress (B = 0.24, P = .004), more
   behavior problems (B = 0.30, P < .001), and nonsignificantly higher MDD
   (B = 0.022, P = .16) versus controls. Other subgroups experienced no
   effect of MTO treatment. Instrumental variable estimates were similar
   but larger.
   CONCLUSIONS: Girls from families experiencing recent violent crime
   victimization were significantly less likely to achieve mental health
   benefits, and boys were harmed, by MTO, suggesting need for
   cross-sectoral program supports to offset multiple stressors. Pediatrics

   challenges in making technical and management decisions. Input from
   producers and consumers was most important in establishing breeding
   program targets, although respondents' direct interaction with consumers
   was not frequent. Breeding targets and management decisions were mostly
   associated with the breeder's type of organization, scope and range of
   crops, and intended use of the crop (fresh, processed, or both).

AB Health inequities are related to social determinants based on gender,
   socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, living in a specific geographic
   region, or having a specific health condition. Such inequities were
   reviewed for blindness and visual impairment by searching for studies on
   the subject in PubMed from 2000 to 2011 in the English and Spanish
   languages. The goal of this article is to provide a current review in
   understanding how inequities based specifically on the aforementioned
   social determinants on health influence the prevalence of visual
   impairment and blindness. With regards to gender inequality, women have
   a higher prevalence of visual impairment and blindness, which cannot be
   only reasoned based on age or access to service. Socioeconomic status
   measured as higher income, higher educational status, or non-manual
   occupational social class was inversely associated with prevalence of
   blindness or visual impairment. Ethnicity and race were associated with
   visual impairment and blindness, although there is general confusion
   over this socioeconomic position determinant. Geographic inequalities
   and visual impairment were related to income (of the region, nation or
   continent), living in a rural area, and an association with
   socioeconomic and political context was suggested. While inequalities
   related to blindness and visual impairment have rarely been specifically
   addressed in research, there is still evidence of the association of
   social determinants and prevalence of blindness and visual impairment.
   Additional research should be done on the associations with intermediary
   determinants and socioeconomic and political context.

AB Health behaviors are known risk factors for colorectal cancer and are
   more common in low socioeconomic status (SES) populations. We evaluated
   the extent to which behavioral risk factors and body mass index (BMI)
   explain SES disparities in colorectal cancer incidence, overall and by
   tumor location.
   We analyzed prospective National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and
   Health Study data on 506 488 participants who were recruited in 19951996
   from six US states and two metropolitan areas and followed through 2006.
   Detailed baseline data on risk factors for colorectal cancer, including
   health behaviors, were obtained using questionnaires. SES was measured
   by self-reported education and census-tract data. The outcome was
   primary incident invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma. Poisson regression
   was used to estimate the association between SES and risk of incident
   colorectal cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, race and ethnicity,
   family history, and state of residence. The model estimates were used to
   derive percentage mediation by behavioral risk factors; bias-corrected
   95% confidence intervals were obtained through bootstrap techniques.
   Seven-thousand six-hundred seventy-six participants developed colorectal
   cancer during follow-up. SES differences in prevalence of physical
   inactivity, unhealthy diet, smoking, and unhealthy weight each explained
   between 11.3% (BMI) and 21.6% (diet) of the association between
   education and risk of colorectal cancer and between 8.6% (smoking) and
   15.3% (diet) of the association between neighborhood SES and risk of
   colorectal cancer. Health behaviors and BMI combined explained
   approximately 43.9% (95% CI 35.1% to 57.9%) of the association of
   education and 36.2% (95% CI 28.0% to 51.2%) of the association of
   neighborhood SES with risk of colorectal cancer. The percentage
   explained by all factors and BMI combined was largest for right colon
   cancers and smallest for rectal cancers.
   A substantial proportion of the socioeconomic disparity in risk of
   new-onset colorectal cancer, and particularly of right colon cancers,
   may be attributable to the higher prevalence of adverse health behaviors
   in low-SES populations.

   26% higher on the item on poor rapport (p < 0.0001), 10.2% higher on
   passive social withdrawal (p = 0.003), and most notably 46% higher on
   the item on lack of judgment and insight (p < 0.0001). These results
   remain broadly consistent across sex subgroup analyses. Differences seem
   to be best explained by both cultural differences in patient clinical

AB Objective: Little consensus exists regarding the relationship between
   socioeconomic status (SES) and substance use. This study examined the
   associations of three indicators of family SES during childhood-income,
   wealth, and parental education-with smoking, alcohol use, and marijuana
   use during young adulthood. Method: Data were obtained from the national
   Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a survey of U.S. families that
   incorporates data from parents and their children. In 2005 and 2007, the
   Panel Study of Income Dynamics was supplemented with two waves of
   Transition into Adulthood data drawn from a national sample of young
   adults, 18-23 years old. Data from the young adults (N = 1,203; 66.1%
   White; 51.5% female) on their current use of alcohol, cigarettes, and
   marijuana were used as outcome variables in logistic regressions.
   Socioeconomic background was calculated from parental reports of
   education, wealth, and income during the respondent's childhood (birth
   through age 17 years). Results: Smoking in young adulthood was
   associated with lower childhood family SES, although the association was
   explained by demographic and social role covariates. Alcohol use and
   marijuana use in young adulthood were associated with higher childhood
   family SES, even after controlling for covariates. Conclusions: Findings
   based on three indicators of family background SES-income, wealth, and
   parental education-converged in describing unique patterns for smoking
   and for alcohol and marijuana use among young adults, although

AB Objective. To explore the extent to which commuters reallocate time away
   from their spouse, children, and friends.
   Methods. An analytic sample of adult, full-time employed, urban-dwelling
   respondents is drawn from the nationally representative American Time
   Use Survey (2003-2010). Seemingly Unrelated Regressions are utilized to
   calculate adjusted mean number of daily minutes spent with spouse, own
   children, and friends at several commuting durations.
   Results. Mean (median) daily commuting time was 54.5 {50} minutes (the
   range was 6-210 min). For those commuting 60 min daily, a one hour
   commuting time increase is associated with a 21.8 minute decrease in
   time males spent with their spouse, an 18.6 minute decrease in time with
   children, and a 7.2 minute decrease in time with friends. A one hour
   increase in commuting time is associated with an 11.9 minute decrease in
   time females spent with friends, only, with no significant impact on
   time females spent with either spouse or children.
   Conclusion. This was the first study to utilize time diary data to
   explore the relationship between commuting length and time spent with
   others. These estimates will inform researchers interested in time
   usages' impacts on physical and mental health. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB Objective: To examine sex differences in the relation of childhood
   socioeconomic status (CSES) to systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood
   pressure (DBP) trajectories during 15 years, spanning young (mean [M]
   [standard deviation {SD}] = 30 [3] years) and middle (M [SD] = 45 [3]
   years) adulthood, independent of adult SES. Methods: A total of 4077
   adult participants reported father's and mother's educational
   attainments at study enrollment (Year 0) and own educational attainment
   at enrollment and at all follow-up examinations. Resting BP also was
   measured at all examinations. Data from examination Years 5 (when
   participant M [SD] age = 30 [3] years), 7, 10, 15, and 20 are examined
   here. Associations of own adult (Year 5), mother's, and father's
   educations with 15-year BP trajectories were examined in separate
   multilevel models. Fully controlled models included time-invariant
   covariates (age, sex, race, recruitment center) and time-varying
   covariates that were measured at each examination (marital status, body
   mass, cholesterol, oral contraceptives/hormones, and antihypertensive
   drugs). Analyses of parental education controlled for own education.
   Results: When examined without covariates, higher education - own (SBP
   gamma = -0.03, DBP gamma = -0.03), mother's (SBP gamma = -0.02, DBP
   gamma = -0.02), and father's (SBP gamma = -0.02, DBP gamma = -0.01)were
   associated with attenuated 15-year increases in BP (p < .001).
   Associations of own (but not either parent's) education with BP
   trajectories remained independent of standard controls. Sex moderated
   the apparent null effects of parental education, such that higher
   parental education especially mother's, predicted attenuated BP
   trajectories independent of standard covariates among women (SBP gamma =
   -0.02,p =.02; DBP gamma = -0.01, p =.04) but not men (SBP gamma = 0.02,p
   =.06; DBP gamma = 0.005, p =.47; p interaction SBP <.001, p interaction
   DBP =.01). Conclusions: Childhood socioeconomic status may influence
   women's health independent of their own adult status.

AB This article is an intellectual history of two enduring
   binariessociety-nature and city-countrysideand their co-identification,
   told through evolving uses of the concept of urban metabolism. After
   recounting the emergence of the modern society-nature opposition in the
   separation of town and country under early industrial capitalism, I
   interpret three ecologiessuccessive periods of urban metabolism research
   spanning three disciplines within the social sciences. The first is the
   human ecology of the Chicago School, which treated the city as an
   ecosystem in analogy to external, natural ecosystems. The second is
   industrial ecology: materials-flow analyses of cities that conceptualize
   external nature as the source of urban metabolism's raw materials and
   the destination for its social wastes. The third is urban political
   ecology, a reconceptualization of the city as a product of diverse
   socio-natural flows. By analyzing these three traditions in succession,
   I demonstrate both the efficacy and the limits to Catton and Dunlap's
   distinction between a human exemptionalist paradigm and a new ecological
   paradigm in sociology.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the effectiveness
   of multidisciplinary team training on organizational culture and team
   communication.
   STUDY DESIGN: The training included a 6-step protocol: (1) a pretest
   survey assessing cultural attitudes and perceptions, (2) a baseline
   high-fidelity simulation session, (3) invitational medical rhetoric
   instruction, (4) a second high-fidelity simulation session, (5) a
   posttest survey assessing changed cultural attitudes and perceptions,
   and (6) a debriefing with participants. Teams of 4 physicians trained
   together: 2 obstetricians and 2 anesthesiologists. Forty-four physicians
   completed the training protocol during 2010 and 2011.
   RESULTS: Paired-sample t tests demonstrated significant decreases in
   autonomous cultural attitudes and perceptions (t = 8.23, P < .001) and
   significant increases in teamwork cultural attitudes and perceptions (t
   = -4.05, P < .001). Paired-sample t tests also demonstrated significant
   increases in communication climate that invited participation and
   integrated information from both medical services (t = -5.80, P < .001).
   CONCLUSION: The multidisciplinary team training program specified in
   this report resulted in increased teamwork among obstetricians and
   anesthesiologists.

   relation to BMI among 22,014 black males, 9,343 white males, 30,810
   black females, and 14,447 white females, aged 4079 years, from the
   Southern Community Cohort Study, an epidemiologic cohort of largely
   low-income participants in 12 southeastern US states. Participants
   enrolled in the cohort from 2002 to 2009 and were followed up to 8.9
   years. Hazard ratios and 95 confidence intervals for mortality were
   obtained from sex- and race-stratified Cox proportional hazards models
   in association with BMI at cohort entry, adjusting for age, education,
   income, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Elevated BMI was
   associated with increased mortality among whites (hazard ratios for BMI
   40 vs. 2024.9 1.37 (95 confidence interval (CI): 1.02, 1.84) and 1.47
   (95 CI: 1.15, 1.89) for white males and white females, respectively) but
   not significantly among blacks (hazard ratios 1.13 (95 CI: 0.89, 1.43)
   and 0.87 (95 CI: 0.72, 1.04) for black males and black females,
   respectively). In this large cohort, obesity in mid-to-late adulthood
   among blacks was not associated with the same excess mortality risk seen
   among whites.

   as well as subtle inequities, such as limited access to healthy foods.
   We reviewed the literature on neighborhood disparities in access to
   fast-food outlets and convenience stores. Low-income neighborhoods
   offered greater access to food sources that promote unhealthy eating.
   The distribution of fast-food outlets and convenience stores differed by
   the racial/ethnic characteristics of the neighborhood.
   Further research is needed to address the limitations of current
   studies, identify effective policy actions to achieve environmental
   justice, and evaluate intervention strategies to promote lifelong
   healthy eating habits, optimum health, and vibrant communities. (Am J

AB Objectives. We examined relationships between neighborhood poverty and
   allostatic load in a low- to moderate-income multiracial urban
   community. We tested the hypothesis that neighborhood poverty is
   associated with allostatic load, controlling for household poverty. We
   also examined the hypotheses that this association was mediated by
   psychosocial stress and health-related behaviors.
   Methods. We conducted multilevel analyses using cross-sectional data
   from a probability sample survey in Detroit, Michigan (n=919) and the
   2000 US Census. The outcome, measure was allostatic load. Independent
   variables included neighborhood and household poverty, psychosocial
   stress, and health-related behaviors. Covariates included neighborhood
   and individual demographic characteristics.
   Results. Neighborhood poverty was positively associated with allostatic
   load (P<.05), independent of household poverty and controlling for
   potential confounders. Relationships between neighborhood poverty were
   mediated by self-reported neighborhood environment stress but not by
   health-related behaviors.
   Conclusions. Neighborhood poverty is associated with wear and tear on
   physiological systems, and this relationship is mediated through
   psychosocial stress. These relationships are evident after accounting
   for household poverty levels. Efforts to promote health equity should
   focus on neighborhood poverty, associated stressful environmental
   conditions, and household poverty. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. To consider how the relationships between social
   determinants and health indicators change over time, we assessed the
   time-varying influence of maternal education on risk of preterm birth
   (PTB) between 1989 and 2006.
   Methods. We used bivariate and multivariable Poisson regression models
   with robust variation estimates to examine (1) the association between
   maternal education and PTB risk by year; (2) the relationship between
   low maternal education and PTB, late PTB, and very PTB risk by year
   relative to 1989; and (3) the relationship between high maternal
   education and PTB, late PTB, and very PTB risk by year relative to 1989.
   Results. After adjustment, PTB risk increased among the most educated
   and did not change among the least educated women over time. Risk of PTB
   among the least educated relative to the most educated women decreased
   with time. Late PTB risk increased among both the most and the least
   educated groups but more among the most educated.
   Conclusions. Maternal education may be becoming less protective against
   PTB. The influence of the social determinants of health is dynamic,
   warranting revisions of our understanding of their roles over time. (Am

AB Objectives. Although previous research has shown that low socioeconomic
   status (SES) is associated with mental illness, it is unclear which
   aspects of SES are most important. We investigated this issue by
   examining associations between 5 aspects of SES and adolescent mental
   disorders.
   Methods. Data came from a national survey of US adolescents (n = 6483).
   Associations among absolute SES (parental income and education),
   relative SES (relative deprivation, subjective social status), and
   community level income variation (Gini coefficient) with past-year
   mental disorders were examined.
   Results. Subjective social status (mean 0, variance 1) was most
   consistently associated with mental disorder. Odds ratios with mood,
   anxiety, substance, and behavior disorders after controlling for other
   SES indicators were all statistically significant and in the range of
   0.7 to 0.8. Associations were strongest for White adolescents. Parent
   education was associated with low risk for anxiety disorder, relative
   deprivation with high risk for mood disorder, and the other 2 indicators
   were associated with none of the disorders considered.
   Conclusions. Associations between SES and adolescent mental disorders
   are most directly the result of perceived social status, an aspect of
   SES that might be more amenable to interventions than objective aspects
   of SES. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102:1742-1750.

AB Objectives. We assessed whether multiple psychosocial factors are
   additive in their relationship to sexual risk behavior and self-reported
   HIV status (i.e., can be characterized as a syndemic) among young
   transgender women and the relationship of indicators of social
   marginalization to psychosocial factors.
   Methods. Participants (n = 151) were aged 15 to 24 years and lived in
   Chicago or Los Angeles. We collected data on psychosocial factors (low
   self-esteem, polysubstance use, victimization related to transgender
   identity, and intimate partner violence) and social marginalization
   indicators (history of commercial sex work, homelessness, and
   incarceration) through an interviewer-administered survey.
   Results. Syndemic factors were positively and additively related to
   sexual risk behavior and self-reported HIV infection. In addition, our
   syndemic index was significantly related to 2 indicators of social
   marginalization: a history of sex work and previous incarceration.
   Conclusions. These findings provide evidence for a syndemic of
   co-occurring psychosocial and health problems in young transgender
   women, taking place in a context of social marginalization. (Am J Public

   angiography, receipt of revascularization procedures, among 9941

   surveillance by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
   (1993-2002).
   Results: In analyses by tertile of nINC controlling for age, study
   community, gender, and year, compared with white patients from high nINC
   areas, black patients from low nINC (0.60, 0.54-0.66) and medium nINC
   (0.70, 0.60-0.78) areas, as well as white patients from low nINC areas
   (0.83, 0.75-0.91) were less likely to receive angiography, whereas black
   patients from high nINC and white patients from medium nINC areas were
   not. Associations were attenuated, but persisted, after we controlled
   for event severity, medical history, receipt of Medicaid, and hospital
   type. Compared with high nINC white patients, black patients were less
   likely, and white patients were as likely, to undergo cardiac
   revascularization, given receipt of an angiogram.
   Conclusions: Black and lower nINC patients were less likely to undergo
   angiography than were white patients and those from higher nINC areas.
   Among those receiving angiography, race, but not nINC, gradients
   persisted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Decisions involving moral vectors are inherently social. This paper
   investigates social closeness to others as one of the important factors
   that mediate our evaluations of moral infractions. The influence of
   social closeness on participants' third-party evaluations of moral
   transgressions was measured across development. Participants'
   intentional attributions, punitive sentiments, moral judgments, and
   emotional reactions were measured using responses to hypothetical
   vignettes that describe socio-moral transgressions involving theft.
   Participants' attribution judgments, punitive decisions, and emotional
   reactions differed when their social relationship with the perpetrator
   (Study One), and alternatively with the victim (Study Two), of the
   transgression was varied. Evidence is provided for the supposition that
   morality is a construct of social cooperative exchange and that social
   closeness influences socio-moral evaluations and judgments.

   Security Hypothesis. Slower pop songs and songs in less common keys are
   generally more reflective and serious, whereas faster pop songs and
   songs in common keys are generally more celebratory and fun. Consistent
   with theory predictions, songs with more beats per minute and in common
   key signatures were most popular in social and economic good times and

AB Relationships exist between language ability, emotion regulation, and
   social competence in preschool children. This study examines how these
   relationships function in elementary school children, and explores
   whether language ability partially mediates the relationship between
   emotion regulation and social competence. Second-grade students (N = 67)
   completed an assessment of receptive vocabulary, and teachers rated
   emotional and social skills. Results show relationships between emotion
   regulation and social competence, and between language and aspects of
   social competence. There were compelling sex differences in the strength
   of the relationships between these variables. However, language did not
   act as a mediator. Future research should further investigate the role
   of language skills in social competence as children mature, and further
   investigate sex differences in these constructs.

AB The present study investigated the impact of social support on the
   psychological well-being of mothers of adolescents and adults with ASD
   (n = 269). Quantity of support (number of social network members) as
   well as valence of support (positive support and negative support) were
   assessed using a modified version of the "convoy model" developed by
   Antonucci and Akiyama (1987). Having a larger social network was
   associated with improvements in maternal well-being over an 18-month
   period. Higher levels of negative support as well as increases in
   negative support over the study period were associated with increases in
   depressive symptoms and negative affect and decreases in positive
   affect. Social support predicted changes in well-being above and beyond
   the impact of child behavior problems. Implications for clinical
   practice are discussed.

AB OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between the barriers to healthcare
   access and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening practices among
   African-American and Afro-Caribbean men.
   METHODS Stratified cluster sampling of census tracts in Brooklyn, New
   York yielded 533 men, aged 45-70 years. The men were classified into the
   following groups: U.S.-born white, U.S.-born AfricanAmerican, Jamaican,
   and Trinidadian/Tobagonian. The subjects completed a written 6-item
   survey assessing the healthcare barriers.
   RESULTS Overall, 27% of men reported never having had a PSA test and 28%
   reported that they had received annual PSA screening. On multivariate
   analysis, those who viewed the healthcare system as convenient were more
   likely to report an initial PSA test (odds ratio 1.8, P < .05). Those
   who perceived difficulty in accessing reliable care were less likely to
   ever have had a PSA test (odds ratio 0.6, P < .05). Subjects who had not
   had a comprehensive discussion with their physician about prostate
   cancer were less likely to have had an initial PSA test and more likely
   to have maintained annual PSA screening (odds ratio 0.3 and 1.7,
   respectively, P < .05).
   CONCLUSION We identified 2 novel perceived barriers to prostate cancer
   screening: men who experience the healthcare system as inconvenient were
   less likely to initiate PSA testing, and those who found it difficult to
   obtain quality care were less likely to ever have had a PSA test. The
   perceived system barriers were more closely linked to PSA screening
   behavior than were the measures assessing perceptions of self-efficacy.
   Our results suggest that a broader discussion by physicians that
   addresses the perceptions regarding the healthcare system might enhance
   the understanding of, and increase the use of, prostate cancer screening
   among higher risk minority men. UROLOGY 80: 556-563, 2012. (c) 2012

AB Controversies about international migration expose the changing
   structure of and underlying assumptions about societal membership in
   many nations. The sociology of international migration has emerged as an
   increasingly important subfield over the past decade in large part
   because it has tended to move beyond more narrow economic and
   demographic problems and has begun to address this fundamentally
   sociological issue. In the future it will be particularly important that
   sociologists pay attention to how demographically changing societies
   define who is and is not a member. As such, legal status and the role of
   the state has become critically important.

AB U.S. immigration has changed dramatically in the last 20 years:
   immigrants have increasingly gravitated toward new destinations and a
   growing portion are undocumented. In the absence of federal
   comprehensive immigration reform, states are proposing a patchwork of
   laws. While some laws encourage immigrant integration, most seek
   restriction. To understand this trend, this article analyzes Utah as a
   new immigration destination, exploring its transformation from an
   inclusive to a restrictive state. It focuses on a major debate: whether
   to allow unauthorized residents legal driving privileges. Because Utah
   initiated this law earlier than most, it leads this debate. To explain
   its evolution, this article analyzes 10 years of legislative debates and
   articles published on this law. Building on the narrative studies
   literature, I find that both sides of the immigration debate utilized a
   public safety and well-being narrative. However, supporters of the
   driver license law relied on a lower mimetic narrative, characterized by
   logic and factual arguments. In contrast, their opponents wove a
   compelling, apocalyptic narrative to criticize the law. This narrative
   indelibly linked immigration to the dangers of crime and terrorism and
   thus paved the way for the passage of one of the most restrictive
   immigration laws in the United States.

AB Recent studies have examined the influence on patterns of human genetic
   variation of a variety of cultural practices. In India, centuries-old
   marriage customs have introduced extensive social structuring into the
   contemporary population, potentially with significant consequences for
   genetic variation. Social stratification in India is evident as social
   classes that are defined by endogamous groups known as castes. Within a
   caste, there exist endogamous groups known as gols (marriage circles),
   each of which comprises a small number of exogamous gotra (lineages).
   Thus, while consanguinity is strictly avoided and some randomness in
   mate selection occurs within the gol, gene flow is limited with groups
   outside the gol. Gujarati Patels practice this form of exogamic
   endogamy. We have analyzed genetic variation in one such group of
   Gujarati Patels, the Chha Gaam Patels (CGP), who comprise individuals
   from six villages. Population structure analysis of 1,200 autosomal loci
   offers support for the existence of distinctive multilocus genotypes in
   the CGP with respect to both non-Gujaratis and other Gujaratis, and
   indicates that CGP individuals are genetically very similar. Analysis of
   Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial haplotypes provides support for both
   patrilocal and patrilineal practices within the gol, and a low-level of
   female gene flow into the gol. Our study illustrates how the practice of
   gol endogamy has introduced fine-scale genetic structure into the
   population of India, and contributes more generally to an understanding
   of the way in which marriage practices affect patterns of genetic
   variation. Am J PhyAnthropol 2012. (c) Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Pictures of emotional facial expressions or natural scenes are often
   used as cues in emotion research. We examined the extent to which these
   different stimuli engage emotion and attention, and whether the presence
   of social anxiety symptoms influences responding to facial cues. Sixty
   participants reporting high or low social anxiety viewed pictures of
   angry, neutral, and happy faces, as well as violent, neutral, and erotic
   scenes, while skin conductance and event-related potentials were
   recorded. Acoustic startle probes were presented throughout picture
   viewing, and blink magnitude, probe P3 and reaction time to the startle
   probe also were measured. Results indicated that viewing emotional
   scenes prompted strong reactions in autonomic, central, and reflex
   measures, whereas pictures of faces were generally weak elicitors of
   measurable emotional response. However, higher social anxiety was
   associated with modest electrodermal changes when viewing angry faces
   and mild startle potentiation when viewing either angry or smiling
   faces, compared to neutral. Taken together, pictures of facial
   expressions do not strongly engage fundamental affective reactions, but
   these cues appeared to be effective in distinguishing between high and
   low social anxiety participants, supporting their use in anxiety
   research. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The application of evolutionary theory to human behavior has elicited a
   variety of critiques, some of which charge that this approach expresses
   or encourages conservative or reactionary political agendas. In a survey
   of graduate students in psychology, Tybur, Miller, and Gangestad (Human
   Nature, 18, 313-328, 2007) found that the political attitudes of those
   who use an evolutionary approach did not differ from those of other
   psychology grad students. Here, we present results from a directed
   online survey of a broad sample of graduate students in anthropology
   that assays political views. We found that evolutionary anthropology
   graduate students were very liberal in their political beliefs,
   overwhelmingly voted for a liberal U.S. presidential candidate in the
   2008 election, and identified with liberal political parties; in this,
   they were almost indistinguishable from non-evolutionary anthropology
   students. Our results contradict the view that evolutionary
   anthropologists hold conservative or reactionary political views. We
   discuss some possible reasons for the persistence of this view in terms
   of the sociology of science.

AB Objectives: Ongoing social and economic changes in developing countries
   are associated with increases in body size, and most notably increases
   in the prevalence of obesity. The social patterning of these changes in
   terms of socioeconomic status (SES) is not well documented. The aim of
   this study was to assess the changes in stature, body mass index (BMI)
   and fatness in adult women in urban Cali, Colombia between 19881989 and
   20072008. Methods: We compared the results of anthropometric surveys
   completed in 19881989 and 20072008 of nonpregnant, nonlactating women,
   1844 years of age. Samples in both studies were stratified by SES. We
   calculated age-standardized prevalence rates to assess time trends in
   obesity. Body fatness was assessed by skinfold thicknesses. Results:
   Stature increased in all SES groups and remained positively associated
   with SES. BMI increased only in the lower SES group, from 24.4 to 25.9
   kg/m2 and remained negatively associated with SES. The age-standardized
   prevalence of obesity increased from 7.9 to 17.0% in the lower SES
   group, but only from 4.5 to 8.2% in the middle SES group, and was
   unchanged in the upper SES group. Body fatness increased in all SES
   groups, but only in the upper body. Conclusion: The increased stature in
   all SES groups is indicative of general improvements in socioeconomic
   conditions. The increased prevalence of obesity in the lower SES groups
   is in keeping with the findings in other middle-income developing
   countries. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB Cancer screening is often fully covered under high-deductible health

   To determine the impact of switching to a HDHP on breast and cervical
   cancer screening among women of low SES.
   Pre-post with comparison group.
   Four thousand one hundred and eighty-eight health plan members enrolled
   for one year before and up to two years after an employer-mandated
   switch from a traditional HMO to an HMO-based HDHP, compared with 9418
   propensity score matched controls who remained in HMOs by employer
   choice. Both groups had low outpatient copayments. High-deductible
   members had full coverage of mammography and Pap smears, but $500 to
   $2000 individual deductibles for most other services. HMO members had
   full coverage of cancer screening and low copayments for other services
   without any deductible. We stratified analyses by SES.
   Transition to a HDHP.
   Annual breast and cervical cancer screening rates; rates of annual
   preventive outpatient visits.
   In follow-up years 1 and 2, low SES HDHP members experienced no
   statistically detectable changes in rates of breast cancer screening
   (ratio of change, 1.14, 95 % CI, [0.93,1.40] and 1.05, [0.80,1.37],
   respectively) or preventive visits (difference-in-differences, +1.9 %,
   [-11.9 %,+17.7 %] and +10.1 %, [-9.4 %,+33.7 %], respectively) relative
   to HMO counterparts. Similarly, among low SES HDHP members eligible for
   cervical cancer screening, no significant changes occurred in either
   screening rates (1.01, [0.86,1.20] and 1.08, [0.86,1.35]) or preventive
   visits (+0.2 %, [-11.4 %,+13.3 %] and -1.4 %, [-18.1,+18.6]). Patterns
   were statistically similar for high SES members.
   During two follow-up years, transition to an HMO-based HDHP with
   coverage of primary care visits and cancer screening did not lead to
   differentially lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening or
   preventive visits for low SES women. Generalizability is limited to
   commercially insured women transitioning to HDHPs with low cost-sharing
   for cancer screening and primary care visits, a common design.

AB Safety-net hospital systems provide care to a large proportion of United

   colorectal cancer (CRC) care in this population and sought to identify
   demographic and systemic differences in these patients compared to those
   in an insured health-care system.
   We collected demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data from
   2005-2007 on all patients with CRC seen at Parkland Health and Hospital
   System (PHHS), a safety-net health system and at Presbyterian Hospital
   Dallas System (Presbyterian), a community health system, and compared
   characteristics among the two health-care systems. Variables associated
   with advanced stage were identified with multivariate logistic
   regression analysis and odds ratios were calculated.
   Three hundred and eighteen patients at PHHS and 397 patients at
   Presbyterian with CRC were identified. An overwhelming majority (75 %)
   of patients seen at the safety-net were diagnosed after being seen in
   the emergency department or at an outside facility. These patients had a
   higher percentage of stage 4 disease compared to the community. Patients
   within the safety-net with Medicare/private insurance had lower rates of
   advanced disease than uninsured patients (25 % vs. 68 %, p < 0.001).
   Insurance status and physician encounter resulting in diagnosis were
   independent predictors of disease stage at diagnosis.
   A large proportion of patients seen in the safety-net health system were
   transferred from outside systems after diagnosis, thus leading to
   delayed care. This delay in care drove advanced stage at diagnosis. The
   data point to a pervasive and systematic issue in patients with CRC and
   have fundamental health policy implications for population-based CRC
   screening.

   is also not known whether the co-existence of depression modifies any
   racial differences that may exist.
   To examine racial differences in ART adherence and whether the presence
   of comorbid depression moderates these differences among
   Medicaid-enrolled HIV-infected patients.
   Retrospective cohort study.
   Multi-state Medicaid database (Thomson Reuters MarketScanA (R)).
   Data for 7,034 HIV-infected patients with at least two months of
   antiretroviral drug claims between 2003 and 2007 were assessed.
   Antiretroviral therapy adherence (90 % days covered) were measured for a
   12-month period. The main independent variables of interest were race
   and depression. Other covariates included patient variables, clinical
   variables (comorbidity and disease severity), and therapy-related
   variables.
   In this study sample, over 66 % of patients were of black race, and
   almost 50 % experienced depression during the study period. A
   significantly higher portion of non-black patients were able to achieve
   optimal adherence (a parts per thousand yen90 %) compared to black
   patients (38.6 % vs. 28.7 %, p < 0.001). In fact, black patients had
   nearly 30 % decreased odds of being optimally adherent to antiretroviral
   drugs compared to non-black patients (OR = 0.70, 95 % CI: 0.63-0.78),
   and was unchanged regard less of whether the patient had depression.
   Antidepressant treatment nearly doubled the odds of optimal ART
   adherence among patients with depression (OR = 1.92, 95 % CI:
   1.12-3.29).
   Black race was significantly associated with worse ART adherence, which
   was not modified by the presence of depression. Under-diagnosis and
   under-treatment of depression may hinder ART adherence among
   HIV-infected patients of all races.

AB The relative impact of genetic and social influences on disordered
   eating behaviors (DEB) including binging, purging, excessive dieting and
   negative self-evaluations about weight remain an issue of debate. The
   current study sought to examine the relative influence of genetic and
   social influences on DEB. A 7-year prospective analysis of 580
   monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins was conducted. Estimates of
   heritability of DEB were obtained using the DF Analysis Model.
   Regression equations revealed the relative predictive value of sibling's
   DEB, neurotic personality, maternal warmth and television and video game
   exposure on DEB. Heritability estimates for DEB were 0.40 for females
   and 0.48 for males. Among MZ and DZ twin pairs, female sex, neurotic
   personality and a genetic variable component, but not maternal warmth or
   school related problems, predicted DEB. Contrary to the expectations of
   media effects theory, greater media use was associated with lower DEB
   among DZ twins and had no influence on MZ twins. These results indicate
   that DEB is highly heritable and that personality variables may play an
   important role in the formation of DEB. This suggests that it is
   important to control for genetic variables when analyzing risk factors
   for DEB.

AB There is relatively little content available addressing the use of
   social media, such as Facebook in psychiatric populations. There has
   been significant growth of various social media websites in the last 10
   years, such as Facebook, and yet little is written about their overall
   impact on this population. There are articles in the scientific
   literature about the use of social media in adolescents and young adults
   and also about its use among physicians and medical students. This
   article reviews the literature addressing social media and describes a
   therapeutic interaction with a patient with significant psychiatric
   comorbities and his use of social media. Furthermore, this is a unique
   example in current literature of an overall positive interaction and
   social improvement of this patient in large degree due to his use of
   Facebook. Physicians themselves must be very cautious in their
   interaction with patients online and especially via social media, while
   acknowledging that social media can serve as a spring board for more
   reclusive patients into greater societal integration.

AB Longitudinal social network data on adolescents in seven schools are
   analyzed to reach a new understanding about how the personal and
   interpersonal social dimensions of adolescent religion intertwine
   together in small school settings. We primarily address two issues
   relevant to the sociology of religion and.sociology in general: (1)
   social selection as a source of religious homophily and (2) friend
   socialization of religion. Analysis results are consistent with Collins
   interaction ritual chain theory, which stresses the social dimensions of
   religion, since network-religion autocorrelations are relatively
   substantial in magnitude and both selection and socialization mechanisms
   play key roles in generating them. Results suggest that socialization
   plays a stronger role than social selection in four of six religious
   outcomes, and that more religious youth are more cliquish. Implications
   for our understanding of the social context of religion, religious
   homophily, and the ways we model religious influence, as well as
   limitations and considerations for future research, are discussed. (c)

AB To address disparities in health risks associated with ambient air
   pollution for racial/ethnic minority groups, this study characterized
   personal and ambient concentrations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
   in a suspected hot spot of air pollution - the Village of Waterfront
   South (WFS), and an urban reference community - the Copewood/Davis
   Streets (CDS) neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. Both are
   minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h
   integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS
   residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during
   the summer and winter seasons of 2004-2006. Ambient air samples from the
   center of each community were also collected simultaneously during
   personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX)
   presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS,
   particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal
   and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS.
   Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane,
   benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These
   observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air
   pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks
   resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and
   non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane,
   benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in
   both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address
   disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the
   socio-economically disadvantaged groups. This study also demonstrated
   that air pollution hot spots similar to WFS can provide robust setting
   to investigate health effects of ambient air pollution. (C) 2012

   This paper examined the associations between change in leisure-time
   physical activity and individual and social contextual factors in
   participants employed in small businesses (n = 850) at both baseline and
   at 18-month final.
   In bivariate analyses, age, language acculturation, social ties, and
   workplace social capital were significantly associated with physical
   activity at final. In multivariable analyses, being younger and having
   high language acculturation were significantly associated with greater
   leisure-time physical activity at final; high workplace social capital
   was significantly associated with a decline in physical activity at
   final.
   These findings have implications for understanding factors that are
   integral to promoting change in physical activity among working-class,

AB At this time, compared with mainstream (Caucasian) youth, cultural
   minority adolescents experience more severe substance-related
   consequences and are less likely to receive treatment. Although several
   empirically supported interventions (ESIs), such as motivational
   interviewing (MI), have been evaluated with mainstream adolescents,
   fewer published studies have investigated the fit and efficacy of these
   interventions with cultural minority adolescents. In addition, many
   empirical evaluations of ESIs have not explicitly attended to issues of
   culture, race, and socioeconomic background in their analyses. As a
   result, there is some question about the external validity of ESIs,
   particularly in disadvantaged cultural minority populations. This review
   seeks to take a step toward filling this gap, by addressing how to
   improve the fit and efficacy of ESIs like MI with cultural minority
   youth. Specifically, this review presents the existing literature on MI
   with cultural minority groups (adult and adolescent), proposes two
   approaches for evaluating and adapting this (or other) behavioral
   interventions, and elucidates the rationale, strengths, and potential
   liabilities of each tailoring approach. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article explores the phenomenological and socially constructed
   experience of time during the finite period of the vacation. Temporal
   routine is considered as a form of social control from which vacations
   and similar breaks for time off offer opportunities for agency and
   release. In-depth interviews, participant observation, and a narrative
   analysis of vacation blogs are used to analyze norms in orientation to
   time while one is away from select constraints of everyday life.
   Approaches to time while on vacation are found to fall into two ideal
   types: those who may "ignore" time and find release from schedules and
   routine, and those who must closely attend to its passage. Influences of
   duration, frequency and pace are also central in moderating experience.

AB This is a qualitative study detailing the links between racial discourse
   and social action. Specifically, this article provides evidence for the
   ways in which a white habitus is reproduced in a racially diverse
   community, despite the best intentions of its community members. This is
   chiefly due to the influence of national color-blind ideologies and the
   diversity discourse that follows. Because this ideology and discourse
   are individual in nature and centered on a white norm, it chiefly
   produces consumption-driven actions for individuals and collective
   action that protects those with racial privilege. While prior studies
   have detailed the influence of this ideology on racial attitudes and
   examined the contours of diversity discourse generally, this study
   utilizes the racial formations approach to make concrete links to social
   outcomes in a diverse community. These findings are particularly
   significant given the hope vested in racially diverse communities as the
   nation itself becomes more diverse.

   data collected through participant observation and interviews, we
   examine the struggles of a small, multiracial antiracist organization
   that protests the Cleveland baseball franchise's 'Indians' name and
   Chief Wahoo mascot. White activists' racial consciousness, or awareness
   of white racism and white privilege, compels them to participate in the
   group; their ways of participating, however, ultimately may hamper the
   organizational effectiveness of the Committee of 500 Years of Dignity
   and Resistance. Specifically, white activists' racial consciousness
   makes them reluctant to adopt necessary leadership roles. Borrowing from
   literature on white racism, white racial consciousness, and multiracial
   organizing, we illustrate the complex nature and potential pitfalls of
   multiracial alliances formed to protest racism in the United States.

   fact central to the debate on immigration, both by those opposed to any
   legalization of undocumented workers in the US and those who favor a
   temporary worker ('work visa') program. In this article, I examine how
   both anti-immigration and pro-work-visa groups framed the immigration
   debate as reported in newspaper articles in the particularly contentious
   period from December 2005 to November 2006. I performed a content
   analysis of three newspapers representing three different regions and
   three differing histories of immigration: the Chicago Tribune, the
   Houston Chronicle, and the Raleigh News & Observer. Using Blumer's group
   position theory, I examine the patterns within the discussion for
   evidence of preservation of racial group position on the part of both
   anti-immigration and pro-work visa advocates.

   merging physical spaces, mental maps of information, and experiences

   conceptualization as a pivotal cultural worker. To better understand
   this condition, this article has two interrelated goals: first, to raise
   the importance of Bourdieu's 'cultural intermediary' and the practice of
   spatial narratives as concerns for the study of culture, and, second, to
   refit Wendy Griswold's (1987a) 1987 framework for a sociology of culture
   in order to better suit social actors located within a 'circuit of

   Bourdieu's provocative concept in dialogue with a clear epistemological

AB The archaeological record has been described as a key to the long-term
   consequences of human action that can help guide our decisions today.
   Yet the sparse and incomplete nature of this record often makes it
   impossible to inferentially reconstruct past societies in sufficient
   detail for them to serve as more than very general cautionary tales of
   coupled socio-ecological systems. However, when formal and computational
   modeling is used to experimentally simulate human socioecological
   dynamics, the empirical archaeological record can be used to validate
   and improve dynamic models of long term change. In this way, knowledge
   generated by archaeology can play a unique and valuable role in
   developing the tools to make more informed decisions that will shape our
   future. The Mediterranean Landscape Dynamics project offers an example
   of using the past to develop and test computational models of
   interactions between land-use and landscape evolution that ultimately
   may help guide decision-making. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Essentialist beliefs have pernicious consequences, supporting social
   stereotyping and contributing to prejudice. How does social essentialism
   develop? In the studies reported here, we tested the hypothesis that
   generic language facilitates the cultural transmission of social
   essentialism. Two studies found that hearing generic language about a
   novel social category diverse for race, ethnicity, age, and sex led
   4-y-olds and adults to develop essentialist beliefs about that social
   category. A third study documented that experimentally inducing parents
   to hold essentialist beliefs about a novel social category led them to
   produce more generic language when discussing the category with their
   children. Thus, generic language facilitates the transmission of
   essentialist beliefs about social categories from parents to children.

AB High levels of social trust and social support are associated with life
   satisfaction around the world. However, it is not known whether this
   association extends to other indicators of social capital and of
   subjective well-being globally. We examine associations between three
   measures of social capital and three indicators of subjective well-being
   in 142 low-, middle- dand high-income countries. Furthermore, we explore
   whether positive and negative feelings mirror each other or if they are
   separate constructs that behave differently in relation to social
   capital. Data comes from the Gallup World Poll, an international
   cross-sectional comparable survey conducted yearly from 2005 to 2009 for
   those 15 years of age and over. The poll represents 95% of the world's
   population. Social capital was measured with self-reports of access to
   support from relatives and friends, of volunteering to an organization
   in the past month, and of trusting others. Subjective well-being was
   measured with self-reports of life satisfaction, positive affect, and
   negative affect. We first estimate random coefficient (multi-level)
   models and then use multivariate (individual-level) Ordinary Least
   Square (OLS) regression to model subjective well-being as a function of
   social support, volunteering and social trust, controlling for age,
   gender, education, marital status, household income and religiosity. We
   found that having somebody to count on in case of need and reporting
   high levels of social trust are associated with better life evaluations
   and more positive feelings and an absence of negative feelings in most
   countries around the world. Associations, however, are stronger for
   high- and middle-income countries. Volunteering is also associated with
   better life evaluations and a higher frequency of positive emotions.
   There is not an association, however, between volunteering and
   experiencing negative feelings, except for low-income countries.
   Finally, we present evidence that the two affective components of
   subjective well-being behave differently in relation to different
   indicators of social capital and social support across countries.

AB Niche construction is a process through which organisms modify their
   environment and, as a result, alter the selection pressures on
   themselves and other species. In cultural niche construction, one or
   more cultural traits can influence the evolution of other cultural or
   biological traits by affecting the social environment in which the
   latter traits may evolve. Cultural niche construction may include either
   gene-culture or culture-culture interactions. Here we develop a model of
   this process and suggest some applications of this model. We examine the
   interactions between cultural transmission, selection, and assorting,
   paying particular attention to the complexities that arise when
   selection and assorting are both present, in which case stable
   polymorphisms of all cultural phenotypes are possible. We compare our
   model to a recent model for the joint evolution of religion and
   fertility and discuss other potential applications of cultural niche
   construction theory, including the evolution and maintenance of
   large-scale human conflict and the relationship between sex ratio bias
   and marriage customs. The evolutionary framework we introduce begins to
   address complexities that arise in the quantitative analysis of multiple
   interacting cultural traits.

AB For many, climate change is no longer recognized as the primary cause of
   cultural changes in the Near East. Instead, human landscape degradation,
   population growth, socioeconomic adjustments, and conflict have been
   proposed as the mechanisms that shaped the Neolithic Revolution.
   However, as Bar-Yosef noted, even if there is chronological correlation
   between climate changes and cultural developments, what is important is
   to understand how Neolithic societies dealt with these improving or
   deteriorating environments. Changes in bifacial stone tools provide a
   framework for examining some of these interactions by focusing on
   changing land use practices during the Neolithization process. The
   results of microwear analysis of 40 bifacial artifacts from early
   Pre-Pottery Neolithic (EPPNB) levels at Motza in the Judean hills
   document changes during the PPNA-PPNB transition at the onset of the
   Levantine Moist Period (ca. 8000 cal B.C.) when conditions for
   agriculture improved. EPPNB villagers added heavy-duty axes to a toolkit
   they had used for carpentry and began to clear forests for fields and
   grazing lands. Sustainable forest management continued for the duration
   of the PPN until the cumulative effects of tree-felling and overgrazing
   seem to have led to landscape degradation at end of the Pre-Pottery
   Neolithic C (PPNC), when a cold, dry climatic anomaly (6600-6000 cal B.
   C.) may have accelerated the reduction of woodlands. Early PPNB
   components at sites like Motza, with data from nearly five millennia of
   Neolithic occupations, show how complex hunter-gatherers and early food
   producers were able to establish sustainable resource management systems
   even as climate changed, population increased, and social relations were
   redefined.

AB Compared with other species, exchange among non-kin is a hallmark of
   human sociality in both the breadth of individuals and total resources
   involved. One hypothesis is that extensive exchange evolved to buffer
   the risks associated with hominid dietary specialization on calorie
   dense, large packages, especially from hunting. 'Lucky' individuals
   share food with 'unlucky' individuals with the expectation of
   reciprocity when roles are reversed. Cross-cultural data provide prima
   facie evidence of pair-wise reciprocity and an almost universal
   association of high-variance (HV) resources with greater exchange.
   However, such evidence is not definitive; an alternative hypothesis is
   that food sharing is really 'tolerated theft', in which individuals
   possessing more food allow others to steal from them, owing to the
   threat of violence from hungry individuals. Pair-wise correlations may
   reflect proximity providing greater opportunities for mutual theft of
   food. We report a laboratory experiment of foraging and food consumption
   in a virtual world, designed to test the risk-reduction hypothesis by
   determining whether people form reciprocal relationships in response to
   variance of resource acquisition, even when there is no external
   enforcement of any transfer agreements that might emerge. Individuals
   can forage in a high-mean, HV patch or a low-mean, low-variance (LV)
   patch. The key feature of the experimental design is that individuals
   can transfer resources to others. We find that sharing hardly occurs
   after LV foraging, but among HV foragers sharing increases dramatically
   over time. The results provide strong support for the hypothesis that
   people are pre-disposed to evaluate gains from exchange and respond to
   unsynchronized variance in resource availability through endogenous
   reciprocal trading relationships.

AB Human communication in social networks is dominated by emergent
   statistical laws such as non-trivial correlations and temporal
   clustering. Recently, we found long-term correlations in the user's
   activity in social communities. Here, we extend this work to study the
   collective behavior of the whole community with the goal of
   understanding the origin of clustering and long-term persistence. At the
   individual level, we find that the correlations in activity are a
   byproduct of the clustering expressed in the power-law distribution of
   inter-event times of single users, i.e. short periods of many events are
   separated by long periods of no events. On the contrary, the activity of
   the whole community presents long-term correlations that are a true
   emergent property of the system, i.e. they are not related to the
   distribution of inter-event times. This result suggests the existence of
   collective behavior, possibly arising from nontrivial communication
   patterns through the embedding social network.

AB This article is part of a Special Issue "Neuroendocrine-Immune Axis in
   Health and Disease."
   For humans in developed nations, socioeconomic status (SES)-relative
   income, education and occupational position in a society is a strong
   predictor of morbidity and mortality rates, with increasing SES
   predicting longer life span (e.g. Marmot et al., 1991). Mechanisms
   underlying this relationship have been examined, but the relative role
   of each mechanism still remains unknown. By understanding the relative
   role of specific mechanisms that underlie dramatic health disparities
   between high and low social status individuals we can begin to identify
   effective, targeted methods to alleviate health disparities. In the
   current paper, we take advantage of a growing number of animal studies
   that have quantified biological health-related correlates
   (glucocorticoid production and immune function) of social status and
   compare these studies to the current literature on human SES and health
   to determine if and how animal studies can further our understanding of
   SES-associated human health disparities. Specifically, we compared
   social-status related glucocorticoid production and immune function in
   humans and animals. From the review, we show that our present
   understanding of the relationships between social status and
   glucocorticoid production/immune function is still growing, but that
   there are already identifiable parallels (and non-parallels) between
   humans and animals. We propose timely areas of future study focused on
   (1) specific aspects of social status that may influence stress-related
   physiology, (2) mechanisms underlying long-term influences of social
   status on physiology and health, and (3) intervention studies to
   alleviate potentially negative physiological correlates of social
   status. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Understanding what factors contribute to alcohol abuse in
   resource-poor countries is important given its adverse health
   consequences. Past research shows that social peers influence substance
   abuse, suggesting that the social environment may be an effective target
   for reducing alcohol abuse across a population. This study investigates
   the determinants of alcohol use and abuse in rural Zimbabwe and tests a
   Community Popular Opinion Leader (CPOL) community-based intervention
   partly directed at reducing alcohol abuse.
   Methods: Tests were conducted on the impact of the CPOL intervention on
   alcohol use patterns across communities in rural Zimbabwe over three
   waves from 2003 to 2007, including community- and individual-level tests
   using data based on in-person interviews of adult men and women (ages
   18-30: N=5543). Data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests, as well
   as logistic and ordinary least-squares regression with random effects.
   Results: Higher drinking (any use, more frequent use, greater quantity,
   and/or frequent drunkenness) was generally associated with being male,
   older, not married, more highly educated, of Shona ethnicity, away from
   home frequently, employed, having no religious affiliation, or living in
   areas with a higher crude death rate or lower population density. Over
   the study period, significant declines in alcohol use and abuse were
   found in intervention and control sites at relatively equal levels.
   Conclusions: Although no support was found for the effectiveness of the
   CPOL study in reducing alcohol abuse. Zimbabwe is similar to other
   countries in the impact of socio-demographic and cultural factors on
   alcohol use and abuse. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

AB Background: Studies often demonstrate homophily in adolescent smoking
   behavior, but rarely investigate the extent to which this is due to the
   peer network processes of selection versus influence. Applying the
   concept of social distance, this study examines these two processes for
   smoking initiation.
   Methods: We analyzed socio-centric network data from the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N=2065; grades = 7th-12th).
   Social distance (degrees of separation), combined with stability and
   change in friendship networks, was used to derive indicators of peer
   selection and influence on initiation. Multilevel modeling was used to
   predict initiation from these indicators, and propensity score modeling
   was used to determine whether these associations remained after
   adjusting for pre-existing differences between initiators and consistent
   non-smokers.
   Results: We found that both peer influence and selection effects
   increased the likelihood of initiation even after adjusting with
   propensity score weights and demographic controls. While the effect size
   for peer influence depended on the overall proportion of smokers at the
   school, the selection effect was independent of the school environment.
   De-selection and indirect influence effects were not significant after
   controlling for school norm interactions.
   Conclusions: The association between peer smoking and adolescent smoking
   initiation appears to be due to both peer selection and direct
   influence. However, "friends of friends" effects are likely to be
   confounded with contextual factors. Given that smoking initiation is
   primarily associated with close personal interactions between the
   adolescent and his/her friends, prevention efforts should focus on the
   role of smoking in fostering personal relationships among adolescents.

AB Social scientists have intensely debated the use of deception in
   experimental research, and conflicting norms governing the use of
   deception are now firmly entrenched along disciplinary lines. Deception
   is typically allowed in sociology and social psychology but proscribed
   in economics. Notably, disagreements about the use of deception are
   generally not based on ethical considerations but on pragmatic grounds:
   the anti-deception camp argues that deceiving participants leads to
   invalid results, while the other side argues that deception has little
   negative impact and, under certain conditions, can even enhance
   validity. These divergent norms governing the use of deception are
   important because they stifle interdisciplinary research and discovery,
   create hostilities between disciplines and researchers, and can
   negatively impact the careers of scientists who may be sanctioned for
   following the norms of their home discipline. We present two
   experimental studies aimed at addressing the issue empirically. Study 1
   addresses the effects of direct exposure to deception, while Study 2
   addresses the effects of indirect exposure to deception. Results from
   both studies suggest that deception does not significantly affect the
   validity of experimental results.

AB American resistance to accepting evolution is uniquely high among First
   World countries. This is due largely to the extreme religiosity of the
   United States, which is much higher than that of comparably advanced
   nations, and to the resistance of many religious people to the facts and
   supposed implications of evolution. The prevalence of religious belief
   in the United States suggests that outreach by scientists alone will not
   have a huge effect in increasing the acceptance of evolution, nor will
   the strategy of trying to convince the faithful that evolution is
   compatible with their religion. Because creationism is a symptom of
   religion, another strategy to promote evolution involves loosening the
   grip of faith on America. This is easier said than done, for recent
   sociological surveys show that religion is highly correlated with the
   dysfunctionality of a society, and various measures of societal health
   show that the United States is one of the most socially dysfunctional
   First World countries. Widespread acceptance of evolution in America,
   then, may have to await profound social change.

AB Environmental migration, in its different forms, is an aspiration toward

   critical system relationships that couple human and natural systems and
   change in due course of a regime shift affecting Garifuna villages in
   Northern Honduras. The specified resilience of these relationships
   influences the course that migration takes after a flooding event. In
   impacted villages, migration is a mechanism for demographic
   fragmentation, 'downgrades' livelihood chains, and reinforces a class
   divide. Villages systems that experience a shift to uninhabitable and
   unproductive state spaces become shallow stability domains and
   consequently, perpetual exporters of migrants over an extended period of
   time. In the end, migration itself is a cascading aspect of a regime
   shift that is both ecological and social, forced and chosen.

AB Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) demonstrate increased
   visual attention and elevated brain reward circuitry responses to images
   related to circumscribed interests (CI), suggesting that a heightened
   affective response to CI may underlie their disproportionate salience
   and reward value in ASD. To determine if individuals with ASD differ
   from typically developing (TD) adults in their subjective emotional
   experience of CI object images, non-CI object images and social images,
   213 TD adults and 56 adults with ASD provided arousal ratings (sensation
   of being energized varying along a dimension from calm to excited) and
   valence ratings (emotionality varying along dimension of approach to
   withdrawal) for a series of 114 images derived from previous research on
   CI. The groups did not differ on arousal ratings for any image type, but
   ASD adults provided higher valence ratings than TD adults for CI-related
   images, and lower valence ratings for social images. Even after
   co-varying the effects of sex, the ASD group, but not the TD group, gave
   higher valence ratings to CI images than social images. These findings
   provide additional evidence that ASD is characterized by a preference
   for certain categories of non-social objects and a reduced preference
   for social stimuli, and support the dissemination of this image set for
   examining aspects of the circumscribed interest phenotype in ASD.

AB OBJECTIVE: To analyze cause-specifi c mortality rates according to the
   relative income hypothesis.
   METHODS: All 96 administrative areas of the city of Sao Paulo,
   southeastern Brazil, were divided into two groups based on the Gini
   coefficient of income inequality: high (>= 0.25) and low (<0.25). The
   propensity score matching method was applied to control for confounders
   associated with socioeconomic differences among areas.
   RESULTS: The difference between high and low income inequality areas was
   statistically significant for homicide (8.57 per 10,000; 95% CI: 2.60;
   14.53); ischemic heart disease (5.47 per 10,000 [95% CI 0.76; 10.17]);
   HIV/AIDS (3.58 per 10,000 [95% CI 0.58; 6.57]); and respiratory diseases
   (3.56 per 10,000 [95% CI 0.18; 6.94]). The ten most common causes of
   death accounted for 72.30% of the mortality difference. Infant mortality
   also had signifi cantly higher age-adjusted rates in high inequality
   areas (2.80 per 10,000 [95% CI 0.86; 4.74]), as well as among males
   (27.37 per 10,000 [95% CI 6.19; 48.55]) and females (15.07 per 10,000
   [95% CI 3.65; 26.48]).
   CONCLUSIONS: The study results support the relative income hypothesis.
   After propensity score matching cause-specifi c mortality rates was
   higher in more unequal areas. Studies on income inequality in smaller
   areas should take proper accounting of heterogeneity of social and
   demographic characteristics.

AB Objectives. We investigated associations among age, race, socioeconomic
   status (SES), and mortality in older persons and whether low SES
   contributes to the Black-White mortality crossover (when elevated age
   specific mortality rates invert).
   Methods. We used panel data from the North Carolina Established
   Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly to test the main
   and interactive effects of SES on mortality.
   Results. Discrete-time hazard models showed that the association between
   low education and mortality did not vary by race or age and was only
   significant for men. For women, the effect of low income diminished with
   age and had little impact on the crossover. For men, low income varied
   by race and age, altering the Black-White crossover and producing low
   high income crossovers at advanced ages.
   Conclusions. Low education and income were associated with increased
   mortality risk for older adults, but only low income had a differential
   impact on the Black-White mortality crossover. A primary route to
   reducing mortality differentials in later life is to prevent the
   disproportionate selective mortality of Blacks and the poor earlier in
   the life course. (Am J Public Health. 2012;102: 1566-1571.

AB Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a poor prognosis and,
   unlike most cancers, HCC incidence and mortality rates are increasing in
   the United States. While risk is known to vary among different racial
   and ethnic groups, less is known about the variability of risk within
   these groups by neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES).
   Methods: HCC cases diagnosed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End
   Results (SEER) 11 cancer registries between 1996 and 2007, and the
   population of the SEER 11 catchment areas was studied. Analyses were
   conducted to compare census tract area family poverty, educational
   attainment, and unemployment by race and ethnicity. A multiple linear
   regression model, weighted by the number of cases and the number of
   individuals in each census tract, with adjustment for registry, was used
   to calculate mean differences in area-level attributes between HCC cases
   and the population.
   Results: HCC cases in most racial/ethnic groups had lower mean
   neighborhood-level measures of SES than their referent population. An
   exception was seen among Hispanics. Comparing white cases with cases of
   other racial groups and to Hispanics, white cases lived in neighborhoods
   with less family poverty, fewer high-school dropouts, and lower
   unemployment. Compared with white cases, Asian and Pacific Islander and
   Hispanic cases lived in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of
   foreign-born population.
   Conclusions: Low neighborhood-level SES and immigrant status may be
   associated with greater risk of HCC within specific racial and ethnic
   groups.
   Impact: These findings could help to focus control resources for HCC
   toward the most affected communities. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev;

AB OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine the degree to which
   children born within the "normal term" range of 37 to 41 weeks'
   gestation vary in terms of school achievement.
   METHODS: This study analyzed data from 128 050 singleton births born
   between 37 and 41 weeks' gestation in a large US city. Data were
   extracted from city birth records to assess a number of obstetric,
   social, and economic variables, at both the individual and community
   levels. Birth data were then matched with public school records of
   standardized city-wide third-grade reading and math tests. Specifically,
   we assessed (1) whether children born within the normal term range of 37
   to 41 weeks' gestation show differences in reading and/or math ability 8
   years later as a function of gestational age, and (2) the degree to
   which a wide range of individual- and community-level social and
   biological factors mediate this effect.
   RESULTS: Analyses revealed that gestational age within the normal term
   range was significantly and positively related to reading and math
   scores in third grade, with achievement scores for children born at 37
   and 38 weeks significantly lower than those for children born at 39, 40,
   or 41 weeks. This effect was independent of birth weight, as well as a
   number of other obstetric, social, and economic factors.
   CONCLUSIONS: Earlier normal term birth may be a characteristic
   considered by researchers, clinicians, and parents to help identify
   children who may be at risk for poorer school performance. Pediatrics

AB Vision plays a privileged role in social interaction and the
   construction of intersubjective reality. Given that one of sociology's
   tasks is to problematize the taken for granted, research that examines
   rarely foregrounded non-visual modes of sensory perception is a powerful
   resource. This article draws on twenty-seven interviews that explore
   blind people's perceptions of male and female bodies. I highlight
   several distinctive features of non-visual sex attribution (salience,
   speed, and diachronicity), and argue that conceptions of sex as
   self-evident primarily reflect visual perception. These findings suggest
   the need to explore the sociology of perception as a new approach to the
   sociology of the body, and more broadly highlight the role of sensory
   perception in the social construction of reality.

AB A host of theoretical frameworks suggest associations of physiological
   signals between two individuals within a romantic relationship. However,
   few studies have provided empirical evidence of such associations using
   physiological reactivity from both partners in the dyad. In this study
   we use measures of respiration and heart rate from romantic partners
   recorded across three laboratory tasks. We examine the interrelations of
   each measure between both dyad members using coupled linear oscillators
   (Boker & Nesselroade, 2002). These models were used to capture
   oscillations in respiration and heart rate, and to examine
   interdependence in the physiological signals between both partners.
   Results show that associations were detectable within all three tasks,
   with different patterns of coupling within each task. Discussion centers
   on ways to investigate the synchrony of physiological responses across
   within relationships, including the promises of and obstacles for doing
   so.

AB Avoidant personality disorder (AvPD) has a high level of symptom overlap
   and comorbidity with generalized social anxiety disorder (GSAD). We
   examined whether the presence of comorbid AvPD adds significant
   clinically relevant information for individuals seeking treatment for
   GSAD. Results suggested that AvPD was significantly associated with
   poorer quality of life and greater disability in univariate, but not
   multivariate analyses. Endorsement of more AvPD symptoms was associated
   with increased disability, increased risk of intimacy, and lower social
   support, even after covariate adjustment. Specifically, AvPD item 3,
   hard to be "open" even with people you are close to, was most strongly
   correlated with quality of life and disability. A binary diagnosis of
   AvPD alone adds little beyond a marker of greater GSAD severity and
   depression among patients with GSAD, while a specific feature of AvPD
   not captured by the GSAD diagnosis, namely emotional guardedness, may be
   associated with greater impairment. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Objective: To evaluate the association of demographic, behavioral and
   socioeconomic factors with all-cause mortality while controlling for
   health status among a cohort of participants with severe disability
   related to spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Study design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Data were analyzed at a major medical university in the
   Southeast United States of America.
   Methods: Participants included 1361 adults with traumatic SCI of at
   least 1-year duration who were recruited through a large specialty
   hospital in the Southeast United States of America. Three Cox
   proportional hazard models were generated relating the predictors to
   all-cause mortality.
   Results: Age, disability, smoking and income were significant in the
   final model. Both current (hazard ratio (HR)=2.03, 95% confidence
   interval (CI)-1.46-2.82) and former smokers (HR-1.58, CI-1.16-2.16) were
   at elevated hazard of mortality, as were those with incomes below $10
   000 (HR=2.29, CI=1.53-3.44) and between $10 000 and $35 000 (HR=1.47,
   CI=1.03-2.10).
   Conclusions: Even after controlling for health and severity of
   disability, the coefficients for smoking and income were significant,
   exceeding that reported previously within the general population. The
   importance of these factors may be magnified after severe disability,
   even though life expectancy is already greatly diminished in this
   population. Spinal Cord (2012) 50, 609-613; doi:10.1038/sc.2012.24;

   Objectives: To examine the factors affecting return to productive

   Setting: A large southeastern rehabilitation hospital in the United
   States.
   Methods: We used hazard regression models to analyze data from newly
   injured people (n=111) participating in an educational intervention post
   discharge who were followed for up to 2 years. Outcomes were time to
   return to productive activities and employment.
   Results: Increasing age and being on Medicaid significantly decreased
   the likelihood of returning to productive activities (P < 0.01), while
   being white (P < 0.05) and having a higher median income (P < 0.001)
   significantly increased this probability. The same factors, bar being on
   Medicaid, affected the return to employment. Whites returned to
   productive activities 2.5 times sooner than African Americans and
   employment twice as fast (P < 0.001). Being in the 75th income
   percentile compared with the 25th shortened time to employment by 209

   Conclusion: Findings here suggest that income and race affect the time
   to return to productivity and employment, while being on Medicaid also
   has a role in general post injury productivity. Spinal Cord (2012) 50,

AB Past research in both the transitions to adulthood literature and
   cultural sociology more broadly suggests that the working class relies
   on traditional cultural models in their construction of identity. In the
   contemporary post-industrial world, however, traditional life pathways
   are now much less available to working-class men and women. I draw on 93
   interviews with black and white working-class young people in their 20s
   to 30s and ask, in an era of increasing uncertainty, where traditional
   markers of adulthood have become tenuous, what kinds of cultural models
   do working-class young people employ to validate their adult identities?
   In contrast to previous studies of working-class identity, I found that
   respondents embraced a model of therapeutic selfhood-that is, an
   inwardly directed self preoccupied with its own psychic development. I
   demonstrate that the therapeutic narrative allows working-class men and
   women to redefine competent adulthood in terms of overcoming a painful
   family past. Respondents required a witness to validate their
   performances of adulthood, however, and the inability to find one left
   many lost in transition.

   animals hold for people. Using a selective review of their research,
   this essay outlines how a focus on understanding meaning can inform
   anthrozoological research. Arluke's research on animal abuse reveals how
   harm must be defined in context. Sanders's research on canine-human
   relationships documents how people come to understand companion dogs as
   persons. Both bodies of work rely on careful observation and listening
   to those who interact with animals. The resulting insights hold

AB Although it has been previously reported that patients with inflammatory
   breast cancer (IBC) experience worse survival than patients with other
   breast cancer (BC) types, the socioeconomic and ethnic factors leading
   to this survival difference are not fully understood. The association
   between county-level percent of persons below the poverty level and
   BC-specific (BCS) survival for cases diagnosed from 1990 to 2008 in the
   Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database linked to
   census derived county attributes was examined. A sub-analysis of cases
   from 2000 to 2008 also examined BCS survival by an index combining
   percent below poverty and less than high school graduates as well as
   metropolitan versus non-metropolitan county of residence. The
   Kaplan-Meier estimator was used to construct survival curves by stage,
   inflammatory status, and county-level socioeconomic position (SEP).
   Stage and inflammatory status stratified proportional hazards models,
   adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, tumor and treatment characteristics
   were used to determine the hazard of BCS death by county-level SEP.
   Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated IBC has worse survival than stage
   matched non-IBC, (stage III IBC median survival = 4.75 years vs. non-IBC
   = 13.4 years, p < 0.0001). Residing in a lower SEP, non-metro county
   significantly worsens BCS survival for non-IBC in multivariate
   proportional hazards models. African American cases appear to have worse
   survival than non-Hispanic Whites regardless of inflammatory status,
   stage, county-level SEP, tumor, or treatment characteristics. This is
   the first study to examine IBC survival by SEP in a nation-wide
   population-based tumor registry. As this analysis found generally poorer
   survival for IBC, regardless of SEP or race/ethnicity, it is important
   that interventions that help educate women on IBC symptoms target women
   in various SEP and race/ethnicity groups.

AB A central feature of human psychology is our pervasive tendency to
   divide the social world into "us" and "them". We prefer to associate
   with those who are similar to us over those who are different,
   preferentially allocate resources to similar others, and hold more
   positive beliefs about similar others. Here we investigate the
   developmental origins of these biases, asking if preference for similar
   others occurs prior to language and extensive exposure to cultural
   norms. We demonstrate that, like adults, prelinguistic infants prefer
   those who share even trivial similarities with themselves, and these
   preferences appear to reflect a cognitive comparison process ("like
   me"/"not like me"). However, unlike adults, infants do not appear to
   prefer others with an utterly arbitrary similarity to themselves.
   Together, these findings suggest that the phenomena of ingroup bias, and
   enhanced interpersonal attraction toward those who resemble ourselves,
   may be rooted in an inherent preference for similarity to self, which
   itself may be enhanced during development by the influence of cultural
   values. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Americans are not saving enough for retirement. Previous research
   suggests that this is due, in part, to people's tendency to think of the
   future self as more like another person than like the present self,
   making saving feel like giving money away rather than like investing in
   oneself. Using objective employer saving data, a field experiment
   capitalized on this phenomenon to increase saving. It compared the
   effectiveness of a novel message-one appealing to people's sense of
   "social" responsibility to their future selves-with a more traditional
   appeal to people's sense of rational self-interest. The
   social-responsibility-tothe-future-self message resulted in larger
   increases in saving than the self-interest message, but only to the
   extent that people felt a strong "social" connection to their future
   selves. These results broaden our understanding of the psychology of
   moral responsibility and refine our understanding of the role of
   future-self continuity in fostering intertemporal patience. They further
   demonstrate how understanding conceptions of the self over time can
   suggest solutions to important and challenging policy problems.

AB Background and Purpose-Initial stroke severity is one of the strongest
   predictors of eventual stroke outcome. However, predictors of initial
   stroke severity have not been well-described within a population. We
   hypothesized that poorer patients would have a higher initial stroke
   severity on presentation to medical attention.
   Methods-We identified all cases of hospital-ascertained ischemic stroke
   occurring in 2005 within a biracial population of 1.3 million.
   "Community" socioecomic status was determined for each patient based on
   the percentage below poverty in the census tract in which the patient
   resided. Linear regression was used to model the effect of socioeconomic
   status on stroke severity. Models were adjusted for race, gender, age,
   prestroke disability, and history of medical comorbidities.
   Results-There were 1895 ischemic stroke events detected in 2005 included
   in this analysis; 22% were black, 52% were female, and the mean age was
   71 years (range, 19-104). The median National Institutes of Health
   Stroke Scale was 3 (range, 0-40). The poorest community socioeconomic
   status was associated with a significantly increased initial National
   Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by 1.5 points (95% confidence
   interval, 0.5-2.6; P<0.001) compared with the richest category in the
   univariate analysis, which increased to 2.2 points after adjustment for
   demographics and comorbidities.
   Conclusions-We found that increasing community poverty was associated
   with worse stroke severity at presentation, independent of other known
   factors associated with stroke outcomes. Socioeconomic status may impact
   stroke severity via medication compliance, access to care, and cultural
   factors, or may be a proxy measure for undiagnosed disease states.

AB Background Existing research has found a positive association between
   cognitive function and residence in a socioeconomically advantaged
   neighbourhood. Yet, the mechanisms underlying this relationship have not
   been empirically investigated.
   Objective To test the hypothesis that neighbourhood socioeconomic
   structure is related to cognitive function partly through the
   availability of neighbourhood physical and social resources (eg,
   recreational facilities, community centres and libraries), which promote
   cognitively beneficial activities such as exercise and social
   integration.
   Methods Using data from a representative survey of community-dwelling
   adults in the city of Chicago (N=949 adults aged 50 and over), cognitive
   function was assessed with a modified version of the Telephone Interview
   for Cognitive Status instrument. Neighbourhood socioeconomic structure
   was derived from US census indicators. Systematic social observation was
   used to directly document the presence of neighbourhood resources on the
   blocks surrounding each respondent's residence.
   Results Using multilevel linear regression, residence in an affluent
   neighbourhood had a net positive effect on cognitive function after
   adjusting for individual risk factors. For white respondents, the
   effects of neighbourhood affluence operated in part through a greater
   density of institutional resources (eg, community centres) that promote
   cognitively beneficial activities such as physical activity. Stable
   residence in an elderly neighbourhood was associated with higher
   cognitive function (potentially due to greater opportunities for social
   interaction with peers), but long term exposure to such neighbourhoods
   was negatively related to cognition.
   Conclusions Neighbourhood resources have the potential to promote
   'cognitive reserve' for adults who are ageing in place in an urban
   setting.

   historical factors set the stage for these trends and, perhaps more
   importantly, their origins. Specifically, the authors analyze Russian
   history, culture, and state ideology to explore the connections between
   masculinities and alcohol and to apply existing sociological theories of
   gender to this unique social context. The authors employ the concept of
   hegemonic masculinity to examine the historical dimensions of
   working-class drinking and its impact on Russian men's health. The
   authors also identify one of the important origins of men's harmful
   drinking practices by focusing on the historical construction and
   enactment of masculinities in two prominent social fields-the tavern and
   the workplace. The authors' focus upon Russian history and culture
   emphasizes the sociohistorical factors associated with negative drinking
   patterns, and consequent health problems, among men in this part of the

AB Theory and empirical data from a variety of disciplines strongly imply
   that recent human history involves extensive gene-culture coevolution,
   much of it as a direct result of human agricultural practices. Here we
   draw on niche-construction theory (NCT) and gene-culture coevolutionary
   theory (GCT) to propose a broad theoretical framework (NCT-GCT) with
   which archaeologists and anthropologists can explore coevolutionary
   dynamics. Humans are enormously potent niche constructors, and
   understanding how niche construction regulates ecosystem dynamics is
   central to understanding the impact of human populations on their
   ecological and developmental environments. We use as primary examples
   the evolution of dairying by Neolithic groups in Europe and Africa and
   the rise of the "sickle-cell allele" among certain agricultural groups
   in West Africa and suggest that these examples are broadly
   representative of much of human recent history. Although the core
   aspects of these case studies are familiar, we lay out the examples with
   a specific NCT-GCT focus, which allows us to highlight how archaeology,
   when coupled with genetic research, can play an important role in better
   understanding human history. Finally, we suggest that the NCT-GCT
   perspective is likely to be of widespread general utility because it
   inherently promotes consideratiwon of the active agency of humans, and
   other organisms, in modifying their ecological and developmental niches
   and naturally draws attention to the various forms of feedback that flow
   from human activities at multiple levels, in multiple populations, and
   across multiple species.

   decline. Adolescent mothers and their offspring are at risk for negative
   outcomes. Recent literature exploring the consequences of teenage
   childbearing and interventions to ameliorate these consequences are
   presented.
   Recent findings
   Negative consequences of adolescent childbearing can impact mothers and
   their offspring throughout the lifespan. These consequences are likely
   attributable to social and environmental factors rather than solely to
   maternal age. Increasing educational attainment, preventing repeat
   pregnancy and improving mother-child interactions can improve outcomes
   for mothers and their children. Home, community, school and clinic-based
   programs are all viable models of service delivery to this population.
   Summary
   Connecting teen mothers with comprehensive services to meet their
   social, economic, health and educational needs can potentially improve
   long-term outcomes for both mothers and their offspring. Programs that
   deliver care to this population in culturally sensitive, developmentally
   appropriate ways have demonstrated success. Future investigation of
   parenting interventions with larger sample sizes and that assess
   multiple outcomes will allow comparison among programs. Explorations of
   the role of the father and coparenting are also directions for future
   research.

AB This study examined multiple types of forgiveness as predictors of
   mortality and potential psychosocial, spiritual, and health mechanisms
   of the effects of forgiveness on longevity. Data from a nationally
   representative sample of United States adults ages 66 and older assessed
   forgiveness, health, religiousness/spirituality, and socio-demographics
   (N = 1,232). God's unconditional forgiveness and conditional forgiveness
   of others initially emerged as statistically significant predictors of
   mortality risk. However, only conditional forgiveness of others remained
   a significant predictor of mortality after controlling for religious,
   socio-demographic, and health behavior variables. Mediators of the
   association between conditional forgiveness of others and mortality were
   examined, and a statistically significant indirect effect was identified
   involving physical health. These findings suggest that conditional
   forgiveness of others is associated with risk for all-cause mortality,
   and that the mortality risk of conditional forgiveness may be conferred
   by its influences on physical health.

AB Despite mounting evidence for a strong and persistent association
   between socioeconomic status (SES) and health, this relationship is
   largely unknown among Asian immigrants, a fast growing minority group in
   the US population. Previous research has typically focused on objective
   SES (primarily education and income) and ignored self-perceived SES.
   Using data from the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) (N
   = 1,570), we examined the impact of subjective as well as objective SES
   upon multiple self-reported health outcomes among Asian immigrants.
   Results indicated that conventional SES indicators by and large were
   non-significantly related to self-rated physical health, physical
   discomfort, self-rated mental health, and psychological distress. In
   contrast, subjective SES relative to people in the United States and
   people in the community showed strong associations with health outcomes
   above and beyond conventional SES markers. This study suggested a
   promising avenue to incorporate subjective SES in health disparities
   research, especially among immigrants.

   GNN peer preferences differ from children with gender normative (GN)
   peer preferences in problem behaviors? Second, do GNN and GN children
   differ in sociability and isolation and do they have differential
   socialization opportunities with externalizing, internalizing, and
   socially competent peers? We employed a Bayesian approach for
   classifying children as GNN based on their peer preferences as compared
   to their peers using a sample of Head Start preschool children from a
   large Southwestern city (N = 257; 53 % boys; M age = 51 months; 66 %
   Mexican American). To calculate socialization opportunities, we assessed
   affiliation to each child in the class and weighted that by each peer's
   characteristics to determine the exposure that each child had to
   different kinds of peers. GN children of both sexes interacted more with
   same-sex peers, which may limit learning of different styles of
   interaction. As compared to GN children, GNN children exhibited more
   engagement in other-sex activities and with other-sex play partners and
   GNN children experienced somewhat fewer peer interactions, but did not
   differ on problem behaviors or social competence. Boys with GNN peer
   preferences had increased exposure to peers with problem behaviors. GNN
   girls experienced little exposure to peers with problem behaviors, but
   they also had little exposure to socially competent peers, which may
   reduce learning social skills from peers. Implications of these findings
   for future socialization and development will be discussed.

AB Asian Americans have been understudied with respect to sexuality and
   rape and its contributory factors. Some attitudinal research has shown
   that Asian American college males tend to hold more rape-supportive
   beliefs than their White counterparts. Generally, this research treats
   ethnicity as a proxy for culture rather than examining specific facets
   of culture per se. The current study incorporated measures of
   misogynistic beliefs, acculturation, and ethnic identity to investigate
   these ethnic differences in rape-supportive attitudes. White (n = 222)
   and Asian American (n = 155) college men read an acquaintance rape
   vignette and evaluated it on four judgments: how much they blamed the
   perpetrator and the victim, how credible they viewed the victim's
   refusal, and to what degree they defined the event as rape. Consistent
   with previous research, Asian American men made more rape-supportive
   judgments than Whites. This relationship was partially mediated by
   misogynistic beliefs for all judgments except the extent to which they
   defined the vignette as rape. Among Asian Americans, acculturation was
   negatively associated with all four rape vignette judgments above and
   beyond generational status, and ethnic identity was positively
   associated with two of the four judgments above and beyond acculturation
   and generational status. These findings suggest that cultural constructs
   are relevant to understanding rape-supportive attitudes among Asian
   American men, and may be useful for promoting culturally enhanced
   theoretical models of rape and sexual assault prevention efforts, as
   well as a deeper understanding of cultural influences on sexuality.

AB The current generation of college students commonly uses the Internet
   for myriad sexually-related purposes. Yet, it has been suggested that
   usage of the Internet for sexual purposes might lead to psychological
   problems. In this study, undergraduate students from a public university
   in the U.S. (n = 320) and Peru (n = 251) completed questionnaires
   addressing their online sexual activity (OSA), psychological adjustment,
   and family environment and communication. Results indicated that
   Peruvians used the Internet significantly more than U.S. students to
   view sexually-explicit material (SEM), find sexual partners, and search
   for sex-related information. Men, irrespective of nationality, used the
   Internet to view SEM significantly more than women. Social support,
   religiosity, and erotophilia were found to moderate the relations
   between nationality and OSA. In absolute terms, both national groups, on
   average, engaged in OSA a relatively low number of hours each week.
   Further, no differences were found in maladjustment between those who
   engage in OSA and those who do not, suggesting that concerns over OSA
   are probably unwarranted.

AB Participatory processes for obtaining residents' input about community
   impacts of proposed environmental management actions have long raised
   concerns about who participates in public involvement efforts and whose
   interests they represent. This study explored methods of broad-based
   involvement and the role of deliberation in social impact assessment.
   Interactive community forums were conducted in 27 communities to solicit
   public input on proposed alternatives for recovering wild salmon in the
   Pacific Northwest US. Individuals identified by fellow residents as most
   active and involved in community affairs ("AE residents") were invited
   to participate in deliberations about likely social impacts of proposed
   engineering and ecological actions such as dam removal. Judgments of
   these AE participants about community impacts were compared with the
   judgments of residents motivated to attend a forum out of personal
   interest, who were designated as self-selected ("SS") participants.
   While the magnitude of impacts rated by SS participants across all
   communities differed significantly from AE participants' ratings,
   in-depth analysis of results from two community case studies found that
   both AE and SS participants identified a large and diverse set of unique
   impacts, as well as many of the same kinds of impacts. Thus, inclusion
   of both kinds of residents resulted in a greater range of impacts for
   consideration in the environmental impact study. The case study results
   also found that the extent to which similar kinds of impacts are
   specified by AE and SS group members can differ by type of community.
   Study results caution against simplistic conclusions drawn from this
   approach to community-wide public participation. Nonetheless, the
   results affirm that deliberative methods for community-based impact
   assessment involving both AE and SS residents can provide a more
   complete picture of perceived impacts of proposed restoration
   activities.

AB Racial identification shapes self-concept and how people share in and

   neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the role of the neural default
   network in self-referential and empathic processing. However, how racial
   identification affects neural processing of social information remains
   unknown. Here, we examined the effect of racial identification on neural
   response related to social perception among African American and
   Caucasian American individuals using functional magnetic resonance
   imaging. Our results demonstrate that degree of racial identification
   predicts activity within cortical midline structures of the default
   network in response to viewing racial ingroup, relative to outgroup
   members, and activity within the medial temporal lobe subsystem of the
   default network in response to viewing racial outgroup, relative to
   ingroup members. Broadly, our findings suggest that the strength of
   racial identification is associated with differential recruitment of
   neural and cognitive processes to understand and respond to other people
   within and outside of one's racial group. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. (c) 2011

   to change the economic and social trends now deepening the human
   predicament: overpopulation and continuing population growth,
   overconsumption by rich societies, resource depletion, environmental
   degradation, and inequitable distribution of wealth within and between
   societies. Certain points often overlooked include: the demographic
   contribution to environmental deterioration; climate disruption, global
   toxification, and a decay of biodiversity and ecosystem services; and
   economic growth of the rich, which hurts everyone in the long term.
   Perpetual economic growth is biophysically impossible; the culture gap
   impedes solutions; and all the factors are intertwined. Potential
   solutions include: empowering women and providing family planning
   services to all sexually active people; reducing overconsumption and
   helping the poor; overhauling education systems, including universities;
   adapting to changes that are inevitable; and improving food production
   and distribution systems. Hope comes from growing worldwide grassroots

AB Background: Autism incidence and prevalence have increased dramatically
   in the last two decades. The autism caseload in California increased
   600% between 1992 and 2006, yet there is little consensus as to the
   cause. Studying the seasonality of conceptions of children later
   diagnosed with autism may yield clues to potential etiological drivers.
   Objective: To assess if the conceptions of children later diagnosed with
   autism cluster temporally in a systematic manner and whether any pattern
   of temporal clustering persists over time.
   Method: We searched for seasonality in conceptions of children later
   diagnosed with autism by applying a one-dimensional scan statistic with
   adaptive temporal windows on case and control population data from
   California for 1992 through 2000. We tested for potential confounding
   effects from known risk factors using logistic regression models.
   Results: There is a consistent but decreasing seasonal pattern in the
   risk of conceiving a child later diagnosed with autism in November for
   the first half of the study period. Temporal clustering of autism
   conceptions is not an artifact of composition with respect to known risk
   factors for autism such as socio-economic status.
   Conclusion: There is some evidence of seasonality in the risk of
   conceiving a child later diagnosed with autism. Searches for
   environmental factors related to autism should allow for the possibility
   of risk factors or etiological drivers that are seasonally patterned and
   that appear and remain salient for a discrete number of years.

AB Background: Eliminating socioeconomic disparities in health is an
   overarching goal of the U.S. Healthy People decennial initiatives. We
   present recent trends in mortality by education among working-aged
   populations.
   Methods and Findings: Age-standardized death rates and their average
   annual percent change for all-cause and five major causes (cancer, heart
   disease, stroke, diabetes, and accidents) were calculated from 1993
   through 2007 for individuals aged 25-64 years by educational attainment
   as a marker of socioeconomic status, using national vital registration
   data for 26 states with consistent educational information on the death
   certificates. Rate ratios and rate differences were used to assess
   disparities (<= 12 versus >= 16 years of education) for 1993 through
   2007. From 1993 through 2007, relative educational disparities in
   all-cause mortality continued to increase among working-aged men and
   women in the U. S., due to larger decreases of mortality rates among the
   most educated coupled with smaller decreases or even worsening trends in
   the less educated. For example, the rate ratios of all-cause mortality
   increased from 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-2.6) in 1993 to
   3.6 (95% CI, 3.5-3.7) in 2007 in men and from 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8-2.0) to
   3.0 (95% CI, 2.9-3.1) in women. Generally, the rate differences (per
   100,000 persons) of all-cause mortality increased from 415.5 (95% CI,
   399.1-431.9) in 1993 to 472.7 (95% CI, 460.2-485.2) in 2007 in men and
   from 165.4 (95% CI, 154.5-176.2) to 256.2 (95% CI, 248.3-264.2) in
   women. Disparity patterns varied largely across the five specific causes
   considered in this study, with the largest increases of relative
   disparities for accidents, especially in women.
   Conclusions: Relative educational differentials in mortality continued
   to widen among men and women despite emphasis on reducing disparities in
   the U. S. Healthy People decennial initiatives.

AB Identifying social influence in networks is critical to understanding

   experimentation to identify influence and susceptibility in networks
   while avoiding the biases inherent in traditional estimates of social
   contagion. Estimation in a representative sample of 1.3 million Facebook
   users showed that younger users are more susceptible to influence than
   older users, men are more influential than women, women influence men
   more than they influence other women, and married individuals are the
   least susceptible to influence in the decision to adopt the product
   offered. Analysis of influence and susceptibility together with network
   structure revealed that influential individuals are less susceptible to
   influence than noninfluential individuals and that they cluster in the
   network while susceptible individuals do not, which suggests that
   influential people with influential friends may be instrumental in the
   spread of this product in the network.

AB Urban scaling relations characterizing how diverse properties of cities
   vary on average with their population size have recently been shown to
   be a general quantitative property of many urban systems around the
   world. However, in previous studies the statistics of urban indicators
   were not analyzed in detail, raising important questions about the full
   characterization of urban properties and how scaling relations may
   emerge in these larger contexts. Here, we build a self-consistent
   statistical framework that characterizes the joint probability
   distributions of urban indicators and city population sizes across an
   urban system. To develop this framework empirically we use one of the
   most granular and stochastic urban indicators available, specifically
   measuring homicides in cities of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico, three
   nations with high and fast changing rates of violent crime. We use these
   data to derive the conditional probability of the number of homicides
   per year given the population size of a city. To do this we use Bayes'
   rule together with the estimated conditional probability of city size
   given their number of homicides and the distribution of total homicides.
   We then show that scaling laws emerge as expectation values of these
   conditional statistics. Knowledge of these distributions implies, in
   turn, a relationship between scaling and population size distribution
   exponents that can be used to predict Zipf's exponent from urban
   indicator statistics. Our results also suggest how a general statistical
   theory of urban indicators may be constructed from the stochastic
   dynamics of social interaction processes in cities.

   Further analysis shows that whites' tolerance of black neighbors is
   closely associated with their overall racial attitudes toward blacks.

AB The term "network interventions" describes the process of using social
   network data to accelerate behavior change or improve organizational
   performance. In this Review, four strategies for network interventions
   are described, each of which has multiple tactical alternatives. Many of
   these tactics can incorporate different mathematical algorithms.
   Consequently, researchers have many intervention choices at their
   disposal. Selecting the appropriate network intervention depends on the
   availability and character of network data, perceived characteristics of
   the behavior, its existing prevalence, and the social context of the
   program.

TI Stigma and restriction on the social life of families of children with
   intellectual disabilities in Vietnam
SO SINGAPORE MEDICAL JOURNAL

PD JUL 2012
PY 2012
AB INTRODUCTION Intellectual disabilities are as prevalent in East Asian
   countries as in the West (0.06%-1.3%). Widespread discrimination against
   intellectual disabilities in Asia may initiate stigma that places unfair
   restrictions on the social life of these individuals and their
   caregivers. We utilised established stigma frameworks to assess the
   extent to which a child's intellectual disability contributes to the
   social exclusion of caregivers in Vietnam.
   METHODS A mixed quantitative and qualitative approach was employed to
   examine the experience of social life restriction among parents of
   children with intellectual disabilities. The child's disability level
   and restrictions on caregivers' social experiences were assessed among
   70 mothers and fathers recruited from schools in Hue City, Vietnam.
   Qualitative responses describing social exclusion were also recorded.
   RESULTS Caregivers reported elevated levels of social exclusion. As
   hypothesised, parents of children with greater intellectual disability
   experienced more restrictions on their social life (Beta = 0.79, 95%
   confidence interval 0.27-1.30, standard error = 0.26, p < 0.01).
   Qualitative analyses indicated that the threatening of core cultural
   norms (inability to be employed or married upsets community harmony)
   initiated labelling, social exclusion and efforts to keep the condition
   secret or withdraw from others.
   CONCLUSION This study is among the first to demonstrate the impacts of
   intellectual disabilities on caregivers' social functioning in Asia. The
   findings illustrate how traditional Asian norms initiate stigma, which
   in turn restricts key social interactions among caregivers.
   Psycho-educational interventions may address the social domains in which
   caregivers are impacted and encourage sustained help-seeking among
   caregivers for their children.

AB Purpose: This study explores the health care experience of individuals
   with disabilities and how this knowledge can guide health care
   professionals in providing effective and compassionate care for persons
   with disabilities.
   Methods: Participants' experiences about the health care they received
   were quantitatively analyzed for common themes.
   Results: Participants most often discussed the process of how they came
   to receive their official disability diagnosis. Another recurrent theme
   was disability etiology, in which participants described the events or
   process that resulted in a disability. Two other frequent themes,
   normality and others' perceptions of disability, centered upon what it
   means to be "normal" or others' assumptions about what it means to be
   "normal" (as opposed to having a disability). Family support and
   struggles, experiences with medical professionals and hospitals, and
   barriers to inclusion and accommodations were the other key themes.
   Conclusion: This study provides insights to aspects of living with a
   disability that individuals with disabilities felt were important for
   health care professionals to know. Being aware of these topics may help
   health care providers in establishing good communication with their
   patients who have a disability.

AB Stigma towards people living with HIV is pervasive in China and related
   to poor service utilization, psychosocial distress and diminished
   quality of life (QOL). In an effort to identify mechanisms to reduce HIV
   stigma and its negative consequences, we examined whether social support
   mediates the relation between enacted stigma and both depressive
   symptoms and QOL among 120 HIV outpatients in Beijing, China. Generally,
   perceived social support was associated with less stigma, less
   depressive symptomatology and better QOL. Using multivariable regression
   models, we found that social support was a full mediator of the impact
   of stigma on both depressive symptomatology and QOL. The findings
   suggest social support may be an important target of interventions to
   reduce the impact of stigma on poor psychosocial health outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the progress of neurosurgical practices in
   Tanzania, taking into account humanitarian, socioeconomic, and
   geographic influences.
   METHOD: Articles, records, and historical texts were consulted to
   establish a timeline and history of neurosurgery in Tanzania.
   RESULTS: Reulen, a German neurosurgeon, was integral to the development
   of sustainable neurosurgical services in Tanzania. By training
   Tanzanians who returned to their country to practice, Reulen helped to
   establish a continuity of care and legacy on which future Tanzanian
   surgeons could build. Subsequently, as neurosurgical services were
   integrated into the Muhimbili Orthopedic Institute, surgeons found a
   hospital to call home and a place to focus their efforts. Neurosurgical
   services have now been offered to the Tanzanian people for >40 years, a
   direct consequence of international influences coupled with certain
   extraordinary Tanzanian physicians.
   CONCLUSIONS: Neurosurgery in Tanzania and Africa more generally has a
   long history; however, it was not until more recent efforts of certain
   local pioneers and educational advisors abroad that modernization
   occurred. The progress of the past 50 years is substantial and with
   continued efforts advances will continue to be made.

AB Social anhedonia is a promising vulnerability marker for
   schizophrenia-spectrum pathology. Prior research has demonstrated that
   individuals with psychometrically-defined social anhedonia show a range
   of "schizophrenia-like" neurocognitive abnormalities. However, this
   research is limited in that it is based largely on the study of college
   students. The present article reports findings from a longitudinal study
   of social anhedonia recruited from a community sample. As part of this
   study, a neurocognitive battery was administered at baseline and at
   three-year follow-up sessions to participants with (n = 78) versus
   without (n = 77) social anhedonia. Additional measures of global
   functioning and schizotypal, schizoid and paranoid
   schizophrenia-spectrum symptoms were also administered. Across groups,
   subjects showed significant improvement in neurocognitive functioning
   over time. Compared to controls, at follow-up, individuals with social
   anhedonia showed significantly poorer attentional vigilance and simple
   processing speed, but failed to evidence impairments in immediate or
   delayed verbal memory, immediate or delayed visual memory, visual or
   verbal working memory, olfaction or executive abilities. At follow-up,
   within the social anhedonia group, schizoid (and to a lesser extent,
   schizotypal) symptom severity was associated with a range of
   neurocognitive impairments. Neurocognitive impairments were generally
   not associated with paranoid symptoms or global functioning. Baseline
   neurocognitive performance was not significantly predictive of follow-up
   symptom severity or functioning. Collectively, these findings suggest
   that neurocognitive dysfunctions only characterize a subset of
   individuals with social anhedonia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Objective. This paper explores the impact of contextual variables at the
   neighborhood level on a health marker in the city of Hermosillo, Mexico
   and discusses the importance of collaboration between planners and
   health professional to minimize the negative effect of contextual
   factors on urban health. Materials and methods. Few studies in Mexico
   have assessed health outcomes at the intra-urban scale and their
   interaction with neighborhood-level contextual variables. Using spatial
   analysis and geographical information systems, the paper explores the
   association between infant mortality and an index of socio-environmental
   vulnerability used to measure urban contextual factors. Results. Two
   high infant mortality clusters were detected within neighborhoods
   characterized by relatively good environmental conditions and one in a
   neighborhood with a poor environment. Conclusions. Our results show the
   clustering of high infant mortality areas and some association with
   built environment factors in Hermosillo. The results support the need to
   reconnect public health and urban planning as a way to create healthier
   environments in Mexican cities.

AB Objectives. We examined the social patterning of cumulative
   dysregulation of multiple systems, or allostatic load, among African
   Americans adults.
   Methods. We examined the cross-sectional associations of socioeconomic
   status (SES) with summary indices of allostatic load and neuroendocrine,
   metabolic, autonomic, and immune function components in 4048 Jackson
   Heart Study participants.
   Results. Lower education and income were associated with higher
   allostatic load scores in African American adults. Patterns were most
   consistent for the metabolic and immune dimensions, less consistent for
   the autonomic dimension, and absent for the neuroendocrine dimension
   among African American women. Associations of SES with the global
   allostatic load score and the metabolic and immune domains persisted
   after adjustment for behavioral factors and were stronger for income
   than for education. There was some evidence that the neuroendocrine
   dimension was inversely associated with SES after behavioral adjustment
   in men, but the immune and autonomic components did not show clear dose
   response trends, and we observed no associations for the metabolic
   component.
   Conclusions. Findings support our hypothesis that allostatic load is
   socially patterned in African American women, but this pattern is less
   consistent in African American men. (Am J Public Health.

AB Objectives. We examined temporal and regional trends in the prevalence

   Methods. We used 1994 to 2007 data from the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System to assess 4 healthy lifestyle characteristics:
   having a healthy weight, not smoking, consuming fruits and vegetables,
   and engaging in physical activity. The concurrent presence of all 4
   characteristics was defined as a healthy overall lifestyle. We used
   logistic regression to assess temporal and regional trends.
   Results. The percentages of individuals who did not smoke (4% increase)
   and had a healthy weight (10% decrease) showed the strongest temporal
   changes from 1994 to 2007. There was little change in fruit and
   vegetable consumption or physical activity. The prevalence of healthy
   lifestyles increased minimally over time and varied modestly across
   regions; in 2007, percentages were higher in the Northeast (6%) and West
   (6%) than in the South (4%) and Midwest (4%).
   Conclusions. Because of the large increases in overweight and the
   declines in smoking, there was little net change in the prevalence of
   healthy lifestyles. Despite regional differences, the prevalence of
   healthy lifestyles across the United States remains very low. (Am J

AB Background: To compare the skin and breast/cervical cancer prevention
   /screening practices of adult siblings of childhood cancer survivors
   with controls and to identify modifying factors for these practices.
   Methods: Cross-sectional, self-report data from 2,588 adult siblings of
   5+ year survivors of childhood cancer were analyzed to assess cancer
   prevention/screening practices. Two age, sex, and race/ethnicity-matched
   samples (N = 5,915 and N = 37,789) of the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System participants served as the comparison populations.
   Sociodemographic and cancer-related data were explored as modifying
   factors for sibling cancer prevention/screening practices through
   multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: Compared with controls, siblings were more likely to practice
   skin cancer prevention behaviors: use of protective clothing [OR, 2.85;
   95% confidence interval (CI), 2.39-3.39], use of shade (OR, 2.11; 95%
   CI, 1.88-2.36), use of sunscreen (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14-1.40), and
   wearing a hat (OR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.58-1.98). No differences were noted
   for breast/cervical cancer screening including mammography and Pap
   testing. Having less than a high school education and lack of health
   insurance were associated with diminished cancer prevention/screening
   behaviors. Survivor diagnosis, treatment intensity, adverse health,
   chronic health conditions, and second cancers were not associated with
   sibling cancer prevention /screening behaviors.
   Conclusions: Siblings of cancer survivors report greater skin cancer
   prevention practices when compared with controls; however, no
   differences were noted for breast/cervical cancer screening practices.
   Access to care and lack of education may be associated with decreased
   cancer prevention /screening behaviors. Interventions are needed to
   address these barriers.

AB The purpose of this study was to examine cohort comparisons in levels of
   resources (e.g., mental health, physical functioning, economic and
   social resources, and cognitive functioning) for 211 community-dwelling
   centenarians (whose Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 23 or
   higher) of phases I and III of the Georgia Centenarian Study. The
   earlier cohort was defined as those born between 1881 and 1895 (part of
   phase I) and the later cohort included persons born between 1901 and
   1907 (part of phase III). Five specific domains were compared: mental
   health; mental status; physical functioning; social resources; and
   economic resources. Results showed that there were significant cohort
   comparisons in five domains: mental health; mental status; physical
   functioning; social networks; and economic resources. Findings suggest
   that the later centenarian cohort was more satisfied with life, felt
   less depressed, showed less positive or negative emotion, had higher
   scores on perceived economic status, and higher levels of physical and
   cognitive functioning when compared to the earlier cohort. In
   conclusion, our findings suggest that recent cohorts of centenarians may
   be better off than previous ones with respect to several areas of
   individual resources. This study suggests that, even as the number of
   centenarians increases and some proportion of centenarians experience
   severe deterioration at the end of their life, there are improvements of
   functioning, health, and overall life quality among advanced older
   adults.

AB Hatching failure occurs in approximately 10% of all avian eggs, but
   varies both within and among species. This reduction in viable offspring
   can have significant fitness consequences for breeding parents;
   therefore, it is important to understand which factors influence
   variation in hatching failure among populations. Previous research
   suggests that hatching failure is higher in a suburban than in a
   wildland population in the Florida scrub-jay. From 2003 to 2007, we
   performed two experiments to examine whether increased hatching failure
   in the suburbs resulted from 1) increased length of off-bouts during
   incubation (predation risk hypothesis, 20032004) or 2) increased
   exposure to ambient temperature during laying (egg viability hypothesis,
   20052007). Hatching failure was higher for females that took fewer
   off-bouts, but the length of those off-bouts did not influence hatching
   failure. Thus, nest predation risk does not appear to explain higher
   hatching failure in the suburbs. Alternatively, hatching failure
   increased with increasing exposure of eggs to ambient conditions during
   the laying period. First-laid eggs in the suburbs had the greatest
   pre-incubation exposure to ambient temperature and the greatest rate of
   hatching failure, consistent with the egg viability hypothesis.
   Urbanization influences hatching failure through a series of complex
   interactions. Access to predictable food sources advances mean laying
   date in suburban scrub-jays, leading to larger clutch sizes. Because
   scrub-jays begin incubation with the ultimate egg, first-laid eggs in
   the suburbs may be exposed to ambient temperatures for longer periods,
   thus reducing their viability.

AB Objective: Utilizing an experimental vignette design, this study
   assessed attitudes in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan toward the
   implementation of foster care as an alternative to institutions for
   children in need of care and protection. Methods: A sample of 111 adults
   were surveyed in Amman and presented with a vignette describing a
   14-year-old boy who came into the care of the Ministry of Social
   Development when he was a baby after being placed by the grandfather
   because of shame surrounding the mother being unwed. The vignettes
   systematically varied as to whether the child was described as raised in
   an orphanage, with a relative in a kinship foster placement, or with a
   nonkin foster family. Participants were then asked a series of questions
   about their acceptance of the child, stigma that the community might
   attach to the child, and potential outcomes for the child. Results: We
   found no differences across the acceptance and stigma questions between
   the kinship and nonkin foster conditions. The 2 foster care options were
   at least as acceptable as current institutional models across all
   domains, and participants were more likely to accept the child going to
   school with or being friends with their child if they were in foster
   care rather than an institution. Conclusions: These results represent
   the first evidence of public acceptance of foster care as a model of
   care in Jordan and may inform the process of local stakeholders
   implementing alternatives to institutional care on a meaningful and
   sustainable scale in the Kingdom and regionally.

AB Low-income Latino immigrants are understudied in elder abuse research.
   Limited English proficiency, economic insecurity, neighborhood
   seclusion, a tradition of resolving conflicts within the family, and
   mistrust of authorities may impede survey research and suppress abuse
   reporting. To overcome these barriers, promotores, local
   Spanish-speaking Latinos, were recruited and trained to interview a
   sample of Latino adults aged 66 and older residing in low-income
   communities. The promotores conducted door-to-door interviews in
   randomly selected census tracts in Los Angeles to assess the frequency
   of psychological, physical, and sexual abuse; financial exploitation;
   and caregiver neglect. Overall, 40.4% of elderly Latino adults had
   experienced some form of abuse or neglect within the previous year.
   Nearly 25% reported psychological abuse, 10.7% physical assault, 9%
   sexual abuse, and 16.7% financial exploitation, and 11.7% were neglected
   by their caregivers. Younger age, higher education, and experiencing
   sexual or physical abuse before age 65 were significant risk factors for
   psychological, physical, and sexual abuse. Years lived in the United
   States, younger age, and prior abuse were associated with greater risk
   of financial exploitation. Years spent living in the United States was a
   significant risk factor for caregiver neglect. Abuse prevalence was much
   higher in all mistreatment domains than findings from previous research
   on community-dwelling elderly adults, suggesting that low-income Latino
   immigrants are highly vulnerable to elder mistreatment or that
   respondents are more willing to disclose abuse to promotores who
   represent their culture and community.

AB Introduction: This study examined the ability of family cohesion,
   parental control, and parent-child attachment to prevent adolescents
   with a history of drug or alcohol use from experiencing subsequent
   problems related to their use.
   Methods: Data came from Wave land Wave II of the National Longitudinal
   Study of Adolescent Health and included Mexican heritage and White
   adolescents who reported alcohol use (n = 4894, 25% prevalence) or any
   other drug use (n = 2875, 14% prevalence) in their lifetime.
   Results: Logistic regression results indicate greater parent-child
   attachment predicted lower risk of experiencing drug use problems (OR=
   0.87, 95% CI= 0.77-0.98) while stronger family cohesion predicted lower
   odds of experiencing drug- (OR = 0.82, 95% CI= 0.70-0.97) or
   alcohol-related (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.65-0.84) problems. Parental
   control was also negatively associated with odds of problems related to
   drug use (OR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.86-0.99) or alcohol use (OR =0.94, 95%
   CI = 0.90-0.99). Results also indicated family cohesion was the only
   protective factor for Mexican heritage youth while family cohesion and
   parent-child attachment were protective among White youth. Parental
   control protected White female adolescents from drug use problems more
   than males. Mexican heritage male adolescents experienced more
   protection from drug problems compared to females.
   Conclusion: Findings highlight the need for prevention interventions to
   emphasize parent-child attachment for White youth and family cohesion
   for both Mexican-heritage and White youth to decrease adolescent
   substance users' drug- and alcohol-related problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier

AB Mal de debarquement syndrome (MdDS) is a disorder of phantom perception
   of self-motion of unknown cause. The purpose of this work was to
   describe the quality of life (QOL) of patients with MdDS and to estimate
   the economic costs associated with this disorder. A modified version of
   a QOL survey used for another neurological disease (multiple sclerosis;
   MSQOL-54) was used to assess the impact of MdDS on QOL in 101 patients.
   The estimated economic costs were based on self-reported direct and
   indirect costs of individuals living in the United States using Medicare
   reimbursement payment rates for 2011 in 79 patients. Patients with MdDS
   reported a poor overall QOL as indicated by a mean composite QOL score
   of 59.26 +/- A 1.89 (out of 100). The subcategories having the lowest
   QOL rating were role limitations due to physical problems (18.32 +/- A
   3.20), energy (34.24 +/- A 1.47), and emotional problems (36.30 +/- A
   4.00). The overall physical health composite score including balance was
   49.40 +/- A 1.69, and the overall mental health composite score was
   52.40 +/- A 1.83. The cost to obtain a diagnosis was $2,997 +/- A 337,
   which included requiring an average of 19 physician visits per patient.
   The direct cost of MdDS medical care was $826 +/- A 140 per patient per
   year, which mainly included diagnostic imaging and physician visits. The
   indirect costs (i.e., lost wages) were $9,781 +/- A 2,347 per patient
   per year. Among 65 patients who were gainfully employed when they
   acquired MdDS, the indirect costs were $11,888 +/- A 2,786 per patient
   per year. Thus, the total annual cost of the disorder ranged from
   $11,493 +/- A 2,341 to $13,561 +/- A 2,778 per patient per year
   depending on employment status prior to developing MdDS. MdDS negatively
   and dramatically impacts QOL, and also imposes a substantial economic
   burden on MdDS patients. These findings underscore the need for further
   basic and clinical research on MdDS.

AB Objective: Experiences of racial/ethnic bias and unfair treatment are
   risk factors for alcohol problems, and population differences in
   exposure to these social adversities (i.e., differential exposure) may
   contribute to alcohol-related disparities. Differential vulnerability is
   another plausible mechanism underlying health disparities, yet few
   studies have examined whether populations differ in their vulnerability
   to the effects of social adversity on psychological stress and the
   effects of psychological stress on alcohol problems. Method: Data from
   the 2005 U.S. National Alcohol Survey (N = 4,080 adult drinkers) were
   analyzed using structural equation modeling to assess an overall model
   of pathways linking social adversity, depressive symptoms, heavy
   drinking, and alcohol dependence. Multiple group analyses were conducted
   to assess differences in the model's relationships among Blacks versus
   Whites, Hispanics versus Whites, and the poor (income below the federal
   poverty line) versus non-poor (income above the poverty line). Results:
   The overall model explained 48% of the variance in alcohol dependence
   and revealed significant pathways between social adversity and alcohol
   dependence involving depressive symptoms and heavy drinking. The effects
   of social adversity and depressive symptoms were no different among
   Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites. However, the poor (vs.
   non-poor) showed stronger associations between unfair treatment and
   depressive symptoms and between depressive symptoms and heavy drinking.
   Conclusions: Contrary to some prior studies, these findings suggest that
   racial disparities in alcohol problems may be more a function of
   racial/ethnic minorities' greater exposure, rather than vulnerability,
   to chronic stressors such as social adversity. However, observed
   differences between the poor and non-poor imply that differential
   vulnerability contributes to socioeconomic disparities in alcohol
   problems. Efforts to reduce both differential exposure and vulnerability
   might help to mitigate these disparities. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73,

AB Objective: This study explored the relationship between bonding and
   bridging social capital and college student attendance at
   alcohol-present parties, a common method for building informal social
   networks. Method: A random sample of students (n = 6,291; 52% female)
   from a large public midwestern university completed a survey regarding
   their alcohol use and party-related behaviors on targeted weekends. The
   survey also included questions regarding students' living arrangements,
   romantic relationships, and membership in student and community
   organizations. Results: Based on a dichotomous logistic regression
   analysis, we concluded that the act of attending parties largely serves
   as a complement to, rather than a substitute for, more conventional and
   formal social capital. Membership in bonding groups is associated with
   increased odds of party attendance, and bridging exerts no direct effect
   on party attendance. However, bridging capital does mitigate the effect
   of bonding capital, reducing its apparent tendency to promote or
   contribute to partying. Conclusions: Off-campus parties may offer an
   informal supplement to more conventional social capital as students
   establish themselves in their new context. These findings may have
   implications for structural decisions,(e.g., number of roommates) as
   well as the design of context-based prevention programs that address
   students' need to quickly build social capital without exposing both
   themselves and the students around them to the harms associated with
   high-risk drinking. (J. Stud. Alcohol Drugs, 73, 604-612, 2012)

AB Objective: To develop and validate the HIV Self-management Scale for
   women, a new measure of HIV self-management, defined as the day-to-day
   decisions that individuals make to manage their illness.
   Methods: The development and validation of the scale was undertaken in 3
   phases: focus groups, expert review, and psychometric evaluation. Focus
   groups identified items describing the process and context of
   self-management in women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA). Items were refined
   using expert review and were then administered to WLHA in 2 sites in the
   United States (n = 260). Validity of the scale was assessed through
   factor analyses, model fit statistics, reliability testing, and
   convergent and discriminate validity.
   Results: The final scale consists of 3 domains with 20 items describing
   the construct of HIV self-management. Daily self-management health
   practices, social support and HIV self-management, and chronicity of HIV
   self-management comprise the 3 domains. These domains explained 48.6% of
   the total variance in the scale. The item mean scores ranged from 1.7 to
   2.8, and each domain demonstrated acceptable reliability (0.72-0.86) and
   stability (0.61-0.85).
   Conclusions: Self-management is critical for WLHA, who constitute over
   50% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and have poorer health
   outcomes than their male counterparts. Methods to assess the
   self-management behavior of WLHA are needed to enhance their health and
   wellbeing. Presently, no scales exist to measure HIV self-management.
   Our new 20-item HIV Self-management Scale is a valid and reliable
   measure of HIV self-management in this population. Differences in
   aspects of self-management may be related to social roles and community
   resources, and interventions targeting these factors may decrease
   morbidity in WLHA.

AB Accelerated telomere length attrition has been associated with
   psychological stress and early adversity in adults; however, no studies
   have examined whether telomere length in childhood is associated with
   early experiences. The Bucharest Early Intervention Project is a unique
   randomized controlled trial of foster care placement compared with
   continued care in institutions. As a result of the study design,
   participants were exposed to a quantified range of time in institutional
   care, and represented an ideal population in which to examine the
   association between a specific early adversity, institutional care and
   telomere length. We examined the association between average relative
   telomere length, telomere repeat copy number to single gene copy number
   (T/S) ratio and exposure to institutional care quantified as the percent
   of time at baseline (mean age 22 months) and at 54 months of age that
   each child lived in the institution. A significant negative correlation
   between T/S ratio and percentage of time was observed. Children with
   greater exposure to institutional care had significantly shorter
   relative telomere length in middle childhood. Gender modified this main
   effect. The percentage of time in institutional care at baseline
   significantly predicted telomere length in females, whereas the
   percentage of institutional care at 54 months was strongly predictive of
   telomere length in males. This is the first study to demonstrate an
   association between telomere length and institutionalization, the first
   study to find an association between adversity and telomere length in
   children, and contributes to the growing literature linking telomere
   length and early adversity. Molecular Psychiatry ( 2012) 17, 719-727;

AB As the racial composition of the population changes, intergroup
   interactions are increasingly common. To understand how we perceive and
   categorize race and the attitudes that flow from it, scientists have
   used brain imaging techniques to examine how social categories of race
   and ethnicity are processed, evaluated and incorporated in
   decision-making. We review these findings, focusing on black and white
   race categories. A network of interacting brain regions is important in
   the unintentional, implicit expression of racial attitudes and its
   control. On the basis of the overlap in the neural circuitry of race,
   emotion and decision-making, we speculate as to how this emerging
   research might inform how we recognize and respond to variations in race
   and its influence on unintended race-based attitudes and decisions.

AB The linguistically distinctive Haida and Tlingit tribes of Southeast
   Alaska are known for their rich material culture, complex social
   organization, and elaborate ritual practices. However, much less is
   known about these tribes from a population genetic perspective. For this
   reason, we analyzed mtDNA and Y-chromosome variation in Haida and
   Tlingit populations to elucidate several key issues pertaining to the
   history of this region. These included the genetic relationships of
   Haida and Tlingit to other indigenous groups in Alaska and Canada; the
   relationship between linguistic and genetic data for populations
   assigned to the Na-Dene linguistic family, specifically, the inclusion
   of Haida with Athapaskan, Eyak, and Tlingit in the language family; the
   possible influence of matrilineal clan structure on patterns of genetic
   variation in Haida and Tlingit populations; and the impact of European
   entry into the region on the genetic diversity of these indigenous
   communities. Our analysis indicates that, while sharing a northern
   genetic profile, the Haida and the Tlingit are genetically distinctive
   from each other. In addition, Tlingit groups themselves differ across
   their geographic range, in part due to interactions of Tlingit tribes
   with Athapaskan and Eyak groups to the north. The data also reveal a
   strong influence of maternal clan identity on mtDNA variation in these
   groups, as well as the significant influence of non-native males on
   Y-chromosome diversity. These results yield new details about the

AB Rituals pose a cognitive paradox: although widely used to treat
   problems, rituals are causally opaque (i.e., they lack a causal
   explanation for their effects). How is the efficacy of ritual action
   evaluated in the absence of causal information? To examine this question
   using ecologically valid content, three studies (N = 162) were conducted
   in Brazil, a cultural context in which rituals called simpatias are used
   to treat a great variety of problems ranging from asthma to infidelity.
   Using content from existing simpatias, experimental simpatias were
   designed to manipulate the kinds of information that influences
   perceptions of efficacy. A fourth study (N = 68) with identical stimuli
   was conducted with a US sample to assess the generalizability of the
   findings across two different cultural contexts. The results provide
   evidence that information reflecting intuitive causal principles (i.e.,
   repetition of procedures, number of procedural steps) and transcendental
   influence (i.e., presence of religious icons) affects how people
   evaluate ritual efficacy. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Time, an everyday yet fundamentally abstract domain, is conceptualized
   in terms of space throughout the world's cultures. Linguists and
   psychologists have presented evidence of a widespread pattern in which
   deictic time-past, present, and future-is construed along the front/back
   axis, a construal that is linear and ego-based. To investigate the
   universality of this pattern, we studied the construal of deictic time
   among the Yupno, an indigenous group from the mountains of Papua New
   Guinea, whose language makes extensive use of allocentric topographic
   (uphill/downhill) terms for describing spatial relations. We measured
   the pointing direction of Yupno speakers' gestures-produced naturally
   and without prompting-as they explained common expressions related to
   the past, present, and future. Results show that the Yupno spontaneously
   construe deictic time spatially in terms of allocentric topography: the

   local terrain. The findings shed light on how, our universal human

AB Objective: To determine the effects of a transition-home education and
   support program, BPD, and health insurance type on VLBW infant
   rehospitalizations at 3 and 7 months corrected age. It was hypothesized
   that the transition-home program would be associated with decreased
   rehospitalizations between Phase 1 and 2, and public health insurance
   and BPD would be associated with increased rehospitalizations.
   Methods: 274 infants with birth weight <1500 g were enrolled in two
   successive years of a transition-home program (Phase 1-start-up) and
   (Phase 2-full implementation) and followed to 7 months CA.
   Results: The Phase 2 rehospitalization rates were lower but not
   statistically significant at both 3 months (20% and 15%; p = 0.246), and
   7 months (24% and 17%; p = 0.171). Infants with public insurance had
   twice as many rehospitalizations by 3 months (28% versus 11%; p = 0.018)
   in Phase 1. In regression analyses the intervention effects did not
   achieve significance for the cohort at 3 months (OR = 0.63; CI = 0.33 to
   1.20) or 7 months (OR = 0.61; CI = 0.33 to 1.13). BPD and public
   insurance did not reach significance in the models whereas siblings were
   significantly associated with increased odds of rehospitalization. In
   subgroup analyses for infants on pubic health insurance the intervention
   significantly decreased the odds of rehospitalization between Phase 1
   and 2(OR = 0.43; CI = 0.19 to 0.96) at 3 months.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a transition-home program may be
   beneficial to reduce the rehospitalization rate for VLBW infants, and
   infants on public insurance may derive greater benefit. (C) 2011

AB While oncologists are aware that cancer treatments may impact fertility,
   referral rates for fertility preservation consultation (FPC) remain
   poor. The goal of this study was to identify predictors associated with
   FPC referral.
   This is a retrospective, cohort study of women aged 1842 years diagnosed
   with a new breast, gynecologic, hematologic or gastrointestinal cancer
   at our institution between January 2008 and May 2010. Exclusion criteria
   included history of permanent sterilization, documentation of no desire
   for future children, stage IV disease, short interval (4 days) between
   diagnosis and treatment and treatment that posed no threat to fertility.
   Demographic, socioeconomic and cancer variables were evaluated with
   respect to FPC. Logistic regression was used to determine the odds of
   referral for FPC based on specified predictors.
   One hundred and ninety-nine patients were eligible for FPC and of those,
   41 received FPC (20.6). Women with breast cancer were 10 times more
   likely to receive FPC compared with other cancer diagnoses [odds ratio
   (OR) 10.1; 95 confidence interval (CI) 3.826.8]. The odds of FPC
   referral were approximately two times higher for Caucasian women (OR
   2.4; 95 CI 0.96.2), three times higher for age 35 years (OR 3.3; 95 CI
   1.47.7) and four times higher in nulliparous women (OR 4.6; 95 CI
   1.911.3). There was no association between BMI, income, distance to our
   institution, being in a relationship and referral for FPC.
   Overall referral rates for FPC are low, and there appear to be
   significant discrepancies in referral based on ethnicity, age, parity
   and cancer type. This highlights a need for further provider education
   and awareness across all oncologic disciplines.

AB A recent movement has extended previous emphases on the rights of
   national citizens by asserting the global human rights of all persons.
   This article describes the extent to which this change is reflected in
   the language of national constitutions around the world. Human rights
   language - formerly absent from almost all constitutions - now appears
   in most of them. Rather than characterizing developed or democratic
   states, human rights language is, first, especially common in countries
   most susceptible to global influences. Second, human rights language is
   driven by the extent of the international human rights regime at the
   time of a constitution's writing. Third, human rights language tends to
   appear in newer constitutions and in the constitutions of emergent and
   reorganized states. National constitutions are imprinted with global
   social conditions, which now stress the discourse of human rights.

AB Despite the prominence of teaching in academia, we know little about how
   graduate students learn to teach. We propose the concept of a teaching
   community network (TCN), an informal social network that facilitates the
   exchange of teaching-specific resources. We explore the role of TCNs
   through a case study of a sociology doctoral program at a large state
   university. Results reveal that students rely heavily on informal ties
   within the graduate student community and existing formal programs to
   share teaching-related resources (e.g., information and social support)
   and develop their identities as instructors. We suggest that graduate
   programs facilitate TCNs through formal teacher-training programs and
   structural conditions that encourage informal, one-on-one interactions
   (e.g., shared offices). By cultivating TCNs, graduate programs can
   assist students in developing their teaching skills and identities as
   instructors, thus training students to balance the demands of research
   and teaching within an academic culture.
