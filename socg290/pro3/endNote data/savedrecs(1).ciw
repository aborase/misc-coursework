AB It is often observed that individuals with higher education levels tend
   to be more environmentally friendly. Yet, the causal evidence is lacking
   because there may well be omitted variables that cause individuals to
   attain more education and also cause individuals to be environmentally
   conscious. We implement a regression discontinuity design to estimate
   the increase in educational attainment due to changes in compulsory
   education laws in 20th century Europe. This allows us to overcome the
   identification problem of endogenous educational attainment. Using two
   waves of Eurobarometer surveys, we find a positive local average
   treatment effect for 7 of the 8 pro-environmental behaviors. An analysis
   of related questions on the survey supports the notion that education
   causes individuals to be more concerned with social welfare and to
   accordingly behave in a more environmentally friendly manner. (c) 2015

AB Objectives:Socio-demographic indicators closely relate to sleep in
   industrialized populations. However we know very little about how such
   factors impact sleep in populations undergoing industrialization. Within
   populations transitioning to the global economy, the preliminary
   evidence has found an inconsistent relationship between
   socio-demographics and sleep complaints across countries and social
   strata.
   Materials and methods:Surveys were conducted on a sample of rural Sakha
   (Yakut) adults (n=168) during the autumn of 2103 to assess variation in
   socio-demographics and sleep complaints, including trouble sleeping and
   daytime sleepiness. Socio-demographic variables included age, gender,
   socioeconomic measures, and markers of traditional/market-based
   lifestyle. We tested whether the socio-demographic variables predicted
   sleep complaints using bivariate analyses and multiple logistic
   regressions.
   Results:Trouble sleeping was reported by 18.5% of the participants and
   excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) by 17.3%. Trouble sleeping was
   significantly predicted by older age, female gender, and mixing
   traditional and market-based lifestyles. EDS was not significantly
   predicted by any socio-demographic variable.
   Discussion:These findings support the few large-scale studies that found
   inconsistent relationships between measures of socioeconomic status and
   sleep complaints in transitioning populations. Employing a mix of
   traditional and market-based lifestyles may leave Sakha in a space of
   vulnerability, leading to trouble sleeping. Am J Phys Anthropol

AB Social support improves health and has been shown to attenuate stress
   and pain. The precise characteristics of social support responsible for
   these effects, however, remain elusive.
   The purpose of this study is to examine the relative efficacy of social
   support versus a neutral non-verbal social presence to attenuate stress
   and pain.
   Seventy-six participants provided pain ratings and task assessments
   during a cold pressor task (CPT) in one of three conditions: verbal
   social support, neutral non-support, or alone. Reactivity to the CPT was
   assessed via cardiovascular measures, cortisol, and subjective ratings.
   Participants receiving social support showed attenuated blood pressure,
   heart rate, and cortisol reactivity, as well as reduced pain ratings,
   task difficulty, tension, and effort compared to neutral non-support and
   alone conditions.
   Social support, not the mere presence of another individual, attenuated
   stress and pain during a CPT. Given the negative health consequences of
   stress and pain, clinical studies incorporating social support into
   medical procedures and treatments are warranted.

AB Improvement in US survival rates among adolescents and young adults
   (AYAs, ages 15 through 39 years inclusive) diagnosed with non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma (NHL) has been documented over the last two decades. We
   examined national trends in survival disparities for AYAs with NHL by
   race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES, county-level poverty) to
   further understand NHL and to begin monitoring health outcome
   disparities for this disease.
   Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data were used to calculate
   5-year relative survival rates of AYAs diagnosed with NHL from 1992 to
   2007 and followed through 2011. Absolute and relative disparities were
   computed using HD*Calc. Whether a significant linear trend was present
   was evaluated using Joinpoint. Analyses were replicated after excluding
   individuals with known HIV infection.
   The study sample included 9,573 total and 7,121 non-HIV cases of NHL.
   Five-year survival rates improved for all groups over time. Significant
   decreases were found in absolute disparities for race/ethnicity
   (non-HIV), in relative disparities for SES (total) and race/ethnicity
   (total and non-HIV) (all p < 0.05). Survival rates of non-Hispanic
   Blacks and Hispanics remained below than those of non-Hispanic Whites
   throughout the time period.
   Absolute and relative disparities in 5-year survival narrowed for AYAs
   with NHL over the time period. To continue to promote this trend, future
   research should investigate factors, particularly diagnostic delays and
   barriers to care, which continue to contribute to SES and racial/ethnic
   differences in survival. These factors may be particularly relevant to
   identify given the recent Affordable Care Act, which is designed to
   increase access to medical services, particularly for young adults.

AB Debates on linking livelihoods and conservation through the
   commercialization of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) continue to hold
   significance considering the increasing market demand for NTFPs, its
   high economic value for forest-dependent communities and "enabling"
   neoliberal policies that are in place. Kerala, located on the southwest
   coast of India, flanked by the Western Ghats-a UN declared biodiversity
   hot spot, on its windward side, is of particular significance due to the
   presence of the Ayurvedic industry-a traditional medicine industry that
   procures 90 % of its raw materials from the wild. In addition, the
   presence of a resource-dependent tribal population re-affirms the
   economic, social and cultural significance of NTFPs. Unsustainable
   practices and poor co-management and marketing arrangements have
   rendered the sector ineffective in terms of meeting livelihood as well
   as conservation goals in the region. Although new approaches such as
   NTFP certification are being recommended for India not much has been
   reported on its feasibility and/or implementation challenges. Focusing
   on the Kadar community of Kerala, this study attempts to highlight some
   of the issues within the sector and using an "instrumental model",
   present the benefits accrued from new strategies such as NTFP
   certification through quantitative and qualitative assessments. Last but
   not least, recommendations for the adoption of sustainable strategies in
   context with the existing policy environment are provided that may be
   broadly applicable to other forest-dependent communities in India and

AB Ethologists proposed the coevolution of pedomorphic characteristics in
   infants and caregiving responses to these features in parents. Human
   infants higher in pedomorphic characteristics are more likely to receive
   baby talk from adults and elicit stronger motivations for caretaking.
   Neotenous facial characteristics in human adults cue social approach and
   elicit helping. This study demonstrates generally strong differences in
   reactions to infants from non-mammalian species requiring parental care
   (semiprecocial) and superprecocial species within the same class. People
   perceive semiprecocial infants as more neotenous (cute, immature, and
   helpless), had greater desires to hold or pet them, thought they would
   have a greater appreciation of being held or pet, thought they would be
   less likely to survive on their own, and anticipated being more likely
   to adopt them compared to superprecocial infants. Both avian and
   reptilian infants elicited these patterns. There was a moderate degree
   of sex differences in ratings, women saw the infants as more neotenous
   and were more willing to adopt them than men.

AB Black feminist theory has shown how respectability politics shape
   cultural discourses about African American women's sexuality. Responding
   to silent' depictions resulting from racial uplift strategies among
   turn-of-the-century middle-class black women, subsequent work theorises
   alternative discourses that portray a desiring and agentic black female
   sexual subject. Locating these alternative discourses in a politics of
   irreverence', I argue that respectability/irreverence oppositional logic
   narrowly frames theorising of black female sexuality. Although recent
   work emphasises dialectical - rather than oppositional - dynamics, this
   analytic approach is unevenly applied. Binary frameworks continue to
   shape analyses of women's rap. Drawing upon lyrics of rappers Lil' Kim
   and Foxy Brown, I highlight three discursive strategies whereby women
   rappers render the respectability/irreverence binary problematic: (1)
   using irreverence to claim respectability, (2) claiming both' or,
   embracing contradiction, and (3) beating to the punch. This analysis
   shows how dialectical approaches account for potential third spaces'
   where more complex representational politics are possible.

AB Perceived ethnic discrimination has been associated with cigarette
   smoking in US adults in the majority of studies, but gaps in
   understanding remain. It is unclear if the association of discrimination
   to smoking is a function of lifetime or recent exposure to
   discrimination. Some sociodemographic and mood-related risk factors may
   confound the relationship of discrimination to smoking. Gender and
   race/ethnicity differences in this relationship have been understudied.
   This study examines the relationship of lifetime and recent
   discrimination to smoking status and frequency, controlling for
   sociodemographic and mood-related variables and investigating the
   moderating role of race/ethnicity and gender. Participants included 518
   Black and Latino(a) adults from New York, US. Lifetime and past week
   discrimination were measured with the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination
   Questionnaire-Community Version. Ecological momentary assessment methods
   were used to collect data on smoking and mood every 20 min throughout
   one testing day using an electronic diary. Controlling for
   sociodemographic and mood-related variables, there was a significant
   association of recent (past week) discrimination exposure to current
   smoking. Lifetime discrimination was associated with smoking frequency,
   but not current smoking status. The association of recent discrimination
   to smoking status was moderated by race/ethnicity and gender, with
   positive associations emerging for both Black adults and for men. The
   association of lifetime discrimination on smoking frequency was not
   moderated by gender or race/ethnicity. Acute race/ethnicity-related
   stressors may be associated with the decision to smoke at all on a given
   day; whereas chronic stigmatization may reduce the barriers to smoking
   more frequently.

AB Recently, scholars and activists have turned their attention toward
   improving the measurement of sex and gender in survey research. The
   focus of this effort has been on including answer options beyond male
   and female to questions about the respondent's gender. This is an
   important step toward both reflecting the diversity of gendered lives
   and better aligning survey measurement practice with contemporary gender
   theory. However, our systematic examination of questionnaires, manuals,
   and other technical materials from four of the largest and
   longest-running surveys in the United States indicates that there are a
   number of other issues with how gender is conceptualized and measured in
   social surveys that also deserve attention, including essentialist
   practices that treat sex and gender as synonymous, easily determined by
   others, obvious, and unchanging over the life course. We find that these
   understandings extend well beyond direct questions about the
   respondent's gender, permeating the surveys. A hyper-gendered world of
   males and females, brothers and sisters, and husbands and wives shapes
   what we can see in survey data. If not altered, surveys will continue to
   reproduce statistical representations that erase important dimensions of
   variation and likely limit understanding of the processes that
   perpetuate social inequality.

   that provide a rich understanding of the motivations to consume (or not
   consume) baseball. Likewise, the authors investigated the facets of
   baseball that seemingly create social and psychological consumption
   barriers for African Americans. The findings suggest three broad
   categories best represent the deterrence from baseball consumption:
   attitudes toward baseball consumption, social constraints related to
   consuming baseball, and the role of racial identification toward sport
   consumption. Within these three categories, seven general dimensions
   evolved that, if present, would thus influence perceptions toward
   baseball and eventually affect consumption habits.

AB Competitive reality television is a pervasive part of contemporary
   American culture and encompasses a range of topics and forms. We
   identify three categories, or spheres, of contestant-elimination reality
   shows: External Vote, Internal Vote, and Choosing Individual/Deity.
   Within each sphere, we examine the locus of blame and the structure of
   the show as contexts for the elimination as symbolic death. This
   symbolic death presents allegories of loss of fame, social isolation,
   and individual loss of job, career, or love across these spheres.
   Contestants perform eulogy work to cope publicly with their elimination
   at the moment of exit. Eulogy work enables departing contestants to
   frame their death as a good death and to cool themselves out in an
   attempt to save face. In this way, contestants deal with conceptions of
   self in the show and the transfer of that self back to a reality outside
   of the bracketed time and space of the show. Drawing on literature from
   the sociology of emotions, the sociology of death, and the sociology of
   ritual, we provide the concept of eulogy work to capture the performance
   of the self specifically in the context of loss.

   In this article, we explore these extra-deliberative processes in order

   examining how extra-deliberative dynamics shape action in systematic
   ways, we endeavor to bring together two aspects of sociological practice

AB The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system plays a critical role in
   responses to stressful stimuli, and is expressed in many areas of the
   brain involved in processing fear, anxiety, and social behaviors. To
   better understand the mechanisms by which the CRF system modulates
   responses to stressful events and social stimuli, we employed a mouse
   model that selectively disrupts NMDA receptor function via NMDA receptor
   subunit NR1 (Grin1) knockout specifically in Cre-expressing CRF neurons.
   These animals (Cre+/(fGrin1+)) were compared with littermates lacking
   Cre expression (Cre-/(fGrin1+)). Following cue discrimination fear
   conditioning, male Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice showed increased fear expression
   to the tone paired with a foot shock (CS+) while still discriminating
   the CS+ from a tone never paired with a foot shock (CS-). In contrast to
   males, female mice learned and discriminated fear cues equivalently
   across the genotypes. Similarly, no genotype differences in sociability
   or social novelty were observed in female mice, but Cre+/(fGrin1+) males
   displayed greater naive sociability and preference for social novelty
   than Cre-/(fGrin1+) Uttermates. Furthermore, the level of social
   withdrawal exhibited by mate Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice susceptible to social
   defeat stress relative to same genotype controls was significantly more
   pronounced than that displayed by susceptible Cre-/(fGrin1+) mice
   compared to control Cre-/(fGrin1+) mice. Together, these results
   demonstrate increased fear, social, and stress responsiveness
   specifically in male Cre+/(fGrin1+) mice. Our findings indicate that
   NMDA-mediated glutamatergic regulation of CRF neurons is important for
   appropriately regulating fear and social responses, likely functioning
   to promote survival under aversive circumstances. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   and all-cause mortality among women diagnosed with breast cancer before
   and after controlling for insurance status, race and ethnicity, stage,
   treatment modalities, and other demographic and hospital
   characteristics.
   Methods: Data analyzed included follow-up through 2011 for 582,396
   patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2006 with ductal carcinoma in situ
   or invasive (stage I-IV) breast cancer from the National Cancer Data
   Base. SES was measured by grouping patients into six income and
   education-level ZIP code categories. Hierarchical Cox regression models
   were used to analyze SES survival differences.
   Results: Five- and 10-year survival probabilities for the highest SES
   group were 87.8% and 71.5%, versus 79.5% and 61.5% for the lowest SES
   group. Controlling for all covariates reduced the highest-to-lowest SES
   hazard ratio from 1.69 (95% confidence interval: 1.64-1.74) to 1.27 (95%
   confidence interval: 1.24-1.31). Results were virtually identical in
   models that included comorbidity and invasive cancer patients only.
   Conclusions: Differences in insurance status, race, and stage at
   diagnosis are important components of SES disparities and explain about
   two-thirds of the initial SES survival disparity. The residual SES
   effect likely mirrors underlying social determinants of health for all
   American women. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   ovarian cancer survival. The purpose of this analysis is to assess the
   influence of neighborhood SES on NHB-NHW survival differences after
   accounting for differences in tumor characteristics and in treatment.
   Methods: Data were obtained from 2432 women (443 NHB and 1989 NHW)
   diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer in Cook County, Illinois
   between 1998 and 2007. Neighborhood (i.e., census tract) SES at the time
   of diagnosis was calculated for each woman using two well-established
   composite measures of affluence and disadvantage. Cox proportional
   hazard models measured the association between NHB race and survival
   after adjusting for age, tumor characteristics, treatment, year of
   diagnosis, and neighborhood SES.
   Results: There was a strong association between ovarian cancer survival
   and both measures of neighborhood SES (P < .0001 for both affluence and
   disadvantage). After adjusting for age, tumor characteristics,
   treatment, and year of diagnosis, NHB were more likely than NHW to die
   of ovarian cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.47, 95% confidence interval
   [CI]: 1.28-1.68). The inclusion of neighborhood affluence and
   disadvantage into models separately and together attenuated this risk
   (HRaffluence = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.18-1.58; HRdisadvantage = 1.28, 95% CI:
   1.08-1.52; and HRaffluence + disadvantage = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.08-1.52.
   Conclusions: Neighborhood SES, as measured by composite measures of
   affluence and disadvantage, is a predictor of survival in women
   diagnosed with ovarian cancer in Cook County, Illinois and may
   contribute to the racial disparity in survival. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Linguistic and cultural differences can impede comprehension among
   potential research participants during the informed consent process, but
   how researchers and IRBs respond to these challenges in practice is
   unclear. We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 researchers, research
   ethics committee (REC) chairs and members from 8 different countries
   with emerging economies, involved in HIV-related research sponsored by
   HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN), regarding the ethical and
   regulatory challenges they face in this regard. In the interviews,
   problems with translating study materials often arose as major concerns.
   Four sets of challenges were identified concerning linguistic and
   cultural translations of informed consent documents and other study
   materials, related to the: (1) context, (2) process, (3) content and (4)
   translation of these documents. Host country contextual issues included
   low literacy rates, education (e.g., documents may need to be written
   below 5th grade reading level), and experiences with research, and
   different views of written documentation. Certain terms and concepts may
   not exist in other languages, or have additional connotations that back
   translations do not always reveal. Challenges arise because of not only
   the content of word-for-word, literal translation, but the linguistic
   form of the language, such as tone (e.g., appropriate forms of
   politeness vs. legalese, seen as harsh), syntax, manner of questions
   posed, and the concept of the consent); and the contexts of use affect
   meaning. Problems also emerged in bilateral communications - US IRBs may
   misunderstand local practices, or communicate insufficiently the reasons
   for their decisions to foreign RECs. In sum, these data highlight
   several challenges that have received little, if any, attention in past
   literature on translation of informed consent and study materials, and
   have crucial implications for improving practice, education, research
   and policy, suggesting several strategies, including needs for broader
   open-source multilingual lexicons, and more awareness of the
   complexities involved.

AB Volcanic eruptions contribute to climate variability, but quantifying
   these contributions has been limited by inconsistencies in the timing of
   atmospheric volcanic aerosol loading determined from ice cores and
   subsequent cooling from climate proxies such as tree rings. Here we
   resolve these inconsistencies and show that large eruptions in the
   tropics and high latitudes were primary drivers of
   interannual-to-decadal temperature variability in the Northern
   Hemisphere during the past 2,500 years. Our results are based on new
   records of atmospheric aerosol loading developed from high-resolution,
   multi-parameter measurements from an array of Greenland and Antarctic
   ice cores as well as distinctive age markers to constrain chronologies.
   Overall, cooling was proportional to the magnitude of volcanic forcing
   and persisted for up to ten years after some of the largest eruptive
   episodes. Our revised timescale more firmly implicates volcanic
   eruptions as catalysts in the major sixth-century pandemics, famines,
   and socioeconomic disruptions in Eurasia and Mesoamerica while allowing
   multi-millennium quantification of climate response to volcanic forcing.

AB I modify Fredrik Barth's approach, which sees ethnic group building as a
   signaling system, to place it within a framework that draws from
   collective action and costly signaling theories. From these
   perspectives, ethnic signaling, although representing a costly penalty
   to group members, is one effective form of communication that
   facilitates collective management of resources. I then identify three
   contexts in which the benefits of ethnic group building are likely to
   outweigh its signaling costs: in politically chaotic refuge and
   periphery zones; in the context of long-distance specialist trading
   groups; and within the territorial scope of failed states. I point to
   selected data from the Mughal and Aztec polities to illustrate how a
   combination of effective public goods management, in highly collective
   states, and the growth of highly integrated commercial economies will
   render ethnic group building superfluous.

AB The south central Andes is known as a region of enduring multiethnic
   diversity, yet it is also the cradle of one the South America's first
   successful expansive-state societies. Social structures that encouraged
   the maintenance of separate identities among coexistent ethnic groups
   may explain this apparent contradiction. Although the early expansion of
   the Tiwanaku state (A. D. 600-1000) is often interpreted according to a
   centralized model derived from Old World precedents, recent
   archaeological research suggests a reappraisal of the socio-political
   organization of Tiwanaku civilization, both for the diversity of social
   entities within its core region and for the multiple agencies behind its
   wider program of agropastoral colonization. Tiwanaku's sociopolitical
   pluralism in both its homeland and colonies tempers some of
   archaeology's global assumptions about the predominant role of
   centralized institutions in archaic states.

AB This Perspective presents an overview of the archaeology of pluralistic

   complements the other special feature papers in this issue on ancient
   societies in Mesoamerica, the Near East, the Armenian Highlands, Peru,
   and China by presenting another body of literature for examining the
   dynamics of change in multiethnic societies from a different time and
   place. In synthesizing archaeological investigations of mercantile,
   plantation, and missionary colonies, this Perspective shows how this
   research is relevant to the study of pluralism in both historic and
   ancient societies in three ways. (i) It enhances our understanding of
   interethnic relationships that took place in complex societies with
   imposing political hierarchies and labor structures. (ii) It helps us to
   refine the methods used by archaeologists to define and analyze
   multiethnic communities that were spatially delimited by ethnic
   neighborhoods. Finally, (iii) it presents more than a half century of
   experimentation with various models (e. g., acculturation, creolization,
   ethnogenesis, and hybridity) that have been used to study the dynamics
   of culture change in multiethnic societies.

AB The Neolithic (ca. 8000-1900 B. C.) underpinnings of early Chinese
   civilization had diverse geographic and cultural foundations in distinct
   traditions, ways of life, subsistence regimes, and modes of leadership.
   The subsequent Bronze Age (ca. 1900-221 B. C.) was characterized by
   increasing political consolidation, expansion, and heightened
   interaction, culminating in an era of a smaller number of warring
   states. During the third century B. C., the Qin Dynasty first
   politically unified this fractious landscape, across an area that covers
   much of what is now China, and rapidly instituted a series of
   infrastructural investments and other unifying measures, many of which
   were maintained and amplified during the subsequent Han Dynasty. Here,
   we examine this historical sequence at both the national and macroscale
   and more deeply for a small region on the coast of the Shandong
   Province, where we have conducted several decades of archaeological
   research. At both scales, we examine apparent shifts in the governance
   of local diversity and some of the implications both during Qin-Han
   times and for the longer duree.

AB Background: Copy number variations (CNV) within the recurrent similar to
   600 kb chromosomal locus of 16p11.2 are associated with a wide range of
   neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   However, little is known about the social brain phenotype of 16p11.2 CNV
   and how this phenotype is related to the social impairments associated
   with CNVs at this locus. The aim of this preliminary study was to use
   molecular subtyping to establish the social brain phenotype of
   individuals with 16p11.2 CNV and how these patterns relate to typical
   development and ASD.
   Methods: We evaluated the social brain phenotype as expressed by mu
   attenuation in 48 children and adults characterized as duplication
   carriers (n = 12), deletion carriers (n = 12), individuals with
   idiopathic ASD (n = 8), and neurotypical controls (n = 16). Participants
   watched videos containing social and nonsocial motion during
   electroencephalogram (EEG) acquisition.
   Results: Overall, only the typical group exhibited predicted patterns of
   mu modulation to social information (e. g., greater mu attenuation for
   social than nonsocial motion). Both 16p11.2 CNV groups exhibited more mu
   attenuation for nonsocial than social motion. The ASD group did not
   discriminate between conditions and demonstrated less mu attenuation
   compared to the typical and duplication carriers. Single-trial analysis
   indicated that mu attenuation decreased over time more rapidly for
   16p11.2 CNV groups than the typical group. The duplication group did not
   diverge from typical patterns of mu attenuation until after initial
   exposure.
   Conclusions: These results indicate atypical but unique patterns of mu
   attenuation for deletion and duplication carriers, highlighting the need
   to continue characterizing the social brain phenotype associated with
   16p11.2 CNVs.

AB Brain arginine vasopressin (AVP) critically regulates normative social
   behavior in mammals, and experimental disruption of the AVP signaling
   pathway produces social impairments in rodent models. We therefore
   hypothesized that AVP signaling deficits may contribute to social
   impairments in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since blood
   measures (which are far easier to obtain than brain measures) of AVP are
   most meaningful if they are related to brain AVP activity, Study 1
   tested the relationship between AVP concentrations in concomitantly
   collected blood and CSF samples from children and adults (N = 28)
   undergoing clinical procedures. Study 2 tested whether blood AVP
   concentrations: 1) differed between children with ASD (N = 57), their
   ASD discordant siblings (N = 47), and neurotypical controls (N = 55);
   and 2) predicted social functioning (using the NEPSY-II Theory of Mind
   and Affect Recognition tasks and the Social Responsiveness Scale) in
   this large, well-characterized child cohort. Blood AVP concentrations
   significantly and positively predicted CSF AVP concentrations (F-1,F-26
   = 7.17, r = 0.46, p = 0.0127) in Study 1. In Study 2, blood AVP
   concentrations did not differ between groups or by sex, but
   significantly and positively predicted Theory of Mind performance,
   specifically in children with ASD, but not in non-ASD children
   (F-1,F-144 = 5.83, p = 0.017). Blood AVP concentrations can be used: 1)
   as a surrogate for brain AVP activity in humans; and 2) as a robust
   biomarker of theory of mind ability in children with ASD. These findings
   also suggest that AVP biology may be a promising therapeutic target by
   which to improve social cognition in individuals with ASD.

AB There are, in mankind, two kinds of heredity: biological and cultural.
   Cultural inheritance makes possible for humans what no other organism
   can accomplish: the cumulative transmission of experience from
   generation to generation. In turn, cultural inheritance leads to
   cultural evolution, the prevailing mode of human adaptation. For the
   last few millennia, humans have been adapting the environments to their
   genes more often than their genes to the environments. Nevertheless,
   natural selection persists in modern humans, both as differential
   mortality and as differential fertility, although its intensity may
   decrease in the future. More than 2,000 human diseases and abnormalities
   have a genetic causation. Health care and the increasing feasibility of
   genetic therapy will, although slowly, augment the future incidence of
   hereditary ailments. Germline gene therapy could halt this increase, but
   at present, it is not technically feasible. The proposal to enhance the
   human genetic endowment by genetic cloning of eminent individuals is not
   warranted. Genomes can be cloned; individuals cannot. In the future,
   therapeutic cloning will bring enhanced possibilities for organ
   transplantation, nerve cells and tissue healing, and other health
   benefits.

AB Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is a major global
   strategy for enhancing conservation outcomes while also seeking to
   improve rural livelihoods; however, little evidence of socioeconomic
   outcomes exists. We present a national-level analysis that empirically
   estimates socioeconomic impacts of CBNRM across Tanzania, while
   systematically controlling for potential sources of bias. Specifically,
   we apply a difference-indifferences model to national-scale,
   cross-sectional data to estimate the impact of three different CBNRM
   governance regimes on wealth, food security and child health,
   considering differential impacts of CBNRM on wealthy and poor
   populations. We also explore whether or not longer-standing CBNRM
   efforts provide more benefits than recently-established CBNRM areas. Our
   results show significant improvements in household food security in
   CBNRM areas compared with non-CBNRM areas, but household wealth and
   health outcomes in children are generally not significantly different.
   No one CBNRM governance regime demonstrates consistently different
   welfare outcomes than the others. Wealthy households benefit more from
   CBNRM than poor households and CBNRM benefits appear to increase with
   longer periods of implementation. Perhaps evidence of CBNRM benefits is
   limited because CBNRM hasn't been around long enough to yield
   demonstrable outcomes. Nonetheless, achieving demonstrable benefits to
   rural populations will be crucial for CBNRM's future success in
   Tanzania.

AB Newcomers to a social network show preferential attachment, a tendency
   to befriend those with many friends. Here, we show that preferential
   attachment is equivalent to a form of 'probability matching' commonly
   found in studies of decision-making. This equivalence, whereby newcomers
   probability match to a social signal akin to popularity, marries network
   science to the study of decision-making and raises new questions about
   how individual psychology impacts the social structure of groups. We
   asked people to view a visualization of a social network and to select
   group members whom they would like to meet and befriend. People varied
   in how strongly they weighed popularity and this was mildly correlated
   with aspects of their personality. Individual differences in
   preferential attachment affect the structure and connectivity of the

   yielded the most accurate re-estimate of the current total population.
   Stratification variable (c), which can be estimated from aerial
   photography and zoning type verification, and variable (b), which could
   be ascertained by surveying a limited number of households, increased
   the accuracy of method (2). Small household-level surveys with

AB Dynamic social media content, such as Twitter messages, can be used to
   examine individuals' beliefs and perceptions. By analyzing Twitter
   messages, this study examines how Twitter users exchanged and recognized
   toponyms (city names) for different cities in the United States. The
   frequency and variety of city names found in their online conversations
   were used to identify the unique spatiotemporal patterns of
   "geographical awareness" for Twitter users. A new analytic method,
   Knowledge Discovery in Cyberspace for Geographical Awareness (KDCGA), is
   introduced to help identify the dynamic spatiotemporal patterns of
   geographic awareness among social media conversations. Twitter data were
   collected across 50 U.S. cities. Thousands of city names around the
   world were extracted from a large volume of Twitter messages (over 5
   million tweets) by using the Twitter Application Programming Interface
   (APIs) and Python language computer programs. The percentages of distant
   city names (cities located in distant states or other countries far away
   from the locations of Twitter users) were used to estimate the level of
   global geographical awareness for Twitter users in each U.S. city. A
   Global awareness index (GAI) was developed to quantify the level of
   geographical awareness of Twitter users from within the same city. Our
   findings are that: (1) the level of geographical awareness varies
   depending on when and where Twitter messages are posted, yet Twitter
   users from big cities are more aware of the names of international
   cities or distant US cities than users from mid-size cities; (2) Twitter
   users have an increased awareness of other city names far away from
   their home city during holiday seasons; and (3) Twitter users are more
   aware of nearby city names than distant city names, and more aware of
   big city names rather than small city names.

AB Most studies on the response of socioeconomic systems to a sudden shift
   focus on long-term equilibria or end points. Such narrow focus forgoes
   many valuable insights. Here we examine the transient dynamics of regime
   shift on a divided population, exemplified by societies divided
   ideologically, politically, economically, or technologically. Replicator
   dynamics is used to investigate the complex transient dynamics of the
   population response. Though simple, our modeling approach exhibits a
   surprisingly rich and diverse array of dynamics. Our results highlight
   the critical roles played by diversity in strategies and the magnitude
   of the shift. Importantly, it allows for a variety of strategies to
   arise organically as an integral part of the transient dynamics-as
   opposed to an independent process-of population response to a regime
   shift, providing a link between the population's past and future
   diversity patterns. Several combinations of different populations'
   strategy distributions and shifts were systematically investigated. Such
   rich dynamics highlight the challenges of anticipating the response of a
   divided population to a change. The findings in this paper can
   potentially improve our understanding of a wide range of
   socio-ecological and technological transitions.

AB Studies have shown that natural environments can enhance health and here
   we build upon that work by examining the associations between
   comprehensive greenspace metrics and health. We focused on a large urban
   population center (Toronto, Canada) and related the two domains by
   combining high-resolution satellite imagery and individual tree data
   from Toronto with questionnaire-based self-reports of general health
   perception, cardio-metabolic conditions and mental illnesses from the
   Ontario Health Study. Results from multiple regressions and multivariate
   canonical correlation analyses suggest that people who live in
   neighborhoods with a higher density of trees on their streets report
   significantly higher health perception and significantly less
   cardio-metabolic conditions (controlling for socio-economic and
   demographic factors). We find that having 10 more trees in a city block,
   on average, improves health perception in ways comparable to an increase
   in annual personal income of $10,000 and moving to a neighborhood with
   $10,000 higher median income or being 7 years younger. We also find that
   having 11 more trees in a city block, on average, decreases
   cardio-metabolic conditions in ways comparable to an increase in annual
   personal income of $20,000 and moving to a neighborhood with $20,000
   higher median income or being 1.4 years younger.

AB The present research investigates the role of intuitive mental
   processing on cooperation in experimental games involving structural
   inequality. Results from an experiment using conceptual priming to
   induce intuitive mental processing provide the first evidence that
   cooperation is promoted by intuition in an asymmetric context that
   distributes the gains from cooperation unequally among a group.
   Therefore, the results extend our understanding of the cognitive
   underpinnings of human cooperation by demonstrating the robustness of
   intuitive cooperation in games involving structural inequality regarding
   asymmetric gains from cooperation. Additionally, the results provide the
   first successful conceptual replication of the intuition-cooperation
   link using conceptual priming, therefore also contributing to the debate
   about the validity of previous research in other contexts. Taken
   together, the present research contributes to the literature on
   psychological and institutional mechanisms that promote cooperation.

AB High-precision accelerator mass spectrometer (AMS) C-14 dates of scarlet
   macaw (Ara macao) skeletal remains provide the first direct evidence
   from Chaco Canyon in northwestern New Mexico that these Neotropical
   birds were procured from Mesoamerica by Pueblo people as early as
   similar to A.D. 900-975. Chaco was a prominent prehistoric Pueblo center
   with a dense concentration of multistoried great houses constructed from
   the 9th through early 12th centuries. At the best known great house of
   Pueblo Bonito, unusual burial crypts and significant quantities of
   exotic and symbolically important materials, including scarlet macaws,
   turquoise, marine shell, and cacao, suggest societal complexity
   unprecedented elsewhere in the Puebloan world. Scarlet macaws are known
   markers of social and political status among the Pueblos. New AMS
   C-14-dated scarlet macaw remains from Pueblo Bonito demonstrate that
   these birds were acquired persistently from Mesoamerica between A.D. 900
   and 1150. Most of the macaws date before the hypothesized apogeal
   Chacoan period (A.D. 1040-1110) to which they are commonly attributed.
   The 10th century acquisition of these birds is consistent with the
   hypothesis that more formalized status hierarchies developed with
   significant connections to Mesoamerica before the post-A.D. 1040
   architectural florescence in Chaco Canyon.

AB Evidence from three studies reveals a critical difference in
   self-control as a function of political ideology. Specifically, greater
   endorsement of political conservatism (versus liberalism) was associated
   with greater attention regulation and task persistence. Moreover, this
   relationship is shown to stem from varying beliefs in freewill;
   specifically, the association between political ideology and
   self-control is mediated by differences in the extent to which belief in
   freewill is endorsed, is independent of task performance or motivation,
   and is reversed when freewill is perceived to impede (rather than
   enhance) self-control. Collectively, these findings offer insight into
   the self-control consequences of political ideology by detailing
   conditions under which conservatives and liberals are better suited to
   engage in self-control and outlining the role of freewill beliefs in

AB Background
   Despite universal health care coverage, disparities in colorectal cancer
   (CRC) screening by income in Switzerland have been reported. However, it
   is not known if these disparities have changed over time. This study
   examines the association between socioeconomic position and CRC
   screening in Switzerland between 2007 and 2012.
   Methods
   Data from the 2007 (n = 5,946) and 2012 (n = 7,224) population-based
   Swiss Health Interview Survey data (SHIS) were used to evaluate the
   association between monthly household income, education, and employment
   with CRC screening, defined as endoscopy in the past 10 years or fecal
   occult blood test (FOBT) in the past 2 years. Multivariable Poisson
   regression was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and 95%
   Confidence Intervals (CI) adjusting for demographics, health status, and
   health utilization.
   Results
   CRC screening increased from 18.9% in 2007 to 22.2% in 2012 (padjusted:
   = 0.036). During the corresponding time period, endoscopy increased
   (8.2% vs. 15.0%, padjusted:<0.001) and FOBT decreased (13.0% vs. 9.8%,
   padjusted: 0.002). CRC screening prevalence was greater in the highest
   income (>$6,000) vs. lowest income (<=$ 2,000) group in 2007 (24.5% vs.
   10.5%, PR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.96-1.96) and in 2012 (28.6% vs. 16.0%, PR:
   1.45, 95% CI: 1.09-1.92); this disparity did not significantly change
   over time.
   Conclusions
   While CRC screening prevalence in Switzerland increased from 2007 to
   2012, CRC screening coverage remains low and disparities in CRC
   screening by income persisted over time. These findings highlight the
   need for increased access to CRC screening as well as enhanced awareness
   of the benefits of CRC screening in the Swiss population, particularly
   among low-income residents.

   practices, smoking, exercise, dieting, family planning, bullying, and
   mental health. We review the literature that suggests the relationship
   between health behaviors and social network attributes demonstrates a
   high degree of specificity. The article then examines hypothesized
   social influence mechanisms including social norms, modeling, and social
   rewards and the factors of social identity and social rewards that can
   be employed to sustain social network interventions. Areas of future
   research avenues are highlighted, including the need to examine and to
   adjust analytically for contamination and social diffusion, social
   influence versus differential affiliation, and network change. Use and
   integration of mhealth and face-to-face networks for promoting health
   behavior change are also critical research areas.

AB Several studies have investigated associations between socioeconomic
   status (SES) and indicators of children's physiological and cognitive
   self-regulation. Although objective measures of family SES may be good
   proxies for families' experiences of disadvantage, less is known about
   subjective aspects of families' experiences. We hypothesize that
   subjective social status (SSS) and perceived stress may be important
   independent predictors of children's stress physiology and executive
   functioning (EF). Eighty-two children from diverse SES backgrounds were
   administered EF measures and provided saliva samples for cortisol assay.
   Caregivers reported on objective SES, SSS, and perceived stress. Results
   suggest that SES and SSS are both independently and positively related
   to EF. In models predicting stress physiology, higher perceived stress
   was associated with lower baseline cortisol. Moreover, SES and age
   interacted to predict cortisol levels such that among younger children,
   lower SES was associated with higher cortisol, whereas among older
   children, lower SES was associated with lower cortisol. Results
   highlight the importance of considering both objective and subjective
   indicators of families' SES and stressful experiences in relation to
   multiple aspects of children's self-regulation.

AB Language is almost universally considered an encoding of mental contents
   into an utterance stream, and mental contents, in turn, are almost
   universally considered constituted as, or derived from, encodings of the
   environment. This basic framework has been in place for millennia, but
   it has remained mysterious and perplexing how it could be modeled. I
   have argued for some time that both aspects of this encoding framework
   are fatally flawed, and here I outline an alternative perspective on the
   nature of both mental representation and language. The model outlined is
   generally pragmatist in the senses of Peirce (although it is not
   semiotic) and Dewey. It is an interaction-based model in which
   representation is emergent in interaction systems and language is
   constituted as a conventional system for generating interactions with
   social realities-which, in turn, are constituted as relations among
   individuals' representations of their environments.

AB Stochastic models for finite binary vectors are widely used in
   sociology, with examples ranging from social influence models on
   dichotomous behaviors or attitudes to models for random graphs. Exact
   sampling for such models is difficult in the presence of dependence,
   leading to the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as an
   approximation technique. While often effective, MCMC methods have
   variable execution time, and the quality of the resulting draws can be
   difficult to assess. Here, we present a novel alternative method for
   approximate sampling from binary discrete exponential families having
   fixed execution time and well-defined quality guarantees. We demonstrate
   the use of this sampling procedure in the context of random graph
   generation, with an application to the simulation of a large-scale
   social network using both geographical covariates and dyadic dependence
   mechanisms.

AB This essay brings together 'commodity chain' analysis with some of the
   central concerns motivating studies of consumption and consumer culture.
   It argues that we can, from the perspective of capitalist agents and
   agencies, discern important historical shifts in the economic
   significance of the various activities that generate modern consumer
   culture, or 'consumer cultural production'. Shifts in both the nature
   and intensity of competitive pressures imply different roles for
   consumer cultural production within the portfolios and strategies of
   leading capitalist organizations over time. Thus, the essay provides a
   framework for periodizing and linking historical shifts in the
   organization of commodity chains in relation to transformations in the
   structure and nature of consumer cultural production over roughly the
   past century. More concretely, it connects the broad shift from
   commodity chains organized along a 'producer-driven' form to the
   'buyer-driven' arrangement to different kinds of 'market making' through
   consumer cultural production.

AB For decades sociologists have been interested in the labor movement's
   attempts to rebound. Most research, however, focuses on revitalization
   within the service industry, ignoring important efforts in other
   sectors, like construction. As recent scholars argue, revitalization
   within the building trades is unique because organizing workers is not
   the same as organizing work. Locals must simultaneously increase
   membership and market capacity. Unfortunately, existing theories ignore
   many obstacles that building trade unions face in market expansion
   efforts. These obstacles include macro-economic conditions, like the
   Great Recession, which limit work opportunities; inter-union competition
   which allows one Local to expand market share by poaching work from
   another; and cost differentials which continue to prevent unions from
   breaking into new markets. Relying on the case of International
   Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 58, these obstacles are
   explored and used to reformulate current theories on revitalization and
   market recovery within the building trades.

   for expressing the sacred. The creation of specialized roles brought
   about by the division of labor associated with producing the gospel
   sound, combined with changes in the orientation of experiential
   structures, forged new standards of authenticity and created a structure
   for experiencing the sacred that, within the context of performance,

AB Objectives. We evaluated a school-based child sexual abuse (CSA)
   prevention program, Safe Touches, in a low-socioeconomic status,
   racially diverse sample.
   Methods. Participants were 492 second-and third-grade students at 6
   public elementary schools in New York City. The study period spanned
   fall 2012 through summer 2014. We cluster-randomized classrooms to the
   Safe Touches intervention or control groups and assessed outcomes with
   the Children's Knowledge of Abuse Questionnaire. Hierarchical models
   tested change in children's knowledge of inappropriate and appropriate
   touch.
   Results. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvement
   than the control group on knowledge of inappropriate touch. Children in
   second grade and children in schools with a greater proportion of
   students in general (vs special) education showed greater gains than
   other participants in knowledge of inappropriate touch. We observed no
   significant change in knowledge of appropriate touch among control or
   intervention groups.
   Conclusions. Young children benefited from a school-based, 1-time CSA
   prevention program. Future research should explore the efficacy of CSA
   prevention programs with children before the second grade to determine
   optimal age for participation.

AB Objectives. We sought to understand incarcerated youths' perspectives on
   the role of protective factors and risk factors for juvenile offending.
   Methods. We performed an in-depth qualitative analysis of interviews
   (conducted October-December 2013) with 20 incarcerated youths detained
   in the largest juvenile hall in Los Angeles.
   Results. The adolescent participants described their homes, schools, and
   neighborhoods as chaotic and unsafe. They expressed a need for love and
   attention, discipline and control, and role models and perspective.
   Youths perceived that when home or school failed to meet these needs,
   they spent more time on the streets, leading to incarceration. They
   contrasted the path through school with the path to jail, reporting that
   the path to jail felt easier. All of them expressed the insight that
   they had made bad decisions and that the more difficult path was not
   only better but also still potentially achievable.
   Conclusions. Breaking cycles of juvenile incarceration will require that
   the public health community partner with legislators, educators,
   community leaders, and youths to determine how to make success, rather
   than incarceration, the easier path for disadvantaged adolescents.

TI The Interaction Between an Individual's Acculturation and Community

AB Objectives. We examined whether the interactions between primarily
   speaking English at home and community-level measures (median household
   income and immigrant composition) are associated with physical
   inactivity and obesity.
   Methods. We pooled the 2005 and 2007 Los Angeles County Health Survey
   data to construct a multilevel data set, with community-level median
   household income and immigrant density as predictors at the community
   level. After controlling for individual-level demographic variables, we
   included the respondent's perceived community safety as a covariate to
   test the hypothesis that perceived public safety mediates the
   association between acculturation and health outcomes.
   Results. The interaction between community median household income and
   primarily speaking English at home was associated with lower likelihoods
   of physical inactivity (odds ratio [OR] = 0.644; 95% confidence interval
   [CI] = 0.502, 0.825) and obesity (OR = 0.674; 95% CI = 0.514, 0.882).
   These odds remained significant after we controlled for perceived
   community safety.
   Conclusions. Resources in higher-income areas may be beneficial only to
   residents fully integrated into the community. Future research could
   focus on understanding how linguistic isolation affects community-level
   social learning and access to resources and whether this differs by
   family-level acculturation.

AB We explore the consequences of increased financial investment by
   non-financial firms, finding consistent evidence that financialization
   in the non-finance sector reduced economic growth in that sector.
   Employing an expanded conceptualization of value added which identifies
   internal (capital, labour) and external (creditors, government,
   charities) stakeholders with claims on the value generated in production
   and exchange, we find that the declining value added produced by
   financialization was born most strikingly by labour and the state, while
   increasing value was channelled to corporate debt and equity holders.
   Corporate charities also had a net gain associated with increased
   financial investments by the non-financial firms.

AB In recent decades, financialization has significantly restructured
   American capitalism. Social scientists have offered several accounts to
   explain financial markets' ascendance, but this work often portrays
   financialization as a totalizing force and is conducted within divergent
   theoretical paradigms-political economy and neo-institutionalism-with
   few attempts to bridge these differences. Accordingly, we risk talking
   past each other while failing to identify where financialization occurs.
   I address these issues with a unique panel data set, panel analysis and
   with a focus on identifying the meso-level determinants of
   financialization. I do so with a substantively important industry that
   exemplifies the global, flexible and competitive characteristics of
   neo-liberal capitalism. I argue that the propensity to financialize
   rests significantly upon firms' productive roles, meaning we cannot
   understand financialization without understanding production-global
   production networks in particular. This is also a call for researchers
   to explore financialization's multifaceted character and to develop a
   more analytically rigorous research agenda.

AB Objectives. We considered changes in the geographic distribution of
   early stage breast cancer among White and non-White women while secular
   trends in lifestyle and health care were under way.
   Methods. We aggregated tumor registry and census data by age, race,
   place of residence, and year of diagnosis to evaluate rate variation
   across Connecticut census tracts between 1985 and 2009. Global and local
   cluster detection tests were completed.
   Results. Age-adjusted incidence rates increased by 2.71% and 0.44% per
   year for White and non-White women, respectively. Significant global
   clustering was identified during surveillance of these populations, but
   the elements of clustering differed between groups. Among White women,
   fewer local clusters were detected after 1985 to 1989, whereas
   clustering increased over time among non-Whitewomen.
   Conclusions. Small-area variation of breast cancer incidence rates
   across time periods proved to be dynamic and race-specific. Incidence
   rates might have been affected by secular trends in lifestyle or health
   care. Single cross-sectional analyses might have confused our
   understanding of disease occurrence by not accounting for the social
   context in which patient preferences or provider capacity influence the
   numbers and locations of diagnosed cases. Serial analyses are
   recommended to identify "hot spots" where persistent geographic
   disparities in incidence occur.

AB nonsmoking women of reproductive age as a proxy for workplace secondhand
   smoke exposure during pregnancy.
   Methods. We included nonsmoking women aged 18 to 44 years employed
   during the past 12 months who participated in the 2010 National Health
   Interview Survey. We estimated the prevalence of workplace secondhand
   smoke exposure and its associations with sociodemographic and workplace
   characteristics.
   Results. Nine percent of women reported workplace secondhand smoke
   exposure. Prevalence decreased with increasing age, education, and
   earnings. Workplace secondhand smoke exposure was associated with
   chemical exposure (prevalence odds ratio [POR] = 3.3; 95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 2.3, 4.7); being threatened, bullied, or harassed (POR =
   3.2; 95% CI = 2.1, 5.1); vapors, gas, dust, or fume exposure (POR = 3.1;
   95% CI = 2.3, 4.4); and worrying about unemployment (POR = 3.0; 95% CI =
   1.8, 5.2), among other things.

   Fourteen articles met all inclusioncriteria. The majority of included
   articles reported significant underuse of ET among minority and
   low-income women. Modifiable intrapersonal, interpersonal, and
   community-level factors are associated with ET use, and these factors
   vary across subgroups.
   Both race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are associated with ET use
   in most settings. Variation in factors associated with ET use across

   factors.
   Results. Of the trans*female youths, 4.8% were HIV positive.
   Racial/ethnic minority and White trans*female youths differed
   significantly in gender identity and sexual orientation. Racial/ethnic
   minority youths also had significantly lower educational attainment,
   were less likely to have lived with their parents of origin as a child,
   and were significantly more likely to engage in recent condomless anal
   intercourse than were Whites.
   Conclusions. Efforts to assess the impact of multiple-minority stress on
   racial/minority trans*female youths are needed imminently, and
   prevention efforts must addressmacrolevel disparities for trans*female
   youths, especially those from racial/ethnic minority groups, to reduce

   Methods. We used difference-in-difference models to estimate the impact
   of the ACA expansion on health care expenditures, out-of-pocket payments
   (OOP) as a share of total health care expenditure, and utilization among
   young adults aged 19 to 26 years by race/ethnicity (White, African

   compared with the 27 to 30 years cohort. OOP, as a share of health care
   expenditure, remained the same after the ACA expansion for all

   expansion among all racial/ethnic groups for those aged 19 to 26 years

   Methods. We linked health care and publicly available datasets by home
   zip code for traumatically injured workers in Illinois from 2000 to
   2009. We calculated numbers and rates of injuries, determined the
   spatial relationships, and developed 3 models.
   Results. Among the 23 200 occupational injuries, 80% of cases were
   located in 20% of zip codes and clustered in 10 locations. After
   component analysis, numbers and clusters of injuries correlated directly
   with immigrants; injury rates inversely correlated with urban poverty.
   Conclusions. Traumatic occupational injuries were clustered spatially by
   home location of the affected workers and in a predictable way. This put
   an inequitable burden on communities and provided evidence for the
   possible value of community-based interventions for prevention of
   occupational injuries. Work should be included in health disparities
   research. Stakeholders should determine whether and how to intervene at
   the community level to prevent occupational injuries.

AB Objectives. We identified correlates of racial/ethnic disparities in
   colorectal cancer screening and changes in disparities under
   state-mandated insurance coverage.
   Methods. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, we
   estimated a Fairlie decomposition in the insured population aged 50 to
   64 years and a regression-adjusted
   difference-in-difference-in-difference model of changes in screening
   attributable to mandates.
   Results. Under mandated coverage, blood stool test (BST) rates increased
   among Black, Asian, and Native American men, but rates among Whites also
   increased, so disparities did not change. Endoscopic screening rates
   increased by 10 percentage points for Hispanic men and 3 percentage
   points for non-Hispanic men. BST rates fell among Hispanic relative to
   non-Hispanic men. We found no changes for women. However, endoscopic
   screening rates improved among lower income individuals across all races
   and ethnicities.
   Conclusions. Mandates were associated with a reduction in endoscopic
   screening disparities only for Hispanic men but may indirectly reduce
   racial/ethnic disparities by increasing rates among lower income
   individuals. Findings imply that systematic differences in insurance
   coverage, or health plan fragmentation, likely existed without mandates.
   These findings underscore the need to research disparities within
   insured populations.

   Methods. We used data from the 2013 Minnesota Health Access Survey to
   identify 4123 Minnesota adults aged 18 to 64 years who reported about
   their experiences of insurance-based discrimination. We modeled the
   association between discrimination and insurance type and predicted odds
   of having reduced access to care among those reporting discrimination,
   controlling for sociodemographic factors. Data were weighted to
   represent the state's population.
   Results. Reports of insurance-based discrimination were higher among
   uninsured (25%) and publicly insured (21%) adults than among privately
   insured adults (3%), which held in the regression analysis. Those
   reporting discrimination had higher odds of lacking a usual source of
   care, lacking confidence in getting care, forgoing care because of cost,
   and experiencing provider-level barriers than those who did not.
   Conclusions. Further research and policy interventions are needed to

   medical schools participating in the 2011-2012 survey. Pathologists'
   response rate was 66% (461 of 697). To investigate sex differences, t
   tests and chi(2) analyses were used. The APC survey, administered to
   academic department chairs, had a 55% response rate (104 of 189).
   Results.-According to the Faculty Forward Engagement Survey, women
   report more time in patient care and less time in research. Women
   consider formal mentorship, feedback, and career advancement more
   important than men do and are less satisfied with communication and
   governance. The APC survey shows that 20% to 40% of nonchair department
   leaders are women. More than half of chairs report satisfaction with the
   sex diversity of their departmental leaders.
   Conclusion.-Opportunities exist for department chairs and professional
   organizations to create targeted interventions to support career
   satisfaction, recruitment, retention, and career and leadership
   development for women in academic pathology. Although chairs report
   satisfaction with diversity within department leadership, responses of
   women faculty indicate there is work to be done to grow more women
   leaders.

AB The emergent field of data science is a critical driver for innovation
   in all sectors, a focus of tremendous workforce development, and an area
   of increasing importance within science, technology, engineering, and
   math (STEM). In all of its aspects, data science has the potential to
   narrow the gender gap and set a new bar for inclusion. To evolve data
   science in a way that promotes gender diversity, we must address two
   challenges: (1) how to increase the number of women acquiring skills and
   working in data science and (2) how to evolve organizations and
   professional cultures to better retain and advance women in data
   science. Everyone can contribute.

AB It is widely recognized that achieving water security will take
   substantive investments in hydrology, engineering, soil science,
   agronomy, and a wide variety of physical and natural sciences and
   technologies. Less understood is the human aspect, the social science of
   beliefs, values, human perceptions and decision-making, social
   relationships, and social organization that intentionally and
   unintentionally construct, destroy, and reconstruct the water and land
   resources to which society is intimately linked. Addressing the complex
   issues of water security will require humans to acknowledge the threats
   to security and a willingness to give priority to assuring water
   quality, water availability, and water access to meet the needs of a
   growing world population and their economic engines.
   Soil-water-vegetation-climate-human relationships are central to
   maintaining and repairing the hydrological cycle necessary for fresh,
   safe, and abundant water supply. The current and future condition of our
   earth ecosystem is substantively dependent on individual and social
   decisions and policies associated with water. There is a need for (i)
   more coupled human-natural science to understand these relationships,
   (ii) greater public participation in connecting scientific facts and
   social values, and (iii) a willingness to innovate and adapt water and
   land use decisions and policies as scientific understanding and values
   evolve.

AB STUDY QUESTION: Do the strategies women use to disclose information
   about their infertility to social network members impact the quality of
   the support they receive and their quality of life?
   SUMMARY ANSWER: The data showed that women who disclosed
   infertility-related information in direct ways, rather than in indirect
   ways (e.g. by incremental disclosures or through third parties), to
   social network members perceived higher quality support and reported
   greater quality of life related to their infertility experience.
   WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Social support has been shown to buffer stress
   associated with various health issues including infertility. The way
   people disclose information about stressors has been associated with the
   quality of the support they receive. Disclosing information in a way
   that most effectively elicits support is beneficial because women with
   infertility who have lower levels of stress are more likely to seek and
   remain in treatment.
   STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional study of 301
   infertile women was conducted in the USA.
   PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: To determine the variation in
   length of infertility and treatment decisions, we conducted an online
   survey of 301 American women coping with infertility. We investigated
   the strategies women used to disclose infertility-related information
   with social network members, their perceptions of support from friends
   and family, and their quality of life both in general (overall quality
   of life) and related to the experience of infertility (fertility quality
   of life).
   MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Direct disclosure of experiences
   related to infertility was positively and significantly associated with
   the perceived quality of social support received (P < 0.01). Strategies
   of disclosure that use entrapment or indirect media were negatively
   associated with fertility quality of life (P < 0.001). Directly (P <
   0.01) and incremental disclosures (P < 0.01) were positively associated
   with overall quality of life, while the use of humor was negatively
   associated with overall quality of life (P < 0.01). Perceived support
   quality also mediated the influence of direct disclosures on women's
   fertility quality of life (95% CI: 0.18, 1.05) and overall quality of
   life (95% CI: 0.10, 0.30). This effect is particularly noteworthy for
   the model predicting fertility quality of life, which exhibited a
   non-significant main effect with direct disclosures. The non-significant
   main effect combined with the significant indirect effect suggests that
   perceived support quality fully mediates the association between direct
   disclosures and fertility quality of life.
   LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The cross-sectional nature of our
   convenient sample did not allow us to test cause and effect. It is
   equally plausible that women who perceive support are more likely to
   disclose. Longitudinal data are necessary to test the cyclic nature of
   these variables and confirm directionality.
   WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: When women make the decision to
   reveal information about their infertility, direct disclosure (i.e.
   face-to-face, clearly, verbally and with the opportunity for an
   immediate response) was the only strategy that significantly
   corresponded with perceived support quality and was one of only two
   strategies that were positively associated with quality of life. To the
   extent that social support reduces stress, and lower stress increases
   the chance that people seek and stay in treatment, infertility clinics
   and therapists can use this information as a low-cost strategy for
   supporting infertile women. Scholars and practitioners can also instruct
   women coping with infertility about how to most effectively engage in
   seeking effective support.
   STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): No external funding was either
   sought or obtained for this study and no competing interests are
   declared.

AB Can we identify and theorize contingency as a property of processes and
   situations? Applied to social and historical events, contingency denotes
   a mode of causality characterized by its indeterminate character.
   Conjunctural causation and period effects lack the specificity required
   to identify a distinctive class of processes. References to chance
   happenings offer no clue to analyze endogenous disruptions. Focusing on
   breaks in patterns of social relations and the role played by individual
   agency, the author distinguishes four types of impact-pyramidal,
   pivotal, sequential, and epistemic-and investigates how these relate to
   the possibility of indeterminacy through an Event Structure Analysis of
   the night of August 4, 1789, in Versailles. This empirical foray
   underscores the significance of junctures that are indeterminate with
   respect to their collective outcomes. The article grounds analytically
   this class of conjunctures with the concept of mutual uncertainty,
   gauges the phenomenal scope of this contingency in terms of action
   domains and group types, contrasts it with the notion of chance events,
   and draws its implications for the study of social and historical
   change.

AB Objective To estimate the absolute wealth of households using data from
   demographic and health surveys.
   Methods We developed a new metric, the absolute wealth estimate, based
   on the rank of each surveyed household according to its material assets
   and the assumed shape of the distribution of wealth among surveyed
   households. Using data from 156 demographic and health surveys in 66
   countries, we calculated absolute wealth estimates for households. We
   validated the method by comparing the proportion of households defined
   as poor using our estimates with published World Bank poverty
   headcounts. We also compared the accuracy of absolute versus relative
   wealth estimates for the prediction of anthropometric measures.
   Findings The median absolute wealth estimates of 1 403 186 households
   were 2056 international dollars per capita (interquartile range:
   723-6103). The proportion of poor households based on absolute wealth
   estimates were strongly correlated with World Bank estimates of
   populations living on less than 2.00 United States dollars per capita
   per day (R-2=0.84). Absolute wealth estimates were better predictors of
   anthropometric measures than relative wealth indexes.
   Conclusion Absolute wealth estimates provide new opportuhities for
   comparative research to assess the effects of economic resources on
   health and human capital, as well as the long-term health consequences
   of economic change and inequality.

AB BACKGROUND: Understanding ethnic differences in health status (HS) could
   help in designing culturally appropriate interventions. We hypothesized
   that racial and ethnic differences exist in HS between non-Hispanic
   whites and Mexican Americans with obstructive lung disease (OLD) and
   that these differences are mediated by socioeconomic factors.
   METHODS: We analyzed 826 US adults aged >= 30 years self-identified as
   Mexican American or non-Hispanic white with spirometry-confirmed OLD
   (FEV1/FVC < 0.7) who participated in the National Health and Nutrition
   Examination Survey 2007-2010. We assessed associations between Mexican
   American ethnicity and self-reported HS using logistic regression models
   adjusted for demographics, smoking status, number of comorbidities,
   limitations for work, and lung function and tested the contribution of
   education and health-care access to ethnic differences in HS.
   RESULTS: Among Mexican Americans with OLD, worse (fair or poor) HS was
   more prevalent than among non-Hispanic whites (weighted percentage [SE],
   46.6% [5.0] vs 15.2% [1.6]; P < .001). In bivariate analysis,
   socioeconomic characteristics were associated with lower odds of
   reporting poor HS (high school graduation: OR, 0.24 [95% CI, 0.10-0.40];
   access to health care: OR, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.30-0.80]). In fully adjusted
   models, a strong association was found between Mexican American
   ethnicity (vs non-Hispanic white) and fair or poor HS (OR, 7.52; 95% CI,
   4.43-12.78; P < .001). Higher education and access to health care
   contributed to lowering the Mexican American ethnicity odds of fair or
   poor HS by 47% and 16%, respectively, and together, they contributed 55%
   to reducing the differences in HS with non-Hispanic whites.
   CONCLUSIONS: Mexican Americans with OLD report poorer overall HS than
   non-Hispanic whites, and education and access to health care are large
   contributors to the difference.

AB Afghanistan and Iraq veterans experienced traumas during deployment, and
   disrupted connections with friends and family. In this context, it is
   critical to understand the nature of veterans' transition to civilian
   life, the challenges navigated, and approaches to reconnection. We
   investigated these issues in a qualitative study, framed by homecoming
   theory, that comprised in-depth interviews with 24 veterans. Using an
   inductive thematic analysis approach, we developed three overarching
   themes. Military as family explored how many veterans experienced the
   military environment as a "family" that took care of them and provided
   structure. Normal is alien encompassed many veterans experiences of
   disconnection from people at home, lack of support from institutions,
   lack of structure, and loss of purpose upon return to civilian life.
   Searching for a new normal included strategies and supports veterans
   found to reconnect in the face of these challenges. A veteran who had
   successfully transitioned and provided support and advice as a peer
   navigator was frequently discussed as a key resource. A minority of
   respondents-those who were mistreated by the military system, women
   veterans, and veterans recovering from substance abuse problems-were
   less able to access peer support. Other reconnection strategies included
   becoming an ambassador to the military experience, and knowing
   transition challenges would ease with time. Results were consistent with
   and are discussed in the context of homecoming theory and social climate
   theory. Social support is known to be protective for veterans, but our
   findings add the nuance of substantial obstacles veterans face in
   locating and accessing support, due to disconnection and unsupportive
   institutions. Larger scale work is needed to better understand how to
   foster peer connection, build reconnection with family, and engage the
   broader community to understand and support veterans; interventions to
   support reconnection for veterans should be developed.

AB Objectives. Studies about racial disparities in infant mortality suggest
   that racial differences in socioeconomic position (SEP) and maternal
   risk behaviors explain some, but not all, excess infant mortality among
   Blacks relative to non-Hispanic Whites. We examined the contribution of
   these to disparities in specific causes of infant mortality.
   Methods. We analyzed data about 2,087,191 mother-child dyads in Michigan
   between 1989 and 2005. First, we calculated crude Black-White infant
   mortality ratios independently and by specific cause of death. Second,
   we fit multivariable Poisson regression models of infant mortality,
   overall and by cause, adjusting for SEP and maternal risk behaviors.
   Third, Crude Black-White mortality ratios were compared to adjusted
   predicted probability ratios, overall and by specific cause.
   Results. SEP and maternal risk behaviors explained nearly a third of the
   disparity in infant mortality overall, and over 25% of disparities in
   several specific causes including homicide, accident, sudden infant
   death syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome. However, SEP and
   maternal risk behaviors had little influence on disparities in other
   specific causes, such as septicemia and congenital anomalies.
   Conclusions. These findings help focus policy attention toward
   disparities in those specific causes of infant mortality most amenable
   to social and behavioral intervention, as well as research attention to
   disparities in specific causes unexplained by SEP and behavioral
   differences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Background. Local parks are an important community resource that may
   influence levels of physical activity among youth. However, few
   population-based studies have investigated park-based physical activity
   among youth.
   Purpose. This study examines sociodemographic, family, and neighborhood
   characteristics associated with park-based physical activity among
   adolescents.
   Methods. Data were from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey
   (CHIS), a population-based survey of California households, and were
   analyzed in 2012-2013 and 2015. This study examined individual (age,
   gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity), family (household income,
   parental education, and nativity), and neighborhood characteristics
   (urbanicity, perceived park availability, perceived park safety,
   neighborhood income, and racial composition) associated with engaging in
   park-based physical activity among adolescents.
   Results. In California, 71% of adolescents reported being physically
   active the last time they visited a park. In adjusted multinomial
   logistic regression analyses, older adolescents and females were less
   likely to be physically active in parks. Adolescents with a park within
   walking distance of home and those with a safe park nearby were more
   likely to be physically active during a park visit.
   Conclusions. Park availability and perceptions of park safety are
   important predictors of engaging in park-based physical activity among
   adolescents. These findings provide information that can help inform
   interventions intended to increase physical activity among youth.
   Strategies that increase availability and safety of parks and other
   recreation spaces may be particularly effective. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB We examine the causes of variation in personality traits among human
   hunter-horticulturalists. Specifically, we demonstrate that prosocial
   aspects of personality (related to leadership and gregarious
   cooperation) associate positively with physical strength and the
   possession of formal education. Moreover, we report evidence that the
   heritability associated with strength and education explains much of the
   heritability in prosocial personality traits. Our results suggest
   personality is calibrated to condition-dependent aspects of one's
   phenotype, such as size and skill.Evolutionary theories of personality
   origins have stimulated much empirical research in recent years, but
   pertinent data from small-scale human societies have been in short
   supply. We investigate adaptively patterned personality variation among
   Tsimane' forager-horticulturalists. Based on a consideration of
   cost-benefit tradeoffs that likely maintain variation in human
   prosociality, we hypothesize that individual differences in prosocial
   personality traits are facultatively calibrated to variation in
   "embodied capital"aEuro"that is, knowledge, skills, or somatic traits
   that increase expected future fitness. In support of this hypothesis, 2
   components of embodied capital-physical strength and formal
   education-associated positively with Tsimane' prosocial leadership
   orientation (PLO), a broad personality dimension representing gregarious
   cooperation, interpersonal warmth, and pursuit of leadership. Moreover,
   using pedigrees to compute heritability estimates, strength and
   education had additive effects on the heritable variance in PLO, which
   suggests that prosocial traits may be "reactively heritable" by virtue
   of their calibration to condition-dependent components of embodied
   capital. Although alternative explanations must be falsified in future
   research, our findings 1) provide one of the first demonstrations of
   adaptively patterned personality variation in a small-scale society and
   2) illustrate the potential power of an adaptationist approach to
   elucidate the causal underpinnings of heritable personality variation.

AB Objective:
   Children whose parents do not speak English experience significant
   disparities in the identification of developmental delays and disorders;
   however, little is known about the availability and validity of
   translations of developmental screeners. The goal was to create a map of
   the scientific evidence regarding translations of the 9 Academy of
   Pediatrics-recommended screening instruments into languages other than
   English.
   Methods:
   The authors conducted a systematic search of Medline and PsycINFO,
   references of identified articles, publishers' Web sites, and official
   manuals. Through evidence mapping, a new methodology supported by AHRQ
   and the Cochrane Collaboration, the authors documented the extent and
   distribution of published evidence supporting translations of
   developmental screeners. Data extraction focused on 3 steps of the
   translation and validation process: (1) translation methods used, (2)
   collection of normative data in the target language, and (3) evidence
   for reliability and validity.
   Results:
   The authors identified 63 distinct translations among the 9 screeners,
   of which 44 had supporting evidence published in peer-reviewed sources.
   Of the 63 translations, 35 had at least some published evidence
   regarding translation methods used, 28 involving normative data, and 32
   regarding reliability and/or construct validity. One-third of the
   translations found were of the Denver Developmental Screening Test.
   Specific methods used varied greatly across screeners, as did the level
   of detail with which results were reported.
   Conclusion:
   Few developmental screeners have been translated into many languages.
   Evidence map of the authors demonstrates considerable variation in both
   the amount and the comprehensiveness of information available about
   translated instruments. Informal guidelines exist for conducting
   translation of psychometric instruments but not for documentation of
   this process. The authors propose that uniform guidelines be established
   for reporting translation research in peer-reviewed journals, similar to
   those for clinical trials and studies of diagnostic accuracy.

AB Studies in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems have documented the
   potential importance of consumers on ecosystem-level nutrient dynamics.
   This is especially true when aggregations of organisms create
   biogeochemical hotspots through nutrient consumption, assimilation, and
   remineralization via excretion and egestion. Here, we focused on
   aggregations of humans in cities to examine how diet and waste
   management interact to drive nitrogen-(N) and phosphorus-(P) fluxes into
   nutrient pollution, inert forms, and nutrient recycling. We constructed
   six diet patterns (five US-based and one developing nation) to examine
   N-and P-consumption and excretion, and explored their implications for
   human health. Next, we constructed six waste-management patterns (three
   US and three for developing nations) to model how decisions at household
   and city scales determine the eventual fates of N and P. When compared
   to the US Recommended Daily Intake, all US diet patterns exceeded N and
   P requirements. Other than the "enriched CO2 environment scenario" diet,
   the typical US omnivore had the greatest excess (37% N and 62% P).
   Notably, P from food additives could account for all of the excess P
   found in US omnivore and vegetarian diets. Across all waste-management
   approaches, a greater proportion of P was stored or recycled (0 to >
   100% more P than N) and a greater proportion of N was released as
   effluent (20 to > 100% more N than P) resulting in pollution enriched
   with N and a recycling stream enriched with P. In developing nations,
   60% of N and 50% of P from excreta entered the environment as pollution
   because of a lack of sanitation infrastructure. Our study demonstrates a
   novel addition to modeling sustainable scenarios for urban N-and
   P-budgets by linking human diets and waste management through
   socio-ecological systems.

AB Populations of color and low-income communities are often
   disproportionately burdened by exposures to various environmental
   contaminants, including air pollution. Some air pollutants have
   carcinogenic properties that are particularly problematic in South
   Carolina (SC), a state that consistently has high rates of cancer
   mortality for all sites. The purpose of this study was to assess cancer
   risk disparities in SC by linking risk estimates from the U.S.
   Environmental Protection Agency's 2005 National Air Toxics Assessment
   (NATA) with sociodemographic data from the 2000 US Census Bureau.
   Specifically, NATA risk data for varying risk categories were linked by
   tract ID and analyzed with sociodemographic variables from the 2000
   census using R. The average change in cancer risk from all sources by
   sociodemographic variable was quantified using multiple linear
   regression models. Spatial methods were further employed using ArcGIS 10
   to assess the distribution of all source risk and percent non-white at
   each census tract level. The relative risk (RR) estimates of the
   proportion of high cancer risk tracts (defined as the top 10% of cancer
   risk in SC) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
   calculated between the first and latter three quartiles defined by
   sociodemographic factors, while the variance in the percentage of high
   cancer risk between quartile groups was tested using Pearson's
   chi-square. The average total cancer risk for SC was 26.8 people/million
   (ppl/million). The risk from on-road sources was approximately 5.8
   ppl/million, higher than the risk from major, area, and non-road sources
   (1.8, 2.6, and 1.3 ppl/million), respectively. Based on our findings,
   addressing on-road sources may decrease the disproportionate cancer risk
   burden among low-income populations and communities of color in SC. (C)

AB Objective:
   The effects of social discrimination, job concerns, and social support
   on worker mental health and the influence of mental health on
   occupational health outcomes have been documented intermittently. We
   propose an integrated, theory-driven model to distinguish the impact of
   social determinants on work performance and injuries and the mediating
   effects of mental health problems.
   Methods:
   The US Chinese immigrant food service workers (N = 194) completed a
   multimeasure interview; we tested the integrated model using structural
   equation modeling.
   Results:
   Mental health problems, which were associated with decreased work
   performance and increased injuries, also mediated relationships between
   job/employment concerns and both work performance and injuries but did
   not mediate the influences of discrimination and social support.
   Conclusions:
   This research reveals mechanisms by which social determinants influence
   immigrant worker health, pointing to complementary strategies for
   reducing occupational health disparities.

AB Objective: To examine associations between relative, friend, and partner
   support, as well as size and source of weekly social network, and
   mortality risk in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study.
   Patients and Methods: In a mail-back survey completed between January 1,
   1990, and December 31, 1990, adult participants in the Aerobics Center
   Longitudinal Study (N = 12,709) answered questions on whether they
   received social support from relatives, friends, and spouse/partner (yes
   or no for each) and on the number of friends and relatives they had
   contact with at least once per week. Participants were followed until
   December 31, 2003, or until the date of death. Cox proportional hazards
   regression analyses evaluated the strength of the associations,
   controlling for covariates.
   Results: Participants (3220 [25%] women) averaged 53.0 +/- 11.3 years of
   age at baseline. During a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 1139 deaths
   occurred. Receiving social support from relatives reduced mortality risk
   by 19% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% CI, 0.68-0.95). Receiving
   spousal/partner support also reduced mortality risk by 19% (HR, 0.81;
   95% CI, 0.66-0.99). Receiving social support from friends was not
   associated with mortality risk (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.75-1.09); however,
   participants reporting social contact with 6 or 7 friends on a weekly
   basis had a 24% lower mortality risk than did those in contact with 0 or
   1 friend (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Contact with 2 to 5 or 8 or more
   friends was not associated with mortality risk, nor was the number of
   weekly contacts with relatives.
   Conclusion: Receiving social support from one's spouse/partner and
   relatives and maintaining weekly social interaction with 6 to 7 friends
   reduced mortality risk. Such data may inform interventions to improve
   long-term survival. (C) 2015 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and

AB Objectives
   To examine whether race and poverty (income <125% of the federal poverty
   limit), modifies associations between diabetes and cognition in a
   biracial, urban-dwelling sample.
   Methods
   Cross-sectional data for 2066 participants (mean age = 47.6 years, 56.8%
   women, 56.2% African American, 38.6% below poverty) from the first wave
   of the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span
   study were used for analyses. Eleven tests measured cognitive function.
   Interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status with cognition
   were assessed in multiple regression analyses.
   Results
   Significant interactions among diabetes, race, and poverty status were
   observed. Among African Americans below poverty, diabetic individuals
   performed lower than nondiabetic individuals on California Verbal
   Learning Test Free Recall Short Delay (z = -0.444 [0.123] versus z =
   -0.137 [0.045]) and Long Delay (z = -0.299 [0.123] versus z = -0.130
   [0.045]), Digit Span Backward (z = -0.347 [0.109] versus z = -0.072
   [0.041]), and the Brief Test of Attention (z = -0.452 [-0.099] versus z
   = -0.099 [0.047]), and higher on Category Fluency (z = 0.114 [0.117]
   versus z = -0.118 [0.044]). No consistent differences between diabetic
   and nondiabetic individuals were found for African American and white
   participants above poverty.
   Conclusions
   Diabetes was associated with poorer verbal memory, working memory, and
   attention among African Americans living in poverty. Diabetic African
   Americans below poverty may have increased risk of cognitive deficit at
   a younger age. Improving health literacy, doctor-patient communication,
   and multidisciplinary medical care for impoverished individuals may
   reduce differences. Additional research is needed to clarify mechanisms
   underlying these associations.

AB A care/cure dichotomy exists between nursing and medicine. Consistent
   with the nature of most dichotomies, where one part dominates, medicine
   has emerged as the more valued and prestigious half of the dichotomy.
   Nursing has steadfastly adhered to the science of caring which, in many
   ways, impedes the ability to move beyond the dualism of care/cure. This
   analysis examines the origins and endurance of the care/cure dichotomy
   in nursing as both externally and internally imposed.

AB Self-help groups for mental health problems are widely used, yet studies
   of their effectiveness show mixed results and are often not
   theoretically guided. Drawing on empowerment, stigma, and social
   selection perspectives, we test a theoretically organized model of the
   relationships between self-help group involvement, empowerment, and
   recovery outcomes (symptoms and quality of life). Using two-wave survey
   data from a sample of 553 persons with mental illnesses in self-help
   groups and outpatient services, we find (1) social selection' effects -
   persons with greater symptoms and lower quality of life are less likely
   to be a part of self-help groups, (2) that self-help is associated with
   some beneficial effects on self-esteem, but is associated with stronger
   beliefs about expected stigma, (3) that self-help may yield only slight
   benefits to quality of life, and (4) perceived helpfulness of self-help
   and group involvement are reciprocally related. Open-ended questions
   reveal why some of our respondents never attended self-help group
   meetings, why those who continue to attend do so, and why others stop
   attending.

AB This article explores the role of space in social movements, through an
   examination of the case of Tahrir Square in the Egyptian revolution of
   2011. The author argues that the pre-existing, historically specific
   understanding of Tahrir Square as a politicized space of protest drew
   people there in January 2011 and shaped their participation in the
   revolution. Specifically, the author suggests that earlier mobilizations
   that took place in Tahrir Square contributed to the events of the
   revolution in three ways: (1) provided protesters with an idea about
   Tahrir as a target of protests, (2) provided protesters with the idea of
   occupation of Tahrir, and (3) provided protesters with an inspiration in
   the revolution. The article contributes to the literature in sociology
   of space and social movements by proposing that the history of space in
   social movements and previous mobilization matters, but also these may
   shape the new movement and the role of space in protest. This article is
   part of the author's research about the Egyptian revolution of 2011. It
   is based on two phases of historical and ethnographic research in Egypt
   conducted in 2011 and 2012.

AB On 28 January 2011 - as police abandoned the streets and reports of
   theft spread - Egyptians went down to the streets to protect their
   families and property, closing down intersections and setting up
   checkpoints. These neighborhood groups - known as popular committees
   (PCs) - filled the security vacuum and were one of the deciding factors
   of Mubarak's downfall. This article explores how ordinary Egyptians
   collectively acted in order to restore stability during the regime's
   moment of crisis. The author briefly introduces Egyptian PCs by
   discussing other instances of community organizing that occurred under
   extraordinary circumstances. Next, the author focuses on the
   microdynamics of PCs during the 2011 revolution by describing their
   mobilization, social networks, practices, communication methods, and
   dissolution. The PC narrative reminds us that, even during a revolution,
   the actions of ordinary individuals are often ignored by scholars and
   observers. Only after moving our attention away from the main squares do
   we begin to understand the full complexity of such exceptional moments.

AB Youth gang involvement is a serious public health challenge as
   adolescents involved in gangs are more likely than others to engage in
   violence and aggression. To better understand gang involvement, we
   examined the role of protective (empathy and parental support) and risk
   (peer deviance and lack of safety at school) factors, as well as their
   interactions, in predicting adolescent gang affiliation. The study
   involved a sample of 26,232 students (53.4% females; mean age=14.62,
   SD=1.69) participating in the California Healthy Kids Survey (CHKS), a
   survey investigating a wide range of youth health and risk behaviors
   administered in all California schools every 2 years. Using hierarchical
   linear modeling (HLM), findings indicated that high levels of empathy
   and parental support were associated with a lower likelihood of
   affiliating with a gang. Associating with deviant peers and perceiving
   the school as unsafe were positively correlated with gang membership. At
   the school level, lack of safety and type of school (special education,
   vocational, or alternative school vs. comprehensive schools) were
   associated with greater probability of gang membership. Empathy
   mitigated the association between deviant peers and gang membership.

AB ObjectiveTo examine the association of socioeconomic status (SES) and
   delays in disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment with
   clinical measures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
   MethodsRA patients were recruited from rheumatology practices. We
   assessed SES based on education, occupation, and income, and divided
   patients into tertiles. The time from RA symptom onset to DMARD
   initiation (DMARD lag) was determined by self-report of the 2 dates, and
   distance to the rheumatologist (Distance) was obtained from Google Maps.
   We examined disease activity, determined by the Disease Activity Score
   in 28 joints using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR); joint
   damage, determined from hand radiographs by Sharp scores; and physical
   disability, determined by the modified Health Assessment Questionnaire
   (M-HAQ). We used linear regression models to examine the relationship
   between clinical measures and SES, Distance, and DMARD lag.
   ResultsWe recruited 1,209 RA patients, 1,159 of whom had received DMARD
   treatment. MeanSD DMARD lag was 6.9 +/- 9.0 years. On average, patients
   with lower SES waited 8.5 +/- 10.2 years after onset of RA symptoms to
   begin DMARD treatment, compared to those in the middle and upper SES
   tertiles who waited 6.1 +/- 7.9 years (P=0.002) and 6.1 +/- 8.6 years
   (P=0.009), respectively. Each year of delayed treatment was associated
   with a DAS28-ESR increase of 0.02 (P0.001), a Sharp score increase of
   1.33 (P0.001), and an M-HAQ score increase of 0.01 (P0.001).
   ConclusionLow SES was associated with delay in DMARD initiation, and
   both were independently associated with worse clinical measures in RA.
   Strategies to reduce treatment delay in low-SES RA patients are needed.

AB Objective: To evaluate racial/ethnic differences in contraceptive use
   among women who do not desire future pregnancy.
   Study Design: We used the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth to
   examine the associations between race/ethnicity and 1) use of any
   contraceptive method at last heterosexual intercourse and 2)
   effectiveness of contraceptive method used among women who stated that
   they did not desire any (more) children. We conducted multivariable
   logistic regression to assess the independent effect of race/ethnicity
   on these outcomes, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, reproductive
   characteristics, and indicators of healthcare access and utilization.
   Results: The study sample consisted of 2900 women, aged 15-44 years. The
   vast majority of women (91.2%) used contraception at last sex, although
   this varied significantly by race/ethnicity (p<.01). In the fully
   adjusted model controlling for demographic and reproductive
   characteristics as well as healthcare access, compared to whites, black
   women were significantly less likely to use any contraception at last
   sex (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.27-0.73), while there was no significant
   difference for Hispanic women (OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.52-1.72). Among women
   who used a method at last sex, the type of contraceptive method varied
   significantly by race/ethnicity in bivariate analysis (p<.01), although
   most women (59%) used a highly effective method. In the fully adjusted
   model, racial/ethnic differences were no longer significant.
   Conclusions: In this nationally representative cohort of women who
   report that they do not desire (more) children, black women were
   significantly less likely than white women to use any contraception at
   last intercourse; this difference did not appear to be due to
   differential access to health care. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB In this study, we test the effect of in-class student peer review on
   student learning outcomes using a quasiexperimental design. We provide
   an assessment of peer review in a quantitative research methods course,
   which is a traditionally difficult and technical course. Data were
   collected from 170 students enrolled in four sections of a quantitative
   research methods course, two in-class peer review sections, and two
   sections that did not incorporate in-class peer review over two
   semesters. For the two sections with peer review, content scheduled for
   the days during which peer review was used in class was delivered
   through the online course management system. We find that in-class peer
   review did not improve final grades or final performance on student
   learning outcomes, nor did it affect performance differences between
   drafts and final assignments that measured student learning objectives.
   Further, it took time away from in-class delivery of course content in
   course sections that used in-class peer review. If peer review is
   utilized, we recommend it be assigned as an out-of-class assignment so
   it does not interfere with in-class teaching.

AB Lecturing has been criticized for fostering a passive learning
   environment, emphasizing a one-way flow of information, and not
   adequately engaging students. In contrast, active-learning approaches,
   such as team-based learning (TBL), prioritize student interaction and
   engagement and create multidirectional flows of information. This paper
   presents an exploratory analysis of whether lecturing or TBL was better
   for teaching content; developing skills, such as critical thinking; and
   creating an enjoyable learning environment in a sociology course.
   Results showed few differences in these outcomes between groups taught
   with the two different methods, although TBL students thought they
   improved their oral communication and creative thinking skills more than
   the lecture students, and they reported getting to know their professor
   and classmates more than did the lecture students.

AB Introduction: Despite a proposed connection between neighborhood
   environment and obesity, few longitudinal studies have examined the
   relationship between change in neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation,
   as defined by moving between neighborhoods, and change in body weight.
   The purpose of this study is to examine the longitudinal relationship
   between moving to more socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods and
   weight gain as a cardiovascular risk factor.
   Methods: Weight (kilograms) was measured in the Dallas Heart Study
   (DHS), a multiethnic cohort aged 18-65 years, at baseline (2000-2002)
   and 7-year follow-up (2007-2009, N=1,835). Data were analyzed in
   2013-2014. Geocoded addresses were linked to Dallas County, TX, census
   block groups. A block group-level neighborhood deprivation index (NDI)
   was created. Multilevel difference-indifference models with random
   effects and a Heckman correction factor (HCF) determined weight change
   relative to NDI change.
   Results: Forty-nine percent of the DHS population moved (263 to higher
   NDI, 586 to lower NDI, 47 within same NDI), with blacks more likely to
   move than whites or Hispanics (p<0.01), but similar baseline BMI and
   waist circumference were observed in movers versus non-movers (p>0.05).
   Adjusting for HCF, sex, race, and time-varying covariates, those who
   moved to areas of higher NDI gained more weight compared to those
   remaining in the same or moving to a lower NDI (0.64 kg per 1-unit NDI
   increase, 95% CI=0.09, 1.19). Impact of NDI change on weight gain
   increased with time (p=0.03).
   Conclusions: Moving to more-socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods was
   associated with weight gain among DHS participants. Published by

AB Determining the drivers of complex systems is a major challenge felt by
   virtually all of biology. For complex societies, there is considerable
   interest in how individuals' traits determine their social roles and how
   the milieu of trait variants within groups shapes emergent group-level
   phenotypes. In this study, we tested in spiders whether individual
   differences in behaviour, morphology, or both shape individuals'
   participation in foraging. We then tested which aspects of group
   composition (e. g. morphological composition, personality composition,
   group size) predict colony-level foraging and escape behaviour. We
   performed these studies both under (1) standardized laboratory
   conditions, where colonies' ability to build webs was constrained, and
   (2) under more free-living conditions in the field. Regardless of the
   laboratory/field distinction, we found that individual task
   participation was regulated by individuals' body size and group size:
   larger individuals and individuals in smaller groups tended to
   participate more in foraging tasks. At the colony level, colonies
   composed of bolder spiders attacked prey with a larger number of
   attackers regardless of the laboratory/field distinction. However, our
   field assessments of colony foraging revealed that the speed with which
   colonies responded to prey was determined by their group size,
   morphological composition and personality composition; none of these
   effects were detected under laboratory conditions. Finally, we found
   that colonies took longer to retreat from aversive stimuli when more
   spiders were outside the nest. Taken together, our results suggest that
   colonies' social organization and collective behaviour are determined by
   spiders' morphology, behavioural tendencies and colony demographics. The

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is strongly associated with cognition and
   achievement. Socioeconomic disparities in language and memory skills
   have been reported from elementary school through adolescence. Less is
   known about the extent to which such disparities emerge in infancy.
   Here, 179 infants from socioeconomically diverse families were
   recruited. Using a cohort-sequential design, 90 infants were followed at
   9 and 15 months, and 89 were followed at 15 and 21 months. SES
   disparities in developmental trajectories of language and memory were
   present such that, at 21 months of age, children of highly educated
   parents scored approximately .8 standard deviations higher in both
   language and memory than children of less educated parents. The home
   language and literacy environment and parental warmth partially
   accounted for disparities in language, but not memory development. (c)

AB Objective. Investigate the impact of socioeconomic status and other
   demographic variables on adherence to the National Comprehensive Cancer
   Network ovarian cancer treatment guidelines among patients with stage
   I/II disease.
   Methods. Patients diagnosed with stage I/II epithelial ovarian cancer
   between 1/1/96-12/31/06 were identified from the California Cancer
   Registry. Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression
   models were used to evaluate differences in surgical procedures,
   chemotherapy regimens, and overall adherence to the NCCN guidelines
   according to increasing SES quintiles (SES-1 to SES-5).
   Results. A total of 5445 stage I and II patients were identified. The
   median age at diagnosis was 54.0 years (range = 18-99 years); 72.5% of
   patients had stage I disease, while 27.5% had stage II disease. With a
   median follow-up time of 5 years, the 5-year ovarian cancer-specific
   survival for all patients was 82.7% (SE = 0.6%). Overall, 23.7% of
   patients received care that was adherent to the NCCN guidelines.
   Compared to patients in the highest SES quintile (SES-5), patients in
   the lowest SES quintile (SES-1) were significantly less likely to
   receive proper surgery (27.3% vs 47.9%, p < 0.001) or chemotherapy
   (42.4% vs 53.6%, p < 0.001). There were statistically significant trends
   between increasing SES and the likelihood of overall treatment plan
   adherence to the NCCN guidelines: SES-1 = 16.4%, SES-2 = 19.0%, SES-3 =
   22.4%, SES-4 = 24.2% and SES-5 = 31.6% (p < 0.001). Multivariate
   logistic regression analysis revealed that compared to SES-5, decreasing
   SES was independently predictive of a higher risk of non-standard
   overall care.
   Conclusions. For patients with early-stage ovarian cancer, low SES is a
   significant and independent predictor of deviation from the NCCN
   guidelines for surgery, chemotherapy, and overall treatment. Published

AB We examined the effects of duration of residence and age at immigration
   on mortality among US-born and foreign-born Hispanics aged 25 and older.
   We analyzed the National Health Interview Survey-National Death Index
   linked files from 1997-2009 with mortality follow-up through 2011. We
   used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the effects of duration
   of US residence and age at immigration on mortality for US-born and
   foreign-born Hispanics, controlling for various demographic,
   socioeconomic and health factors. Age at immigration included 4 age
   groups: < 18, 18-24, 25-34, and 35+ years. Duration of residence was
   0-15 and > 15 years.
   We observed a mortality advantage among Hispanic immigrants compared to
   US-born Hispanics only for those who had come to the US after age 24
   regardless of how long they had lived in the US. Hispanics who
   immigrated as youths (< 18) did not differ from US-born Hispanics on
   mortality despite duration of residence.
   Findings suggest that age at immigration, rather than duration of
   residence, drives differences in mortality between Hispanic immigrants
   and the US-born Hispanic population.

AB Background Statins reduce mortality after acute myocardial infarction,
   but up to half of patients discontinue statin use within 1 year of
   therapy initiation. Although cost may influence medication adherence, it
   is unknown whether use of generic versus brand statins influences
   adherence.
   Methods and results We linked detailed inhospital clinical data for 1421
   non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients discharged on a
   statin in 2006 to Medicare Part D medication claims records to examine
   postdischarge medication use. One-year statin adherence was defined
   using the proportion of days covered with optimal adherence >= 80%. We
   examined the association of brand versus generic statin prescription and
   1-year adherence after adjusting for demographics, clinical factors,
   predischarge lipid values, prior statin use, and socioeconomic status.
   Overall, 65.5% of statin fills were for brand-name statins. There were
   few baseline differences in demographics and clinical factors among
   generic versus brand users. Patient copay amounts were higher for brand
   versus generic statins (median = $25 vs $5, P < .001), yet the mean
   proportion of days covered over 1 year was similar (71.5% vs 68.9%; P =
   .97; unadjusted odds ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.96-1.37]). Proportion of days
   covered >= 80% was low for both generic (56.2%) and brand statins
   (55.9%; P = .93). Statin adherence rates remained similar between
   generic and brand users after adjusting for demographics, clinical risk
   factors, lipid value, prior statin use, and socioeconomic status.
   Conclusions In a cohort of older non-ST-segment elevation myocardial
   infarction patients, we found no evidence that use of generic versus
   brand drug was associated with higher adherence to statins at 1 year
   after hospital discharge.

AB Understanding the underpinnings of social responsiveness and theory of
   mind (ToM) will enhance our knowledge of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
   We hypothesize that higher-order relational reasoning (higher-order RR:
   reasoning necessitating integration of relationships among multiple
   variables) is necessary but not sufficient for ToM, and that social
   responsiveness varies independently of higher-order RR. A pilot
   experiment tested these hypotheses in n = 17 children, 3-14, with and
   without ASD. No child failing 2nd-order RR passed a false belief ToM
   test. Contrary to prediction, Social Responsiveness Scale scores did
   correlate with 2nd-order RR performance, likely due to sample
   characteristics. It is feasible to translate this comparative
   cognition-inspired line of inquiry for full-scale studies of ToM,
   higher-order RR, and social responsiveness in ASD.

AB Background Children born to parents with lower income and education are
   at risk for obesity and later-life risk of common chronic diseases, and
   epigenetics has been hypothesised to link these associations. However,
   epigenetic targets are unknown. We focus on a cluster of
   well-characterised genomically imprinted genes because their monoallelic
   expression is regulated by DNA methylation at differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs), are critical in fetal growth, and DNA methylation
   patterns at birth have been associated with increased risk of birth
   weight extremes and overweight status or obesity in early childhood.
   Methods We measured DNA methylation at DMRs regulating genomically
   imprinted domains (IGF2/H19, DLK1/MEG3, NNAT and PLAGL1) using umbilical
   cord blood leucocytes from 619 infants recruited in Durham, North
   Carolina in 2010-2011. We examined differences in DNA methylation levels
   by race/ethnicity of both parents, and the role that maternal
   socioeconomic status (SES) may play in the association between
   race/ethnic epigenetic differences.
   Results Unadjusted race/ethnic differences only were evident for DMRs
   regulating MEG3 and IGF2; race/ethnic differences persisted in IGF2/H19
   and NNAT after accounting for income and education.
   Conclusions Results suggest that parental factors may not only influence
   DNA methylation, but also do so in ways that vary by DMR. Findings
   support the hypothesis that epigenetics may link the observed lower SES
   during the prenatal period and poor outcomes such as low birth weight;
   lower birth weight has previously been associated with adult-onset
   chronic diseases and conditions that include cardiovascular diseases,
   diabetes, obesity and some cancers.

AB Improving colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates for patients from
   socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds is a recognized public
   health priority.
   Our aim was to determine if implementation of a system-wide screening
   intervention could reduce disparities in the setting of improved overall
   screening rates.
   This was an interrupted time series (ITS) analysis before and after a
   population management intervention.
   Patients eligible for CRC screening (age 52-75 years without prior total
   colectomy) in an 18-practice research network from 15 June 2009 to 15
   June 2012 participated in the study.
   The Technology for Optimizing Population Care (TopCare) intervention
   electronically identified patients overdue for screening and facilitated
   contact by letter or telephone scheduler, with or without physician
   involvement. Patients identified by algorithm as high risk for
   non-completion entered into intensive patient navigation.
   Patients were dichotomized as a parts per thousand currency signaEuro
   parts per thousand high school diploma (a parts per thousand currency
   sign HS), an indicator of socioeconomic disadvantage, vs. > HS diploma
   (> HS). The monthly disparity between a parts per thousand currency
   signaEuro parts per thousand HS and > HS with regard to CRC screening
   completion was examined.
   At baseline, 72 % of 47,447 eligible patients had completed screening,
   compared with 75 % of 51,442 eligible patients at the end of follow-up
   (p < 0.001). CRC screening completion was lower in a parts per thousand
   currency signaEuro parts per thousand HS vs. > HS patients in June 2009
   (65.7 % vs. 74.5 %, p < 0.001) and remained lower in June 2012 (69.4 %
   vs. 76.7 %, p < 0.001). In the ITS analysis, which accounts for secular
   trends, TopCare was associated with a significant decrease in the CRC
   screening disparity (0.7 %, p < 0.001). The effect of TopCare represents
   approximately 99 additional a parts per thousand currency signaEuro
   parts per thousand HS patients screened above prevailing trends, or 26
   life-years gained had these patients remained unscreened.
   A multifaceted population management intervention sensitive to the needs
   of vulnerable patients modestly narrowed disparities in CRC screening,
   while also increasing overall screening rates. Embedding interventions
   for vulnerable patients within larger population management systems
   represents an effective approach to increasing overall quality of care
   while also decreasing disparities.

   the recovery of historical memory and the politics deriving from this
   recovery. This process was catalyzed by the exhumations of the remains
   of victims of Francoism that have been under way since the beginning of
   the twenty-first century. In order to do this, we will use the
   literature on cosmopolitan sociology and provide a dialogue between this
   sociology and recent developments in the study of social and cultural
   memory using concepts like postmemory, multidirectional, and
   cosmopolitan memory. The article moves beyond the national context and
   looks at Spanish memory politics through the theory and praxis of
   Holocaust memory on the one hand and the memory of the Argentinean
   victims of the military dictatorship on the other hand. This will enable
   us to identify the components and problems of a culture and politics of
   globalized memory.

AB OBJECTIVES To describe the spatial pattern in under-5 mortality rates in
   the Basse Health and Demographic Surveillance System (BHDSS) and to test
   for associations between under-5 deaths and biodemographic and
   socio-economic risk factors.
   METHODS Using data on child survival from 2007 to 2011 in the BHDSS, we
   mapped under-5 mortality by km(2). We tested for spatial clustering of
   high or low death rates using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic.
   Associations between child death and a variety of biodemographic and
   socio-economic factors were assessed with Cox proportional hazards
   models, and deviance residuals from the best-fitting model were tested
   for spatial clustering.
   RESULTS The overall death rate among children under 5 was 0.0195 deaths
   per child-year. We found two spatial clusters of high death rates and
   one spatial cluster of low death rates; children in the two high
   clusters died at a rate of 0.0264 and 0.0292 deaths per child-year,
   while in the low cluster, the rate was 0.0144 deaths per child-year. We
   also found that children born to Fula mothers experienced, on average, a
   higher hazard of death, whereas children born in the households in the
   upper two quintiles of asset ownership experienced, on average, a lower
   hazard of death. After accounting for the spatial distribution of
   biodemographic and socio-economic characteristics, we found no residual
   spatial pattern in child mortality risk.
   CONCLUSION This study demonstrates that significant inequality in
   under-5 death rates can occur within a relatively small area (1100 km
   2). Risks of under-5 mortality were associated with mother's ethnicity
   and household wealth. If high mortality clusters persist, then equity
   concerns may require additional public health efforts in those areas.

AB Schools today are more frequently using punitive discipline practices to
   control student behavior, despite the greater effectiveness of
   community-building techniques on compliance that are based on
   restorative justice principles found in the criminal justice system.
   Prior research testing the racial threat hypothesis has found that the
   racial composition of schools is associated with the use of more
   punitive and less reparative approaches to discipline, just as it has
   been associated with criminal justice harshness. However, no research to
   date has assessed the possibility that school-level racial composition
   may affect the likelihood that specific restorative justice techniques,
   which are the most commonly used alternative, will be implemented. This
   study is the first to test the racial threat perspective in relation to
   use of the restorative practices student conferences, peer mediation,
   restitution, and community service. Using a national random sample in
   logistic regression analyses, we find that schools with proportionally
   more Black students are less likely to use such techniques when
   responding to student behavior. This finding has several troubling
   implications for minority students in particular and for education as a
   whole.

AB Fishery management is increasingly moving toward management that
   accounts for environmental and social dimensions. Such an approach
   requires the integration of natural and social science information into
   planning and decision-making processes. The actual integration of social
   science information, however, remains limited in many policy and
   decision-making processes within fisheries. Our study provides insights
   into factors that influence the intention to use social science
   information among fishery managers and the actual integration of such
   information into fishery management. Based on interviews with fishery
   managers in the Great Lakes, we find that the lack of social science
   expertise in fishery management agencies leads to multiple negative
   beliefs and attitudes, and subsequently a low intention to use social
   science information in decision-making processes. At the same time, the
   paper finds that more expertise in decision-making tools and basing
   social science on equal footing with natural sciences within fishery
   management institutions appears critical to advance the actual
   integration of social science information in fishery management. (C)

AB This paper introduces the use of social network analysis theory and
   tools for implementation research. The social network perspective is
   useful for understanding, monitoring, influencing, or evaluating the
   implementation process when programs, policies, practices, or principles
   are designed and scaled up or adapted to different settings. We briefly
   describe common barriers to implementation success and relate them to
   the social networks of implementation stakeholders. We introduce a few
   simple measures commonly used in social network analysis and discuss how
   these measures can be used in program implementation. Using the four
   stage model of program implementation (exploration, adoption,
   implementation, and sustainment) proposed by Aarons and colleagues [1]
   and our experience in developing multi-sector partnerships involving
   community leaders, organizations, practitioners, and researchers, we
   show how network measures can be used at each stage to monitor,
   intervene, and improve the implementation process. Examples are provided
   to illustrate these concepts. We conclude with expected benefits and
   challenges associated with this approach.

AB We studied received social support using the cross-cultural method of
   situation sampling. College students from the US and Japan described and
   rated recent examples of received social support, both everyday support
   as well as support in response to stress. Middle class,
   European-American (EuA) students' situations fit a model in which
   support is frequent and offered freely in interactions, even for
   relatively minor issues. Even when it's unrequested, EuA support makes
   recipients feel in control, and support-givers are perceived to have
   acted by free choice. In contrast, results suggest that middle-class
   Japanese (Jpn) contexts favor support that is empathic and responsive to
   the recipients' degree of need. Japanese support was experienced
   positively when it was emotional support, when it was in more serious
   situations and when the support was rated as needed by the recipient. In
   Japan, although problem-based support is most common, it is not
   particularly positive, apparently because it is less likely to be
   perceived as needed.

AB Culling the Masses is a rich, methodologically ambitious book, which
   sheds much needed light on the factors that influence the adoption and
   repeal of racist immigration policies across the Americas. Contrary to
   previous accounts that suggest that the end of racial selection in
   immigration policy began as a domestic issue in the United States and
   Australia and then spread elsewhere, FitzGerald and Cook-Martin find
   that geopolitical factors were the main drivers of the demise of racial
   selection. The sustained attention to the international forces that
   shape domestic immigration policyand the means through which they do
   sois an invaluable contribution of this excellent book. Culling the
   Masses also demonstrates that democracy and racist immigration laws not
   only co-existed comfortably with each other, they have also been
   causally connected. Somewhat less convincing, however, is the assertion
   that liberal democracies essentially abandoned racist immigration laws
   at the end of the 1960s.

AB Social unrest is endemic in many societies, and recent news has drawn
   attention to happenings in Latin America, the Middle East, and Eastern
   Europe. Civilian populations mobilize, sometimes spontaneously and
   sometimes in an organized manner, to raise awareness of key issues or to
   demand changes in governing or other organizational structures. It is of
   key interest to social scientists and policy makers to forecast civil
   unrest using indicators observed on media such as Twitter, news, and
   blogs. We present an event forecasting model using a notion of activity
   cascades in Twitter (proposed by Gonzalez-Bailon et al., 2011) to
   predict the occurrence of protests in three countries of Latin America:
   Brazil, Mexico, and Venezuela. The basic assumption is that the
   emergence of a suitably detected activity cascade is a precursor or a
   surrogate to a real protest event that will happen "on the ground." Our
   model supports the theoretical characterization of large cascades using
   spectral properties and uses properties of detected cascades to forecast
   events. Experimental results on many datasets, including the recent June
   2013 protests in Brazil, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

AB The size of the human population is relevant to the development of a
   sustainable world, yet the forces setting growth or declines in the
   human population are poorly understood. Generally, population growth
   rates depend on whether new individuals compete for the same energy
   (leading to Malthusian or density-dependent growth) or help to generate
   new energy (leading to exponential and super-exponential growth). It has
   been hypothesized that exponential and super-exponential growth in
   humans has resulted from carrying capacity, which is in part determined
   by energy availability, keeping pace with or exceeding the rate of
   population growth. We evaluated the relationship between energy use and
   population size for countries with long records of both and the world as
   a whole to assess whether energy yields are consistent with the idea of
   an increasing carrying capacity. We find that on average energy use has
   indeed kept pace with population size over long time periods. We also
   show, however, that the energy-population scaling exponent plummets
   during, and its temporal variability increases preceding, periods of
   social, political, technological, and environmental change. We suggest
   that efforts to increase the reliability of future energy yields may be
   essential for stabilizing both population growth and the global
   socio-economic system.

   challenge of group living. However, it remains unclear how consensus is
   achieved in stable groups with stratified social relationships. Tracking
   wild baboons with a high-resolution global positioning system and
   analyzing their movements relative to one another reveals that a process
   of shared decision-making governs baboon movement. Rather than
   preferentially following dominant individuals, baboons are more likely
   to follow when multiple initiators agree. When conflicts arise over the
   direction of movement, baboons choose one direction over the other when
   the angle between them is large, but they compromise if it is not. These
   results are consistent with models of collective motion, suggesting that
   democratic collective action emerging from simple rules is widespread,
   even in complex, socially stratified societies.

AB Social media is becoming a new battlefield for tobacco "wars".
   Evaluating the current situation is very crucial for the advocacy of
   tobacco control in the age of social media. To reveal the impact of
   tobacco-related user-generated content, this paper characterizes user
   interaction and social influence utilizing social network analysis and
   information theoretic approaches. Our empirical studies demonstrate that
   the exploding pro-tobacco content has long-lasting effects with more
   active users and broader influence, and reveal the shortage of social
   media resources in global tobacco control. It is found that the user
   interaction in the pro-tobacco group is more active, and user-generated
   content for tobacco promotion is more successful in obtaining user
   attention. Furthermore, we construct three tobacco-related social
   networks and investigate the topological patterns of these
   tobacco-related social networks. We find that the size of the
   pro-tobacco network overwhelms the others, which suggests a huge number
   of users are exposed to the pro-tobacco content. These results indicate
   that the gap between tobacco promotion and tobacco control is widening
   and tobacco control may be losing ground to tobacco promotion in social
   media.

AB Interacting drivers and pressures in many parts of the world are greatly
   undermining the long-term health and wellbeing of coastal human
   populations and marine ecosystems. However, we do not yet have a
   well-formed picture of the nature and extent of the human poverty of
   coastal communities in these areas. In this paper, we begin to fill the
   gap and present a multidimensional picture of the wellbeing of coastal
   communities, using nationally representative survey data to examine the
   health, wealth, and educational status of households in over 38000
   communities across 38 developing countries. In general, we found high
   levels of poverty across the 3 dimensions (health, wealth, and
   education) analyzed, but each dimension also showed large heterogeneity
   within and across countries. We found that coastal communities had
   statistically significant higher levels of wellbeing than non-coastal
   communities. Coastal children were less stunted, less poor, and more
   likely to live in a higher educated household when compared to
   non-coastal households. However, we found that across coastal
   communities, rural coastal communities had 1.5 times lower
   height-for-age standard deviation scores (representing high childhood
   stunting rates), were 4 times more likely to be poor, and were 1.6 times
   more likely to have low levels of educational attainment. A deeper
   understanding of human wellbeing along coasts is critical for generating
   wider social and more long-term economic benefits with respect to
   coastal marine management.

   likelihoods and influence of risks underlie a quantitative model of the
   global risk network dynamics. The modeled risks range from environmental
   to economic and technological, and include difficult to quantify risks,
   such as geo-political and social. Using the maximum likelihood
   estimation, we find the optimal model parameters and demonstrate that
   the model including network effects significantly outperforms the
   others, uncovering full value of the expert collected data. We analyze
   the model dynamics and study its resilience and stability. Our findings
   include such risk properties as contagion potential, persistence, roles
   in cascades of failures and the identity of risks most detrimental to
   system stability. The model provides quantitative means for measuring
   the adverse effects of risk interdependencies and the materialization of
   risks in the network.

AB Background
   Strong evidence supports that living in disadvantaged neighborhoods has
   direct unfavorable impact on mental and physical health. However,
   whether it also has direct impact on cellular health is largely unknown.
   Thus we examined whether neighborhood quality was associated with
   leukocyte telomere length, an indicator of cellular aging.
   Methods
   In May 2014, we extracted and analyzed baseline data from the
   Netherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA), a large
   epidemiological study of individuals age between 18-65 years (n=2902).
   Telomere length was determined using quantitative polymerase chain
   reaction. Neighborhood quality was assessed using modified measures of
   perceived neighborhood disorder, fear of crime, and noise. We used
   multivariable linear regression models to examine association between
   perceived neighborhood quality and telomere length with comprehensive
   adjustment for individual and community characteristics related to
   socioeconomic and demographic status, urbanization level, mental and
   physical health, and lifestyle.
   Results
   Compared to individuals who reported good neighborhood quality, the mean
   telomere length of those who reported moderate neighborhood quality was
   approximately 69 base pair shorter (beta = -69.33, 95% CI: -119.49,
   -19.17, p = 0.007), and that of those who reported poor neighborhood
   quality were 174 base pair shorter (beta = -173.80, 95% CI: -298.80,
   -49.01, p = 0.006). For illustrative purposes, one could extrapolate
   these outcomes to 8.7 and 11.9 years in chronological age, respectively.
   Conclusion
   We have established an association between perceived neighborhood
   quality and cellular aging over and above a range of individual
   attributes. Biological aging processes may be impacted by socioeconomic
   milieu.

AB Introduction
   Legally mandated segregation policies dictated significant differences
   in the educational experiences of black and white Americans through the
   first half of the 20th century, with markedly lower quality in schools
   attended by black children. We determined whether school term length, a
   common marker of school quality, was associated with blood pressure and
   hypertension among a cohort of older Americans who attended school
   during the de jure segregation era.
   Methods
   National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I and II data were
   linked to state level historical information on school term length. We
   used race and gender-stratified linear regression models adjusted for
   age, state and year of birth to estimate effects of term length on
   systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) and hypertension for
   US-born adults. We also tested whether correcting years of schooling for
   term length differences attenuated estimated racial disparities.
   Results
   Among black women, 10% longer school term was associated with lower SBP,
   DBP and hypertension prevalence (2.1 mmHg, 1.0 mmHg, and 5.0 percentage
   points respectively). Associations for whites and for black men were not
   statistically significant. Adjustment for education incorporating
   corrections for differences in school term length slightly attenuated
   estimated racial disparities.
   Conclusions
   Longer school term length predicted better BP outcomes among black
   women, but not black men or whites.

AB Centuries' worth of cultural stories suggest that self-sacrifice may be
   a cornerstone of our moral concepts, yet this notion is largely absent
   from recent theories in moral psychology. For instance, in the
   footbridge version of the well-known trolley car problem the only way to
   save five people from a runaway trolley is to push a single man on the
   tracks. It is explicitly specified that the bystander cannot sacrifice
   himself because his weight is insufficient to stop the trolley. But
   imagine if this were not the case. Would people rather sacrifice
   themselves than push another? In Study 1, we find that people approve of
   self-sacrifice more than directly harming another person to achieve the
   same outcome. In Studies 2 and 3, we demonstrate that the effect is not
   broadly about sensitivity to self-cost, instead there is something
   unique about sacrificing the self. Important theoretical implications
   about agent-relativity and the role of causality in moral judgments are
   discussed.

AB This paper reports on the first test of the value of an online
   curriculum in social intelligence (SI). Built from current social and
   cognitive neuroscience research findings, the 50 session SI program was
   administered, with facilitation in Spanish by classroom instructors, to
   207 students from Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Madrid as part of their
   undergraduate classes. All materials were translated into Castilian
   Spanish, including outcome measures of SI that have been used in prior
   studies to provide valid estimates of two key components of social
   intelligence: 1) Sensitivity to others and 2) confidence in one's
   capacity to manage social situations. Pre- and Posttest were
   administered to participants in the SI training, and also to 87 students
   in similar classes who did not receive the program who served as the
   control group. Gender and emotional intelligence levels at pretest also
   were examined as potential individual differences that might affect the
   impact of the program on study outcomes. Repeated measures ANOVAs on
   study outcomes revealed significant increases, from pre to post, in most
   measures of social intelligence for program participants in comparison
   to controls, with no effects of gender or age on program effectiveness.
   Prior scores on emotional intelligence were not a prerequisite for
   learning from the program. Some findings suggest ways the program may be
   improved to have stronger effects. Nonetheless, the findings indicate
   that the SI program tested here shows considerable promise as a means to
   increase the willingness of young adults to take the perspective of
   others and enhance their efficacy for initiating and sustaining positive
   social connections.

AB Socio-economic status (SES) has been associated with measures of diet
   quality; however, such measures have not directly captured overall
   eating practices in individuals. Based on the factor analysis of
   fifty-six food groups from FFQ, associations between patterns of food
   consumption and SES were examined in a nationwide sample of 17062 black
   (34.6%) and white participants (age >45 years) from the REasons for
   Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Logistic
   regression models adjusted for age, sex, racial group and geographic
   region were used to examine adherence to five emergent dietary patterns
   (convenience, plant-based, sweets/fats, southern and alcohol/salads)
   according to four levels each of individual education, household income
   and community-level SES. Further models assessed adherence to these
   dietary patterns by racial group, and an overall model including both
   racial groups examined whether the relationships between SES and
   adherence to these dietary patterns differed among black and white
   participants. For all the three measures of SES, higher SES had been
   associated with greater adherence to plant-based and alcohol/salads
   patterns, but lower adherence to sweets/fats and southern patterns.
   Statistically significant differences between black and white
   participants were observed in the associations between household income
   and adherence to alcohol/salads, individual education and adherence to
   plant-based and sweets/fats, and community SES and adherence to
   convenience patterns. As adherence to dietary patterns has been shown to
   be associated with health outcomes in this population (e.g. stroke), the
   present study offers valuable insight into behavioural and environmental
   factors that may contribute to health disparities in the diverse US
   population.

AB There has been limited involvement of HIV-negative children in HIV
   disclosure studies; most studies conducted on the effects of disclosure
   on children have been with HIV-positive children and HIV-positive
   mother-child dyads. Seven HIV-positive and five HIV-negative children
   participated in a larger study conducted to understand the lived
   experiences of HIV-positive parents and their children during the
   disclosure process in Kenya. In this study, the experiences of these 12
   children after receiving disclosure of their own and their parents'
   illnesses respectively are presented. Each child underwent an in-depth
   qualitative semi-structured digitally recorded interview. The recorded
   interviews were transcribed and loaded into NVivo8 for phenomenological
   data analysis. Five themes emerged from the data, indicating that
   HIV-positive and negative children appear to have differing
   post-disclosure experiences revolving around acceptance of illness,
   stigma and discrimination, medication consumption, sexual awareness, and
   use of coping mechanisms. Following disclosure, HIV-negative children
   accepted their parents' illnesses within a few hours to a few weeks;
   HIV-positive children took weeks to months to accept their own
   illnesses. HIV-negative children knew of high levels of stigma and
   discrimination within the community; HIV-positive children reported
   experiencing indirect incidences of stigma and discrimination.
   HIV-negative children wanted their parents to take their medications,
   stay healthy, and pay their school fees so they could have a better life
   in the future; HIV-positive children viewed medication consumption as an
   ordeal necessary to keep them healthy. HIV-negative children wanted
   their parents to speak to them about sexual-related matters;
   HIV-positive children had lingering questions about relationships, use
   of condoms, marriage, and childbearing options. All but one
   preadolescent HIV-positive child had self-identified a person to speak
   with for social support. When feeling overwhelmed by their
   circumstances, the children self-withdrew and performed positive
   activities (e.g., praying, watching TV, listening to the radio, singing,
   dancing) to help themselves feel better. Many HIV-affected families have
   a combination of HIV-positive and negative siblings within the
   household. Pending further studies conducted with larger sample sizes,
   the results of this study should assist healthcare professionals to
   better facilitate disclosure between HIV-positive parents and their
   children of mixed HIV statuses.

AB Exposure to news, opinion, and civic information increasingly occurs

   perspectives that cut across ideological lines? Using deidentified data,
   we examined how 10.1 million U.S. Facebook users interact with socially
   shared news. We directly measured ideological homophily in friend
   networks and examined the extent to which heterogeneous friends could
   potentially expose individuals to cross-cutting content. We then
   quantified the extent to which individuals encounter comparatively more
   or less diverse content while interacting via Facebook's algorithmically
   ranked News Feed and further studied users' choices to click through to
   ideologically discordant content. Compared with algorithmic ranking,
   individuals' choices played a stronger role in limiting exposure to
   cross-cutting content.

   Although bamboo can be assimilated within existing forest certification
   mechanisms, there is growing controversy among experts regarding the

   accumulation of fieldwork, interviews, and discussions among experts
   between 2005 and 2014, this article analyzes the Forest Stewardship
   Council (FSC) certification, as well as proposals arising within the
   bamboo community. Through the lens of legitimacy, it analyzes
   stakeholders' views of the input legitimacy (processes) and output
   legitimacy (effectiveness) of FSC bamboo certification. It highlights
   the dissatisfaction with the third-party model for smallholders, as well
   the lack of ecological management gains within the FSC system. However,
   currently the bamboo communities of practice are divided about ways to
   proceed regarding creating alternative approaches. At a macro level, it
   highlights current challenges regarding the need to facilitate new
   resources into already existing institutions.

AB Newly immigrated persons, whatever their origin, tend to fall in the
   lower socioeconomic levels. In fact, failure of an asylum application
   renders one destitute in a large proportion of cases, often resulting in
   a profound lack of access to basic necessities. With over a third of HIV
   positive failed asylum seekers reporting no income, and the remainder
   reporting highly limited resources, poverty is a reality for the vast
   majority. The purpose of the study was to determine the basic social
   processes that guide HIV positive undocumented migrant's efforts to gain
   health services in the UK. The study used the Grounded Theory Approach.
   Theoretical saturation occurred after 16 participants were included in
   the study. The data included reflections of the prominent factors
   related to the establishment of a safe and productive life and the
   ability of individuals to remain within the UK. The data reflected
   heavily upon the ability of migrants to enter the medical care system
   during their asylum period, and on an emerging pattern of service denial
   after loss on immigration appeal. The findings of this study are notable
   in that they have demonstrated sequence of events along a timeline
   related to the interaction between the asylum process and access to
   health-related services. The results reflect that African migrants
   maintain a degree of formal access to health services during the period
   that they possess legal access to services and informal access after the
   failure of their asylum claim. The purpose of this paper is to examine
   the basic social processes that characterize efforts to gain access to
   health services among HIV positive undocumented African migrants to the
   UK. The most recent estimates indicate that there are a total of 618,000
   migrants who lack legal status within the UK. Other studies have placed
   the number of undocumented migrants within the UK in the range of
   525,000-950,000. More than 442,000 are thought to dwell in the London
   metropolitan area. Even in cases where African migrants enter the UK
   legally, they often face considerable difficulty in their quest to gain
   legal employment due to barriers inherent to the system that grants work
   permits. With over a third of HIV positive failed asylum seekers
   reporting no income, and the remainder reporting highly limited
   resources, poverty is a reality for the vast majority.

   several organizations are working hard to address the needs of families
   impacted by HIV and AIDS. However, a close examination of some of the
   services provided suggests that young people within these families are
   ignored. Most of the services are geared toward HIV and AIDS-infected
   adult members of these families. Young people within these household are
   not targeted, and little is known about psychosocial challenges they
   experience in living with HIV-positive parents or guardians. In an
   attempt to address this gap, this small-scale qualitative study
   investigated the psychosocial challenges of young people affected by HIV
   and AIDS as a result of living with HIV-positive parents or guardians.
   Perceived sense of depression, experiencing stigma, self-blame, and lack

AB The tremendous costs of conflict have made humans resourceful not only
   at warfare but also at peacemaking. Although third parties have acted as
   peacemakers since the dawn of history, little is known about voluntary,
   informal third-party intervention in conflict. Here we introduce the
   Peacemaker Game, a novel experimental paradigm, to model and study the
   interdependence between disputants and third parties in conflict. In the
   game, two disputants choose whether to cooperate or compete and a third
   party chooses whether or not to intervene in the conflict. Intervention
   introduces side payments that transform the game disputants are playing;
   it also introduces risk for the third party by making it vulnerable to
   disputants' choices. Six experiments revealed three robust effects: (i)
   The mere possibility of third-party intervention significantly increases
   cooperation in interpersonal and intergroup conflicts; (ii) reducing the
   risk to third parties dramatically increases intervention rates, to
   every-one's benefit; and (iii) disputants' cooperation rates are
   consistently higher than third parties' intervention rates. These
   findings explain why, how, and when self-interested third parties
   facilitate peaceful conflict resolution.

AB The appearance of large geolocated communication datasets has recently
   increased our understanding of how social networks relate to their
   physical space. However, many recurrently reported properties, such as
   the spatial clustering of network communities, have not yet been
   systematically tested at different scales. In this work we analyze the
   social network structure of over 25 million phone users from three
   countries at three different scales: country, provinces and cities. We
   consistently find that this last urban scenario presents significant
   differences to common knowledge about social networks. First, the
   emergence of a giant component in the network seems to be controlled by
   whether or not the network spans over the entire urban border, almost
   independently of the population or geographic extension of the city.
   Second, urban communities are much less geographically clustered than
   expected. These two findings shed new light on the widely-studied
   searchability in self-organized networks. By exhaustive simulation of
   decentralized search strategies we conclude that urban networks are
   searchable not through geographical proximity as their country-wide
   counterparts, but through an homophily-driven community structure.

   study generous identity both alone and in tandem with these related
   constructs. Next, we briefly discuss how generosity can be

AB Purpose: Studies have demonstrated the effects of segregated social and
   physical environments on the development of chronic diseases for African
   Americans. Studies have not delineated the effects of segregated
   environments specifically on the health of African American men over
   their lifetime. This study examines the relationship between life course
   measures of racial composition of social environments and diagnosis of
   hypertension among African American men.
   Design: We analyzed cross-sectional data from a convenience sample of
   African American men seeking health care services in an outpatient
   primary care clinic serving a medically underserved patient population
   (N=118). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine
   associations between racial composition of multiple environments across
   the life course (eg, junior high school, high school, neighborhood
   growing up, current neighborhood, place of employment, place of worship)
   and hypertension diagnosis.
   Results: The majority (86%) of participants were not currently in the
   workforce (retired, unemployed, or disabled) and more than half (54%)
   reported an annual household income of <$9,999; median age was 53.
   Results suggest that African American men who grew up in mostly Black
   neighborhoods (OR=4.3; P=.008), and worked in mostly Black environments
   (OR=3.1; P=.041) were more likely to be diagnosed with hypertension than
   those who did not.
   Conclusion: We found associations between mostly Black residential and
   workplace settings and hypertension diagnoses among African American
   men. Findings suggest exposure to segregated environments during
   childhood and later adulthood may impact hypertension risk among African
   American men over the life course.

AB Objective: Previous research has documented a relationship between
   childhood socioeconomic conditions and adult health, but less is known
   about racial/ethnic differences in this relationship, particularly among
   men. This study utilizes a life course approach to investigate
   racial/ethnic differences in the relationships among early and later
   life socioeconomic circumstances and health in adulthood among men.
   Design: Panel data from the Health and Retirement Study and growth curve
   models are used to examine group differences in the relationships among
   childhood and adult socioeconomic factors and age-trajectories of
   self-rated health among White, Black and Mexican American men aged 51-77
   years (N=4147).
   Results: Multiple measures of childhood socioeconomic status (SES)
   predict health in adulthood for White men, while significantly fewer
   measures of childhood SES predict health for Black and Mexican American
   men. Moreover, the health consequences of childhood SES diminish with
   age for Black and Mexican American men. The childhood SES-adult health
   relationship is largely explained by measures of adult SES for White
   men.
   Conclusion: The life course pathways linking childhood SES and adult
   health differ by race/ethnicity among men. Similar to arguments that the
   universality of the adult SES-health relationship should not be assumed,
   results from our study suggest that scholars should not assume that the
   significance and nature of the association between childhood SES and
   health in adulthood is similar across race/ethnicity among men.

AB Objective: To understand the perceived barriers to and facilitators of
   hypertension self-management among underserved African American older
   adults in a southeastern clinic.
   Design: Qualitative descriptive.
   Setting: Urban cardiovascular health clinic in a southeastern state.
   Participants: 28 African Americans diagnosed with hypertension.
   Methods: Interview questions were focused on knowledge of hypertension
   management and barriers and facilitators to hypertension
   self-management. Thematic content analysis was applied.
   Results: Patients reported increased hypertension knowledge after
   attending the clinic. All patients reported knowledge of the severe
   consequences of uncontrolled hypertension. Perceived barriers to
   hypertension management included lack of money, lack of motivation to
   exercise, and fear of injury from exercising. Perceived facilitators of
   hypertension management included weight loss, unexpected diagnosis of
   hypertension, family members with hypertension and diabetes, and social
   support.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that perceived barriers and facilitators
   influence a patient's decision to manage hypertension. Findings suggest
   the importance of health literacy and patient-provider communication at
   this particular clinic. Possible factors in the social environment may
   influence hypertension management. This study adds to the literature by
   understanding the perceived barriers to and facilitators of hypertension
   management of an underserved sample in a southeastern clinic. The
   results suggest a need for the redesign and transformation of future
   hypertension education strategies aimed at this clinic sample.

AB Although older adult minorities face disparities in health and health
   care, they continue to be underrepresented in health research. Studies
   with biological markers of health often lack representation of older
   minority adults. The purpose of this study was to describe perceptions
   of biomarkers among ethnic minority seniors who might participate in
   studies of biological markers of health and to document barriers and
   facilitators to acceptance of biomarkers. Six focus groups (3 of
   Spanish-speaking Latinos and 3 of African Americans) were conducted in
   three community senior service organizations (two senior centers and one
   church). Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted to support and
   augment focus group data. Seventy-two community-dwelling minority older
   adults aged 62 years and older and 10 community stakeholders
   participated. A community-based partnered research approach was used and
   two community partners participated in the analysis and interpretation
   of results. Standard qualitative content-analysis methods were used to
   identify and organize themes in domains. Focus group participants were
   49% Latino and 51% African American. Results included barriers: 1)
   mistrust, 2) fear of specimen collection/storage, 3) perceived harms, 4)
   competing demands, and 5) costs. Older Latinos cited issues of language
   as barriers to awareness and acceptance of biomarkers. African Americans
   had concerns over perceived harms of biomarkers. Facilitators to
   acceptance of biomarkers were community engagement through church and
   community leaders. Older Latino and African Americans identified many
   barriers and facilitators to the collection and storage of biomarkers.
   Participants identified community-partnered recommendations to overcome
   barriers to the acceptance, collection, and storage of biomarkers.

   sustainable, despite attempts to adhere to PR principles and
   demonstrable success in research outcomes. The influence of community
   and academic parent organizations on the PR process and outcomes is
   presented in the context of the Donabedian Model. We dissected the
   structural elements contributed by parent organizations to forming the
   structure of the PR partnership (memorandum of understanding, policy
   environment, human resources and effort, community and academic
   resources, expertise and experience, and funding) and explored the
   influence of potential and actual conflicts on the PR partnership's
   sustainability. The effect of potential and actual conflict on the PR
   process and quality of PR outcomes is discussed. Based on this, we
   conclude by proposing seven core standards for the establishment and
   development of emerging community-academic PR partnerships.

AB Objectives. We assessed the association between the health of people in
   same-sex relationships and the degree and nature of the legal
   recognition of same-sex relationships offered in the states in which
   they resided.
   Methods. We conducted secondary data analyses on the 2010 to 2013
   Current Population Survey and publicly available data from Freedom to
   Marry, Inc. We estimated ordered logistic regression models in a 4-level
   framework to assess the impact of states' legal stances toward
   same-sexmarriage on self-assessed health.
   Results. Our findings indicated, relative to states with antigay
   constitutional amendments, that same-sex couples living in states with
   legally sanctioned marriage reported higher levels of self-assessed
   health.
   Conclusions. Our findings suggested that full legal recognition of
   same-sex relationships through marriage might be an important legal and
   policy strategy for improving the health of same-sex couples.

AB Objectives. We examined disparities in health insurance coverage for
   racial/ethnic minorities in same-sex relationships.
   Methods. We used data from the 2009 to 2011 American Community Survey on
   nonelderly adults (aged 25-64 years) in same-sex (n = 32 744), married
   opposite-sex (n = 2 866 636), and unmarried opposite-sex (n = 268 298)
   relationships. We used multinomial logistic regression models to compare
   differences in the primary source of health insurance while controlling
   for key demographic and socioeconomic factors.
   Results. Adults of all races/ethnicities in same-sex relationships were
   less likely than were White adults in married opposite-sex relationships
   to report having employer-sponsored health insurance. Hispanic men,
   Black women, and American Indian/Alaska Native women in same-sex
   relationships were much less likely to have employer-sponsored health
   insurance than were their White counterparts in married opposite-sex
   relationships and their White counterparts in same-sex relationships.
   Conclusions. Differences in coverage by relationship type and
   race/ethnicity may worsen over time as states follow different paths to
   implementing health care reform and same-sex marriage.

AB Objectives. We assessed the existence of procedures and policies for
   identifying lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT)-competent
   physicians at US academic faculty practices, and sought to identify
   physician training programs that enhance LGBT competency.
   Methods. We invited all 138 Liaison Committee on Medical
   Education-accredited US academic faculty practices to participate in a
   survey in 2012. We systematically assessed their procedures and policies
   to identify LGBT-competent physicians and their LGBT-competency
   training. We also assessed geographic region, funding source, and an
   LGBT health center in the same state. We performed univariate,
   bivariate, and multivariate logistic regression analyses.
   Results. The response rate was 50%. Few participants had existing
   procedures (9%) or policies (4%) to identify LGBT-competent physicians.
   Procedures included online directories with self-identified
   LGBT-competent physicians available to the public. Sixteen percent of
   participants reported having comprehensive LGBT-competency training, and
   52% reported having no training. Of note, 80% of participants indicated
   interest to do more to address these issues.
   Conclusions. There exist both need and interest for US academic faculty
   practices to develop procedures, policies, and programs that improve
   access to LGBT-competent physicians and to train physicians to become
   LGBT-competent.

AB Objectives. We examined associations between longitudinal neighborhood
   poverty trajectories and preterm birth (PTB).
   Methods. Using data from the Neighborhood Change Database (1970-2000)
   and the American Community Survey (2005-2009), we categorized
   longitudinal trajectories of poverty for California neighborhoods (i.e.,
   census tracts). Birth data included 23 291 singleton California births
   from the Maternal and Infant Health Assessment (2003-2009). We estimated
   associations (adjusted for individual-level covariates) between PTB and
   longitudinal poverty trajectories and compared these to associations
   using traditional, cross-sectional measures of poverty.
   Results. Compared to neighborhoods with long-term low poverty, those
   with long-termhigh poverty and those that experienced increasing poverty
   early in the study period had 41% and 37% increased odds of PTB (95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.18, 1.69 and 1.09, 1.72, respectively).
   High (compared with low) cross-sectional neighborhood poverty was not
   associated with PTB (odds ratio = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.91, 1.28).
   Conclusions. Neighborhood poverty histories may contribute to an
   understanding of perinatal health and should be considered in future
   research.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the effectiveness of offering adjunctive
   financial incentives for abstinence (contingency management [CM]) within
   a safety net hospital smoking cessation program.
   Methods. We randomized participants (n = 146) from a Dallas County,
   Texas, Tobacco Cessation Clinic from 2011 to 2013 to usual care (UC;
   cessation program; n = 71) or CM (UC + 4 weeks of financial incentives;
   n = 75), and followed from 1 week before the quit date through 4 weeks
   after the quit date. A subset (n = 128) was asked to attend a visit 12
   weeks after the scheduled quit date.
   Results. Participants were primarily Black (62.3%) or White (28.1%) and
   female (57.5%). Most participants were uninsured (52.1%) and had an
   annual household income of less than $12 000 (55.5%). Abstinence rates
   were significantly higher for those assigned to CM than UC at all visits
   following the quit date (all Ps<.05). Point prevalence abstinence rates
   in the CM and UC groups were 49.3% versus 25.4% at 4 weeks after the
   quit date and 32.8% versus 14.1% at 12 weeks after the quit date. CM
   participants earned an average of $63.40 ($150 possible) for abstinence
   during the first 4 weeks after the scheduled quit date.
   Conclusions. Offering small financial incentives for abstinence might be
   an effective means to improve abstinence rates among socioeconomically
   disadvantaged individuals participating in smoking cessation treatment.

AB Objectives. We identified content-specific patterns of network diffusion
   underlying smoking cessation in the context of online platforms, with
   the aim of generating targeted intervention strategies.
   Methods. QuitNet is an online social network for smoking cessation. We
   analyzed 16 492 de-identified peer-to-peer messages from 1423 members,
   posted between March 1 and April 30, 2007. Our mixed-methods approach
   comprised qualitative coding, automated text analysis, and affiliation
   network analysis to identify, visualize, and analyze content-specific
   communication patterns underlying smoking behavior.
   Results. Themes we identified in QuitNet messages included relapse,
   QuitNet-specific traditions, and cravings. QuitNet members who were
   exposed to other abstinent members by exchanging content related to
   interpersonal themes (e.g., social support, traditions, progress) tended
   to abstain. Themes found in other types of content did not show
   significant correlation with abstinence.
   Conclusions. Modeling health-related affiliation networks through
   content-driven methods can enable the identification of specific content
   related to higher abstinence rates, which facilitates targeted health
   promotion.

AB OBJECTIVE To determine the extent, severity, and sex differences of
   psychosocial deficits in men and women with urologic chronic pelvic pain
   syndromes (UCPPS), which in the past have been considered separate
   bladder (interstitial cystitis-painful bladder syndrome) and prostate
   (chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome) disorders.
   Evaluations of men and women separately suggest UCPPS is associated with
   increased anxiety and depression. However, studies directly testing
   deficits in broader psychosocial domains such as cognitive processes,
   intimate relationships, and trauma history, or tests of sex differences
   in the pattern of difficulties associated with UCPPS have not been
   performed.
   METHODS A total of 233 female and 191 male UCPPS patients and 235 female
   and 182 male healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from 6 academic
   medical centers in the United States and evaluated with a comprehensive
   battery of symptom, psychosocial, and illness impact measures. Primary
   comparisons of interest were between UCPPS patients and HCs and between
   men and women with UCPPS.
   RESULTS In addition to greater negative effect, male and female UCPPS
   patients show higher levels of current and lifetime stress, poorer
   illness coping, increased self-report of cognitive deficits, and more
   widespread pain symptoms compared with sex- and education-matched HCs.
   Similar problems were found in male and female UCPPS patients although
   female UCPPS patients showed increased self-report of childhood
   adversity and more widespread symptoms of pain and discomfort.
   CONCLUSION Given the significance of psychosocial variables in prognosis
   and treatment of chronic pain conditions, the results add substantially
   to our understanding of the breath of difficulties associated with UCPPS
   and point to important areas for clinical assessment. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Despite increased attention to global mental health, psychiatric genetic
   research has been dominated by studies in high-income countries,
   especially with populations of European descent. The objective of this
   study was to assess single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the FKBP5
   gene in a population living in South Asia. Among adults in Nepal,
   depression was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
   post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the PTSD Checklist-Civilian
   Version (PCL-C), and childhood maltreatment with the Childhood Trauma
   Questionnaire (CTQ). FKBP5 SNPs were genotyped for 682 participants.
   Cortisol awakening response (CAR) was assessed in a sub-sample of 118
   participants over 3 days. The FKBP5 tag-SNP rs9296158 showed a main
   effect on depressive symptoms (p = 0.03). Interaction of rs9296158 and
   childhood maltreatment predicted adult depressive symptoms (p = 0.02)
   but not PTSD. Childhood maltreatment associated with endocrine response
   in individuals homozygous for the A allele, demonstrated by a negative
   CAR and overall hypocortisolaemia in the rs9296158 AA genotype and
   childhood maltreatment group (p < 0.001). This study replicated findings
   related to FKBP5 and depression but not PTSD. Gene environment studies
   should take differences in prevalence and cultural significance of
   phenotypes and exposures into account when interpreting cross-cultural
   findings.

   diabetes are now recognized as factors that increase a woman's risk for
   future CVD. CVD risk factor burden is disproportionately higher in those
   of low socioeconomic status and in ethnic/racial minority women. Since
   younger women often use their obstetrician/gynecologist as their primary
   health provider, this is an opportune time to diagnose and treat CVD
   risk factors early. Embedding preventive care providers such as nurse
   practitioners or physician assistants within OB/GYN practices can be
   considered, with referral to family medicine or internist for ongoing
   risk assessment and management. The American Heart Association
   (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) stroke prevention guidelines
   tailored to women recommend that women with a history of pre-eclampsia
   can be evaluated for hypertension and other CVD risk factors within 6
   months to 1-year post-partum. Given the burden and impact of CVD on
   women in our society, the entire medical community must work to
   establish feasible practice and referral patterns for assessment and
   treatment of CVD risk factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB "Superstorm Sandy" brought unprecedented storm surge to New York City
   neighborhoods and like previous severe weather events exacerbated
   underlying inequalities in part because socially marginalized
   populations were concentrated in environmentally exposed areas. This
   study makes three primary contributions to the literature on
   vulnerability. First, results show how the intersection of social
   factors (i.e., race, poverty, and age) relates to exposure to flooding.
   Second, disruption to the city's transit infrastructure, which was most
   detrimental for Asians and Latinos, extended the consequences of the
   storm well beyond flooded areas. And third, data from New York City's
   311 system show there was variation in distress across neighborhoods of
   different racial makeup and that flooded neighborhoods remained
   distressed months after the storm. Together, these findings show that
   economic and racial factors overlap with flood risk to create
   communities with both social and environmental vulnerabilities.

   County, southern Kenya. Data on weight, height, skinfolds, and
   circumferences were collected from 534 individuals in the year 2000. The
   data were used to describe mean differences in human nutrition between
   ages, sexes, and within and among three Group Ranches. Nutritional data
   and diet recall data were compared with past studies of Maasai nutrition
   from 1930 to 2000. Results indicate that nutritional status is poor and
   has remained so despite numerous changes to the social-ecological system
   including livelihood diversification, sedentarization, human population
   growth and decreased access to vegetation heterogeneity. Imbirikani
   Group Ranch had better access to infrastructure and markets and some
   measures of nutritional status were better than for individuals in other
   group ranches. However, nutritional status remains poor despite
   transitioning to greater market integration.

AB Daily rhythmicity in the locomotor activity of laboratory animals has
   been studied in great detail for many decades, but the daily pattern of
   locomotor activity has not received as much attention in humans. We
   collected waist-worn accelerometer data from more than 2000 individuals
   from five countries differing in socioeconomic development and conducted
   a detailed analysis of human locomotor activity. Body mass index (BMI)
   was computed from height and weight. Individual activity records lasting
   7 days were subjected to cosinor analysis to determine the parameters of
   the daily activity rhythm: mesor (mean level), amplitude (half the range
   of excursion), acrophase (time of the peak) and robustness (rhythm
   strength). The activity records of all individual participants exhibited
   statistically significant 24-h rhythmicity, with activity increasing
   noticeably a few hours after sunrise and dropping off around the time of
   sunset, with a peak at 1: 42pm on average. The acrophase of the daily
   rhythm was comparable in men and women in each country but varied by as
   much as 3 h from country to country. Quantification of the socioeconomic
   stages of the five countries yielded suggestive evidence that more
   developed countries have more obese residents, who are less active, and
   who are active later in the day than residents from less developed
   countries. These results provide a detailed characterization of the
   daily activity pattern of individual human beings and reveal
   similarities and differences among people from five countries differing
   in socioeconomic development.

AB In this study, we examined data quality among Amazon Mechanical Turk
   (MTurk) workers based in India, and the effect of monetary compensation
   on their data quality. Recent studies have shown that work quality is
   independent of compensation rates, and that compensation primarily
   affects the quantity but not the quality of work. However, the results
   of these studies were generally based on compensation rates below the
   minimum wage, and far below a level that was likely to play a practical
   role in the lives of workers. In this study, compensation rates were set
   around the minimum wage in India. To examine data quality, we developed
   the squared discrepancy procedure, which is a task-based quality
   assurance approach for survey tasks whose goal is to identify
   inattentive participants. We showed that data quality is directly
   affected by compensation rates for India-based participants. We also
   found that data were of a lesser quality among India-based than among US
   participants, even when optimal payment strategies were utilized. We
   additionally showed that the motivation of MTurk users has shifted, and
   that monetary compensation is now reported to be the primary reason for
   working on MTurk, among both US-and India-based workers. Overall, MTurk
   is a constantly evolving marketplace where multiple factors can
   contribute to data quality. High-quality survey data can be acquired on
   MTurk among India-based participants when an appropriate pay rate is
   provided and task-specific quality assurance procedures are utilized.

AB A 2-year field study of a free-ranging population of Chukar (Alectoris
   chukar cypriotes), occupying Mediterranean habitat in Israel's Lower
   Galilee, yielded unique insights on (1) the array and context of
   specific behaviors of wild birds, (2) the complex dynamics of their
   social processes, and (3) the interaction of behavioral and population
   dynamics. Systematic observations of individually marked wild birds
   clarified the function of several prominent displays (e.g., waltzing as
   a male courtship display) and vocalizations (e.g., the chuk-ar call as
   an individual announcement that varied widely in form and function).
   Behavioral relationships among birds were complex, and Chukars
   demonstrated individual differences in demeanor and status. Strong
   social bonds among adult males and brood mates were significant cohesive
   forces, and adult males exhibited strong site affinities from year to
   year. Chukars spent autumn and winter in coveys of 10-20 birds having
   heterogeneous gender and age compositions, and occupied separate but
   overlapping ranges of 4-8 ha. Adult males displayed and threatened
   conspecifics more than did females during most seasons, but broody hens
   were aggressive towards other birds. Overt social interactions were most
   intense while coveys disbanded in early spring, during breeding, and in
   post-breeding covey formation. Paired males closely accompanied females
   within restricted nesting territories, but most left their mates during
   incubation. Large late-summer aggregations of Chukars occurred at open
   water and in fallow fields where intense social interactions preceded
   the establishment of permanent covey ranges. The study population
   underwent an inverse, density-dependent fluctuation that was mediated by
   behavioral processes. A low overwintering population in Year 1 exhibited
   little social strife and no population change preceded an orderly and
   productive breeding season. The subsequent dense population in Year 2
   exhibited heightened social strife in winter, a large decline in numbers
   with the onset of pairing, considerable disturbance of nesting pairs,
   and lowered reproductive success.

AB Racial and ethnic diversity in natural resource careers does not reflect
   U.S. population trends. To explore potential drivers of
   underrepresentation in this field, we used a life-cycle analysis to
   review 55 scholarly articles to identify barriers and supports
   influencing career choices (i.e., personal, contextual, self-efficacy,
   outcome expectations) across 4 age groups. The number of cited barriers
   differed significantly among age groups. Personal influences included
   race or ethnicity, gender, age, and perceptions or predispositions
   toward nature. The latter was the most cited barrier for youth.
   Contextual influences included social, familial, structural, and
   experiential, and varied significantly between age groups. Exposure to
   nature was the most cited contextual barrier for all groups: 59% for
   youth, 40% for high school, 43% for college, and 50% for career.
   Self-efficacy was emphasized in studies referencing youth, high school,
   and college age groups, and outcome expectations were only discussed in
   studies of the career group. After the literature analysis, we reviewed
   web sites, reports, and conducted personal interviews to explore how 21
   federal natural-resource agency diversity programs address variables
   influencing minority recruitment. Participating agencies reported
   challenges recruiting individuals, ensuring funding, and creating
   welcoming environments for minority participants, many of whom have
   never experienced remote natural environments or nontraditional careers.
   Our analysis revealed the need for a modified Framework for Career
   Influences. The proposed framework combines existing theories on social
   career choice and minority involvement in natural resource activities,
   but identifies personal and contextual influences that are important for
   minority students, as endogenous variables that influence and are
   influenced by self-efficacy and outcome expectations. (C) 2015 The

AB While secrecy enables policy makers to escape public scrutiny, leaks of
   classified information reveal the social construction of reality by the
   state. I develop a theory that explains how leaks shape the discursive
   frames states create to communicate the causes of social problems to the
   public and corresponding solutions to redress them. Synthesizing
   cultural sociology, symbolic interactionism, and ethnomethodology, I
   argue that leaks enable non-state actors to amplify contradictions
   between the public and secret behavior of the state. States respond by
   ad hoc-ing new frames that normalize their secret transgressions as
   logical extensions of other policy agendas. While these syncretic
   responses resolve contradictions exposed by leaks, they gradually detach
   discursive frames from reality and therefore increase states' need for
   secrecyas well as the probability of future leaksin turn. I illustrate
   this downward spiral of deception and disclosure via a case study of the
   British government's discourse about terrorism between 2000 and 2008.

AB Continuing historical narratives of the early twentieth century nexus of
   conservationism, eugenics, and nativism (exemplified by Madison Grant),
   this paper traces the history of the contemporary US anti-immigration
   movement's roots in environmentalism and global population control
   activism, through an exploration of the thoughts and activities of the
   activist, John Tanton, who has been called "the most influential unknown
   man in America.'' We explore the "neo-Malthusian'' ideas that sparked a
   seminal moment for population control advocacy in the late 1960s and
   early 1970s, leading to the creation of Zero Population Growth (ZPG).
   After rising to the presidency of ZPG, Tanton, and ZPG spun off the
   Federation for American Immigration Reform. After leaving ZPG's
   leadership, Tanton created additional anti-immigration advocacy groups
   and built up connections with existing organizations such as the Pioneer
   Fund. We trace Tanton's increasingly radical conservative network of
   anti-immigration advocates, conservationists, and population control
   activists to the present day. Tanton's archived papers illustrate, among
   other things, his interactions with collaborators such as ecologist
   Garrett Hardin (author of the famous "Tragedy of the Commons'') and his
   documented interest in reviving eugenics. We contend that this history
   of Tanton's network provides key insights into understanding how there
   came to be an overlap between the ideologies and activist communities of
   immigration restrictionism, population control, conservationism and
   eugenics.

AB Background: The American Cancer Society (ACS), Centers for Disease
   Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and North
   American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate
   annually to produce updated, national cancer statistics. This Annual
   Report includes a focus on breast cancer incidence by subtype using new,
   national-level data.
   Methods: Population-based cancer trends and breast cancer incidence by
   molecular subtype were calculated. Breast cancer subtypes were
   classified using tumor biomarkers for hormone receptor (HR) and human
   growth factor-neu receptor (HER2) expression.
   Results: Overall cancer incidence decreased for men by 1.8% annually
   from 2007 to 2011. Rates for women were stable from 1998 to 2011. Within
   these trends there was racial/ethnic variation, and some sites have
   increasing rates. Among children, incidence rates continued to increase
   by 0.8% per year over the past decade while, like adults, mortality
   declined. Overall mortality has been declining for both men and women
   since the early 1990's and for children since the 1970's.
   HR+/HER2-breast cancers, the subtype with the best prognosis, were the
   most common for all races/ethnicities with highest rates among
   non-Hispanic white women, local stage cases, and low poverty areas
   (92.7, 63.51, and 98.69 per 100 000 non-Hispanic white women,
   respectively). HR+/HER2-breast cancer incidence rates were strongly,
   positively correlated with mammography use, particularly for
   non-Hispanic white women (Pearson 0.57, two-sided P <.001).
   Triple-negative breast cancers, the subtype with the worst prognosis,
   were highest among non-Hispanic black women (27.2 per 100 000
   non-Hispanic black women), which is reflected in high rates in
   southeastern states.
   Conclusions: Progress continues in reducing the burden of cancer in the
   United States. There are unique racial/ethnic-specific incidence
   patterns for breast cancer subtypes; likely because of both biologic and
   social risk factors, including variation in mammography use. Breast
   cancer subtype analysis confirms the capacity of cancer registries to
   adjust national collection standards to produce clinically relevant data
   based on evolving medical knowledge.

AB Background: Racial disparities in cancer survival outcomes have been
   primarily attributed to underlying biologic mechanisms and the quality
   of cancer care received. Because prior literature shows little
   difference exists in the socioeconomic status of non-Hispanic whites and
   Asian Americans, any difference in cancer survival is less likely to be
   attributable to inequalities of care. We sought to examine differences
   in cancer-specific survival between whites and Asian Americans.
   Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was
   used to identify patients with lung (n = 130 852 [16.9%]), breast (n =
   313 977 [40.4%]), prostate (n = 166 529 [21.4%]), or colorectal (n = 165
   140 [21.3%]) cancer (the three leading causes of cancer-related
   mortality within each sex) diagnosed between 1991 and 2007. Fine and
   Gray's competing risks regression compared the cancer-specific mortality
   (CSM) of eight Asian American groups (Chinese, Filipino,
   Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Japanese, Korean, other Asian, South Asian
   [Indian/Pakistani], and Vietnamese) to non-Hispanic white patients. All
   P values were two-sided.
   Results: In competing risks regression, the receipt of definitive
   treatment was an independent predictor of CSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37,
   95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.40; HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.53 to
   0.58; HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.62; and HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.25 to
   0.29) for prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers respectively,
   all P <.001). In adjusted analyses, most Asian subgroups (except
   Hawaiians and Koreans) had lower CSM relative to white patients, with
   hazard ratios ranging from 0.54 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.78) to 0.88 (95% CI
   = 0.84 to 0.93) for Japanese patients with prostate and Chinese patients
   with lung cancer, respectively.
   Conclusions: Despite adjustment for potential confounders, including the
   receipt of definitive treatment and tumor characteristics, most Asian
   subgroups had better CSM than non-Hispanic white patients. These
   findings suggest that underlying genetic/biological differences, along
   with potential cultural variations, may impact survival in Asian
   American cancer patients.

AB Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis have argued that individual-selection
   accounts of human cooperation flounder in the face of the free-rider
   identification problem. Kim Sterelny has responded to this line of
   argument for group selection, arguing that the free-rider identification
   problem in fact poses no theoretical difficulty for individual-selection
   accounts. In this article, I set out to clarify Bowles and Gintis'
   argument. As I see matters, the real crux of their argument is this:
   solving the free-rider identification problem, even in modestly sized
   social groups, requires that group members are disposed to share social
   information with one another. The difficulty for individual-selection
   accounts, according to Bowles and Gintis, is that these accounts have no
   explanation for why individuals should be disposed to behave in this
   way. Having clarified their argument, I then turn to Sterelny's
   criticism, and argue that Sterelny underestimates the challenge being
   raised by Bowles and Gintis. More specifically, I argue that it is
   unclear whether the expected benefits of having a disposition to share
   social information would have outweighed the expected costs for an
   individual belonging to a Pleistocene social group. Importantly, this is
   not to say that I am persuaded by Bowles and Gintis' argument; on the
   contrary, what I claim is that more theoretical (and in particular)
   empirical work is necessary before the issues under discussion can be
   settled. I formulate some specific questions which I think future
   research in this area should aim to address.

AB Both positive affect and positive close relationships contribute
   significantly to overall well-being. This review examines the literature
   assessing associations between positive affect and positive indices
   within close relationships across the life span. Specifically, the
   reviewed research includes parent-child relationships, friendships, and
   romantic relationships in relation to a variety of positive emotions and
   happiness more generally. This review also highlights several processes
   that may serve as partial mechanisms linking positive close
   relationships and positive affect including the interpersonal regulation
   and coregulation of positive emotion and the biological processes
   involved in experiences of positive affect and close relationships.
   Throughout the review, evidence of bidirectional, reciprocal
   associations between positive affect and positive close relationships is
   emphasized. Based on the current state of the literature, future
   directions for research in this area are considered. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB This article introduces civic purpose as a construct for learning about
   civic development in adolescence. Civic purpose, defined as a sustained
   intention to contribute to the world beyond the self through civic or
   political action, integrates the components of motivation, civic
   activity, and future-oriented civic intention. We present results from a
   mixed methods longitudinal study that used the civic purpose framework
   in which 1,578 high school seniors took a survey, 50 participated in an
   interview, and 9 additional adolescent "civic exemplars" participated in
   both the survey and the interview. Two years later, 480 participants
   took the survey again, and 34 participated in a second interview. A
   small percentage of the study subjects exhibited full civic purpose
   across three different types of civic activity (political, community
   service, expressive), while a larger percentage demonstrated precursory
   forms of civic purpose, with evidence of some but not all components of
   civic purpose. Key contributors to the development of civic purpose
   were: identity salience, beliefs and values, and invitation from one or
   more adults. (C) 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB Cognition, negative symptoms, and depression are potential predictors of
   disability in schizophrenia. We present analyses of pooled data from
   four separate studies (all n > 169; total n = 821) that assessed
   differential aspects of disability and their potential determinants. We
   hypothesized that negative symptoms would predict social outcomes, but
   not vocational functioning or everyday activities and that cognition and
   functional capacity would predict vocational functioning and everyday
   activities but not social outcomes. The samples were rated by clinician
   informants for their everyday functioning in domains of social and
   vocational outcomes, and everyday activities, examined with assessments
   of cognition and functional capacity, rated clinically with the Positive
   and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and self-reporting depression. We
   computed a model that tested the hypotheses described above and compared
   it to a model that predicted that negative symptoms, depression,
   cognition, and functional capacity had equivalent influences on all
   aspects of everyday functioning. The former, specific relationship model
   fit the data adequately and we subsequently confirmed a similar fit
   within all four samples. Analyses of the relative goodness of fit
   suggested that this specific model fit the data better than the more
   general, equivalent influence predictor model. We suggest that
   treatments aimed at cognition may not affect social functioning as much
   as other aspects of disability, a finding consistent with earlier
   research on the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, while
   negative symptoms predicted social functioning. These relationships are
   central features of schizophrenia and treatment efforts should be aimed
   accordingly. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   have much to offer, words and numbers alone may miss important

   research note provides an overview of work on the most commonly used

   elicitation (PE). We frame our essay around four questions. What is
   visual sociology? What is photo elicitation? How has PE been used in the

   first week after Hurricane Katrina to reexamine race and representation
   during the disaster. Drawing together insights from interdisciplinary
   studies of cognition and sociological theories of race and racism, we
   examine how different combinations of the race of reporters and news
   sources relate to the priming of implicit racism. We find racial cues
   that are consistent with stereotypes and myths about African
   Americanseven in broadcasts featuring black reportersbut which appear
   only in the context of color-blind verbal narration. We conclude by
   drawing attention to the unexpected and seemingly unintended

AB Sociologists have long been interested in collective representations of
   the past, as well as the processes through which individuals, groups, or
   events have been excluded from those representations. Despite this rich
   body of literature, few studies have examined the processes through
   which long-silenced countermemory becomes integrated within official
   public memory. This study examines two instances of silence breaking in
   Philadelphia, Mississippithe town notorious for the silence, denial, and
   collective obstruction of justice surrounding the 1964 Mississippi
   Burning murders. By reconstructing and comparing the event structure of
   the twenty-fifth and fortieth anniversary commemorationsboth interracial
   community-wide events unique for having punctuated Philadelphia's
   prevailing silence on the murdersthis article finds that commemorability
   and mnemonic capacity are necessary but insufficient factors for silence
   breaking commemorations to emerge. This study identifies two additional
   criteria necessary for commemorations that publicly acknowledged
   long-silenced pasts: pressure from external forces, and the convergence
   of interests between those previously opposed to and those in favor of
   acknowledgment.

AB INTRODUCTION
   Despite available, effective therapies, racial and ethnic disparities in
   care and outcomes of hypertension persist. Several interventions have
   been tested to reduce disparities; however, their translation into
   practice and policy is hampered by knowledge gaps and limited
   collaboration among stakeholders.
   METHODS
   We characterized factors influencing disparities in blood pressure (BP)
   control by levels of an ecological model. We then conducted a literature
   search using PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL databases to identify
   interventions targeted toward reducing disparities in BP control,
   categorized them by the levels of the model at which they were primarily
   targeted, and summarized the evidence regarding their effectiveness.
   RESULTS
   We identified 39 interventions and several state and national policy
   initiatives targeted toward reducing racial and ethnic disparities in BP
   control, 5 of which are ongoing. Most had patient populations that were
   majority African-American. Of completed interventions, 27 demonstrated
   some improvement in BP control or related process measures, and 7 did
   not; of the 6 studies examining disparities, 3 reduced, 2 increased, and
   1 had no effect on disparities.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Several effective interventions exist to improve BP in racial and ethnic
   minorities; however, evidence that they reduce disparities is limited,
   and many groups are understudied. To strengthen the evidence and
   translate it into practice and policy, we recommend rigorous evaluation
   of pragmatic, sustainable, multilevel interventions; institutional
   support for training implementation researchers and creating broad
   partnerships among payers, patients, providers, researchers,
   policymakers, and community-based organizations; and balance and
   alignment in the priorities and incentives of each stakeholder group.

AB OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate differences in
   sociodemographic, medical, and obstetric risk factors for primary
   cesarean delivery between black and white women.
   STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 25,251
   black and white women delivering a live, singleton infant with vertex
   presentation at a large, regional hospital between 2004 and 2010.
   Demographic and clinical data were derived from electronic hospital
   records. Differences in risk factors for primary cesarean delivery were
   analyzed using a modified Poisson regression approach stratified by race
   and parity.
   RESULTS: Black and white women had a primary cesarean delivery rate of
   24.7% and 22.2%, respectively (P < .001). Black women had an increased
   risk of cesarean delivery after adjusting for sociodemographic and
   clinical risk factors (adjusted relative risk [RR], 1.23; 95% confidence
   interval [CI], 1.17-1.29). Among nulliparas, labor induction had a
   greater effect on cesarean delivery for black women (adjusted RR, 1.32;
   95% CI, 1.20-1.44) than for white women (adjusted RR, 1.13; 95% CI,
   1.07-1.20). Among multiparas, labor induction reduced the risk of
   cesarean delivery for white women (adjusted RR, 0.63; 95% CI,
   0.55-0.72), whereas no association was observed for black women
   (adjusted RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.92-1.28). Advanced maternal age was a
   stronger risk factor for black women (adjusted RR, 1.72; 95% CI,
   1.43-2.08) than for white women (adjusted RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.11-1.52)
   among multiparas only. Among nulliparas, delivery at 37-38 weeks'
   gestation reduced the risk of cesarean delivery for black women
   (adjusted RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73-0.92), whereas no association was
   observed for white women (adjusted RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90-1.04).
   CONCLUSION: Labor induction, among nulliparous women, and advanced
   maternal age, among multiparous women, are stronger risk factors for
   primary cesarean delivery for black women than for white women.

AB Objective: To examine female and male sterilization patterns in the
   United States based on marital status, and to determine if
   socio-demographic characteristics explain these patterns.
   Design: Survival analysis of cross-sectional data from the female and
   male samples from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family Growth.
   Setting: Not applicable.
   Patient(s): The survey is designed to be representative of the US
   civilian noninstitutionalized population, ages 15-44 years.
   Intervention( s): None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Vasectomy and tubal sterilization.
   Result(s): In the United States, vasectomy is the near-exclusive domain
   of married men. Never-married and ever-married single men, and
   never-married cohabiting men, had a low relative risk (RR) of vasectomy
   (RR = 0.1, 0.3, and 0.0, respectively), compared with men in first
   marriages. Tubal sterilization was not limited to currently married, or
   even to ever-married women, although it was less common among
   never-married single women (RR = 0.2) and more common among women in
   higher-order marriages ( RR = 1.8), compared with women in first
   marriages. In contrast to vasectomy, differential use of tubal
   sterilization by marital status was driven in large part by differences
   in parity.
   Conclusion(s): This study shows that being unmarried at the time of
   sterilization-an important risk factor for poststerilization regret-was
   much more common among women than men. In addition to contributing to
   the predominance of female, vs. male, sterilization, this pattern
   highlights the importance of educating women on the permanency of
   sterilization, and the opportunity to increase reliance on long-acting
   reversible contraceptive methods. (C) 2015 by American Society for

   sociodemographic predictors of maternal education and race, binary
   logistic regressions were utilized to examine differences in autism
   screening, diagnostic evaluation participation rates and outcomes, and
   reasons for non-participation. Families of lower maternal education and
   racial minorities exhibited inflated initial screen positive rates and
   lower participation at Follow-Up, although not at the evaluation.
   Economic challenges, such as invalid phone numbers, were identified as
   barriers to reaching these families. Families of higher education and
   White race were more likely to decline participation in evaluation.
   Results suggest the need for increased public education about childhood
   development to enhance awareness, reduce stigma, and streamline

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Extremely preterm infants and infants born to
   adolescent mothers are at risk for adverse developmental. The objectives
   were to evaluate development and behavior outcomes of extremely low
   birth weight (ELBW) infants born to adolescent mothers <20 compared with
   adult mothers >= 20 years and to identify socioeconomic risk factors
   that affect outcomes.
   METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of 211 infants >27 weeks of
   adolescent mothers and 1723 infants of adult mothers at Neonatal
   Research Network centers from 2008 to 2011. Groups were compared and
   regression models were run to predict 18- to 22-month adverse outcomes.
   Primary outcomes were Bayley-III scores, neurodevelopmental impairment,
   and Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment problem scores
   (BITSEA/P) >= 75th percentile.
   RESULTS: Adolescent mothers were more often single, Hispanic, less
   educated, and had public insurance. By 18 to 22 months, their children
   had significantly increased rates of having lived >= 3 places (21% vs
   9%), state supervision (7% vs 3%), rehospitalization (56% vs 46%), and
   BITSEA/P >= 75th percentile (50% vs 32%) and nonsignificant Bayley-III
   language scores,85 (56% vs 49%, P=.07). In regression analysis, children
   of adolescent mothers were more likely to have BITSEA/P >= 75th
   percentile (relative risk 1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.08-2.07).
   Living >= 3 places and nonwhite race were predictors of adverse
   behavior. State supervision was an independent predictor of each
   Bayley-III composite,70 and neurodevelopmental impairment.
   CONCLUSIONS: ELBW infants of adolescent mothers experience high social
   and environmental risks that are associated with adverse behavior
   outcomes. These findings inform the need for comprehensive follow-up,
   coordinated care services, and behavior interventions for ELBW infants
   of adolescent mothers.

AB In recent years, calls have been made to address the relative dearth of
   qualitative sociological investigation into the sensory dimensions of
   embodiment, including within physical cultures. This article contributes
   to a small, innovative and developing literature utilizing sociological
   phenomenology to examine sensuous embodiment. Drawing upon data from
   three research projects, here we explore some of the 'sensuousities' of
   'intense embodiment' experiences as a distance-running-woman and a
   boxing-woman, respectively. Our analysis addresses the relatively
   unexplored haptic senses, particularly the 'touch' of heat. Heat has
   been argued to constitute a specific sensory mode, a trans-boundary
   sense. Our findings suggest that 'lived' heat, in our own
   physical-cultural experiences, has highly proprioceptive elements and is
   experienced as both a form of touch and as a distinct perceptual mode,
   dependent upon context. Our analysis coheres around two key themes that
   emerged as salient: (1) warming up, and (2) thermoregulation, which in
   lived experience were encountered as strongly interwoven.

AB Through an examination of a Midwestern professional comedy club, this
   article theorizes stand-up comedy as part of the broader
   affective-cultural assemblage that is nightlife entertainment. Using the
   Deleuzian notion of assemblage, this analysis builds on post-structural
   accounts of the dynamic and transient properties of culture, and the
   relationship between space, culture, and affect. As a specific
   affective-cultural assemblage, stand-up comedy operates as both
   constrainer and enabler of racial and heteronormative order through the
   bringing together of a variety of diverse logics and practices. I argue
   that stand-up comedy should no longer be thought of strictly in
   discursive or symbolic-interactionist terms that over-determine the
   roles of particular agents (i.e. comics). Instead, when described as
   emergent, transient, and fundamentally affective, stand-up comedy and
   other cultural forms can be seen for their openness and multiplicity,
   both contributing to racial and heteronormative order as well as
   upending it.

AB Motivated by theoretical and empirical research in life course
   sociology, we examine relationships between trajectories of work and
   family roles across the life course and four measures of economic
   well-being in later adulthood. Using data from the Wisconsin
   Longitudinal Study (WLS) and multiple trajectory-generating methods, we
   first identify latent trajectories of work and family roles between late
   adolescence and age 65. We then model economic well-being at age 65 as a
   function of these trajectories and contemporaneously measured indicators
   of older adults' work, family, and health statuses. Our central finding
   is that trajectories of work and family experiences across the life
   course have direct effects on later-life economic well-being, as well as
   indirect effects that operate through more proximate measures of work,
   family, and other characteristics. We argue that these findings have
   important implications for how social scientists conceptualize and model
   the relationship between later-life economic outcomes and people's work
   and family experiences across the life course.

AB How has the recent shift toward multidisciplinary research affected
   intellectual cohesion in academia? We answer this question through an
   examination of collaborations and knowledge flows among researchers. We
   examine the relevant case of Stanford University during a period of
   intense investment in multidisciplinary research, using a novel measure
   of knowledge flows in the short-cycled movement of published references
   from one researcher to another. We describe intellectual cohesion and
   its trajectory among 1,007 faculty members between 1997 and 2006, and
   then examine the social-structural antecedents of dyadic knowledge flows
   that help explain macro-level patterns. Results show that university
   collaborations have grown denser and more integrated across faculty
   members and their institutional divisions. However, this integration is
   led by "star" researchers and is accompanied by a greater centralization
   of knowledge flows around these individuals. Results illustrate
   important shifts in the nature of academic research, and contribute to a
   dynamic view of intellectual cohesion.

AB Purpose: To investigate whether the gender gap in obesity prevalence is
   greater among U.S. blacks than whites in a study designed to account for
   racial differences in socioeconomic and environmental conditions.
   Methods: We estimated age-adjusted, race-stratified gender gaps in
   obesity (% female obese % male obese, defined as body mass index >= 30
   kg/m(2)) in the National Health Interview Survey 2003 and the Exploring
   Health Disparities in Integrated Communities Southwest Baltimore 2003
   study (EHDIC-SWB). EHDIC-SWB is a population-based survey of 1381 adults
   living in two urban, low-income, racially integrated census tracts with
   no race difference in income.
   Results: In the National Health Interview Survey, the obesity gender gap
   was larger in blacks than whites as follows: 7.7 percentage points
   (ppts; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.4-11.9) in blacks versus -1.5
   ppts (95% CI: -2.8 to -0.2) in whites. In EHDIC-SWB, the gender gap was
   similarly large for blacks and whites as follows: 15.3 ppts (95% Cl:
   8.6-22.0) in blacks versus 14.0 ppts (95% CI: 7.1-20.9) in whites.
   Conclusions: In a racially integrated, low-income urban community,
   gender gaps in obesity prevalence were similar for blacks and whites.

AB Purpose: Medications can have unintended effects. High medication use
   populations may benefit from increased regimen oversight. Limited
   knowledge exists concerning racial and regional polypharmacy variation.
   We estimated total medication distributions (excluding supplements) of
   American black and white adults and assessed racial and regional
   polypharmacy variation.
   Methods: REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke
   (REGARDS) cohort data (n = 30,239 U.S. blacks and whites aged >= 45
   years) were analyzed. Home pill bottle inspections assessed the last two
   weeks medications. Polypharmacy (>= 8 medications) was determined by
   summing prescription and/or over-the-counter ingredients.
   Population-weighted logistic regression assessed polypharmacy's
   association with census region, race, and sex.
   Results: The mean ingredient number was 4.12 (standard error = 0.039),
   with 15.7% of REGARDS using 8 ingredients or more. In crude comparisons,
   women used more medications than men, and blacks and whites reported
   similar mean ingredients. A cross-sectional, logistic model adjusting
   for demographics, Socioeconomics, and comorbidities showed increased.
   polypharmacy prevalence in whites versus blacks (OR [95% CI]: 0.63,
   [0.55-0.72]), women (1.94 [1.68-2.23]), and Southerners (broadly
   Southeasterners and Texans; 1.48 [1.17-1.87]) versus Northeasterners
   (broadly New England and upper Mid-Atlantic). Possible limitations
   include polypharmacy misclassification and model misspecification.
   Conclusion: Polypharmacy is common. Race and geography are associated
   with polypharmacy variation. Further study of underlying factors
   explaining these differences is warranted. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All

AB Objective Data show that many research subjects have difficulty
   understanding study information using traditional paper consent
   documents. This study, therefore, was designed to evaluate the effect of
   an interactive multimedia program on improving parents' and children's
   understanding of clinical trial concepts and participation.
   Methods Parents (n=148) and children (n=135) were each randomised to
   receive information regarding clinical trials using either a traditional
   paper format (TF) or an interactive iPad program (IP) with inline
   exercises. Participants' understanding of the information was assessed
   using semistructured interviews prior to (pretest) and after (post-test)
   receiving the information. Participants also completed a short survey to
   assess their perceptions of information delivery and satisfaction with
   the process.
   Results Regardless of the mode of information delivery, all participants
   demonstrated improved pretest to post-test understanding. While there
   were no statistical differences in parents' post-test understanding
   between the TF and IP groups, children in the IP group had significantly
   greater post-test understanding compared with children in the TF group
   (11.65 (4.1) vs 8.85 (4.1) (2.8, 1.4, 4.2) 0-18 scale where 18=complete
   understanding). Furthermore, the IP was found to be significantly
   'easier to follow' and 'more effective' in presenting information
   compared with the TF.
   Conclusions Results demonstrated the importance of providing information
   regarding clinical trial concepts to parents and children. Importantly,
   the ability of interactive multimedia to improve understanding of
   clinical trial concepts and satisfaction with information delivery,
   particularly among children, supports this approach as a novel and
   effective vehicle for enhancing the informed consent process.

AB Research suggests stereotyping by clinicians as one contributor to
   racial and gender-based health disparities. It is necessary to
   understand the origins of such biases before interventions can be
   developed to eliminate them. As a first step toward this understanding,
   we tested for the presence of bias in senior medical students.
   The purpose of the study was to determine whether bias based on race,
   gender, or socioeconomic status influenced clinical decision-making
   among medical students.
   We surveyed seniors at 84 medical schools, who were required to choose
   between two clinically equivalent management options for a set of
   cardiac patient vignettes. We examined variations in student
   recommendations based on patient race, gender, and socioeconomic status.
   The study included senior medical students.
   We investigated the percentage of students selecting cardiac procedural
   options for vignette patients, analyzed by patient race, gender, and
   socioeconomic status.
   Among 4,603 returned surveys, we found no evidence in the overall sample
   supporting racial or gender bias in student clinical decision-making.
   Students were slightly more likely to recommend cardiac procedural
   options for black (43.9 %) vs. white (42 %, p = .03) patients; there was
   no difference by patient gender. Patient socioeconomic status was the
   strongest predictor of student recommendations, with patients described
   as having the highest socioeconomic status most likely to receive
   procedural care recommendations (50.3 % vs. 43.2 % for those in the
   lowest socioeconomic status group, p < .001). Analysis by subgroup,
   however, showed significant regional geographic variation in the
   influence of patient race and gender on decision-making. Multilevel
   analysis showed that white female patients were least likely to receive
   procedural recommendations.
   In the sample as a whole, we found no evidence of racial or gender bias
   in student clinical decision-making. However, we did find evidence of
   bias with regard to the influence of patient socioeconomic status,
   geographic variations, and the influence of interactions between patient
   race and gender on student recommendations.

AB Background. Surgical services in low- and middle income countries
   (LMIC's) must be considered within the context of a coordinated strategy
   for building primary care systems. Weak front-line primary care systems
   lead to delayed presentation and poor follow-up of patients with
   surgical illness, increasing the risk of poor outcomes.
   Methods. Here we propose a framework to integrating surgery and primary
   care, organized around basic primary care principles of access,
   longitudinal care, coordination, integration and equity.
   Results. Making surgical care accessible will require frontline provider
   capacity to screen for and recognize common surgical conditions, as well
   as to deliver certain basic surgical services themselves. Making this
   care effective will require strengthening the capacity of
   interdisciplinary teams to provide longitudinal care, involving
   coordinated networks for referral, communication with and mentorship by
   more specialized providers, and postoperative follow-up. Innovative
   approaches to information and communication technology can help to
   overcome the transportation and infrastructure barriers that jeopardize
   both access and effectiveness. Explicit integration of surgical and
   primary care programs at the managerial and administrative levels, as
   well as at the point-of-care, will also be critical. Taking a pro-equity
   approach can ensure that populations with the greatest unmet needs are
   effectively reached.
   Conclusion. Utilizing the pillars of effective primary care as a guiding
   framework to design, implement, and scale surgical programs in LMICs
   offers an opportunity for strengthening and enhancing the quality of
   health systems as a whole.

AB Sexual binaries are persistent in society. Scholars argue that
   bisexuality, marked by sexual fluidity, complicates the reproduction of
   the hetero/homo divide. This article draws on archival data from
   multiple sources on bisexual immigrants from 1967 to 2012 to empirically
   test if sexual fluidity disrupts sexual binaries within the context of
   immigration. My findings show that instead of challenging entrenched
   sexual binaries, sexual fluidity helps in maintaining those boundaries.
   Through the process of legally coupling bisexuality with homosexuality,
   the exclusionary policy that denied admission to immigrants with
   same-sex attraction was extended to bisexuals until its repeal in 1990.
   However when refugee protection was expanded to include sexual
   minorities after 1994, bisexuality and homosexuality were decoupled,
   consequently denying asylum protection to bisexuals. From the standpoint
   of immigration policies, bisexuals are paradoxically kinda' gay but just
   not gay enough.

AB Durkheim posited that social relationships protect individuals against
   suicide; however, substantial research demonstrates that suicide can
   spread through the very ties Durkheim theorized as protective. With this
   study, we use Waves I, III, and IV of the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health to investigate whether young adults' suicide attempts
   and ideations are in part products of exposure to suicidal behaviors via
   their social relationships. We find that young adults who have had
   family members or friends attempt suicide are more likely to report
   suicide ideation or even suicide attempts over both the short and long
   run. This finding is robust to many important controls for risk and
   protective factors for suicide. Our findings have implications for the
   sociology of suicide, not the least of which is that social ties have
   the power to harm in addition to the power to protect.

AB PURPOSE: The long-term prostate cancer-specific survival for patients
   initially managed with active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer
   ranges from 97% to 100%. We characterized factors that are associated
   with aggressive treatment with radical prostatectomy or radiation for
   indolent prostate cancer (defined as screening-detected, low-risk
   disease).
   METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was
   used to extract a cohort of 39,803 men diagnosed with prostate-specific
   antigenedetected, low-risk prostate cancer (clinical category T1c,
   Gleason score <= 6, and prostate-specific antigen <10) from 2004 to
   2010. After socioeconomic profiles were generated from county-linked
   education and income data, multivariable logistic regression was used to
   determine whether there were any factors associated with high rates of
   aggressive treatment.
   RESULTS: The rate of aggressive treatment among all men with indolent
   prostate cancer was 64.3%. Greater rates of aggressive treatment were
   experienced by men with high socioeconomic status, Caucasian men, and
   married men (P < .001 for all cases). The increased adjusted odds for
   receipt of aggressive therapy were 1.25 (95% confidence interval [CI],
   1.17-1.32; P < .001), 1.26 (95% CI, 1.21-1.32; P < .001), and 1.88 (95%
   CI, 1.80-1.97; P < .001) for men with high socioeconomic status,
   Caucasian men, and married men, respectively, compared with men with low
   socioeconomic status, non-Caucasian men, and unmarried men,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS: Although men with high socioeconomic status, Caucasian men,
   and married men often receive the highest quality health care and have
   the best outcomes for many cancers, it seems that they are most at risk
   for the avoidable potential harms of aggressive treatment of indolent
   prostate cancer. Future policy should encourage more stringent
   guidelines for deferred treatment and culturally and
   sociodemo-graphically competent counseling of active surveillance. (C)

AB Introduction: Rates of non-access to needed medical services are
   elevated among uninsured and sociodemographic subpopulations. Clinical
   depression is associated with comorbid medical illness and reduced
   treatment adherence. The purpose of this study was to examine whether
   prior depression predicts missed needed medical care independent of
   health insurance status and socioeconomic and demographic
   characteristics.
   Methods: Data were from a cross-sectional representative sample of adult
   New York City residents, surveyed through the 2009 (n = 9,900) and 2010
   (n = 8,622) annual Community Health Survey. Logistic regression was used
   to evaluate the association of lifetime depression with missed needed
   medical care in the past year, with stratification by health insurance
   status and adjustment for socioeconomic characteristics. Analyses were
   performed in 2014.
   Results: Prior depression was associated with missed needed medical care
   among both insured (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.7, 2.2) and uninsured adults
   (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.4). Missed needed care report was associated
   with uninsured status (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 3.1, 4.0), controlling for
   employment, income, and demographics.
   Conclusions: Prior depression corresponded to greater probability of
   missed needed medical care report in the previous year, independent of
   health insurance status, employment, income, and demographics. (C) 2015

AB Anecdotal evidence suggests that socioeconomic shocks strongly affect
   wildlife populations, but quantitative evidence is sparse. The collapse
   of socialism in Russia in 1991 caused a major socioeconomic shock,
   including a sharp increase in poverty. We analyzed population trends of
   8 large mammals in Russia from 1981 to 2010 (i.e., before and after the
   collapse). We hypothesized that the collapse would first cause
   population declines, primarily due to overexploitation, and then
   population increases due to adaptation of wildlife to new environments
   following the collapse. The long-term Database of the Russian Federal
   Agency of Game Mammal Monitoring, consisting of up to 50,000 transects
   that are monitored annually, provided an exceptional data set for
   investigating these population trends. Three species showed strong
   declines in population growth rates in the decade following the
   collapse, while grey wolf (Canis lupus) increased by more than 150%.
   After 2000 some trends reversed. For example, roe deer (Capreolus spp.)
   abundance in 2010 was the highest of any period in our study. Likely
   reasons for the population declines in the 1990s include poaching and
   the erosion of wildlife protection enforcement. The rapid increase of
   the grey wolf populations is likely due to the cessation of governmental
   population control. In general, the widespread declines in wildlife
   populations after the collapse of the Soviet Union highlight the
   magnitude of the effects that socioeconomic shocks can have on wildlife
   populations and the possible need for special conservation efforts
   during such times. Declinacion Rapida de las Poblaciones de Mamiferos
   Mayores despues del Colapso de la Union Sovietica
   Resumen La evidencia anecdotica sugiere que los shocks socio-economicos
   afectan fuertemente a las poblaciones silvestres, pero la evidencia
   cuantitativa es escasa. El colapso del socialismo en Rusia en 1991 causo
   un gran shock socio-economico, incluido un incremento repentino en la
   pobreza. Analizamos las tendencias poblacionales de ocho mamiferos
   mayores en Rusia a partir de 1981 y hasta 2010 (es decir, antes y
   despues del colapso). Propusimos la hipotesis de que el colapso primero
   causaria declinaciones poblacionales, principalmente por causa de la
   sobreexplotacion, y despues incrementos debido a la adaptacion de la
   vida silvestre a nuevos ambientes. La Base de Datos a largo plazo de la
   Agencia Federal Rusa del Monitoreo de Mamiferos de Caza, que consiste en
   hasta 50, 000 transectos que se monitorean anualmente, proporciono un
   conjunto excepcional de datos para investigar estas tendencias
   poblacionales. Tres especies mostraron fuertes declinaciones en la tasa
   de crecimiento poblacional en la decada despues del colapso, mientras
   que las poblaciones de lobo gris (Canis lupus) incrementaron por mas del
   150%. Despues del ano 2000 algunas tendencias fueron revertidas. Por
   ejemplo, la abundancia del venado de corzo (Capreolus spp.) en 2010 fue
   la mas alta de cualquier periodo de nuestro estudio. Las razones
   probables de la declinacion poblacional en la decada de 1990 incluyen a
   la caza furtiva y a la degradacion de la aplicacion de la proteccion de
   vida silvestre. El incremento subito en la poblacion de lobos grises
   probablemente se debe al cese del control poblacional por parte del
   gobierno. En general, las amplias declinaciones de las poblaciones
   silvestres despues del colapso de la Union Sovietica resaltan la
   magnitud de los efectos que los shocks socio-economicos pueden tener
   sobre las poblaciones silvestres y la posible necesidad de esfuerzos
   especiales de conservacion durante estos tiempos.

AB This article examines the consequences of prison overcrowding litigation
   for U.S. prisons. We use insights derived from the endogeneity of law
   perspective to develop expectations about the likely impact of
   overcrowding litigation on five outcomes: prison admissions, prison
   releases, spending on prison capacity, prison crowding, and
   incarceration rates. Using newly available data on prison overcrowding
   litigation cases joined with panel data on U.S. states from 1971 to
   1996, we offer a novel and comprehensive analysis of the impact that
   overcrowding litigation has had on U.S. prisons. We find that it had no
   impact on admissions or release rates and did not lead to any reduction
   in prison crowding. Litigation did, however, lead to an increase in
   spending on prison capacity and incarceration rates. We discuss the
   implications of these results for endogeneity of law theory, attempts to
   achieve reform through litigation, and the politics of prison
   construction.

   environmental intervention to increase walking in underserved
   communities.
   Three matched communities were randomized to a police-patrolled walking
   plus social marketing, a police-patrolled walking-only, or a no-walking
   intervention. The 24-month intervention addressed safety and access for
   physical activity (PA) and utilized social marketing to enhance
   environmental supports for PA. African-Americans (N = 434; 62 % females;
   aged 51 +/- 16 years) provided accelerometry and psychosocial measures
   at baseline and 12, 18, and 24 months. Walking attendance and trail use
   were obtained over 24 months.
   There were no significant differences across communities over 24 months
   for moderate-to-vigorous PA. Walking attendance in the social marketing
   community showed an increase from 40 to 400 walkers per month at 9
   months and sustained similar to 200 walkers per month through 24 months.
   No change in attendance was observed in the walking-only community.
   Findings support integrating social marketing strategies to increase
   walking in underserved African-Americans (ClinicalTrials.gov
   #NCT01025726).

AB A large body of evidence supports the view that psychopathy is
   associated with anomalous emotional processing, reduced guilt and
   empathy, which are important risk factors for criminal behaviors.
   However, the precise nature and specificity of this atypical emotional
   processing is not well understood, including its relation to moral
   judgment. To further our understanding of the pattern of neural response
   to perceiving and evaluating morally-laden behavior, this study included
   155 criminal male offenders with various level of psychopathy, as
   assessed with the Psychopathy Check List-Revised. Participants were
   scanned while viewing short clips depicting interactions between two
   individuals resulting in either interpersonal harm or interpersonal
   assistance. After viewing each clip, they were asked to identify the
   emotions of the protagonists. Inmates with high levels of psychopathy
   were more accurate than controls in successfully identifying the emotion
   of the recipient of both helpful and harmful actions. Significant
   hemodynamic differences were detected in the posterior superior temporal
   sulcus, amygdala, insula, ventral striatum, and prefrontal cortex when
   individuals with high psychopathy viewed negative versus positive
   scenarios moral scenarios and when they evaluated the emotional
   responses of the protagonists. These findings suggest that
   socioemotional processing abnormalities in psychopathy may be somewhat
   more complicated than merely a general or specific emotional deficit.
   Rather, situation-specific evaluations of the mental states of others,
   in conjunction with sensitivity to the nature of the other (victim vs.
   perpetrator), modulate attention to emotion-related cues. Such atypical
   processing likely impacts moral decision-making and behavior in
   psychopaths. Hum Brain Mapp 36:2015-2026, 2015. (c) 2015 Wiley

AB Background Low socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with
   higher risk of cardiometabolic diseases in developed societies, but
   investigation of SES and cardiometabolic risk in children in less
   economically developed populations is sparse. We aimed to examine
   associations among SES and cardiometabolic risk factors in Colombian
   children.
   Methods We used data from a population-based study of 1282 children aged
   6-10 years from Bucaramanga, Colombia. SES was classified according to
   household wealth, living conditions and access to public utilities.
   Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured at a clinic
   visit. Cardiometabolic risk factors were analysed continuously using
   linear regression and as binary outcomes-according to established
   paediatric cut points-using logistic regression to calculate OR and 95%
   CIs.
   Results Mean age of the children was 8.4 (SD 1.4) and 51.1% of the
   sample were boys. Odds of overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity and
   insulin resistance were greater among higher SES. Compared with the
   lowest SES stratum, children in the highest SES had higher odds of
   overweight/obesity (OR=3.25, 95% CI 1.89 to 5.57), abdominal obesity
   (OR=2.74, 95% CI 1.41 to 5.31) and insulin resistance (OR=2.60, 95% CI
   1.81 to 3.71). In contrast, children in the highest SES had lower odds
   of hypertriglyceridaemia (triglycerides >= 90th centile; OR=0.28, 95% CI
   0.14 to 0.54) and low (<= 10th centile) high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
   cholesterol (OR=0.35, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.78).
   Conclusions In Colombian children, SES is directly associated with
   obesity and insulin resistance, but inversely associated with
   dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia and low HDL cholesterol). Our
   findings highlight the need to analyse cardiometabolic risk factors
   separately in children and to carefully consider a population's level of
   economic development when studying their social determinants of
   cardiometabolic disease.

AB Objectives: The incidence of oral tongue cancer (OTC) in the US is
   increasing in women. To understand this phenomenon, we examined factors
   influencing OTC incidence and survival.
   Materials and methods: We identified women diagnosed with OTC that were
   reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
   program from 1973 to 2010. Incidence and survival rates were compared
   across metropolitan, urban and rural residential settings and several
   other demographic categories by calculating rate ratios (RRs) with the
   corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We examined changes in
   incidence of OTC across racial groups using joinpoint analyses since
   1973, and assessed factors associated with survival. Patients diagnosed
   prior to 1988 were excluded from the survival analysis due to lack of
   data on treatment.
   Results: OTC incidence in white females demonstrated a significant
   upward trend with 0.53 annual percentage change (APC) between 1973 and
   2010. The change seems to be limited to white women under the age of 50
   years and appears to have become pronounced in the 1990s. For African
   Americans (AA) on the other hand, the incidence has decreased. Incidence
   estimates did not differ in metropolitan, small urban and rural setting.
   The 1-, 5- and 10-year relative survival estimates were 86%, 63% and 54%
   for white women, and 76%, 46% and 33% for AA women. On multivariable
   analyses factors significantly associated with better survival included
   lower stage, younger age, married status, and receipt of surgical
   treatment, but not race.
   Conclusion: The racial disparity in OTC survival is evident, but may be
   attributable to the differences in stage at diagnosis as well as access
   to and receipt of care. As the incidence of OTC is increasing in young
   white women, identifying the risk factors in this group may lead to a
   better understanding of OTC causes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB The emergence of market society in Europe prompted a major change in the
   social measurement of individual worth. The formal system of
   aristocratic honor culture was gradually supplanted by a bourgeois
   concept of reputation rooted in the public perception of individual
   merits. During this period, dueling was a practice of dispute resolution
   commonly used in honor groups, and also diffused to bourgeois groups in
   domains such as politics and journalism. This article explores this
   cultural transformation by examining duels in 20 European novels and
   comparing these duels with theoretical and historical work on duels as a
   social practice. The novels present a significantly distorted
   representation of dueling. This distortion demonstrates the limited
   ability of the novel, a bourgeois form, to describe group-oriented
   values such as honor. This is, in turn, sociologically significant: the
   novels point to major differences in the social psychologies
   underpinning honor and reputation, and also anticipate the obsolescence
   of honor culture well before this occurred historically.

AB On the fiftieth anniversary of the International Sociology of Sport
   Association and the International Review for the Sociology of Sport, the
   three guest editors for this special fiftieth anniversary issue of the
   IRSS, current ISSA president, Elizabeth CJ Pike, the immediate past
   president, Steven J Jackson, and current IRSS editor, Lawrence A Wenner,
   introduce the issue's genesis and theme: 50@50: Assessing the trajectory
   and challenges of the sociology of sport'. In considering the trajectory
   of the sociology of sport, the ISSA and the IRSS, they reflect on the
   early development of the field and the founding of an international
   association and journal aimed at understanding sport in the social and
   cultural dynamic; they note early and ongoing challenges concerning the
   academic seating of the field, its legitimacy and impact, and its
   engagement with the public sphere and the sociological imagination'.
   Speaking to the challenges of fashioning a special issue to represent
   the breadth of 50 years of the sociology of sport, the editors outline
   how a 50@50' strategy was implemented to bring perspectives from 50
   notable scholars and to ensure that a diversity of voices was heard, not
   only on a range of themes, theories and methods, but from diverse
   identities and locales. Addressing two overarching challenges - the
   global dominance of English as the lingua franca of scholarly discourse
   and the need to advance interdisciplinarity and engagement with scholars
   beyond the sociology of sport - will be key to broadening dialogue to
   help ensure the future sustainability and progress of the sociology of
   sport.

AB On the 50th anniversary of the ISSA and IRSS, David Andrews, a
   foundational scholar in the cultural and critical study of sport,
   considers his hopes and fears for the development of the sociology of
   sport in the US. Reflecting on the field's trajectory, Andrews notes
   growth, diverse scholarly outlets, seemingly unresolvable tussles
   between structural functionalist and conflict theory approaches,
   increasing sports creep across culture, and the broadening of the
   sociology of sport beyond the sociological in a traditional sense. A key
   challenge for sport sociologists is the tendency to operate in perilous
   isolation in their disciplinary homes; a related challenge comes from
   its common seating in kinesiology as it has emerged as a de facto
   science of physical activity. In looking ahead, Andrews sees the
   sociology of sport in the US at a crossroads where impressive levels of
   research productivity may mask the field's increasing marginalization.
   The present situation calls for a broad stocktaking of the sociology of
   sport as a project and new tactics for internal and cross-disciplinary
   dialogues that will help reimagine and situate the field.

AB On the 50th anniversary of the ISSA and IRSS, a key foundational scholar
   on the intersection of race and sport, Ben Carrington, reflects on the
   field as a whole and the notion of diaspora in understanding race and
   sport. In considering the trajectory of the sociology of sport,
   questions are raised about whether a coherent field has ever existed.
   Noting relative failures in getting mainstream sociology to take sport
   seriously, the challenges ahead are for a field that is necessarily a
   multifaceted entity, and one that ironically has never been more
   impactful while at its weakest institutional moment. Noting the paradox
   between the relative little consideration given to sport in the main
   sociology journals in the US and UK in contrast with the sociology of
   sport having successfully established self-reproducing and
   self-referencing spaces of critical enquiry, a key challenge for the
   field continues to be in its search for a scholarly place; it is less
   than clear whether the banner of the sociology of sport continues to
   resonate in the face of the neo-liberal assaults on critical scholarship
   within higher education. The concept of diaspora, surprisingly ignored
   in the study of sport, will be increasingly important in the future as
   it will enable critical race scholars to problematize the often
   Eurocentric and teleological underpinning of globalization theory in
   relation to sport; considerations of diaspora will fuel more meaningful
   accounts of how sport reconnects geographically dispersed groups and
   changes identities and subjectivities in hostile circumstances.

AB On the 50th anniversary of the ISSA and IRSS, one of the leading
   scholars of the study of sport organizations, management, and policy,
   Laurence Chalip, considers the crucial intersection of the sociology of
   sport with its applications in the real world. Reflecting on how a 1989
   call for the development of an applied sociology of sport by Yiannakis
   was not well-received by a sociology of sport scholarly community
   (concerned that political and marketplace imperatives might diminish its
   interpretive and critical agenda) Chalip outlines pragmatic and moral
   grounds for needing an applied sociology of sport. Posing that the
   challenges of the sociology of sport entail both embracing the nexus of
   application and theory, and the development of new conceptual tools, it
   is argued that an applied sociology of sport can, counter to
   conventional wisdom, challenge the status and functioning of privilege
   and power in sport. A key challenge of servicing clients in
   consultancies and applications is realizing that applied sociology of
   sport cannot be a-theoretical, but instead demands being multiply
   theoretical. Looking to the future, it is noted that the dearth of
   action research by sport scholars has been noteworthy, and that the
   simultaneous engagement of theory with practice, which has been
   inadequately developed, represents an opportunity that should not be
   missed.

   cultural understandings of sport. Situated in an unshakable belief about
   the inherent purity and goodness of sport, it is argued that the GSM has
   shaped uncountable decisions to embrace and sponsor sports despite their
   costs and what they may preclude in the way of other private and public
   choices. In assessing the challenges of the field, the author points to
   the influence of the GSM in masking and enabling personal power that has
   enabled ruling elites to appropriate public money for private gain. In
   looking ahead to future sociology of sport inquiry, scholars are
   encouraged to recognize how the GSM continues to undermine critical
   discussions and research on the culture and organization of sports and
   engage that understanding in more effective tactics for disseminating
   research that can facilitate social change and activism.

   the discipline: (1) the movement challenging dominant social theories,
   (2) the feminist (women's) movement, and (3) the African American rights
   movement. The focus on social movements has continued to influence the

   increasingly viewed as terrain on which military tactics and weaponry
   are deemed necessary to protect capital investments, control crowds and
   prevent and respond to terrorist attacks; and the experiences of those
   who live and work in, and visit, urban areas. Future directions of the
   sociology of sport with regard to sport and the city are considered,
   with the reminder that sociologists of sport across the globe view with
   informed scepticism any notion that sports can act as a solution to
   general urban problems: the city is not a unitary entity that benefits
   uniformly from sport-related policy, as recent events in Brazil have
   amply illustrated.

AB On the 50th anniversary of the ISSA and IRSS, Lawrence A Wenner,
   Editor-in-Chief of the IRSS and a key foundational scholar of media and
   sport, considers how the study of media in the sociology of sport is
   unavoidable as media is central to how sport is framed, understood,
   enacted, and transacted. The early reluctance to study mediated sport is
   traced to disciplinary challenges in both physical education and
   communication studies. These challenges were overcome by the rise of
   British cultural studies and concerns over agency in the study of money
   and power and framing and identities as central to inquiry. Key
   challenges for the study of media and sport are fueled by the need to go
   beyond textual analysis, to recognize the dirtiness of sport narratives,
   and interrogate the dynamic of inherently commodified logics. Posing the
   lasting power of the mediasport interpellation as a form of address
   anchored in gender, fan, and consumer identities, it is argued that new
   media will encounter embedded cultural logics about sport as obstacles
   to change.

AB Much work has been done in recent decades to emphasize the need in
   ethnographic writing to grapple with questions of authorship,
   perspective, aesthetics, emotional resonance, and style. Various forms
   of reflexive ethnographic writing, and especially autoethnography, have
   opened up new expressive avenues. In this article, I argue that a figure
   who is at present poorly known in English-language social scientific
   circles, the French ethnographer, poet, and writer Michel Leiris
   (1901-1990), pushes this kind of autobiographical ethnographic writing
   forward in powerful ways. In brief, Leiris offers a powerfully effective
   method (which I call poesie auto-socioanalytique) that ties subjective
   experience into a larger objective structural framework via a method
   that (1) focuses on cultural meaning in an autobiographical experiential
   framework, that is, from the inside, (2) is expressly concerned with the
   role that language itself plays in meaning and memory, and (3) examines
   extraordinary situations in which one stands, temporarily, outside the
   normal interactional world in an existential frame of peculiar intensity
   and effervescence (the ek-static), and uses the Durkheimian conception
   of the sacred-profane opposition, along with the binary differentiation
   of the sacred into pure and impure varieties, as a structural
   theoretical tool for these descriptions. He makes an important
   contribution to ongoing discussions in the disciplines of cultural
   anthropology and cultural sociology concerning the interpretation and
   description of cultural meaning.

AB There are many similarities in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals'
   coming out experiences, but bisexual people face unique challenges.
   Despite this, an explicit focus on bisexual people is missing from
   family research. Using family systems and cultural sociological
   perspectives, the authors analyzed how social and cultural factors shape
   disclosure processes for bisexuals as they come out to multiple family
   members. After analyzing qualitative data from a diverse group of 45
   individuals, they found that bisexual people navigate monosexist and
   heterosexist expectations in their family relationships. Cultural
   constructions of bisexuality shape the ways that bisexual people
   disclose their identities, including how they use language to influence
   family members' responses in desirable ways. Relationship status also
   influences bisexual people's disclosure strategies, as a romantic
   partner's gender is meaningful to family members' understandings of
   their sexual orientation. The findings highlight the importance of
   addressing cultural and social contexts in understanding sexual minority
   people's coming out processes.

AB Contemporary theory on community suggests that disagreement or conflict
   over foundational beliefs and values greatly decreases the chance that a
   successful, sustainable community experience will develop. My findings
   suggest, however, that feelings of community can develop despite
   incongruous ideologies through the perception of shared beliefs and
   values. Using an ethnographic case of a voluntary non-profit
   organization, I demonstrate how three types of mechanisms operate
   jointly to maintain a community without shared beliefs: environmental
   mechanisms related to the division of labor, relational mechanisms
   associated with selective recruitment and homophily, and a cognitive
   mechanism that produces the feeling of consensus in the absence of
   objectively shared beliefs. These mechanisms combine to allow a powerful
   experience of community to flourish in a context where we might expect,
   based on previous research, no community experience at all. Implications
   for the study of community, sociology of organizations, and social
   psychology are discussed.

AB Background: Prescription drugs, such as stimulants, opioid analgesics,
   anxiolytics, and sedatives, are frequently being used without a
   physician's prescription by college students, resulting in a rising
   epidemic. The literature has not yet examined the impact of one's social
   network in the use of these drugs, nor the co-occurrence of multiple
   prescription drugs. The current study investigated predictors of
   non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD), in addition to the
   prevalence of NMUPD in college students' social networks.
   Methods: 279 undergraduates from a large southeastern university were
   recruited to participate in the study. Logistic regressions were
   conducted to examine the predictors of the respondent misusing
   prescription drugs in the past 12 months.
   Results: The number of close friends who misused prescription drugs
   predicted the respondent misusing prescription drugs in the past year
   (p<.05), after controlling for the respondent's own substance use. The
   misuse of prescription drugs by college students and their close friends
   is widespread: approximately one-fourth of the sample used prescription
   drugs without a physician's prescription, and 30% of the sample had at
   least one close friend who misused prescription drugs.
   Conclusions: Prescription drug misuse is prevalent in college students'
   social networks, and more so among those who themselves misuse
   prescription drugs, suggesting the need for prevention specialists to
   provide younger adults with information regarding the detrimental
   consequences of prescription drug misuse for themselves and their
   friends. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Despite the clubhouse model's 60-year existence internationally, the
   central nature of its core program, the "work-ordered day" (WOH) (Beard
   et al. in Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal 5:47-53, 1982), is not
   well understood; hence, the primary focus of the present study was to
   explore members' experiences of the nature and meaning of the WOH. The
   study drew on qualitative interview data collected in 2009-2013 through
   open-ended questions and probes with 102 members and 24 staff from 5
   Clubhouse International-certified clubhouses (2 US and 3 Finnish).
   Participant observation supplemented the interviews and all data were
   analyzed using a grounded theory approach (Charmaz in Rethinking methods
   in psychology, 1995; Glaser and Strauss in The discovery of grounded
   theory: strategies for qualitative research, 1967). Two major themes
   clustered around: (a) WOH in service of autonomy (things to do, sense of
   accomplishment, respite, development of occupational skills) and (b) WOH
   in service of relationships (receiving support; collaboration; and
   making contributions to the clubhouse community). Clubhouse members
   appeared to experience the WOH as meaningful because it helps them, as
   its best, reconstruct a life, develop their occupational self and skill
   sets, and experientially learn and live what parallels a good life in
   the general community. It appears that these experiences,
   interconnecting with the fundamental human needs for autonomy and
   relationship, point to wellbeing and recovery as part of personal
   growth. These findings can guide clubhouse daily practice in assessing
   members' psychosocial strengths and needs pertaining to recovery. Future
   research should elaborate on influences of sources of meaning, including
   work designs and the contributions of everyday socio-cultural
   interactive and reciprocal processes to these meanings.

AB Conflicts fueled by popular religious mobilization have rekindled the
   controversy surrounding Samuel Huntington's theory of changing
   international alignments in the Post-Cold War era. In The Clash of
   Civilizations, Huntington challenged Fukuyama's "end of history" thesis
   that liberal democracy had emerged victorious out of Post-war
   ideological and economic rivalries. Based on a top-down analysis of the
   alignments of nation states, Huntington famously concluded that the axes
   of international geo-political conflicts had reverted to the ancient
   cultural divisions that had characterized most of human history. Until
   recently, however, the debate has had to rely more on polemics than
   empirical evidence. Moreover, Huntington made this prediction in 1993,
   before social media connected the world's population. Do digital
   communications attenuate or echo the cultural, religious, and ethnic
   "fault lines" posited by Huntington prior to the global diffusion of
   social media? We revisit Huntington's thesis using hundreds of millions
   of anonymized email and Twitter communications among tens of millions of
   worldwide users to map the global alignment of interpersonal relations.
   Contrary to the supposedly borderless world of cyberspace, a bottom-up
   analysis confirms the persistence of the eight culturally differentiated
   civilizations posited by Huntington, with the divisions corresponding to
   differences in language, religion, economic development, and spatial
   distance.

AB We intended to determine (1) whether stress from employment
   disadvantages led to increased frequency of heavy drinking and (2)
   whether race had a role in the relationship between such disadvantages
   and heavy drinking. Study data came from the National Longitudinal
   Survey of Youth, a prospective study that has followed a representative
   sample of youth since 1979. Our study employed data from 11 particular
   years, during which the survey included items measuring respondents'
   heavy drinking. Our final sample numbered 10,171 respondents, which
   generated 75,394 person-waves for data analysis. Both of our hypotheses
   were supported by results from multilevel mixed-effects linear
   regression capturing the time-varying nature of three employment
   disadvantages and of the heavy-drinking outcome. Results show that
   more-frequent heavy drinking was associated with employment
   disadvantages, and that disadvantages' effects on drinking were stronger
   for Blacks and Hispanics than for Whites. That worsening employment
   disadvantages have worse effects on minority groups' heavy drinking
   (compared to Whites) probably contributes to the racial health
   disparities in our nation. Policies and programs addressing such
   disparities are especially important during economic downturns.

   synthesis between Basque history, branding identity and Law 8/1994 on
   Basque identity in the homeland and Diaspora. Naturally occurring brands
   combine history, anthropology, sociology, and marketing to explain the
   phenomenon of communities defined by a sense of place. Focusing on both
   the Basque Country and Basques in Boise, Idaho as one case study, the
   authors discuss how the naturally occurring brand and cultural policy of
   the Basque people became formalized 20 years ago with Law 8/1994. The
   article addresses who the Basques are and how they have branded
   themselves through language, place, industry, food, drink, and culture.
   Similarities to other communities are explored so that other
   ethnic/cultural communities can learn from this Diaspora cultural policy
   discussion.

AB The current study aimed to establish a fine-grained, efficient
   characterization of the concurrent neuropsychological contributions to
   social functioning in neuropsychologically-referred youth. A secondary
   aim was to demonstrate a useful statistic approach for such
   investigations (Partial Least Squares Regression; PLSR), which is
   underutilized in this field. Forty-five participants (70 - 164 months;
   M-age = 110.89; 34 male) were recruited from a large neuropsychological
   assessment clinic. Participants completed subtests from the NEPSY-II
   focusing on neuropsychological constructs that have been linked to
   social functioning (affect decoding, social memory, motor skills,
   visuomotor skills, response inhibition, attention and set-shifting, and
   verbal comprehension). Mothers completed the BASC-2, from which
   Atypicality and Social Skills scales were analyzed. PLSR revealed that
   difficulty with social memory, sensorimotor integration, and the ability
   to attend to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli combine to
   best predict atypical or "odd" behavior. In terms of social skills, two
   factors emerged. The first factor indicated that, counterintuitively,
   greater emotional perception, visuospatial perception, ability to attend
   to and accurately discriminate auditory stimuli, and understand
   instructions was related to poorer social skills. The second factor
   indicated that a pattern of better facial memory, and sensorimotor
   ability (execution & integration) characterized a distinct profile of
   greater social ability. PLSR results were compared to traditional OLS
   and Backwards Stepwise regression approaches to demonstrate utility.
   Results also suggested that these findings were consistent across age,
   gender, and diagnostic group, indicating common neuropsychological
   substrates of social functioning in this sample of referred youth.
   Overall, this study provides the first characterization of optimized
   combinations of neuropsychological variables in predicting social
   functioning in assessment clinic-referred youth, and introduces to this
   literature a valuable statistical approach for obtaining such
   characterizations.

AB Research on human sociality rarely includes kinship, social structure,
   sex, and familiarity, even though these variables influence sociality in
   non-human primates. However, cross-cultural ethnographic and
   observational studies with humans indicate that, beginning after age 5
   years, males and females form differing social structures with unrelated
   individuals in a community. Specifically, compared with females, human
   males exhibit greater tolerance for and form larger, interconnected
   groups of peers which we term "gregariousness." To examine sex
   differences in gregariousness early in life when children first interact
   with peers without adult supervision, 3- to 6-year-old children were
   given the choice to enter one of three play areas: an empty one, one
   with an adult, or one with a familiar, same-sex peer. More males than
   females initially chose the play area with the same-sex peer, especially
   after age 5 years. Sex differences in gregariousness with same-sex peers
   likely constitute one facet of human sociality.

AB Background-The purposes of this study were to assess the long-term
   effect of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) on blood pressure (BP)
   trajectories from childhood to young adulthood and to examine whether
   this relation is explained by childhood socioeconomic status (SES) or
   risk behaviors that are associated with ACEs.
   Methods and Results-Systolic and diastolic BPs were measured up to 16
   times (13 times on average) over a 23-year period in 213 African
   Americans and 181 European Americans 5 to 38 years of age. Retrospective
   data on traumatic experiences before 18 years of age were collected,
   including abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction. Individual growth
   curve modeling within a multilevel framework was used to examine the
   relation between exposure to ACEs and BP development. No main effect of
   ACEs on average BP levels was found. However, a significant interaction
   of ACE score with age(3) was observed (systolic BP, P=0.033; diastolic
   BP, P=0.017). Subjects who experienced multiple traumatic events during
   childhood showed a faster rise in BP levels after 30 years of age than
   those without ACEs. As expected, a graded association of ACEs with
   childhood socioeconomic status and negative health behaviors was
   observed (P<0.001). The ACE-systolic BP relation was not explained by
   these factors, whereas the ACE-diastolic BP relation was partially
   mediated by illicit drug use.
   Conclusion-In this novel longitudinal study, we observed that
   participants who were exposed to multiple ACEs displayed a greater
   increase in BP levels in young adulthood compared with their
   counterparts without ACEs.

AB Though decades of research have shown that people are highly influenced
   by peers, few studies have directly assessed how the value of social
   conformity is weighed against other types of costs and benefits. Using
   an effort-based decision-making paradigm with a novel social influence
   manipulation, we measured how social influence affected individuals'
   decisions to allocate effort for monetary rewards during trials with
   either high or low probability of receiving a reward. We found that
   information about the effort-allocation of peers modulated participant
   choices, specifically during conditions of low probability of obtaining
   a reward. This suggests that peer influence affects effort-based choices
   to obtain rewards especially under conditions of risk. This study
   provides evidence that people value social conformity in addition to
   other costs and benefits when allocating effort, and suggests that
   neuroeconomic studies that assess trade-offs between effort and reward
   should consider social environment as a factor that can influence
   decision-making.

   students (1966-2014). Although the majority of adolescents and emerging
   adults are still religiously involved, twice as many 12th graders and
   college students, and 20%-40% more 8th and 10th graders, never attend
   religious services. Twice as many 12th graders and entering college
   students in the 2010s (vs. the 1960s-70s) give their religious
   affiliation as "none," as do 40%-50% more 8th and 10th graders. Recent
   birth cohorts report less approval of religious organizations, are less
   likely to say that religion is important in their lives, report being
   less spiritual, and spend less time praying or meditating. Thus,
   declines in religious orientation reach beyond affiliation to religious
   participation and religiosity, suggesting a movement toward secularism
   among a growing minority. The declines are larger among girls, Whites,
   lower-SES individuals, and in the Northeastern U.S., very small among
   Blacks, and non-existent among political conservatives. Religious
   affiliation is lower in years with more income inequality, higher median
   family income, higher materialism, more positive self-views, and lower
   social support. Overall, these results suggest that the lower religious
   orientation of Millennials is due to time period or generation, and not
   to age.

AB The wide diversity of brain death practices and perceptions throughout
   the world catalogued by Wahlster et al.(1) raises the question of
   whether agreement on international standards and practices of brain
   death is an achievable goal. Worldwide concurrence on death
   determination criteria can enhance public confidence in physicians'
   ability to determine death by eliminating the possibility that patients
   declared dead in one jurisdiction would be considered alive in another.
   International harmonization also is a constructive step toward improving
   global systems of organ transplantation. But as the WHO has found,(2)
   formidable medical and societal barriers must be overcome before such
   consensus becomes possible.

AB Disruptions in stress response system functioning are thought to be a
   central mechanism by which exposure to adverse early-life environments
   influences human development. Although early-life adversity results in
   hyperreactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and
   hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in rodents, evidence from
   human studies is inconsistent. We present results from the Bucharest
   Early Intervention Project examining whether randomized placement into a
   family caregiving environment alters development of the autonomic
   nervous system and HPA axis in children exposed to early-life
   deprivation associated with institutional rearing. Electrocardiogram,
   impedance cardiograph, and neuroendocrine data were collected during
   laboratory-based challenge tasks from children (mean age = 12.9 y)
   raised in deprived institutional settings in Romania randomized to a
   high-quality foster care intervention (n = 48) or to remain in care as
   usual (n = 43) and a sample of typically developing Romanian children (n
   = 47). Children who remained in institutional care exhibited
   significantly blunted SNS and HPA axis responses to psychosocial stress
   compared with children randomized to foster care, whose stress responses
   approximated those of typically developing children. Intervention
   effects were evident for cortisol and parasympathetic nervous system
   reactivity only among children placed in foster care before age 24 and
   18 months, respectively, providing experimental evidence of a sensitive
   period in humans during which the environment is particularly likely to
   alter stress response system development. We provide evidence for a
   causal link between the early caregiving environment and stress response
   system reactivity in humans with effects that differ markedly from those
   observed in rodent models.

AB Although there is a growing consensus that Internet communication
   technology (ICT) affects collective action in the twenty-first century,
   we know very little about what keeps individuals involved in ICT-based
   organizations over time. Our paper addresses this lacuna by examining
   whether individuals stay involved in two organizations that use ICT to
   structure interaction differently over a two-year period. We draw on
   interview and participant observation data with 38 supporters of
   MoveOn.org, which structures interaction hierarchically, and the Florida
   Tea Party Movement, which structures interaction horizontally, to assess
   how individuals think about each organization's use of ICT and how this
   shapes individual efficacy and voice - two factors that we find critical
   to keeping individuals engaged in organizations over time. We show that
   how a group uses ICT to structure interaction affects the kinds of
   efficacy and voice individuals are likely to experience. Organizations
   that use ICT to hierarchically structure interactions are effective at
   mobilizing people or money quickly and at achieving short-term goals,
   but very ineffective at creating a community of activists on the ground.
   The opposite is true of groups that use ICT horizontally. They are
   effective at creating a political community, but the conflicts that
   arise among supporters narrow group membership, hinder mobilization, and
   undercut organizational political clout over time. We conclude with a
   discussion of our results for understanding ICT and activism in the
   digital age.

AB Scholars, journalists, and laypeople alike have argued that the
   relatively new field of citizen journalism (CJ) offers a space where
   citizens can act as amateur reporters to challenge the dominance of
   mainstream media. However, contrary to popular expectations, a large
   number of CJ sites include current or former professional journalists as
   contributors, calling into question the new field's independence from
   the mainstream media. Using a content analysis of a sample (n = 326)
   drawn from the largest sampling frame of English-language CJ websites
   based in the United States to date (n = 1958), we explore potential
   explanations for the presence of professional journalists as
   contributors on CJ sites. In a series of logistic regression analyses,
   we find evidence that for-profit CJ sites and those with editorial
   staffs are more likely to have professional journalists. Furthermore, we
   find that sites with professional journalists do not offer significantly
   different content when controlling for other factors. Based on these
   findings, we theorize that CJ websites seek out professional journalists
   as a means of gaining legitimacy within a new organizational field.
   These results indicate a growing professionalization within the field of
   CJ and the persistence of a public sphere dominated by elite actors.

AB Washington, DC, has the highest AIDS diagnosis rate in the USA, and
   Black women are disproportionately affected. Although HIV testing is the
   first entryway into vital treatment services, evidence reveals that
   foreign-born blacks have a lower rate of recent HIV testing than US-born
   blacks. To date, however, there are no studies that examine the
   culture-specific perceptions of HIV testing among East African immigrant
   women (who comprise a large share of Black Africans in DC) to better
   understand their potential barriers to testing. Adopting the PEN-3
   cultural model as our theoretical framework, the main objective of this
   study was to examine East African women's HIV testing perceptions and
   partner communication norms. Between October 2012 and March 2013,
   trained interviewers conducted a total of 25 interviews with East
   African women in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area. For
   triangulation purposes, data collection consisted of both in-depth,
   semi-structured interviews and cognitive interviews, in which
   participants were administered a quantitative survey and assessed on how
   they interpreted items. Qualitative thematic analysis revealed a
   systematic pattern of discordant responses across participants. While
   they were aware of messages related to Western public health discourse
   surrounding HIV testing (e.g., Everyone should get tested for HIV; One
   should talk to one's spouse about HIV testing), divergent sociocultural
   expectations rooted in cultural and religious beliefs prevailed (e.g.,
   Getting an HIV test brings shame to the person who got tested and to
   one's family; it implies one is engaging in immoral behavior; One should
   not talk with one's spouse about HIV testing; doing so breaks cultural
   norms). Implications of using a culture-centered model to examine the
   role of sociocultural expectations in HIV prevention research and to
   develop culturally responsive prevention strategies are discussed.

AB Does adherence to Islam predict attitudes about suicide bombing among
   American Muslims? This study examines the effects of religious and
   political factors on views of politically motivated violence (PMV). We
   draw from diverse scholarship, emphasizing arguments that are inspired
   by Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations perspective, as well as
   recent work in the sociology of Islam. Using a measure that gauges
   support for suicide bombing from the 2007 Pew Survey of American
   Muslims, results from logistic regression models suggest that political
   views and religious factors have a minimal effect on Muslim American
   attitudes toward suicide bombing. Furthermore, we find that Qur'nic
   authoritativeness (i.e., the view that the Qur'n is the word of God and
   not written by men) is associated with lower odds of supporting this
   form of PMV. We discuss the implications of our findings for the often
   anecdotal and alarmist accounts that link Muslim religiosity to support
   for radical extremism. We close with study limitations and avenues of
   future research.

   men to reconcile their experiences with religious expectations and to

   socioeconomics.
   Aim: To analyse cranial morphological traits for deciphering if they are
   subject to secular trends.
   Subjects and methods: Two documented skeletal collections were sampled
   for a total of 525 individuals from 1849-1960. Cranial morphological
   traits were scored and input into time series statistics (logistic
   regression).
   Results: In females, nuchal crests have enlarged, while glabella has
   decreased. In males, supraorbital margins have dulled, while glabella
   decreased. Sexual dimorphism increased in supraorbital margins.
   Conclusion: The patterns in the data here reflect those found in other
   areas of the skeleton, namely height, as regards to secular trends.
   These findings can be extended to stature and cranial changes that
   parallel socioeconomic trends during the Industrial Revolution,
   antebellum period and after.

   Methods. Using electronic medical records data from Kaiser Permanente
   Northern California linked to data from the California Cancer Registry,

   analyzed survival using multivariable Cox proportional hazards
   regression with follow-up through 2010.
   Results. After consideration of tumor stage, subtype, comorbidity, and
   type of treatment received, non-Hispanic White women living in low-SES
   neighborhoods (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] =
   1.07, 1.52) and African Americans regardless of neighborhood SES (high
   SES: HR= 1.44; 95% CI = 1.01, 2.07; low SES: HR= 1.88; 95% CI = 1.42,
   2.50) had worse overall survival than did non-Hispanic White women
   living in high-SES neighborhoods. Results were similar for breast
   cancer-specific survival, except that African Americans and non-Hispanic
   Whites living in high-SES neighborhoods had similar survival.
   Conclusions. Strategies to address the underlying factors that may
   influence treatment intensity and adherence, such as comorbidities and
   logistical barriers, should be targeted at low-SES non-Hispanic White
   and all African American patients.

AB Objectives. We aimed to identify problem drinking trajectories and their
   predictors among Asian Americans transitioning from adolescence to
   adulthood. We considered cultural and socioeconomic contextual factors,
   specifically ethnic drinking cultures, neighborhood socioeconomic
   status, and neighborhood coethnic density, to identify subgroups at high
   risk for developing problematic drinking trajectories.
   Methods. We used a sample of 1333 Asian Americans from 4 waves of the
   National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1994-2008) in
   growth mixture models to identify trajectory classes of frequent heavy
   episodic drinking and drunkenness. We fitted multinomial logistic
   regression models to identify predictors of trajectory class membership.
   Results. Two dimensions of ethnic drinking culture-drinking prevalence
   and detrimental drinking pattern in the country of origin-were
   predictive of problematic heavy episodic drinking and drunkenness
   trajectories. Higher neighborhood socioeconomic status in adolescence
   was predictive of the trajectory class indicating increasing frequency
   of drunkenness. Neighborhood coethnic density was not predictive of
   trajectory class membership.
   Conclusions. Drinking cultures in the country of origin may have
   enduring effects on drinking among Asian Americans. Further research on
   ethnic drinking cultures in the United States is warranted for
   prevention and intervention.

AB Objectives. We developed the policy indicator checklist (PIC) to
   identify and measure policies for calorie-dense foods and
   sugar-sweetened beverages to determine how policies are clustered across
   multiple settings.
   Methods. In 2012 and 2013 we used existing literature, policy documents,
   government recommendations, and instruments to identify key policies. We
   then developed the PIC to examine the policy environments across 3
   settings (communities, schools, and early care and education centers) in
   8 communities participating in the Childhood Obesity Research
   Demonstration Project.
   Results. Principal components analysis revealed 5 components related to
   calorie-dense food policies and 4 components related to sugar-sweetened
   beverage policies. Communities with higher youth and racial/ethnic
   minority populations tended to have fewer and weaker policy environments
   concerning calorie-dense foods and healthy foods and beverages.
   Conclusions. The PIC was a helpful tool to identify policies that
   promote healthy food environments across multiple settings and to
   measure and compare the overall policy environments across communities.
   There is need for improved coordination across settings, particularly in
   areas with greater concentration of youths and racial/ethnic minority
   populations. Policies to support healthy eating are not equally
   distributed across communities, and disparities continue to exist in
   nutrition policies.

AB Objectives. We explored changes in sexual orientation question item
   completion in a large statewide health survey.
   Methods. We used 2003 to 2011 California Health Interview Survey data to
   investigate sexual orientation item nonresponse and sexual minority
   self-identification trends in a cross-sectional sample representing the
   noninstitutionalized California household population aged 18 to 70 years
   (n = 182 812 adults).
   Results. Asians, Hispanics, limited-English-proficient respondents, and
   those interviewed in non-English languages showed the greatest declines
   in sexual orientation item nonresponse. Asian women, regardless of
   English-proficiency status, had the highest odds of item nonresponse.
   Spanish interviews produced more nonresponse than English interviews and
   Asian-language interviews produced less nonresponse when we controlled
   for demographic factors and survey cycle. Sexual minority
   self-identification increased in concert with the item nonresponse
   decline.
   Conclusions. Sexual orientation nonresponse declines and the increase in
   sexual minority identification suggest greater acceptability of sexual
   orientation assessment in surveys. Item nonresponse rate convergence
   among races/ethnicities, language proficiency groups, and interview
   languages shows that sexual orientation can be measured in surveys of
   diverse populations.

AB Objectives. We assessed factors associated with engagement in
   transactional sex among men who have sex with men recruited from one of
   the largest Internet sites for men seeking social or sexual interactions
   with other men in Latin America.
   Methods. We constructed multilevel logistic regression models to analyze
   factors associated with engagement in transactional sex in 17 Latin
   American countries in 2012.
   Results. Of 24 051 respondents, 1732 (7.2%) reported being paid for
   sexual intercourse in the past 12 months. In a multivariable model,
   higher country-level unemployment was associated with increased odds of
   transactional sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.07 per 1% increase in
   unemployment; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.00, 1.13). Individual or
   interpersonal factors associated with increased odds of engagement in
   transactional sex included self-reported HIV (AOR= 1.33; 95% CI = 1.04,
   1.69) or sexually transmitted infection (AOR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.11,
   1.59), childhood sexual abuse history (AOR = 1.75; 95% CI = 1.48, 2.06),
   intimate partner violence (past 5 years, AOR= 1.68; 95% CI = 1.45,
   1.95), and sexual compulsivity (AOR= 1.77; 95% CI = 1.49, 2.11).
   Conclusions. Structural-level economic interventions and those that
   address individual and interpersonal factors may improve HIV prevention
   efforts among men who have sex with men who engage in transactional sex.

AB The social dimensions of river restoration are not well understood
   especially in the context of large-scale restoration projects embedded
   in a complex social-ecological system. This study used in-depth
   interviews with diverse stakeholders to examine perceptions of
   restoration success on the Clark Fork River Superfund project in Western
   Montana. Trust emerged as critical to restoration success and was
   influenced by public engagement, and by spatial and temporal scale. At
   this large scale, multiple relationships between agencies, NGOs,
   businesses, landowners, and other stakeholders meant that building trust
   was a complicated endeavor. The large spatial scale and long time frame
   made public engagement challenging, and landowners in particular were
   critical of the project, expressing mistrust in both agencies and the
   project as a whole. However, projects focused on smaller spatial scales,
   such as particular stream reaches, appeared to inspire more effective
   collaboration. Relationships between organizations were important at
   this large scale, but inter-organizational conflict affected trust
   across the project. Further, because trust requires accepting
   vulnerability, recognizing the differential vulnerability that
   particular groups and communities experience, based on the risks and
   benefits they accrue relative to the project, is important.

AB Organizing collective action to secure support from local communities
   provides a source of power for elites to protect their interests, but
   community structures constrain the ability of elites to use this power.
   Elites' power is not static or self-perpetuating but changing and
   dynamic. There are situations in which elites are forced into
   movement-like struggles to mobilize support from their community. The
   success of elites' mobilization is affected by cultural and structural
   factors that shape the collective meaning of supporting elites' actions
   and the identities that are formed in doing so. I find broad support for
   these propositions in a study of the issuances of small-denomination
   currency substitutes in 145 U.S. cities during the Panic of 1907. I
   discuss the contributions of this article to elite studies, the social
   movement literature, and the sociology of money.

AB This study rehabilitates concepts from classical human ecology and
   synthesizes them with contemporary urban and environmental sociology to
   advance a theory of urbanization as socioenvironmental succession. The
   theory illuminates how social and biophysical phenomena interact
   endogenously at the local level to situate urban land use patterns
   recursively and reciprocally in place. To demonstrate this theory we
   conduct a historical-comparative analysis of hazardous industrial site
   accumulation in four U.S. cities, using a relational database that was
   assembled for more than 11,000 facilities that operated during the past
   half centurymost of which remain unacknowledged in government reports.
   Results show how three iterative processeshazardous industrial churning,
   residential churning, and risk containmentintersect to produce
   successive socioenvironmental changes that are highly relevant to but
   often missed by research on urban growth machines, environmental
   inequality, and systemic risk.

AB Objectives: Despite a strong link between antibiotic use and resistance,
   and highly variable antibiotic consumption rates across the USA, drivers
   of differences in consumption rates are not fully understood. The
   objective of this study was to examine how provider density affects
   antibiotic prescribing rates across socioeconomic groups in the USA.
   Methods: We aggregated data on all outpatient antibiotic prescriptions
   filled in retail pharmacies in the USA in 2000 and 2010 from IMS Health
   into 3436 geographically distinct hospital service areas and combined
   this with socioeconomic and structural factors that affect antibiotic
   prescribing from the US Census. We then used fixed-effect models to
   estimate the interaction between poverty and the number of physician
   offices per capita (i.e. physician density) and the presence of urgent
   care and retail clinics on antibiotic prescribing rates.
   Results: We found large geographical variation in prescribing, driven in
   part by the number of physician offices per capita. For an increase of
   one standard deviation in the number of physician offices per capita
   there was a 25.9% increase in prescriptions per capita. However, the
   determinants of the prescription ratewere dependent on socio-economic
   conditions. In poorer areas, clinics substitute for traditional
   physician offices, reducing the impact of physician density. In
   wealthier areas, clinics increase the effect of physician density on the
   prescribing rate.
   Conclusions: In areas with higher poverty rates, access to providers
   drives the prescribing rate. However, in wealthier areas, where access
   is less of a problem, a higher density of providers and clinics
   increases the prescribing rate, potentially due to competition.

AB IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, few published studies have examined the
   influence of competitive food and beverage (CF&B) policies on student
   weight outcomes; none have investigated disparities in the influence of
   CF&B policies on children's body weight by school neighborhood
   socioeconomic resources.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate whether the association between CF&B policies
   and population-level trends in childhood overweight/obesity differed by
   school neighborhood income and education levels.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study, from July
   2013 to October 2014, compared overweight/obesity prevalence trends
   before (2001-2005) and after (2006-2010) implementation of CF&B policies
   in public elementary schools in California. The study included 2 700 880
   fifth-grade students in 5362 public schools from 2001 to 2010.
   EXPOSURES California CF&B policies (effective July 1, 2004, and July 1,
   2007) and school neighborhood income and education levels.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Overweight/obesity defined as a body mass
   index at or greater than the 85th percentile for age and sex.
   RESULTS Overall rates of overweight/obesity ranged from 43.5% in 2001 to
   45.8% in 2010. Compared with the period before the introduction of CF&B
   policies, overweight/obesity trends changed in a favorable direction
   after the policies took effect (2005-2010); these changes occurred for
   all children across all school neighborhood socioeconomic levels. In the
   postpolicy period, these trends differed by school neighborhood
   socioeconomic advantage. From 2005-2010, trends in overweight/obesity
   prevalence leveled off among students at schools in socioeconomically
   disadvantaged neighborhoods but declined in socioeconomically advantaged
   neighborhoods. Students in the lowest-income neighborhoods experienced
   zero or near zero change in the odds of overweight/obesity over time:
   the annual percentage change in overweight/obesity oddswas 0.1% for
   females (95% CI, -0.7 to 0.9) and -0.3% for males (95% CI, -1.1 to 0.5).
   In contrast, in the highest-income neighborhoods, the annual percentage
   decline in the odds of overweight was 1.2% for females (95% CI, 0.4 to
   1.9) and 1.0% for males (95% CI, 0.3 to 1.8). Findingswere similar for
   school neighborhood education.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Our study found population-level improvements
   in the prevalence of childhood overweight/obesity that coincided with
   the period following implementation of statewide CF&B policies
   (2005-2010). However, these improvements were greatest at schools in the
   most advantaged neighborhoods. This suggests that CF&B policies may help
   prevent child obesity; however, the degree of their effectiveness is
   likely to depend on socioeconomic and other contextual factors in school
   neighborhoods. To reduce disparities and prevent obesity, school
   policies and environmental interventions must address relevant
   contextual factors in school neighborhoods.

AB Kyoto's chefs have reacted proactively to changes brought about by the
   most recent phase of globalization, hoping to ensure the continued
   existence and resonance of Kyoto cuisine by using science to adapt it to
   contemporary circumstances. These chefs are breaking new ground in their
   pursuit of a scientific understanding of how Kyoto cuisine works. They
   meet once a month in a kitchen laboratory at Kyoto University to present
   and analyze culinary experiments in keeping with a predetermined theme.
   They use their acquired knowledge to more precisely hone their culinary
   skills and to explain Kyoto cuisine to a global audience. Chefs visit
   local elementary schools, appear on national television, and welcome
   chefs from abroad into their kitchens so that people across the world
   will better understand what authentic Kyoto cuisine consists of.
   Although these chefs' efforts are groundbreaking, there is also
   remarkable continuity, to their approach. Not only has Kyoto cuisine
   always been in a steady state of transformation, but the chefs in the
   Laboratory are engaging with science and a global audience specifically
   so that they can ascertain Kyoto cuisine's continued existence and
   importance. Though their means of understanding and articulating what
   Kyoto cuisine is differs from that of their predecessors, concepts like
   shun (seasonality) and hin (refinement) still guide chefs today.
   Ultimately, then, based on interviews and participant observation
   conducted in and outside of the Japanese Cuisine Laboratory in 2012 and
   2013, I argue that by engaging with contemporary food science, Kyoto's
   chefs achieve a strategic balance of protecting their culinary heritage
   while adapting it to contemporary circumstances.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine whether longitudinal urinary incontinence (UI)
   characteristics, race or ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and education
   were associated with UI treatment-seeking in a prospective cohort of
   community-dwelling midlife women.
   METHODS: We analyzed data from 9 years of the Study of Women's Health
   Across the Nation. The study asked participants reporting at least
   monthly UI about seeking treatment for their UI at baseline and in visit
   years 7, 8, and 9. Our main covariates included self-reported race or
   ethnicity, income, level of difficulty paying for basics, and education
   level. We used multiple logistic regression to examine associations
   between demographic, psychosocial, and longitudinal UI characteristics
   and whether women sought UI treatment. We explored interactions by race
   or ethnicity, socioeconomic status measures, and education level.
   RESULTS: A total of 1,550 women (68% of women with UI) reported seeking
   treatment for UI over the 9 years of this study. In multivariable
   analyses, women had higher odds of seeking treatment when UI in the year
   before seeking treatment was more frequent (adjusted odds ratio [OR]
   3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.15-8.67) and more bothersome
   (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.01-1.18), with longer symptom duration, and
   with worsening UI symptoms (adjusted OR 1.75, 95% CI 1.01-3.04). Women
   who saw physicians regularly, had more preventive women's health visits,
   or both were more likely to seek UI treatment (adjusted OR 1.18, 95% CI
   1.07, 1.30). Race or ethnicity, socioeconomic measures, and education
   were not significantly related to seeking treatment for UI.
   CONCLUSION: We found no evidence of racial or ethnic, socioeconomic, or
   education level disparities in UI treatment-seeking. Rather,
   longitudinal UI characteristics were most strongly associated with
   treatment-seeking behavior in midlife women.

AB Objectives: This research sought to assess racial and socioeconomic
   status (SES) differences in level and change in allostatic load (AL)
   over time in midlife women and to test whether psychosocial factors
   mediate these relationships. These factors were discrimination,
   perceived stress, and hostility.
   Methods: Longitudinal data obtained from the Study of Women's Health
   Across the Nation were used (n = 2063; mean age at baseline = 46.0
   years). Latent growth curve models evaluated the impact of demographic,
   menopausal, and psychosocial variables on level and change in AL for 8
   years.
   Results: Direct effects: high levels of discrimination and hostility
   significantly predicted higher AL (path coefficients = 0.05 and 0.05,
   respectively). High perceived stress significantly predicted a faster
   rate of increase of AL (path coefficient = 0.06). Racial and SES
   differentials were present, with African American race (path coefficient
   = 0.23), low income (path coefficient = -0.15), and low education (path
   coefficient = -0.08) significantly predicting high AL level. Indirect
   effects: significant indirect effects were found for African American
   race, less income, and lower education through higher discrimination,
   perceived stress, and hostility on level and rate of AL.
   Conclusions: This was one of the first studies that investigated AL over
   multiple periods, and results supported AL as a cumulative phenomenon,
   affected by multiple psychosocial and demographic factors. The results
   suggest the complex ways in which race, SES, and psychosocial factors
   operate to influence AL.

AB Weber's typology of religious orientations is incomplete. Much more
   attention has been paid to the other-worldly mysticism of monastic or
   contemplative withdrawal from society than the neglected category of
   inner-worldly mysticism. In Weber's brief treatment, he concludes that
   inner-worldly mysticism results in passive acquiescence to social
   conditions. Alternately, we draw on examples from Mother Teresa and
   Dorothy Day to demonstrate not only how mysticism can be tightly linked
   to the social world, but how mystical practices can create meaningful
   social change. We argue that this change is possible because
   inner-worldly mysticism holds the potential to generate solidarity
   across traditional power and status divides. We illustrate how this
   potential for interaction-level change can spread horizontally; the
   number of small groups committed to carrying out inner-worldly mystical
   practices can grow until such groups spread across communities and
   beyond. In this way, the work of inner-worldly mystics can create
   meaningful change without ever vying for power on the macro political
   stage.

AB Malaria is a leading cause of pediatric mortality, and Uganda has among
   the highest incidences in the world. Increased morbidity and mortality
   are associated with delays to care. This qualitative study sought to
   characterize barriers to prompt allopathic care for children
   hospitalized with severe malaria in the endemic region of southwestern
   Uganda. Minimally structured, qualitative interviews were conducted with
   guardians of children admitted to a regional hospital with severe
   malaria. Using an inductive and content analytic approach, transcripts
   were analyzed to identify and define categories that explain delayed
   care. These categories represented two broad themes: sociocultural and
   structural factors. Sociocultural factors were 1) interviewee's
   distinctions of "traditional" versus "hospital" illnesses, which were
   mutually exclusive and 2) generational conflict, where deference to
   one's elders, who recommended traditional medicine, was expected.
   Structural factors were 1) inadequate distribution of health-care
   resources, 2) impoverishment limiting escalation of care, and 3)
   financial impact of illness on household economies. These factors
   perpetuate a cycle of illness, debt, and poverty consistent with a model
   of structural violence. Our findings inform a number of potential
   interventions that could alleviate the burden of this preventable, but
   often fatal, illness. Such interventions could be beneficial in
   similarly endemic, low-resource settings.

AB Both sleep disturbance and social isolation increase the risk for
   morbidity and mortality. Systemic inflammation is suspected as a
   potential mechanism of these associations. However, the complex
   relationships between sleep disturbance, social isolation, and
   inflammation have not been examined in a population-based longitudinal
   study. This study examined the longitudinal association between sleep
   disturbance and systemic inflammation, and the moderating effects of
   social isolation on this association. The CARDIA study is a
   population-based longitudinal study conducted in four US cities. Sleep
   disturbance - i.e., insomnia complaints and short sleep duration - was
   assessed in 2962 African-American and White adults at baseline
   (2000-2001, ages 33-45 years). Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) was
   measured at baseline and follow-up (2005-2006). Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and
   subjective and objective social isolation (i.e., feelings of social
   isolation and social network size) were measured at follow-up. Sleep
   disturbance was a significant predictor of inflammation five years later
   after full adjustment for covariates (adjusted betas: 0.048, P = 0.012
   for CRP; 0.047, P = 0.017 for IL-6). Further adjustment for baseline CRP
   revealed that sleep disturbance also impacted the longitudinal change in
   CRP levels over five years (adjusted beta: 0.044, P = 0.013). Subjective
   social isolation was a significant moderator of this association between
   sleep disturbance and CRP (adjusted beta 0.131, P = 0.002). Sleep
   disturbance was associated with heightened systemic inflammation in a
   general population over a five-year follow-up, and this association was
   significantly stronger in those who reported feelings of social
   isolation. Clinical interventions targeting sleep disturbances may be a
   potential avenue for reducing inflammation, particularly in individuals
   who feel socially isolated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective: To examine the use of social media within Endourology by
   reporting on its utilization during the 2013 World Congress of
   Endourology (WCE) annual meeting. Materials and Methods: Two social
   media platforms were analyzed for this study: Twitter (San Francisco,
   CA) and LinkedIn (Mountain View, CA). For Twitter, a third-party
   analysis service (Tweetreach) was used to quantitatively analyze all
   tweets with the hashtags #WCE2013 and #WCE13 during a 7-day period
   surrounding the WCE. Two reviewers independently classified tweet
   content using a predefined Twitter-specific classification system. Tweet
   sentiment was determined using sentiment analysis software (Semantria,
   Inc., Amherst, MA). Finally, the penetration of Twitter and LinkedIn
   within the WCE faculty was assessed by means of a manual search.
   Results: During the study period, 335 tweets had the hashtag #WCE2013 or
   #WCE13. Content originated from 68 users resulting in a mean of 47
   tweets/day and 4.9 tweets/contributor. Conference-related tweets had a
   reach of 38,141 unique Twitter accounts and an online exposure of
   188,629 impressions. Physicians generated the majority of the content
   (63%), of which 55.8% were not attending the meeting. More tweets were
   informative (56.7%) versus uninformative (43.3%), and 17.9% had links to
   an external web citation. The mean sentiment score was 0.13 (range -0.90
   to 1.80); 13.1%, 57.0%, and 29.9% of tweets were negative, neutral, and
   positive in sentiment, respectively. Of 302 WCE meeting faculty, 150
   (49.7%) had registered LinkedIn accounts while only 52 (17.2%) had
   Twitter accounts, and only 19.2% tweeted during the meeting.
   Conclusions: Despite a relatively low number of Twitter users, tweeting
   about the WCE meeting dramatically increased its online exposure with
   dissemination of content that was mostly informative including
   engagement with physicians not attending the conference. While half of
   faculty at WCE 2013 had LinkedIn accounts, their social media footprint
   in Twitter was limited.

AB BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported that black race and lack of
   health insurance coverage are associated with increased mortality
   following traumatic injury. However, the association of race and
   insurance status with trauma outcomes has not been examined using
   contemporary, national, population-based data.
   METHODS: We used data from the National Inpatient Sample on 215,615
   patients admitted to 1 of 836 hospitals following traumatic injury in
   2010. We examined the effects of race and insurance coverage on
   mortality using two logistic regression models, one for patients younger
   than 65 years and the other for older patients.
   RESULTS: Unadjusted mortality was low for white (2.71%), black (2.54%),
   and Hispanic (2.03%) patients. We found no difference in adjusted
   survival for nonelderly black patients compared with white patients
   (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI],
   0.90-1.19; p = 0.550). Elderly black patients had a 25% lower odds of
   mortality compared with elderly white patients (AOR, 0.75; 95% CI,
   0.63-0.90; p = 0.002). After accounting for survivor bias, insurance
   coverage was not associated with improved survival in younger patients
   (AOR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.77-1.07; p = 0.233).
   CONCLUSION: Black race is not associated with higher mortality following
   injury. Health insurance coverage is associated with lower mortality,
   but this may be the result of hospitals' inability to quickly obtain
   insurance coverage for uninsured patients who die early in their
   hospital stay. Increasing insurance coverage may not improve survival
   for patients hospitalized following injury. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg.

AB BackgroundAs public health leaders prepare for possible future influenza
   pandemics, the rapid spread of 2009 H1N1 influenza highlights the need
   to focus on measures the public can adopt to help slow disease
   transmission. Such measures may relate to hygiene (e.g., hand washing),
   social distancing (e.g., avoiding places where many people gather), and
   pharmaceutical interventions (e.g., vaccination). Given the
   disproportionate impact of public health emergencies on minority
   communities in the United States, it is important to understand whether
   there are differences in acceptance across racial/ethnic groups that
   could lead to targeted and more effective policies and communications.
   ObjectivesThis study explores racial/ethnic differences in the adoption
   of preventive behaviors during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic.
   Patients/MethodsData are from a national telephone poll conducted March
   17 to April 11, 2010, among a representative sample of 1123 white, 330
   African American, 317 Hispanic, 268 Asian, and 262 American
   Indian/Alaska Native adults in the USA.
   ResultsPeople in at least one racial/ethnic minority group were more
   likely than whites to adopt several behaviors related to hygiene, social
   distancing, and healthcare access, including increased hand washing and
   talking with a healthcare provider (P-values <005). Exceptions included
   avoiding others with influenza-like illnesses and receiving 2009 H1N1
   and seasonal influenza vaccinations. After we controlled the data for
   socioeconomic status, demographic factors, healthcare access, and
   illness- and vaccine-related attitudes, nearly all racial/ethnic
   differences in behaviors persisted.
   ConclusionsMinority groups appear to be receptive to several preventive
   behaviors, but barriers to vaccination are more pervasive.

AB Despite research showing that immigrant adolescents differ in the degree
   to which they feel personally discriminated against, little is known
   about individual predictors of their perceived personal discrimination.
   We studied the role of a major developmental task in adolescence that is
   highly relevant for discrimination experiences: being liked by peers. We
   followed N = 532 13-year old immigrant students (n = 294 boys) in Greek
   high schools over 2 years to examine longitudinal links between personal
   ethnic discrimination and social preference among host-national and
   immigrant classmates. We applied a sociometric method to asses peer
   preference and we assessed self-perceived preference. Cross-lagged
   models revealed that preference among host-national peers but not by
   immigrant peers predicted low personal ethnic discrimination beyond
   self-perceptions of preference and group ethnic discrimination. Group
   ethnic discrimination moderated the effect of preference among
   host-national peers on low personal ethnic discrimination. Peer
   preference, in turn, did not feed back on personal ethnic
   discrimination. Findings highlight the importance of being liked by
   host-national classmates for immigrant adolescents: it can prevent
   feelings of being personally discriminated against, even if they
   perceive their group to be discriminated against.

AB Socioeconomic disparities are associated with differences in cognitive
   development. The extent to which this translates to disparities in brain
   structure is unclear. We investigated relationships between
   socioeconomic factors and brain morphometry, independently of genetic
   ancestry, among a cohort of 1,099 typically developing individuals
   between 3 and 20 years of age. Income was logarithmically associated
   with brain surface area. Among children from lower income families,
   small differences in income were associated with relatively large
   differences in surface area, whereas, among children from higher income
   families, similar income increments were associated with smaller
   differences in surface area. These relationships were most prominent in
   regions supporting language, reading, executive functions and spatial
   skills; surface area mediated socioeconomic differences in certain
   neurocognitive abilities. These data imply that income relates most
   strongly to brain structure among the most disadvantaged children.

AB Critical Race Theory (CRT) is a broad theoretical framework created by
   synthesizing the main themes of scholars who have challenged dominant
   contemporary understandings of race and the law. Although a theory of
   state tacitly undergirds much critical race scholarship, no one has yet
   aggregated the literature's disparate assertions into a unified theory
   of state. This article represents an initial contribution toward that
   effort. Through comparison with Omi and Winant's (1994) Racial State
   Theory (RST), I identify six central tenets - racialization of the
   state; state as white institutional space; instrumentalism;
   interest-convergence; fluid boundaries; and permanent racist orientation
   - that characterize the CRT of State for the United States. I close by
   entertaining three questions Omi and Winant (2012) argue demonstrate the
   utility of RST and use them to illustrate where the CRT of State I
   outline achieves greater analytical purchase than RST.

AB In sociology, the self has been conceptualized as either self-concept or
   the process of self-reflectivity. Both notions of the self have been
   traced to the early thinkersWilliam James, Charles H. Cooley, and George
   H. Meadwho laid the foundation for the scientific study of the self
   phenomenon. In this article, I propose a revised conception of the self
   based on a re-reading of the classics. I argue that the self is related
   to but not the same as self-concept or the process of self-reflectivity.
   The self is an emic object, that is, the entity that one takes oneself
   to be. More specifically, the self is the empirical existence of an
   individual perceived by the individual to be his or her own. As the
   identity the individual finds in his or her existence in a world shared
   with others, the self is a product of both self-reflection and
   self-enactment. Implications of this reconceptualization for some broad
   issues related to the self phenomenon are also discussed.

AB Editor's Introduction It gives me particular pleasure to publish this
   review of a major but neglected figure in the recent history of symbolic
   interactionism. I only heard Jack Douglas speak once, when he gave a
   plenary address to the British Sociological Association annual
   conference in Lancaster in the mid-1980s. The audience treated him quite
   disgracefully on that occasion. Douglas made two subtle points about the
   need for sociologists to take contemporary research in primate ethology
   more seriously and to reconsider spontaneous order theories in social
   science. His listeners assumed that he was talking about the crasser
   forms of sociobiology and praising the laissez-faire ideologies of
   Thatcherism, and booed him off the stage. I declined to renew my
   membership to the BSA for about ten years after this episode. I only
   rejoined when I became a department chair and it was important to be
   engaged with the professional association, whatever my personal views.
   John Johnson's paper reminds us of Douglas's important and challenging
   legacy of ideas, and of the support and inspiration that he gave to a
   whole generation of outstanding scholars.Robert DingwallJack Douglas
   published 26 books and many articles between 1967 and 1989, and by his
   intellectual charisma influenced a productive cohort of young scholars
   who have produced over 70 books and 700 articles and chapters since the
   1970s. He combined phenomenology, existentialism, and naturalistic field
   work to create an approach he termed Existential Sociology, also the
   title of a 1977 anthology. His thinking has undergone significant
   changes during the course of a long intellectual career. Following his
   1992 retirement, the development of the internet and new technologies of
   communication afforded Jack a second life with a transdisciplinary
   intellectual community outside of the university environment. This paper
   briefly summarizes a small part of his life and intellectual project.

AB Objective-To determine whether genetic ancestry was associated with
   subclinical atherosclerosis measures after adjustment for traditional
   cardiovascular disease risk factors, inflammatory marker, socioeconomic
   status, and psychosocial factors in a large admixed African American
   population.
   Approach and Results-Participants were drawn from the Jackson Heart
   Study. Participant's percent of European ancestry (PEA) was estimated
   based on 1747 genetic markers using HAPMIX. Association of PEA with
   peripheral arterial disease and common carotid intima-media thickness
   were investigated among 2168 participants and with coronary artery
   calcification >0 and abdominal aortic calcification >0 among 1139
   participants. The associations were evaluated using multivariable
   regression models. Our results showed that a 1 SD increase in PEA was
   associated with a lower peripheral arterial disease prevalence after
   adjusting for age and sex (prevalence ratio=0.90 [95% CI, 0.82-0.99];
   P=0.036). Adjustments for traditional cardiovascular disease risk
   factors, socioeconomic status, and psychosocial factors attenuated this
   association (prevalence ratio=0.91 [0.82-1.00]; P=0.046). There was also
   a nonlinear association between PEA and coronary artery calcification
   and abdominal aortic calcification. The lowest PEA was associated with a
   lower coronary artery calcification (prevalence ratio=0.75 [0.58-0.96];
   P=0.022) and a lower abdominal aortic calcification [prevalence
   ratio=0.80 [0.67-0.96]; P=0.016) compared with the reference group
   (10th-90th percentile) after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular
   disease risk factors, inflammatory marker, socioeconomic status, and
   psychosocial factors. However, we found no significant association
   between PEA and common carotid intima-media thickness.
   Conclusions-Overall, our findings indicate that genetic ancestry was
   associated with subclinical atherosclerosis, suggesting unmeasured risk
   factors and interactions with genetic factors might contribute to the
   distribution of subclinical atherosclerosis among African Americans.

AB Objective: Functional impairments are debilitating concomitants of
   psychotic disorders and are present early in the illness course and,
   commonly, prior to psychosis onset. The factors affecting social and
   role functioning in early psychosis (EP) following treatment are
   unclear. We evaluated whether six months of participation in the PREPR,
   Boston, EP treatment program, part of a public-academic community mental
   health center, was related to improvements in social and role
   functioning and whether premorbid adjustment in adolescence, baseline
   neurocognition, and depression symptoms predicted functional
   improvement.
   Method: The Global Functioning Social and Role scales, MATRICS
   neurocognitive battery, and Calgary Depression Scale were assessed at
   baseline and six months during naturalistic treatment, while premorbid
   adjustment was measured at baseline. All participants were psychotic
   disorder patients in PREPR (n = 46 with social functioning and 47 with
   role functioning measures at both time points).
   Results: Large improvements were observed in role functioning (d = 0.84)
   and medium to large improvements were observed in social functioning (d
   = 0.70). Models consisting of adolescent premorbid adjustment and change
   in depression symptoms predicted social and role functioning change,
   whereas neuropsychological functioning did not.
   Conclusions: Substantial improvements in social and role functioning
   were observed among this sample participating in a recovery-based EP
   program. The impact of clinical factors on social and role functioning
   was highlighted. Further studies of premorbid adjustment in adolescence
   and the treatment of depression in EP programs in controlled treatment
   trials are needed to confirm these findings.

AB I present a multi-impact economic valuation framework called the Social
   Cost of Atmospheric Release (SCAR) that extends the Social Cost of
   Carbon (SCC) used previously for carbon dioxide (CO2) to a broader range
   of pollutants and impacts. Values consistently incorporate health
   impacts of air quality along with climate damages. The latter include
   damages associated with aerosol-induced hydrologic cycle changes that
   lead to net climate benefits when reducing cooling aerosols. Evaluating
   a 1 % reduction in current global emissions, benefits with a high
   discount rate are greatest for reductions of co-emitted products of
   incomplete combustion (PIC), followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen
   oxides (NOx) and then CO2, ammonia and methane. With a low discount
   rate, benefits are greatest for PIC, with CO2 and SO2 next, followed by
   NOx and methane. These results suggest that efforts to mitigate
   atmosphere-related environmental damages should target a broad set of
   emissions including CO2, methane and aerosol/ozone precursors.
   Illustrative calculations indicate environmental damages are $330-970
   billion yr(-1) for current US electricity generation (14-34A cent per
   kWh for coal, 4-18A cent for gas) and $3.80 (-1.80/+2.10) per gallon of
   gasoline ($4.80 (-3.10/+3.50) per gallon for diesel). These results
   suggest that total atmosphere-related environmental damages plus
   generation costs are much greater for coal-fired power than other types
   of electricity generation, and that damages associated with gasoline
   vehicles substantially exceed those for electric vehicles.

AB It is likely that speech-language pathologists (SLPs) will be called
   upon to serve the growing numbers of children under age 5 from Latino
   families. Families are considered central to implementing language
   facilitation strategies at this age. These strategies must be both
   culturally informed and also focus on naturally occurring experiences in
   children's homes. However, few existing early intervention programs are
   specific to the cultural values and language learning experiences of
   young Latino children. This article reviews the current knowledge base
   on the early language learning experiences of these children and
   provides SLPs implementing family programs with suggestions on adapting
   family-centered language facilitation techniques to this population.

AB Noise is widely regarded as a residual categorythe unexplained variance
   in a linear model or the random disturbance of a predictable pattern.
   Accordingly, formal models often impose the simplifying assumption that
   the world is noise-free and social dynamics are deterministic. Where
   noise is assigned causal importance, it is often assumed to be a source
   of inefficiency, unpredictability, or heterogeneity. We review recent
   sociological studies that are noteworthy for demonstrating the
   theoretical importance of noise for understanding the dynamics of a
   complex system. Contrary to widely held assumptions, these studies
   identify conditions in which noise can increase efficiency and
   predictability and reduce diversity. We conclude with a methodological
   warning that deterministic assumptions are not an innocent
   simplification.

AB Background To measure the explanatory role of behavioural factors to
   educational and income disparities in mortality among US adults (ages
   25+).
   Methods Data were from four waves of the American Changing Lives Study
   (N=3617). There were 1832 deaths between 1986 and 2011. Smoking,
   physical activity, alcohol and body mass index were examined.
   Results Those with 0-11 years of schooling had an 88% (95% CI 48% to
   139%) increased risk of dying compared to those with 16+ years of
   schooling. Behavioural factors explained 41% (95% CI 26% to 55%) and 50%
   (95% CI 30% to 70%) of this excess in models that treated behavioural
   factors as fixed (single point in time) and time varying (repeated),
   respectively. The lowest income group (bottom 20th centile) had a 209%
   (95% CI 172% to 256%) increased risk of dying relative to the highest
   income group (top 40th centile). Behavioural factors explained 24%
   (fixed, 95% CI 13% to 35%) and 39% (repeated, 95% CI 22% to 56%) of this
   difference. Analyses of deaths by causes indicated that behavioural
   factors were more consequential to disparities in cardiovascular
   mortality, explaining up to 83% of educational differences, compared to
   cancer and other death causes.
   Conclusions Behavioural factors are one of a number of factors which
   explain socioeconomic mortality disparities, but their estimated
   explanatory role depends on a number of parameters including the
   socioeconomic status measure examined, the cause of death and age. In
   this nationally representative sample, findings based on repeated
   measures did not warrant a re-evaluation of earlier estimates.

AB This article investigated the complex interplay of choice, socioeconomic
   structural factors, and empowerment influencing engagement in sex work.
   The analysis was focused on pathways into and reasons for staying in sex
   work from in-depth qualitative interviews with participants (n = 37)
   recruited from the Durbar community-led structural intervention in
   Kolkata, India. Kabeer's theory of empowerment focused on resources,
   agency, and achievements was utilized to interpret the results. Results
   identified that contexts of disempowerment constraining resources and
   agency set the stage for initiating sex work, typically due to familial
   poverty, loss of a father or husband as a breadwinner, and lack of
   economic opportunities for women in India. Labor force participation in
   informal sectors was common, specifically in domestic, construction, and
   manufacturing work, but was typically insufficient to provide for
   families and also often contingent on sexual favors. The availability of
   an urban market for sex work served as a catalyst or resource, in
   conjunction with Durbar's programmatic resources, for women to find and
   exercise agency and achieve financial and personal autonomy not possible
   in other work or as dependents on male partners. Resources lost in
   becoming a sex worker due to stigma, discrimination, and rejection by
   family and communities were compensated for by achievements in gaining
   financial and social resources, personal autonomy and independence, and
   the ability to support children and extended family. Durbar's programs
   and activities (e.g., savings and lending cooperative, community
   mobilization, advocacy) function as empowering resources that are
   tightly linked to sex workers' agency, achievements, and sex work
   pathways.

AB Urban streams have been found to have high exports of dissolved organic
   carbon (DOC) relative to native land use. While wastewater effluent is
   considered to be a contributor of carbon to streams, it does not wholly
   account for high concentrations of DOC above which would be expected
   from the watershed under native vegetation. This study examined
   biodegradable DOC (BDOC) in urban and remnant soils in order to
   understand the influence of urbanization on microbial carbon cycling.
   Average soil BDOC ranged from 24.4 +/- 32.7% in a city parks under
   mixed, warm-season turfgrass to 52.9 +/- 38.4% in remnant forests under
   senesced mixed forest leaf litter. Highest average soil %BDOC was
   observed in the soils of multi-family homes (61.4 +/- 7.7%), which
   tended to have more weeds and species diversity and were not exposed to
   sodic irrigation water. Water extractable soil sodium explained 53% of
   the variability in %BDOC. Urban soils in the study area are generally
   irrigated using municipal tap water, which is high in sodium. This may
   lead to a buildup of sodium in the soil, and the noted reduction in
   %BDOC resulting in a greater availability of DOC for runoff to surface
   waters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Background
   Men who have sex with men (MSM) are more likely to be living with HIV
   than other adult men in low- and middle-income countries. MSM experience
   barriers to accessing HIV services including a lack of available
   specialized care, and community-level stigma and discrimination. This
   study aims to examine the uptake of HIV services at non-governmental and
   community- based organizations (NGOs/CBOs) to identify ways to improve
   coverage of HIV prevention and treatment among MSM.
   Methods
   An Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) survey was
   conducted in Yaounde and Douala, Cameroon in 2011 using the respondent
   driven sampling (RDS) method to recruit and interview 239 MSM in Yaounde
   and 272 MSM in Douala.
   Results
   MSM in Yaounde were statistically significantly more likely to have
   accessed NGO/CBO services or been reached by an outreach worker in the
   past 12 months if they had any STI symptoms (aOR 2.17 CI 1.02-4.59.
   p=0.04), or if they had a larger MSM social network (aOR 1.02 CI
   1.01-1.04. p<0.01). MSM in Douala were more likely to have accessed
   NGO/CBO services or been reached by an outreach worker in the past 12
   months if they were living with HIV (aOR 3.60 CI 1.35-9.60. p=0.01), or
   if they reported higher numbers of male sexual partners (aOR 1.17 CI
   1.00-1.36. p=0.046). Compared to men in Douala, MSM in Yaounde were
   significantly less likely to have accessed NGO/CBO services or been
   reached by an outreach worker in the past 12 months ( aOR 0.22 CI
   0.14-0.34. p=<0.01).
   Conclusions
   With appropriate funding and resources, community-based organizations
   that provide care specifically for MSM can improve access to HIV
   prevention, treatment, and care services. Additionally, using social
   networks to reach MSM can connect greater numbers of the population to
   effective HIV interventions, which will improve health outcomes and
   decrease onward transmission of HIV.

AB Background
   Homelessness, HIV, and substance use are interwoven problems.
   Furthermore, homeless individuals are frequent users of emergency
   services. The main purpose of this study was to identify risk factors
   for frequent emergency room (ER) visits and to examine the effects of
   housing status and HIV serostatus on ER utilization. The second purpose
   was to identify risk factors for frequent ER visits in patients with a
   history of illicit drug use.
   Methods
   A retrospective analysis was performed on 412 patients enrolled in a
   Boston-based health care for the homeless program (HCH). This study
   population was selected as a 2: 1 HIV seronegative versus HIV
   seropositive match based on age, sex, and housing status. A subgroup
   analysis was performed on 287 patients with history of illicit drug use.
   Chart data were analyzed to compare demographics, health
   characteristics, and health service utilization.
   Results
   were stratified by housing status. Logistic models using generalized
   estimating equations were used to predict frequent ER visits. Results In
   homeless patients, hepatitis C was the only predictor of frequent ER
   visits (OR 4.49, p<0.01). HIV seropositivity was not predictive of
   frequent ER visits. In patients with history of illicit drug use, mental
   health (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.07-5.95) and hepatitis C (OR 2.85, 95% CI
   1.37-5.93) were predictors of frequent ER use. HIV seropositivity did
   not predict ER use (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21 -0.97).
   Conclusions
   In a HCH population, hepatitis C predicted frequent ER visits in
   homeless patients. HIV seropositivity did not predict frequent ER
   visits, likely because HIV seropositive HCH patients are engaged in
   care. In patients with history of illicit drug use, hepatitis C and
   mental health disorders predicted frequent ER visits. Supportive housing
   for patients with mental health disorders and hepatitis C may help
   prevent unnecessary ER visits in this population.

AB The hypothesis of neighborhood stigma predicts that individuals who
   reside in areas known for high crime, poverty, disorder, and/or racial
   isolation embody the negative characteristics attributed to their
   communities and experience suspicion and mistrust in their interactions
   with strangers. This article provides an experimental test of whether
   neighborhood stigma affects individuals in one domain of social life:
   economic transactions. To evaluate the neighborhood stigma hypothesis,
   this study adopts an audit design in a locally organized, online
   classified market, using advertisements for used iPhones and randomly
   manipulating the neighborhood of the seller. The primary outcome under
   study is the number of responses generated by sellers from disadvantaged
   relative to advantaged neighborhoods. Advertisements from disadvantaged
   neighborhoods received significantly fewer responses than advertisements
   from advantaged neighborhoods. Results provide robust evidence that
   individuals from disadvantaged neighborhoods bear a stigma that
   influences their prospects in economic exchanges. The stigma is greater
   for advertisements originating from disadvantaged neighborhoods where
   the majority of residents are black. This evidence reveals that
   residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood not only affects individuals
   through mechanisms involving economic resources, institutional quality,
   and social networks but also affects residents through the perceptions
   of others.

AB In order to scientifically study the human brain's response to
   face-to-face social interaction, the scientific method itself needs to
   be reconsidered so that both quantitative observation and symbolic
   reasoning can be adapted to the situation where the observer is also
   observed. In light of the recent development of dyadic fMRI which can
   directly observe dyadic brain interacting in one MRI scanner, this paper
   aims to establish a new form of logic, dual logic, which provides a
   theoretical platform for deductive reasoning in a complementary dual
   system with emergence mechanism. Applying the dual logic in the dfMRI
   experimental design and data analysis, the exogenous and endogenous dual
   systems in the BOLD responses can be identified; the non-reciprocal
   responses in the dual system can be suppressed; a cerebral coordinate
   for reciprocal interaction can be generated. Elucidated by dual logic
   deductions, the cerebral coordinate for reciprocal interaction suggests:
   the exogenous and endogenous systems consist of the empathy network and
   the mentalization network respectively; the default-mode network emerges
   from the resting state to activation in the endogenous system during
   reciprocal interaction; the cingulate plays an essential role in the
   emergence from the exogenous system to the endogenous system. Overall,
   the dual logic deductions are supported by the dfMRI experimental
   results and are consistent with current literature. Both the theoretical
   framework and experimental method set the stage to formally apply the
   scientific method in studying complex social interaction.

AB Background:Social service interventions have been implemented in many
   countries to help people living with HIV (PLHIV) and household members
   cope with economic burden as a result of reduced earning or increased
   spending on health care. However, the evidence for specific
   interventionseconomic strengthening and legal serviceson key health
   outcomes has not been appraised.Methods:We searched electronic databases
   from January 1995 to May 2014 and reviewed relevant literature from
   resource-limited settings on the impact of social service interventions
   on mortality, morbidity, retention in HIV care, quality of life, and
   ongoing HIV transmission and their cost-effectiveness.Results:Of 1685
   citations, 8 articles reported the health impact of economic
   strengthening interventions among PLHIV in resource-limited settings.
   None reported on legal services. Six of the 8 studies were conducted in
   sub-Saharan Africa: 1 reported on all 5 outcomes and 2 reported on 4 and
   2 outcomes, respectively. The remaining 5 reported on 1 outcome each.
   Seven studies reported on quality of life. Although all studies reported
   some association between economic strengthening interventions and HIV
   care outcomes, the quality of evidence was rated fair or poor because
   studies were of low research rigor (observational or qualitative), had
   small sample size, or had other limitations. The expected impact of
   economic strengthening interventions was rated as high for quality of
   life but uncertain for all the other outcomes.Conclusions:Implementation
   of economic strengthening interventions is expected to have a high
   impact on the quality of life for PLHIV but uncertain impact on
   mortality, morbidity, retention in care, and HIV transmission. More
   rigorous research is needed to explore the impact of more targeted
   intervention components on health outcomes.

AB Background
   The U.S. foreclosure crisis intensified markedly during the Great
   Recession of 2007-09, and currently an estimated five percent of U.S.
   residential properties are more than 90 days past due or in the process
   of foreclosure. Yet there has been no systematic assessment of the
   effects of foreclosure on health and mental health.
   Methods and Findings
   I applied systematic search terms to PubMed and PsycINFO to identify
   quantitative or qualitative studies about the relationship between home
   foreclosure and health or mental health. After screening the titles and
   abstracts of 930 publications and reviewing the full text of 76
   articles, dissertations, and other reports, I identified 42 publications
   representing 35 unique studies about foreclosure, health, and mental
   health. The majority of studies (32 [91%]) concluded that foreclosure
   had adverse effects on health or mental health, while three studies
   yielded null or mixed findings. Only two studies examined the extent to
   which foreclosure may have disproportionate impacts on ethnic or racial
   minority populations.
   Conclusions
   Home foreclosure adversely affects health and mental health through
   channels operating at multiple levels: at the individual level, the
   stress of personally experiencing foreclosure was associated with
   worsened mental health and adverse health behaviors, which were in turn
   linked to poorer health status; at the community level, increasing
   degradation of the neighborhood environment had indirect, cross-level
   adverse effects on health and mental health. Early intervention may be
   able to prevent acute economic shocks from eventually developing into
   the chronic stress of foreclosure, with all of the attendant benefits
   this implies for health and mental health status. Programs designed to
   encourage early return of foreclosed properties back into productive use
   may have similar health and mental health benefits.

AB Cooperative behavior, which pervades nature, can be significantly
   enhanced when agents interact in a structured rather than random way;
   however, the key structural factors that affect cooperation are not well
   understood. Moreover, the role structure plays with cooperation has
   largely been studied through observing overall cooperation rather than
   the underlying components that together shape cooperative behavior. In
   this paper we address these two problems by first applying evolutionary
   games to a wide range of networks, where agents play the Prisoner's
   Dilemma with a three-component stochastic strategy, and then analyzing
   agent-based simulation results using principal component analysis. With
   these methods we study the evolution of trust, reciprocity and
   forgiveness as a function of several structural parameters. This work
   demonstrates that community structure, represented by network
   modularity, among all the tested structural parameters, has the most
   significant impact on the emergence of cooperative behavior, with
   forgiveness showing the largest sensitivity to community structure. We
   also show that increased community structure reduces the dispersion of
   trust and forgiveness, thereby reducing the network-level uncertainties
   for these two components; graph transitivity and degree also
   significantly influence the evolutionary dynamics of the population and
   the diversity of strategies at equilibrium.

AB Studies using massive, passively collected data from communication
   technologies have revealed many ubiquitous aspects of social networks,
   helping us understand and model social media, information diffusion and
   organizational dynamics. More recently, these data have come tagged with
   geographical information, enabling studies of human mobility patterns
   and the science of cities. We combine these two pursuits and uncover
   reproducible mobility patterns among social contacts. First, we
   introduce measures of mobility similarity and predictability and measure
   them for populations of users in three large urban areas. We find
   individuals' visitations patterns are far more similar to and
   predictable by social contacts than strangers and that these measures
   are positively correlated with tie strength. Unsupervised clustering of
   hourly variations in mobility similarity identifies three categories of
   social ties and suggests geography is an important feature to
   contextualize social relationships. We find that the composition of a
   user's ego network in terms of the type of contacts they keep is
   correlated with mobility behaviour. Finally, we extend a popular
   mobility model to include movement choices based on social contacts and
   compare its ability to reproduce empirical measurements with two
   additional models of mobility.

AB Many intrinsically related determinants of health and disease exist,
   including social and economic status, education, employment, housing,
   and physical and environmental exposures. These factors interact to
   cumulatively affect health and disease burden of individuals and
   populations, and to establish health inequities and disparities across
   and within countries. Biomedical models of health care decrease adverse
   consequences of disease, but are not enough to effectively improve
   individual and population health and advance health equity. Social
   determinants of health are especially important in Latin American
   countries, which are characterised by adverse colonial legacies,
   tremendous social injustice, huge socioeconomic disparities, and wide
   health inequities. Poverty and inequality worsened substantially in the
   1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s in these countries. Many Latin American
   countries have introduced public policies that integrate health, social,
   and economic actions, and have sought to develop health systems that
   incorporate multisectoral interventions when introducing universal
   health coverage to improve health and its upstream determinants. We
   present case studies from four Latin American countries to show the
   design and implementation of health programmes underpinned by
   intersectoral action and social participation that have reached national
   scale to effectively address social determinants of health, improve
   health outcomes, and reduce health inequities. Investment in managerial
   and political capacity, strong political and managerial commitment, and
   state programmes, not just time-limited government actions, have been
   crucial in underpinning the success of these policies.

   to illuminate, respectively: the market-making work performed by LIBOR;
   its role in enabling the transfer of financial risk, most notably when
   fraudulently manipulated; and the nature of the regulatory prosecution
   of such manipulation.

AB Social network analysis is a burgeoning field of sociology, but it has
   only recently been adopted by social historians. This article provides
   an overview of the promise of social network analysis for social
   history, as well as a critical discussion of what the method does and
   does not provide. It focuses especially on the problem of "whole
   network" analysis and sketches questions that social network analysis
   can help answer in the past. The author then offers a reflection on his
   own experience using the method and shows what it provided in the study
   of a French-Indian community in the colonial Mississippi Valley.

AB Sociology is the study of society. However, not all aspects of society
   get the same scholarly attention by academics. Throughout my research
   program, I have highlighted some of the lesser-covered areas of society,
   like feminine leisure seen in activities such as quilting, knitting, and
   membership in the Red Hat Society. In this article, I discuss how the
   development of sociology as a discipline has focused on public matters
   in society like the economy, leaving non-economic or private activities
   with less attention. My research on women's feminine leisure from a
   third-wave feminism perspective importantly addresses a gap in the
   discipline.

AB The literature on participatory practices in organizations has been less
   coherent and more limited to subspecialties than the literature on
   bureaucracy in organizations - despite a number of celebrated studies of
   participation in 20th century American sociology. Due to the practical
   nature of participatory reforms and the ambiguity of participation as a
   concept, attempts to review participatory knowledge have a tendency to
   focus on refining definitions and clarifying frameworks within
   subfields. This article instead provides a broad thematic overview of
   three different types of research on participation in organizations, all
   critical to an understanding of today's dramatic expansion of
   participatory practices across a variety of organizations. Classic
   research studied participation as dynamic and central to organizational
   legitimacy. Institutional design research has focused on participation
   as a stand-alone governance reform with promising empowerment potential,
   but mixed results in domains such as health care, environmental
   politics, and urban planning. Finally, recent research seeks to place
   participatory practices in the context of shifting relationships between
   authority, voice, and inequality in the contemporary era. The article
   concludes with suggestions for building on all three categories of
   research by exploring what is old and new in the 21st century's changing
   participatory landscape.

AB Objectives. We studied simulated interventions that leveraged social
   networks to increase physical activity in children.
   Methods. We studied a real-world social network of 81 children (average
   age = 7.96 years) who lived in low socioeconomic status neighborhoods,
   and attended public schools and 1 of 2 structured afterschool programs.
   The sample was ethnically diverse, and 44% were overweight or obese. We
   used social network analysis and agent-based modeling simulations to
   test whether implementing a network intervention would increase
   children's physical activity. We tested 3 intervention strategies.
   Results. The intervention that targeted opinion leaders was effective in
   increasing the average level of physical activity across the entire
   network. However, the intervention that targeted the most sedentary
   children was the best at increasing their physical activity levels.
   Conclusions. Which network intervention to implement depends on whether
   the goal is to shift the entire distribution of physical activity or to
   influence those most adversely affected by low physical activity.
   Agent-based modeling could be an important complement to traditional
   project planning tools, analogous to sample size and power analyses, to
   help researchers design more effective interventions for increasing
   children's physical activity.

AB Objectives. We investigated the role of socioeconomic factors in
   Black-White disparities in preterm birth (PTB).
   Methods. We used the population-based California Maternal and Infant
   Health Assessment survey and birth certificate data on 10 400 US-born
   Black and White California residents who gave birth during 2003 to 2010
   to examine rates and relative likelihoods of PTB among Black versus
   White women, with adjustment for multiple socioeconomic factors and
   covariables.
   Results. Greater socioeconomic advantage was generally associated with
   lower PTB rates among White but not Black women. There were no
   significant Black-White disparities within the most socioeconomically
   disadvantaged subgroups; Black-White disparities were seen only within
   more advantaged subgroups.
   Conclusions. Socioeconomic factors play an important but complex role in
   PTB disparities. The absence of Black-White disparities in PTB within
   certain socioeconomic subgroups, alongside substantial disparities
   within others, suggests that social factors moderate the disparity.
   Further research should explore social factors suggested by the
   literature-including life course socioeconomic experiences and
   racism-related stress, and the biological pathways through which they
   operate-as potential contributors to PTB among Black and White women
   with different levels of social advantage.

AB Objectives. We examined 5 health outcomes among Black children born to
   US-born and foreign-born mothers and whether differences by mother's
   region of birth could be explained by maternal duration of US residence,
   child's place of birth, and familial sociodemographic characteristics.
   Methods. Data were from the 2000-2011 National Health Interview Surveys.
   We examined 3 groups of children, based on mother's region of birth: US
   origin, African origin, and Latin American or Caribbean origin. We
   estimated multivariate regression models.
   Results. Children of foreign-born mothers were healthier across all 5
   outcomes than were children of US-born mothers. Among children of
   foreign-born mothers, US-born children performed worse on all health
   outcomes than children born abroad. African-origin children had the most
   favorable health profile. Longer duration of US residence among
   foreign-born mothers was associated with poorer child health. Maternal
   educational attainment and other sociodemographic characteristics did
   little to explain these differences.
   Conclusions. Further studies are needed to understand the role of
   selective migration and the behavioral, cultural, socioeconomic, and
   contextual origins of the health advantage of Black children of
   foreign-born mothers.

AB Objectives. We investigated the impact of reported racism on the mental
   health of African Americans at cross-sectional time points and
   longitudinally, over the course of 1 year.
   Methods. The Black Linking Inequality, Feelings, and the Environment
   (LIFE) Study recruited Black residents (n = 144) from a probability
   sample of 2 predominantly Black New York City neighborhoods during
   December 2011 to June 2013. Respondents completed self-report surveys,
   including multiple measures of racism. We conducted assessments at
   baseline, 2-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up. Weighted multivariate
   linear regression models assessed changes in racism and health over
   time.
   Results. Cross-sectional results varied by time point and by outcome,
   with only some measures associated with distress, and effects were
   stronger for poor mental health days than for depression. Individuals
   who denied thinking about their race fared worst. Longitudinally,
   increasing frequencies of racism predicted worse mental health across
   all 3 outcomes.
   Conclusions. These results support theories of racism as a
   health-defeating stressor and are among the few that show temporal
   associations with health.

AB Objectives. We evaluated the association between intimate partner
   violence and the mental and physical health status of US Caribbean Black
   and African American women.
   Methods. We used 2001 to 2003 cross-sectional data from the National
   Survey of American Life-the most detailed study to date of physical and
   mental health disorders of Americans of African descent. We assessed
   participants' health conditions by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual
   of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (Washington, DC; American
   Psychological Association) Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
   Results. We found differences in health conditions between abused
   African American and Caribbean Black women. There were increased risks
   for lifetime dysthymia, alcohol dependence, drug abuse, and poor
   perceived health for African American victims of partner abuse, and
   binge eating disorder was associated with partner violence among
   Caribbean Black women.
   Conclusions. Severe intimate partner violence was associated with
   negative mental and physical health outcomes for US Black women, with
   different patterns between African American and Caribbean Blacks.
   Understanding intimate partner violence experiences of US Black women
   requires recognition of key intragroup differences, including nativity
   and immigrant status, and their differential relationships to women's
   health.

AB Objectives. Although schools and neighborhoods influence health, little
   is known about their relative importance, or the influence of one
   context after the influence of the other has been taken into account. We
   simultaneously examined the influence of each setting on depression
   among adolescents.
   Methods. Analyzing data from wave 1 (1994-1995) of the National
   Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we used cross-classified
   multilevel modeling to examine between-level variation and individual-,
   school-, and neighborhood-level predictors of adolescent depressive
   symptoms. Also, we compared the results of our cross-classified
   multilevel models (CCMMs) with those of a multilevel model wherein
   either school or neighborhood was excluded.
   Results. In CCMMs, the school-level random effect was significant and
   more than 3 times the neighborhood-level random effect, even after
   individual-level characteristics had been taken into account.
   Individual-level indicators (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status)
   were associated with depressive symptoms, but there was no association
   with either school-or neighborhood-level fixed effects. The
   between-level variance in depressive symptoms was driven largely by
   schools as opposed to neighborhoods.
   Conclusions. Schools appear to be more salient than neighborhoods in
   explaining variation in depressive symptoms. Future work incorporating
   cross-classified multilevel modeling is needed to understand the
   relative effects of schools and neighborhoods.

AB Objectives. We examined whether transnational ties, social ties, and
   neighborhood ties were independently associated with current smoking
   status among Latino immigrants. We also tested interactions to determine
   whether these associations were moderated by gender.
   Methods. We conducted a series of weighted logistic regression analyses
   (i.e., economic remittances, number of return visits, friend support,
   family support, and neighborhood cohesion) using the Latino immigrant
   subsample (n = 1629) of the National Latino and Asian American Study in
   2002 and 2003.
   Results. The number of past-year return visits to the country-of-origin
   was positively associated with current smoker status. Gender moderated
   the association between economic remittances, friend support, and
   smoking. Remittance behavior had a protective association with smoking,
   and this association was particularly pronounced for Latino immigrant
   women. Friendship support lowered the odds of smoking among men, but not
   women.
   Conclusions. Our results underscore the growing importance of
   transnational networks for understanding Latino immigrant health and the
   gendered patterns of the associations between social ties, transnational
   ties, and health risk behaviors.

AB Objectives. I tested a social marketing intervention delivered in health
   department waiting rooms via digital signage technology for increasing
   radon program participation among priority groups.
   Methods. I conducted a tri-county, community-based study over a 3-year
   period (2010-2013) in a high-radon state by using a quasi-experimental
   design. We collected survey data for eligible participants at the time
   of radon test kit purchase.
   Results. Radon program participation increased at the intervention site
   (t(38) = 3.74; P = .001; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.8, 16.0) with
   an increase in renters (chi(2)(1,228) = 4.3; P = .039), Special

   families (chi(2)(1,166) = 3.13; P = .077) and first-time testers
   (chi(2)(1,228) = 10.93; P = .001). Approximately one third (30.3%; n =
   30) attributed participation in the radon program to viewing the
   intervention message. The intervention crossover was also successful
   with increased monthly kit sales (t(37) = 2.69; P = .01; 95% CI = 1.20,
   8.47) and increased households participating (t(23) = 4.76; P < .001;
   95% CI = 3.10, 7.88).
   Conclusions. A social marketing message was an effective
   population-based intervention for increasing radon program
   participation. The results prompted policy changes for Montana radon
   programming and adoption of digital signage technology by 2 health
   departments.

AB Money has meaning that shapes its uses and social significance,

   welfare, and the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). This study, based on
   in-depth interviews with 115 low-wage EITC recipients, reveals the EITC
   is an unusual type of government transfer. Recipients of the EITC say
   they value the debt relief this government benefit brings. However, they
   also perceive it as a just reward for work, which legitimizes a
   temporary increase in consumption. Furthermore, unlike other
   means-tested government transfers, the credit is seen as a springboard
   for upward mobility. Thus, by conferring dignity and spurring dreams,
   the EITC enhances feelings of citizenship and social inclusion.

AB Political opportunity theory has proven extremely generative,
   highlighting the importance of macro-structural shifts in making
   established authorities vulnerable to insurgent challenge. But as
   critics point out, political opportunity theory flattens both culture
   and agency, and has fared poorly in explaining the timing of insurgency.
   Re-theorizing opportunity as leveraged by particular practices, rather
   than independently conferring to groups, redresses these limits,
   revealing the proximate causes of mobilization and influence. For a
   strategic test, this article revisits the forging ground of opportunity
   theory. Why did President Harry S. Truman, initially an apologist for
   the slow pace of racial reform in 1945-46, suddenly become an avid
   advocate of civil rights? Opportunity scholars argue that
   macro-structural forces caused Truman to advocate civil rights,
   generating the opportunity for insurgency by blacks as a group. But
   event structure analysis reveals how Black Anti-colonialist practices
   leveraged opportunities afforded by the earlier Progressive Challenge to
   compel Truman to adopt civil rights advocacy. Civil rights advocacy, in
   turn, allowed Truman to repress Black Anti-colonialist practices, even
   while setting the stage for the Civil Rights Movement to come. Different
   forms of insurgent practice leveraged opportunities created by different
   institutional cleavages; the same opportunities did not advantage all
   insurgency by a social group.

AB BACKGROUND: A National Spina Bifida Patient Registry (NSBPR) was begun
   in 2009 to help understand the natural history of spina bifida (SB) and
   the effects of treatments provided by SB clinics. We used the NSBPR to
   explore the relationship of sociodemographic characteristics with SB
   outcomes.
   METHODS: Using NSBPR data collected in 2009 to 2012, we examined the
   unadjusted association between demographic characteristics and 4 SB
   outcomes: bowel continence, bladder continence, mobility, and presence
   of pressure sores. We then developed multivariable logistic models to
   explore these relationships while controlling for SB clinic, SB type,
   and level of lesion.
   RESULTS: Data were available on 2054 patients,22 years of age from 10 SB
   clinics. In the multivariable models, older age groups were more likely
   to have continence and pressure sores and less likely to be community
   ambulatory. Males and patients without private insurance were less
   likely to be continent and community ambulatory. Non-Hispanic blacks
   were less likely to be continent. Level of lesion was associated with
   all outcomes; SB type was associated with all but pressure sores; and
   all outcomes except community ambulation showed significant variation
   across clinic sites.
   CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic attributes are associated with SB
   outcomes. In particular, males, non-Hispanic blacks, and patients
   without private insurance have less favorable outcomes, and age has an
   impact as well. These characteristics need to be considered by
   clinicians who care for this patient population and factored into
   case-mix adjustment when evaluating variation in clinical and functional
   outcomes among different SB clinics.

   Results: The majority of participants reported taking a class/course on
   diabetes mellitus management and having checked their blood glucose
   levels at least once per day. The majority (61.26%) of the participants
   did not have good self-management skills, based on the education and
   blood glucose-monitoring criteria established for this study.
   Participants with poor HRQoL had significantly increased odds of good
   diabetes mellitus self-care practices.
   Conclusions: Individuals with poor HRQoL had significantly increased
   odds of good diabetes mellitus self-care practices. Although findings on
   race, education, and income were not statistically significant, they
   were consistent with previous research. In the future, individuals who
   are nonwhite, have less than a high school level of education, and have
   no health insurance should be targeted to improve diabetes mellitus
   self-care practices through educational and informational materials.
   Further investigation using more comprehensive measures of diabetes
   mellitus self-care is warranted.

AB This article uses a set of case histories to describe the physical and
   social terrain of violence in Cite Soleil, Haiti, before and after the
   January 2010 earthquake. Employing empirical data, it aims to
   interrogate our standard categorization and analysis of violence and of
   community responses to violence. The study is guided by the practical
   questions of how individuals and groups navigate and respond to the
   ever-changing configurations of violence in their neighborhoods. This
   violence is considered both as specific to Haiti in its details and as
   an exemplar of a general problem that afflicts nations that are marginal
   to, and marginalized by, current processes of globalization.

AB Demographic effects on cultural complexity are controversial. Some view
   the arguments for cultural drift and similar mechanisms as overstating
   the importance of difficulty in learning, socially or individually.
   Others stress that social learning is vital, and larger social groups
   with active cultural transmission yield greater cultural complexity.
   Using ethnographic data collected among women weavers in the South
   Pacific, I advance the debate by estimating learning parameters directly
   relevant to a theoretical model of the evolution of cultural complexity.
   Through a sensitivity analysis of the estimated model, I show potential
   learning effects on the production rate of a prestigious cultural good.
   I advocate further ethnographic work to understand the learning process
   in naturalistic contexts, as vital to advancing our knowledge of the
   origins and persistence (or not) of cultural complexity in past and
   contemporary societies.

AB In this paper, I use the case of financial economics to show how an
   innovative idea can shape a research agenda. I focus on why the
   efficient-market hypothesis, crystallized in Eugene Fama's research,
   acquired core theoretical status in the discipline of financial
   economics, whereas the Capital Asset Pricing Model, championed by, among
   others, Fischer Black, did not. I draw attention both to differences in
   the networks propagating these models, in particular differences in
   cohesion and coherence, and to differences in the methodologies
   underlying the models. I argue that Fama's use of data-dredging
   techniques and frequentist statistics increased the coherence of the
   intellectual circle around him, turning the analysis of efficiency into
   a collective project oriented towards the discovery of objective
   properties. By contrast, Black's adoption of more subjectivist methods
   exacerbated the individualistic tendencies of his approach and his
   network, increasing the incoherence of his research group.

AB The trans-disciplinary New Institutional framework identifies the
   importance of incentive structures in preventing opportunism in market
   making. In recent decades this theoretical tradition has increasingly
   shifted its attention from formal institutions to identify the
   significance of cultural processes in countering uncertainty, bounded
   rationality, and information asymmetries. More specifically the New
   Institutional perspective tends to focus on the formal mechanisms
   producing and reproducing culture, as opposed to an examination of
   specific cultural content. This attention to formal mechanisms means
   that value-rational action and commitments in market making receive
   insufficient attention. In order to examine the problems entailed in
   this trend, the case study of a financial market in which market making
   was constituted by the values of loyalty, duty, and honor of traders is
   used.

AB Ambient particulate matter (PM) exposures have adverse impacts on public
   health, but research evaluating indoor PM concentrations in rural homes
   in the United States using wood as fuel for heating is limited. Our
   objectives were to characterize indoor PM mass and particle number
   concentrations (PNCs), quantify infiltration of outdoor PM into the
   indoor environment, and investigate potential predictors of
   concentrations and infiltration in 96 homes in the northwestern US and
   Alaska using wood stoves as the primary source of heating. During two
   forty-eight hour sampling periods during the pre-intervention winter of
   a randomized trial, we assessed PM mass (< 2.5 mu m) and PNCs
   (particles/cm(3)) in six size fractions (0.30-0.49, 0.50-0.99,
   1.00-2.49, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-10.0, 10.0+ mu m). Daily mean (sd) PM2.5
   concentrations were 28.8 (28.5) mu g/m(3) during the first sampling
   period and 29.1 (30.1) mu g/m(3) during the second period. In repeated
   measures analyses, household income was inversely associated with PM2.5
   and smaller size fraction PNCs, in particular. Time of day was a
   significant predictor of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, and
   infiltration efficiency was relatively low (F-inf (sd)=0.27 (0.20)). Our
   findings demonstrate relatively high mean PM concentrations in these
   wood burning homes and suggest potential targets for interventions for
   improving indoor air quality and health in rural settings. (C) 2015

AB Objective Social relationships play a vital role in health and
   well-being, and it follows that loss experiences can be highly stressful
   for some people. This article reviews what is known about the
   association between marital separation, divorce, and health outcomes.
   Methods Key findings in the area of divorce and health are discussed,
   and the review outlines a series of specific questions for future
   research. In particular, the article integrates research in social
   epidemiology with research in social psychophysiology. The former
   approach provides a broad-based estimate of the association between
   marital status and health outcomes, whereas the latter approach studies
   mechanisms of action and individual differences associated with
   increased risk for poor outcomes.
   Results The experience of separation or divorce confers risk for poor
   health outcomes, including a 23% higher mortality rate. However, most
   people cope well and are resilient after their marriage or long-term
   relationship ends. Despite the fact that resilience is the most common
   response, a small percentage of people (approximately 10%-15%) struggle
   quite substantially, and it seems that the overall elevated adverse
   health risks are driven by the poor functioning of this group. Several
   candidate mechanisms and novel (ambulatory) assessment techniques that
   may elucidate the poor outcomes among people who adapt poorly to
   separation are discussed.
   Conclusions To increase knowledge on the association between divorce and
   health, three primary areas require more research: a) genetic and third
   variable explanations for divorce-related health outcomes, (b) better
   studies of objective social behavior after separation, and (c) increased
   attention to interventions targeting high-risk adults.

AB Objective To assess the relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and
   inflammation during adolescence and determine whether daily affective
   and social experiences across a 15-day period mediate this relation.
   Methods Adolescents (n = 316) completed daily diary reports of positive
   affect, negative affect, and negative social interactions for 15 days
   and provided whole blood spot samples for the assessment of C-reactive
   protein (CRP). Parents provided information on SES, including the
   highest level of education they and their spouses completed and
   household income.
   Results Lower parent education was associated with higher levels of
   adolescent CRP, controlling for age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index
   ( = -.12, p = .031). Mean daily positive affect, negative affect, and
   negative social interactions were examined as potential mediators of
   this association. In these models, parent education was no longer
   associated with adolescent CRP ( = -.09, p = .12), and only positive
   affect was related to CRP ( = -.12, p = .025). Bootstrapping confirmed
   the mediating role of positive affect (indirect effect = -0.015, 95%
   confidence interval = -0.038 to -0.002).
   Conclusions Adolescents with less educated parents tended to have higher
   levels of CRP, which may be explained by their lower levels of positive
   affect. Findings suggest that a lack of positive affect may be a pathway
   by which SES confers early risk for poor health in adulthood. It is
   possible that adolescents who display positive affect during daily life
   in circumstances of relatively adverse socioeconomic circumstances may
   have better health outcomes related to lower inflammatory factors.

AB BackgroundMuch is unknown about the relationship between socioeconomic
   status (SES) and alcohol use, including the means by which SES may
   influence risk for alcohol use.
   MethodsUsing a sample of 672 twin pairs (aged 25 to 74) derived from the
   MacArthur Foundation Survey of Midlife Development in the United States,
   this study examined whether SES, measured by household income and
   educational attainment, moderates genetic and environmental influences
   on 3 indices of alcohol use: amount used, frequency of use, and problem
   use.
   ResultsWe found significant moderation for amount of alcohol used.
   Specifically, genetic effects were greater in low-SES conditions, shared
   environmental effects (i.e., environmental effects that enhance the
   similarity of twins from the same families) tended to increase in
   high-SES conditions, and nonshared environmental effects (i.e.,
   environmental effects that distinguish twins) tended to decrease with
   SES. This pattern of results was found for both income and education,
   and it largely replicated at a second wave of assessment spaced 9years
   after the first. There was virtually no evidence of moderation for
   either frequency of alcohol use or alcohol problems.
   ConclusionsOur findings indicate that genetic and environmental
   influences on drinking amount vary as a function of the broader SES
   context, whereas the etiologies of other drinking phenomena are less
   affected by this context. Efforts to find the causes underlying the
   amount of alcohol used are likely to be more successful if such
   contextual information is taken into account.

AB Objective: Substantial variation exists in autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD) care by race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status; however, the
   role of parent health beliefs in this variation is poorly understood.
   Study goals were to (1) examine variation in parent beliefs about ASD
   prognosis and treatment according to social determinants of health (SDH)
   and (2) assess whether this variation was associated with variable
   health services utilization, among 1420 children with special health
   care needs (CSHCN) having ASD. Methods: We used linked data from the
   2011 Survey of Pathways to Diagnosis and Treatment and the 2009-2010
   National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs. Bivariate
   and multivariate analyses assessed variation in parent beliefs according
   to race/ethnicity, household income, and parent educational attainment.
   Further analyses assessed whether variation in beliefs was associated
   with the use of psychotropic medication, traditional therapy, or
   complementary/alternative therapy for ASD. Results: Parents of lower
   educational attainment or who had lower income were more likely to think
   that their child's condition was a mystery. Near-poor families were less
   likely to believe that they had the power to change the child's
   condition. Parents of minority children were more likely than white
   children to view their child's condition as temporary. However, these
   differences in beliefs only had modest associations with variation in
   use of the health services analyzed. Conclusions: Some SDH-related
   variation exists in health beliefs among parents of children with ASD,
   but these differences may not be the main factors accounting for ASD
   health care disparities.

   approach. Meeting process measures and pre-/postintervention outcome
   measures were collected. Results: Knowledge gains averaged 18.7%
   (standard deviation = 0.04), and 62.0% (standard deviation = 0.13) of
   participants reported making safety or health changes between meetings.
   Workers' well-being improved significantly (life satisfaction, d = 0.65,
   P < 0.05; negative affect, d = 0.64, P < 0.05), and the majority of
   other safety and health outcomes changed in expected directions.
   Conclusions: COMPASS is a feasible intervention model for simultaneously
   preventing injuries and promoting health among home care workers.

AB OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the impact of race, socioeconomic
   status (SES), and health care system characteristics on receipt of
   specific components of National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline
   care for stage IIIC/IV ovarian cancer.
   STUDY DESIGN: Patients diagnosed with stage IIIC/IV epithelial ovarian
   cancer between Jan. 1, 1996, through Dec. 31, 2006, were identified from
   the California Cancer Registry. Multivariate logistic regression
   analyses evaluated differences in surgery, chemotherapy, and treatment
   sequence according to race, increasing SES (SES-1 to SES-5), and
   provider annual case volume.
   RESULTS: A total of 11,865 patients were identified. Median age at
   diagnosis was 65.0 years. The overall median cancer-specific survival
   was 28.2 months. African American race (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95%
   confidence interval [CI], 1.45-2.87) and care by a low-volume physician
   (OR, 19.72; 95% CI, 11.87-32.77) predicted an increased risk of not
   undergoing surgery. Patients with SES-1 (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.85)
   and those treated at low-volume hospitals (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.77-0.99)
   or by low-volume physicians (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92) were less
   likely to undergo debulking surgery. African American race (OR, 1.55;
   95% CI, 1.24-1.93) and SES-1 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.35-2.39) were both
   significant predictors of not receiving chemotherapy. African American
   patients were also more likely than whites to receive no treatment (OR,
   2.08; 95% CI, 1.45-2.99) or only chemotherapy (OR, 1.55; 95% CI,
   1.10-2.18). Patients with low SES were more likely to receive no
   treatment (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.44-2.64) or surgery without chemotherapy
   (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.38-2.03).
   CONCLUSION: Among patients with advanced-stage ovarian cancer, African
   American race, low SES, and treatment by low-volume providers are
   significant and independent predictors of receiving no surgery, no
   debulking surgery, no chemotherapy, and nonstandard treatment sequences.

AB Evidence of social determinants of disease and awareness of the impact
   of these factors on outcomes continues to increase. Social determinants
   include both socioeconomic and lifestyle factors. This review examines
   the interface between socioeconomic status (SES) and lifestyle and their
   effects on melanoma incidence and mortality. Lifestyle factors including
   occupation, occupational exposures, body mass index, marital status,
   smoking, recreational sun exposure and tanning were explored as they
   have a known relationship with melanoma. A remarkable association of SES
   with melanoma incidence and prognosis has been acknowledged worldwide.
   Melanoma incidence is increased in populations of higher SES, especially
   among the highly educated, while lower SES populations present with
   later-stage disease at time of diagnosis and display greater mortality.
   The aforementioned lifestyle factors are also related to SES, and have
   been shown internationally to affect melanoma incidence and mortality.
   This comprehensive systematic review suggests that lifestyle factors
   including occupation, occupational exposure, obesity, recreational sun
   exposure and tanning may explain the relationship between SES and
   melanoma.

   This study aims to investigate the impact of socioeconomic mobility on
   changes in BMI in childhood. Analyses tested whether [1] socioeconomic
   status influences BMI, [2] changes in socioeconomic status impact
   changes in BMI, and [3] timing of socioeconomic status mobility impacts
   BMI.
   Secondary data spanning birth to age 9 were analyzed. SES and BMI were
   investigated with gender, birth weight, maternal race/ethnicity, and
   maternal nativity as covariates. Autoregressive structural equation
   modeling and latent growth modeling were used.
   Socioeconomic status in the first year of life predicted body mass
   index. Child covariates were consistently associated with body mass
   index. Rate of change in socioeconomic status did not predict change in
   body mass index.
   The findings suggest that early socioeconomic status may most influence

   to determine associations between use and arrest. Socioeconomic
   correlates of lifetime and annual use of powder cocaine and of crack
   were delineated using multivariable logistic regression and correlates
   of frequency of recent use were examined using generalized negative
   binomial regression.
   Results: Crack users were at higher risk than powder cocaine users for
   reporting a lifetime arrest or multiple recent arrests. Racial
   minorities were at low risk for powder cocaine use and Hispanics were at
   low risk for crack use. Blacks were at increased risk for lifetime and
   recent crack use, but not when controlling for other socioeconomic
   variables. However, blacks who did use either powder cocaine or crack
   tended to use at higher frequencies. Higher education and higher family
   income were negatively associated with crack use although these factors
   were sometimes risk factors for powder cocaine use.
   Conclusions: Crack users are at higher risk of arrest and tend to be of
   lower socioeconomic status compared to powder cocaine users. These
   findings can inform US Congress as they review bills (e.g., The Smarter
   Sentencing Act), which would help eliminate cocaine-related sentencing
   disparities. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Background: Little is known about to what extent treatment-seeking
   behavior varies across individuals with alcohol abuse, alcohol
   dependence, drug abuse, and drug dependence.
   Methods: The sample included respondents from the Wave 2 of the National
   Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) who
   reported a lifetime diagnosis alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, drug
   abuse, or drug dependence. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios are
   presented for time to first treatment contact by sociodemographic
   characteristics and comorbid psychiatric disorders. Individuals were
   censored from the analyses if their condition remitted prior to seeking
   treatment.
   Results: In the first year after disorder onset, rates of
   treatment-seeking were 13% for drug dependence, 5% for alcohol
   dependence, 2% for drug abuse, and 1% for alcohol abuse. The lifetime
   probability of seeking treatment among individuals who did not remit was
   also highest for drug dependence (90%), followed by drug abuse (60%),
   alcohol dependence (54%), and alcohol abuse (16%). Having had previous
   treatment contact for a substance use disorder (SUD) increased the
   probability of seeking treatment for another SUD. By contrast, an early
   age of SUD onset, belonging to an older cohort, and a higher level of
   education decreased the lifetime probability of treatment contact for
   SUD. The role of comorbid mental disorders was more complex, with some
   disorders increasing and other decreasing the probability of seeking
   treatment.
   Conclusions: Given high rates of SUD and their substantial health and
   economic burden, these patterns suggest the need for innovative
   approaches to increase treatment access for individuals with SUD. (C)

   years, N = 284) participated in a parent child free play session, and
   children completed cognitive (language, early literacy, early
   mathematics) and emotion knowledge assessments. Approximately 1 year
   later, children completed the same assessment battery. Parental
   responsiveness was coded from the videotaped parent child free play
   sessions, and parental inferential language input was coded from
   transcripts of a subset of 127 of these sessions. All analyses
   controlled for child age, gender, and parental education, and
   longitudinal analyses controlled for initial skill level. Parental
   responsiveness significantly predicted all concurrent cognitive skills
   as well as literacy, math, and emotion knowledge I year later. Parental
   inferential language input was significantly positively associated with
   children's concurrent emotion knowledge. In longitudinal analyses, an
   interaction was found such that for children with stronger initial
   language skills, higher levels of parental inferential language input
   facilitated greater vocabulary development, whereas for children with
   weaker initial language skills, there was no association between
   parental inferential language input and change in children's vocabulary
   skills. These findings further our understanding of the roles of
   parental responsiveness and inferential language input in promoting
   children's school readiness skills. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB OBJECTIVE: To estimate whether race or ethnic and socioeconomic strata
   are independently associated with advanced-stage ovarian cancer-specific
   survival after adjusting for adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer
   Network treatment guidelines.
   METHODS: The design was a retrospective population-based cohort study of
   patients with stage IIIC-IV epithelial ovarian cancer identified from
   the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database
   (1992-2009). Quartile of census tract median household income was used
   as the measure of socioeconomic status (quartiles 1-4). A multivariable
   logistic regression model was used to identify characteristics
   predictive of adherence to National Comprehensive Cancer Network
   guidelines for surgery and chemotherapy. Cox proportional hazards models
   and propensity score matching were used for survival analyses.
   RESULTS: A total of 10,296 patients were identified, and 30.2% received
   National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline-adherent care. Among
   demographic variables, black race (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.53, 95%
   confidence interval [CI] 1.22-1.92) and low socioeconomic status
   (quartile 1, adjusted OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.14-1.52) were independently
   associated with nonguideline care. Stratified multivariate survival
   analysis using the propensity score-matched sample (n=5,124) revealed
   that deviation from treatment guidelines was associated with a
   comparable risk of disease-related death across race-ethnicity: whites
   (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.48-1.71), blacks (adjusted HR
   1.66, 95% CI 1.19-2.30), Asian or Pacific Islanders (adjusted HR 1.52,
   95% CI 0.99-1.92), and Hispanics (adjusted HR 1.91, 95% CI 0.98-3.72).
   Across socioeconomic status, deviation from treatment guidelines was
   also associated with a comparable risk of ovarian cancer mortality for
   quartile 1 (adjusted HR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47-1.95), quartile 2 (adjusted HR
   1.63, 95% CI 1.42-1.87), quartile 3 (adjusted HR 1.51, 95% CI
   1.32-1.73), and quartile 4 (adjusted HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.38-1.79).
   CONCLUSION: Adherence to treatment guidelines for advanced-stage ovarian
   cancer is associated with equivalent survival benefit across racial or
   ethnic and socioeconomic strata. Ensuring equal access to standard
   treatment is a viable strategic approach to reduce survival disparities.

AB To better understand the factors that affect low disease activity (DAS28
   a parts per thousand currency sign 3.2, LDA) in rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA) and barriers within the UAE, demographic/treatment data and DAS28
   scores were collected through chart reviews of 182 consecutive RA
   patients seen at a private clinic in Dubai over a 2-month period.
   Patients were separated into a LDA group and a group comprised of
   moderate (3.2 < DAS28 < 5.1) or high disease activity (DAS28 a parts per
   thousand yen 5.1) (MHDA). We then examined variables that may be
   associated with LDA and re-examined the MHDA group for barriers. While
   97 (53 %) of the 182 patients had achieved the treatment target of DAS28
   a parts per thousand currency sign 3.2, 85 (47 %) had MHDA. A
   significantly larger portion of LDA patients had been previously treated
   with sulfasalazine (36 in LDA vs. 14 in MHDA, P = 0.002) or was
   presently on biological treatments (24 vs. 9, P = 0.013). For the 85
   MHDA patients, 40 (22 % of 182) exhibited resistant disease with 25
   (13.7 % of 182) failing their current first tier disease-modifying
   anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) treatment or combinations and 15 (8.2 % of
   182) failing current anti-TNF or biologic treatment. Reasons listed were
   primarily socioeconomic with 40 % of the resistant disease group unable
   to afford biologicals and 52 % of the patient-driven preference group
   discontinuing DMARDs against professional advice. Going forward,
   emphasis on the agreement between patient and rheumatologist on
   treatment, specifically regarding how DMARDs help relieve symptoms and
   their proper use, could help reduce the percentage of MHDA patients in
   the UAE.

AB This article isolates and observes the impact of peer readership on
   low-stakes reflective writing assignments in two large Introduction to
   Sociology classes. Through a comparative content analysis of over 2,000
   private reflective journal entries and semipublic reflective blog posts,
   I find that both practices produce distinct forms of reflection. I argue
   that these differences can be understood in terms of the risks that
   students take in their writing. Journals, which do not incorporate peer
   readership, appear to compel students to take more personal risks and
   engage in emotional labor to process assigned materials. Blogs, which do
   incorporate peer readership, enable students to take more intellectual
   risks and engage in logical mental endeavors. The results suggest that
   instructors should be cognizant of the variety of risks their
   assignments are likely to compel students to make as they determine how
   best to engage students in reflection on sociological materials and
   ideas.

   of U.S. and Canadian sociology graduate programs offered formal teacher
   training. Despite pronouncements that offerings have increased
   substantially, no similarly thorough and direct investigation has been
   published since. In this time of dramatic change and increasing scrutiny
   of higher education, graduate teacher training is arguably more
   important than ever before. Thus, we seek to provide a new baseline of
   teacher training in the discipline. Using a 2013 survey of U.S. and
   Canadian sociology graduate programs (N = 173), we find that 94 percent
   involve graduate students in teaching, almost 68 percent provide formal
   training for graduate student instructors, and 54 percent provide formal
   training for teaching assistants. We discuss the kinds and frequency of
   teacher training, as well as the type of graduate programs most likely
   to offer teacher training, and we provide suggestions for future
   research.

AB This paper explores dynamics of students' critical consciousness
   development in the context of a thematically organized service-learning
   sociology course titled Health, Illness, and Community. The integrated
   components of the course were designed to cultivate critical
   consciousness by framing the study of health in terms of social justice
   issues that were demonstrable across three community partner
   organization sites. Analyses of writing assignments and qualitative
   interviews at the end of the semester reveal that student development of
   critical consciousness was demonstrated through analytic engagement with
   structural and systemic forces framing health inequities as well as
   reflexive consideration of the limited extent to which well-meaning
   efforts and intentions of individuals can significantly impact lasting
   social change. The combination of these two processes simultaneously
   cultivated students' ideological commitments to ongoing social justice
   work and subverted student self-efficacy with regard to the
   operationalization of those commitments.

AB Differences in parental feeding practices revealed across and within
   different ethnic/cultural groups indicate that cultural examinations of
   feeding practices in understudied non-European-American populations
   require urgent attention. China ranks as the second largest source
   country for children in foreign-born U.S. households. Contrary to the
   stereotype of slender Asians, Chinese-American young children are at
   high risk for obesity but have not received sufficient attention from
   researchers and practitioners dealing with parental feeding practices
   and childhood obesity. The present study aimed to understand foodrelated
   parenting practices among Chinese immigrants in the U.S. using
   qualitative focus groups. Twentytwo mothers with preschool aged children
   participated in a discussion regarding parent-child foodrelated
   interactions and feeding practices. A thematic approach was adopted to
   analyze the focus group data following five stages of framework
   analysis. Thirteen key themes of feeding practices were identified,
   including 9 that are in existing feeding measures (pre-exiting
   practices) and 4 practices that have not been documented or emphasized
   in previous feeding measures (culturally-emphasized practices),
   including regulating healthy routines and food energy, spoon-feeding,
   using social comparison to pressure the child to eat, and making an
   effort to prepare/cook specific foods. Through the use of an emic
   approach and meaning-centered evidence, the complexities of parent-child
   interactions and unique nuances of parental feeding in this understudied
   population were revealed. Our findings can guide future development of
   culturally-appropriate measurement and inform intervention programs to
   promote the healthy development of Chinese-American children. Published

AB Objectives: Use of withdrawal (coitus intenuptus) has consequences for
   reproductive health, but few nationally representative studies exist. We
   (1) examined patterns of withdrawal among 15- to 24-year-old women and
   men, and (2) explored withdrawal's associations with sociodemographic,
   psychological, and sexual factors.
   Study design: Using data from the 2006-2010 National Survey of Family
   Growth, we assessed reports of any and only withdrawal use at last
   sexual episode in the last month from 3517 sexually active 15 to 24
   year-old women and men at risk of unintended pregnancy. Logistic
   regression documented associations with withdrawal.
   Results: Fourteen percent of young women and 17% of young men reported
   any use of withdrawal at last sex; 7% and 6%, respectively, reported
   only use of withdrawal. Though associated with few sociodemographic
   factors, withdrawal was significantly linked with pregnancy-and condom
   attitudes. In regression models, compared to those who said they would
   be upset if they discovered they were pregnant, young women who said
   they would be pleased about a pregnancy were 2.2-2.6 times as likely to
   have used any/only withdrawal (p<.01). For both women and men, those who
   felt that condoms were likely to diminish sexual pleasure were more
   likely to have used any/only withdrawal (odds ratio=1.8-2.6, p<.05).
   Conclusions: At their last sexual episode, a greater proportion of young
   adults used withdrawal in conjunction with other methods than by itself.
   The psychological and sexual variables of orientation toward pregnancy
   and attitudes about condoms and pleasure were more strongly linked with
   withdrawal practices than most sociodemographic variables.
   Implications statement: Since a substantial minority of young adults use
   withdrawal, providers may wish to speak directly to contraceptive
   clients about this method, though they should distinguish between only
   versus any withdrawal use. Practitioners may also be well served by
   assessing and responding to pregnancy orientation and pleasure attitudes
   in contraceptive counseling. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

   cancer patients. In a cross-sectional design, 179 ambulatory cancer
   patients completed measures of intrinsic religiousness, religious
   coping, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, well-being, and
   demographic variables. Type of cancer, stage of cancer, and time since
   diagnosis were collected from electronic medical charts. In a path
   model, the positive association between intrinsic religiousness and
   three types of well-being-physical, functional, and social-was fully
   mediated by active religious surrender and self-efficacy for coping with
   cancer. In addition, the negative association between passive religious
   deferral and all four types of well-being-physical, functional, social,
   and emotional-was fully mediated by self-efficacy for coping with
   cancer. Finally, there was a negative direct association between
   pleading for God's direct intercession and emotional well-being. These
   findings suggest pathways by which intrinsic religiousness and
   control-related religious coping are linked to various dimensions of
   well-being among cancer patients.

AB Background: Human papilloma virus (HPV) is the most common sexually
   transmitted infection (STI) globally, with a high burden of anogenital
   warts (AGW) among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transwomen (TW).
   Methods: Six-hundred HIV negative MSM and TW (300 with AGW, 300 without)
   were recruited for a prospective cohort study to examine HPV outcomes
   and HPV vaccine knowledge. Participants completed a self-administered
   online questionnaire. Logistic regression was used to assess the
   association between sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics with
   HPV vaccine knowledge.
   Results: The average participant age was 25.5 years. Most (67%) were
   single and 41.2% self-reported STI symptoms. The average age of first
   anal intercourse was 17 years, with self-reported sexual role as active
   (36%), passive (36%), and both (27%). Three quarters (77%) of
   participants reported engaging in condomless anal or oral sex up to six
   months prior to the study. Less than half (48%) of participants had
   heard of HPV. Participants with AGW were more likely to report that
   condoms helped prevent HPV (p=0.01) and that the absence of genital
   warts does not mean the absence of HPV (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Study participants had low levels of HPV knowledge but
   likely high HPV exposure due to condomless anal sex. The HPV knowledge
   gap may be explained in part by the stigma of sex work, underreporting
   of STIs, the high cost of the HPV vaccine in Peru, and misinformation
   about HPV vaccine. More work is needed to educate MSM and TW on HPV and
   the HPV vaccine.

   MethodsWe recruited adults starting TB treatment in Tororo, Uganda, over
   1year. Fifty four TB cases provided names of frequent contacts, sites of
   residence, health care, work and social activities, and two sputum
   samples. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) culture-positive specimens
   underwent spoligotyping to identify strains with shared genotypes. We
   visualised TB case social networks, and obtained, mapped and geo-coded
   global positioning system measures for every location that cases
   reported frequenting 1month before treatment. Locations of spatial
   overlap among genotype-clustered cases were considered potential
   transmission sites.
   ResultsSix distinct genotypic clusters were identified involving 21 of
   33 (64%) MTB culture-positive, genotyped cases; none shared a home.
   Although 18 of 54 (33%) TB cases shared social network ties, none of the
   genotype-clustered cases shared social ties. Using spatial analysis, we
   identified potential sites of within-cluster TB transmission for five of
   six genotypic clusters. All sites but one were healthcare and social
   venues, including sites of drinking, worship and marketplaces. Cases
   reported spending the largest proportion of pre-treatment person-time
   (22.4%) at drinking venues.
   ConclusionsUsing molecular epidemiology, geospatial and social network
   data from adult TB cases identified at clinics, we quantified
   person-time spent at high-risk locations across a rural Ugandan
   community and determined the most likely sites of recent TB transmission
   to be healthcare and social venues. These sites may not have been
   identified using contact investigation alone.
   ObjectifsCibler les sites de transmission elevee de la tuberculose (TB)
   peut offrir une nouvelle approche pour la prevention de la TB en Afrique
   subsaharienne. Nous avons cherche a caracteriser les sites de
   transmission de la TB dans un township rural en Ouganda.
   MethodesNous avons recrute des adultes debutant le traitement de la TB a
   Tororo, en Ouganda sur un an. 54 cas de TB ont fourni les noms des
   contacts frequents, le lieu de residence, les soins de sante, le travail
   et les activites sociales, et deux echantillons d'expectoration. Les
   specimens a culture positive pour Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) ont
   subi un spoligotypage pour identifier les souches avec des genotypes
   partages. Nous avons visualise les reseaux sociaux des cas de TB et
   obtenu des mesures de systeme de positionnement global cartographie et
   geocodees pour chaque endroit que les cas ont declare avoir frequente un
   mois avant le traitement. Les lieux de chevauchement spatial parmi les
   cas regroupes genotypiquement ont ete consideres comme des sites
   potentiels de transmission.
   ResultatsSix regroupements genotypiques distincts ont ete identifies,
   impliquant 21/33 (64%) cas genotypes de cultures positives de MTB; aucun
   d'eux partage a domicile. Bien que 18/54 (33%) cas de TB partageaient
   des liens de reseaux sociaux, aucun des cas de regroupement genotypique
   ne partageait des liens sociaux. En utilisant l'analyse spatiale, nous
   avons identifie des sites potentiels de transmission TB au sein du

   sites sauf un etaient des lieux de soins de sante et sociaux, y compris
   des sites de consommation de boisson, de culte et des marches. Les cas
   ont rapporte passer la plus grande proportion du temps par personne
   (22,4%) dans la periode de pretraitement dans des lieux de consommation

   ObjetivosCentrarse en los lugares con una alta transmision de TB podria
   dar un enfoque novedoso a la prevencion de la TB en africa
   sub-Sahariana. Hemos buscado caracterizar los lugares de transmision de
   la TB en un poblado rural de Uganda.
   MetodosDurante un ano se reclutaron adultos que comenzaban el
   tratamiento para la TB en Tororo, Uganda. De 54 casos de TB se
   obtuvieron nombres de contactos frecuentes, lugares de residencia,
   cuidados sanitarios, trabajo y actividades sociales, asi como dos
   muestras de esputo. A las muestras de esputo positivas mediante cultivo
   para Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) se les realizo espoligotipado para
   identificar cepas con genotipos compartidos. Hemos visualizado las redes
   sociales de los casos de TB, mapeado y obtenido coordenadas de
   geolocalizacion global para cada lugar que los casos reportaban haber
   frecuentado un mes antes de iniciar el tratamiento. Las localizaciones
   de superposicion espacial entre casos agrupados por genotipo, se
   consideraban como lugares potenciales de transmision.
   ResultadoSe identificaron seis conglomerados genotipicos distintivos que
   involucraban 21/33(64%) casos de MTB positivos mediante cultivo y
   genotipado; ninguno compartia casa. Aunque 18/54(33%) casos de TB
   compartia su red social, ninguno de los casos genotipicamente agrupados
   compartia vinculos sociales. Utilizando un analisis espacial,
   identificamos lugares potenciales dentro del conglomerado para la
   transmision de TB para cinco de los seis conglomerados genotipicos.
   Todos los lugares menos uno eran centros sanitarios o sedes sociales,
   incluyendo lugares para beber, culto y plazas de mercado. Los casos
   reportaron haber pasado la mayor parte proporcional de persona-tiempo
   antes del tratamiento (22.4%) en los bares.
   ConclusionesUtilizando datos de epidemiologia molecular, geoespaciales y
   de redes sociales de casos de adultos con TB identificados en clinicas,
   hemos cuantificado las personas-tiempo empleada en lugares de alto
   riesgo a lo largo de la comunidad rural de Uganda, y determinado que los
   lugares con mayor probabilidad de transmision reciente de TB eran los
   centros sanitarios y las sedes sociales. Estos lugares podrian no
   haberse identificado si se hubiesen investigado solamente los contactos.

AB Based on semi-structured, in-depth interviews, this article examines the
   experiences of twenty adults with gay and lesbian parents. Faced with
   ruptures in significant childhood attachments and strains in
   parent-child bonds, respondents developed coping strategies to deal with
   the disruptions to their bonds with others and the demands of forced
   autonomy that are the result of the creation of new identities. How and
   when they were told of their parents' sexual orientation proved to be
   the fulcrum for how they were able to manage their identities as the
   children of gay and lesbian parents. The sexual orientation of their
   parents did not prove to be an issue for these respondents; instead the
   reactions of others proved to be a critical component for how they were
   able to create meanings in their livestheir identities were reinforced
   by positive interactions, and challenged by negative interactions. In
   the end, the influence of parental sexual orientation was less
   important, in relation to how respondents were able to construct
   meanings, and develop and maintain identities, than the qualities of
   familial relationships and interactions.

AB Social status, defined as the relative rank or position that an
   individual holds in a social hierarchy, is known to be among the most
   important motivating forces in social behaviors. In this paper, we
   consider the notion of status from the perspective of a position or
   title held by a person in an enterprise. We study the intersection of
   social status and social networks in an enterprise. We study whether
   enterprise communication logs can help reveal how social interactions
   and individual status manifest themselves in social networks. To that
   end, we use two enterprise datasets with three communication
   channels-voice call, short message, and email-to demonstrate the
   social-behavioral differences among individuals with different status.
   We have several interesting findings and based on these findings we also
   develop a model to predict social status. On the individual level,
   high-status individuals are more likely to be spanned as structural
   holes by linking to people in parts of the enterprise networks that are
   otherwise not well connected to one another. On the community level, the
   principle of homophily, social balance and clique theory generally
   indicate a "rich club" maintained by high-status individuals, in the
   sense that this community is much more connected, balanced and dense.
   Our model can predict social status of individuals with 93% accuracy.

AB Resource systems with enforced rules and strong monitoring systems
   typically have more predictable resource abundance, which can confer
   economic and social benefits to local communities. Co-management regimes
   demonstrate better social and ecological outcomes, but require an active
   role by community members in management activities, such as monitoring
   and enforcement. Previous work has emphasized understanding what makes
   fishermen comply with rules. This research takes a different approach to
   understand what influences an individual to enforce rules, particularly
   sea tenure. We conducted interviews and used multiple regression and
   Akaike's Information Criteria model selection to evaluate the effect of
   social networks, food security, recent catch success, fisherman's age
   and personal gear investment on individual's enforcement of sea tenure.
   We found that fishermen's enforcement of sea tenure declined between the
   two time periods measured and that social networks, age, food security,
   and changes in gear investment explained enforcement behavior across
   three different communities on Nicaragua's Atlantic Coast, an area
   undergoing rapid globalization.

AB Starting in the late 1980s, many Latin American countries began social
   sector reforms to alleviate poverty, reduce socioeconomic inequalities,
   improve health outcomes, and provide financial risk protection. In
   particular, starting in the 1990s, reforms aimed at strengthening health
   systems to reduce inequalities in health access and outcomes focused on
   expansion of universal health coverage, especially for poor citizens. In
   Latin America, health-system reforms have produced a distinct approach
   to universal health coverage, underpinned by the principles of equity,
   solidarity, and collective action to overcome social inequalities. In
   most of the countries studied, government financing enabled the
   introduction of supply-side interventions to expand insurance coverage
   for uninsured citizens-with defined and enlarged benefits packages-and
   to scale up delivery of health services. Countries such as Brazil and
   Cuba introduced tax-financed universal health systems. These changes
   were combined with demand-side interventions aimed at alleviating
   poverty (targeting many social determinants of health) and improving
   access of the most disadvantaged populations. Hence, the distinguishing
   features of health-system strengthening for universal health coverage
   and lessons from the Latin American experience are relevant for
   countries advancing universal health coverage.

AB Latin America continues to segregate different social groups into
   separate health-system segments, including two separate public sector
   blocks: a well resourced social security for salaried workers and their
   families and a Ministry of Health serving poor and vulnerable people
   with low standards of quality and needing a frequently impoverishing
   payment at point of service. This segregation shows Latin America's
   longstanding economic and social inequality, cemented by an economic
   framework that predicted that economic growth would lead to rapid
   formalisation of the economy. Today, the institutional setup that
   organises the social segregation in health care is perceived, despite
   improved life expectancy and other advances, as a barrier to fulfilling
   the right to health, embodied in the legislation of many Latin American
   countries. This Series paper outlines four phases in the history of
   Latin American countries that explain the roots of segmentation in
   health care and describe three paths taken by countries seeking to
   overcome it: unification of the funds used to finance both social
   security and Ministry of Health services (one public payer); free choice
   of provider or insurer; and expansion of services to poor people and the
   non-salaried population by making explicit the health-care benefits to
   which all citizens are entitled.

AB Studies in Western cultures have observed that both children and adults
   tend to overimitate, copying causally irrelevant actions in the presence
   of clear causal information. Investigation of this feature in
   non-Western groups has found little difference cross-culturally in the
   frequency or manner with which individuals overimitate. However, each of
   the non-Western populations studied thus far has a history of close
   interaction with Western cultures, such that they are now far removed
   from life in a hunter-gatherer or other small-scale culture. To
   investigate overimitation in a context of limited Western cultural
   influences, we conducted a study with the Aka hunter-gatherers and
   neighboring Ngandu horticulturalists of the Congo Basin rainforest in
   the southern Central African Republic. Aka children, Ngandu children,
   and Aka adults were presented with a reward retrieval task similar to
   those performed in previous studies, involving a demonstrated sequence
   of causally relevant and irrelevant actions. Aka children were found not
   to overimitate as expected, instead displaying one of the lowest rates
   of overimitation seen under similar conditions. Aka children copied
   fewer irrelevant actions than Aka adults, used a lower proportion of
   irrelevant actions than Ngandu children and Aka adults, and had less
   copying fidelity than Aka adults. Measures from Ngandu children were
   intermediate between the two Aka groups. Of the participants that
   succeeded in retrieving the reward, 60% of Aka children used emulation
   rather than imitation, compared to 15% of Ngandu children, 11% of Aka
   adults, and 0% of Western children of similar age. From these results,
   we conclude that cross-cultural variation exists in the use of
   overimitation during childhood. Further study is needed under a more
   diverse representation of cultural and socioeconomic groups in order to
   investigate the cognitive underpinnings of overimitation and its
   possible influences on social learning and the biological and cultural
   evolution of our species.

AB Background: Lifetime prevalence of panic attacks is estimated at 22.7%,
   and research on the correlates and causes of depression, anxiety, and
   other mental illnesses have yielded mixed results in minority groups.
   Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the relationship
   between panic attacks, minority status, and nativity by focusing on the
   effects of health lifestyle behaviors and discrimination.
   Methods: Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression,
   which was used to estimate the probability of meeting the criteria for
   panic attacks (n=17,249).
   Results: Demographic and socioeconomic variables had significant
   associations; females had over 2.4 Limes higher odds than males of
   meeting the criteria for panic attacks. The more frequently respondents
   were treated as dishonest, less smart, with disrespect, threatened, or
   called names, the more likely they met the criteria for panic attacks.
   Additionally, smoking and alcohol abuse were significant predictors of
   panic attacks. Those who abused alcohol have over 2 times the odds of
   having panic attacks. Similarly, smokers had 52% higher odds of panic
   attacks than non-smokers.
   Limitations: The primary limitation of this project was the lack of a
   true acculturation measure with a secondary limitation being the
   inability to determine respondents' legal status.
   Conclusions: Key findings were that health lifestyle choices and
   exposure to discrimination significantly affected the chance of having
   panic attacks. Nativity was protective; however, its effect was
   ameliorated by exposure to discrimination or engagement in smoking
   behavior or alcohol abuse. Thus, this study offers insight into
   contextual factors for clinicians caring for racial and ethnic
   minorities diagnosed with panic attacks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Epidemic trajectories and associated social responses vary widely
   between populations, with severe reactions sometimes observed. When
   confronted with fatal or novel pathogens, people exhibit a variety of
   behaviours from anxiety to hoarding of medical supplies, overwhelming
   medical infrastructure and rioting. We developed a coupled network
   approach to understanding and predicting social response. We couple the
   disease spread and panic spread processes and model them through local
   interactions between agents. The social contagion process depends on the
   prevalence of the disease, its perceived risk and a global media signal.
   We verify the model by analysing the spread of disease and social
   response during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak in Mexico City and 2003 severe
   acute respiratory syndrome and 2009 H1N1 outbreaks in Hong Kong,
   accurately predicting population-level behaviour. This kind of
   empirically validated model is critical to exploring strategies for
   public health intervention, increasing our ability to anticipate the
   response to infectious disease outbreaks.

AB It is hypothesized that persons who use drugs (PWUD) in Vietnam who are
   also HIV-positive may face additional challenges in psychosocial
   outcomes, and these challenges may extend to their family members. In
   this study, we examined depressive symptoms, stigma, social support, and
   caregiver burden of HIV-positive PWUD and their family members, compared
   to the outcomes of HIV-negative PWUD and their family members. Baseline,
   3-month, and 6-month assessment data were gathered from 83 PWUD and 83
   family members recruited from four communes in Phu Tho Province,
   Vietnam. For PWUD, although we observed a general decline in overall
   stigma over time for both groups, HIV-positive PWUD consistently
   reported significantly higher overall stigma for all three periods.
   Depressive symptoms among family members in both groups declined over
   time; however, family members of HIV-positive PWUD reported higher
   depressive symptoms across all three periods. In addition, family
   members of HIV-positive PWUD reported lower levels of tangible support
   across all three periods. Caregiver burden among family members of
   HIV-positive PWUD increased significantly over time, whereas the
   reported burden among family members of HIV-negative PWUD remained
   relatively unchanged. The findings highlight the need for future
   interventions for PWUD and family members, with targeted and culturally
   specific strategies to focus on the importance of addressing additional
   stigma experienced by PWUD who are HIV-positive. Such challenges may
   have direct negative impact on their family members' depressive
   symptoms, tangible support, and caregiver burden.

AB Using data obtained from 4004 participants across eight countries
   (Canada, India, Japan, Korea, Poland, Slovakia, Uganda, and the U.S.),
   the factorial reliability, validity and structural/ measurement
   invariance of a 30-item version of Expressions of Spirituality Inventory
   (ESI-R) was evaluated. The ESI-R measures a five factor model of
   spirituality developed through the conjoint factor analysis of several
   extant measures of spiritual constructs. Exploratory factor analyses of
   pooled data provided evidence that the five ESI-R factors are reliable.
   Confirmatory analyses comparing four and five factor models revealed
   that the five dimensional model demonstrates superior goodness-of-fit
   with all cultural samples and suggest that the ESI-R may be viewed as
   structurally invariant. Measurement invariance, however, was not
   supported as manifested in significant differences in item and dimension
   scores and in significantly poorer fit when factor loadings were
   constrained to equality across all samples. Exploratory analyses with a
   second adjective measure of spirituality using American, Indian, and
   Ugandan samples identified three replicable factors which correlated
   with ESI-R dimensions in a manner supportive of convergent validity. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the meaning of the findings and
   directions needed for future research.

   be examined from a variety of angles: Why have nations differed so
   drastically, historically speaking, in terms of the level of debt that
   their citizens carry? Why have patterns converged over the past few
   decades, with levels of indebtedness increasing across the board? This
   paper considers these questions from a sociological perspective. I first
   consider the role of political, institutional, economic, and cultural
   factors, as well as individual characteristics, in shaping the demand
   for and supply of credit and the degree and nature of household
   indebtedness in and across nations. I then attempt to explain the
   cross-national convergence towards rising indebtedness over the past few
   decades by situating the transformation of these various demand and
   supply side factors under the neoliberal regime.

AB Context: Many newly credentialed athletic trainers gain initial
   employment as graduate assistants (GAs) in the collegiate setting, yet
   their socialization into their role is unknown. Exploring the
   socialization process of GAs in the collegiate setting could provide
   insight into how that process occurs.
   Objective: To explore the professional socialization of GAs in the
   collegiate setting to determine how GAs are socialized and developed as
   athletic trainers.
   Design: Qualitative study.
   Setting: Individual phone interviews.
   Patients or Other Participants: Athletic trainers (N = 21) who had
   supervised GAs in the collegiate setting for a minimum of 8 years (16
   men [76%], 5 women [24%]; years of supervision experience = 14.6 +/-
   6.6).
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data were collected via phone interviews,
   which were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed by a
   4-person consensus team with a consensual qualitative-research design.
   The team independently coded the data and compared ideas until a
   consensus was reached, and a codebook was created. Trustworthiness was
   established through member checks and multianalyst triangulation.
   Results: Four themes emerged: (1) role orientation, (2) professional
   development and support, (3) role expectations, and (4) success. Role
   orientation occurred both formally (eg, review of policies and
   procedures) and informally (eg, immediate role immersion). Professional
   development and support consisted of the supervisor mentoring and
   intervening when appropriate. Role expectations included decision-making
   ability, independent practice, and professionalism; however, supervisors
   often expected GAs to function as experienced, full-time staff. Success
   of the GAs depended on their adaptability and on the proper selection of
   GAs by supervisors.
   Conclusions: Supervisors socialize GAs into the collegiate setting by
   providing orientation, professional development, mentoring, and
   intervention when necessary. Supervisors are encouraged to use these
   socialization tactics to enhance the professional development of GAs in
   the collegiate setting.

AB BACKGROUND: Recent research shows that by age 5, children form rigid
   social hierarchies, with some children consistently subordinated, and
   then later, bullied. Further, several studies suggest that enduring
   mental and physical harm follow. It is time to analyze the health
   burdens posed by early social dominance and to consider the ethical
   implications of ongoing socially caused harms.
   METHODS: First, we reviewed research demonstrating the health impact of
   early childhood subordination. Second, we used philosophical conceptions
   of children's rights and social justice to consider whether children
   have a right to protection and who has an obligation to protect them
   from social harms.
   RESULTS: Collectively, recent studies show that early subordination is
   instantiated biologically, increasing lifetime physical and mental
   health problems. The pervasive, and enduring nature of these harms leads
   us to argue that children have a right to be protected. Further, society
   has a role responsibility to protect children because society conscripts
   children into schools. Society's promise to parents that schools will be
   fiduciaries entails an obligation to safeguard each child's right to a
   reasonably open future. Importantly, this role responsibility holds
   independently of bearing any causal responsibility for the harm. This
   new argument based on protecting from harm is much stronger than
   previous equality of opportunity arguments, and applies broadly to other
   social determinants of health.
   CONCLUSIONS: Social institutions have a role responsibility to protect
   children that is not dependent on playing a causal role in the harm.
   Children's rights to protection from social harms can be as strong as
   their rights to protection from direct bodily harms.

AB Despite medical advances, childhood health and well-being have not been
   broadly achieved due to rising chronic diseases and conditions related
   to child poverty. Family and neighborhood living conditions can have
   lasting consequences for health, with community adversity affecting
   health outcomes in significant part through stress response and
   increased allostatic load. Exposure to this "toxic stress" influences
   gene expression and brain development with direct and indirect negative
   consequences for health. Ensuring healthy child development requires
   improving conditions in distressed, high-poverty neighborhoods by
   reducing children's exposure to neighborhood stressors and supporting
   good family and caregiver functioning. The community development
   industry invests more than $200 billion annually in low-income
   neighborhoods, with the goal of improving living conditions for
   residents. The most impactful investments have transformed neighborhoods
   by integrating across sectors to address both the built environment and
   the social and service environment. By addressing many facets of the
   social determinants of health at once, these efforts suggest substantial
   results for children, but health outcomes generally have not been
   considered or evaluated. Increased partnership between the health sector
   and community development can bring health outcomes explicitly into
   focus for community development investments, help optimize intervention
   strategies for health, and provide natural experiments to build the
   evidence base for holistic interventions for disadvantaged children. The
   problems and potential solutions are beyond the scope of practicing
   pediatricians, but the community development sector stands ready to
   engage in shared efforts to improve the health and development of our
   most at-risk children.

   challenge. We describe our experiences in introducing a mandatory,
   full-day workshop to incoming Master of Public Health students, called
   "Self, Social, and Global Awareness: Personal Capacity Building for
   Professional Education and Practice." The purpose of the program is to
   provide a meaningful, structured environment to explore issues of

AB Purposes: Racial/ethnic differences in mental health service utilization
   were examined among youth who reported participating in negative
   externalizing behaviors.
   Methods: The study utilized merged data from the 2007-2010 National
   Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) to examine differences in
   utilization of inpatient or outpatient mental health services not
   related to substance or alcohol use by White, Black and Hispanic youth
   who reported engaging in negative externalizing behaviors ("acting
   out"). Differences in service utilization in these groups were assessed
   using logistic regression models.
   Results: Race/ethnicity was a significant predictor of outpatient mental
   health service use. Black and Hispanic children were less likely to use
   outpatient services. Inpatient service use decreased with increasing
   income. Parental presence in the household increased the likelihood of
   outpatient service use for minorities.
   Conclusion: Racial/ethnic minority youth in the United States continue
   to use outpatient mental health services at lower rates. This may lead
   to high prevalence of untreated negative externalizing behaviors among
   minority adolescent groups and, in turn, lead to use of inpatient
   services from systems such as juvenile justice and foster care. Such
   severe treatment alternatives can be prevented if timely and culturally
   tailored outpatient intervention is provided.

AB Objective: African Americans, Hispanics and some Asian subgroups have a
   higher stroke incidence than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). Additionally,
   African Americans and Hispanics have worse stroke outcomes than
   non-Hispanic Whites. Thus, we explored racial and ethnic differences in
   mental distress, a known risk factor for post-stroke disability.
   Methods: National Health Interview Survey data from 2000-2010 were used
   to identify 8,324 community dwelling adults with self-reported stroke.
   Serious mental distress was identified by the Kessler-6 scale. Logistic
   regression models assessed racial/ethnic associations with serious
   mental distress after adjusting for demographics, comorbidities,
   disability, health care utilization and socioeconomic factors.
   Results: Serious mental distress was identified in 9% of stroke
   survivors. Hispanics (14%) were more likely to have serious mental
   distress than African Americans (9%), non-Hispanic Whites (9%) and
   Asians.(8%, P=.02). After adjustment, Hispanics (OR=1.06, 95%
   CI.76-1.48) and Asians (.84, 95% CI.37-1.90) had a similar odds of
   serious mental distress while African Americans had a lower odds of
   serious mental distress (OR=.61, 95% CI.48.78) compared with
   non-Hispanic Whites. Younger age, low levels of education and insurance
   were important predictors of serious mental distress among Hispanics.
   Conclusion: Serious mental distress is highly prevalent among US stroke
   survivors and is more common in Hispanics than NHWs, African Americans
   and Asians. Further study of the role of mental distress in ethnic
   differences in post-stroke disability is warranted.

AB Objective: The purpose of our study was twofold: 1) adapt and test a
   social support measure specific to the experiences of African American
   women with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); 2) examine its relationship
   to psychosocial measures.
   Research Design and Methods: 200 rural African American women with
   uncontrolled T2DM participating in a randomized controlled trial
   completed surveys at baseline on their social support, empowerment,
   self-care, self-efficacy, depression and diabetes distress. Exploratory
   factor analysis and correlation analysis were conducted to test the
   psychometric properties of the Dunst Family Support Scale adapted for AA
   women with T2DM (FSS-AA T2DM) and its relationship with other
   psychosocial measures.
   Results: The 16 items of the FSS-AA T2DM loaded onto three distinct
   factors: parent and spouse/partner support, community and medical
   support, and extended family and friends support. Reliability for the
   entire scale was good (Cronbach's alpha=.90) and was acceptable to high
   across these three factors (Cronbach's a of alpha 86,.83, and .83
   respectively). All three factors were significantly correlated with
   self-reported empowerment, self-care, self-efficacy, depression and
   diabetes distress, although the pattern was different for each factor.
   FSS-AA-T2DM showed good concurrent validity when compared with similar
   items on the Diabetes Distress Scale.
   Conclusion: The FSS-AA T2DM, a 16-item scale measuring social support
   among rural African American women with T2DM, is internally consistent
   and reliable. Findings support the utility of this screening tool in
   this population, although additional testing is needed with other groups
   in additional settings.

AB This article presents hiring as an emotional process rooted in
   interpersonal evaluation. Drawing from Randall Collins's theory of
   interaction ritual, the author offers a qualitative case study of elite
   professional service firms to unpack how employers' emotional reactions
   to applicants in job interviews affect hiring evaluations. She finds
   that employers use subjective feelings of excitement and enthusiasm
   toward candidates-akin to Collins's concept of emotional energy-to
   evaluate applicants and make hiring decisions. With these data, she
   constructs an original theoretical framework of emotional energy
   development, which highlights the qualities that tend to produce or
   inhibit the subjective experience of emotional energy in job interviews.
   Additionally, she outlines the particular phases of an encounter where
   energy gains and losses are most consequential for influencing hiring
   outcomes and inequalities. She discusses the implications of these
   findings for research on hiring, labor market stratification, and
   interaction rituals.

AB The Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890 and the Ghost Dance movement that
   preceded it offer a compelling sociological case for understanding
   legitimation, elite framing, and repression. Building on the social
   movements literature and theoretical insights on power, institutions,
   and inequality, we engage in multimethod, in-depth analyses of a rich
   body of archived correspondence from key institutional actors at the
   time. Doing so contributes to the literature by drawing attention to (1)
   the cultural foundations of inequality and repression; (2)
   super-ordinate framing by political elites and the state; and (3) key
   institutional conflicts and their consequences. We find that, within an
   ambiguous colonial context, officials of the Office of Indian Affairs
   and federal politicians shelved benign military observations and,
   instead, amplified ethnocentric and threat frames. Force was
   consequently portrayed as justifiable, which increased the likelihood of
   the massacre. We conclude by discussing the utility of our results for
   conceptions of culture, power, inequality, the state, and state
   violence.

AB Objectives: This study aimed to identify social, economic, structural,
   and individual-level vulnerabilities of female adolescents who sell sex
   in Kumasi, Ghana.
   Methods: Twenty-four in-depth interviews and 4 focus group discussions
   were conducted with female sex workers of age 18-20 years who had been
   involved in sex work for at least 2 years. Total sample size was 48.
   Findings: One-third of participants started sex work before age 15.
   Knowledge of HIV was accurate and most reported having intentions to use
   condoms consistently with clients; however, factors such as higher
   payments, drug and/or alcohol use, fear of violence, and police
   harassment affected condom use. They perceived violence and rape at the
   hands of clients as their greatest risk. They also reported abuse and
   exploitation by police. Respondents voiced strong concerns that girls
   and teens involved in sex work are at higher risk of unsafe sex,
   exploitation, and abuse than their older and more experienced
   counterparts. Unprotected sex with boyfriends was also common.
   Discussion: The pathway to sex work followed a similar pattern for many
   study participants who left their rural homes for Kumasi in search of
   economic opportunity. While adolescents who sell sex appear to be
   abundant in Kumasi, they have been missed by HIV prevention and harm
   reduction programming. The findings from this study informed the design
   and implementation of a young female sex worker peer educator pilot
   program. Key elements of that program are presented, and recommendations
   for future program evaluation are made.

   Policies intended to improve community health were most often proposed
   in urban, racially diverse communities; policies proposed in small towns
   or majority-White communities aimed to protect community aesthetics or
   local businesses. Health-focused policies were subject to more criticism
   than other policies and were generally less successful. Our findings

AB Objectives. We examined the prospective association between negative
   life events and time to initiation of sexual intercourse and the
   influence of family structure and family income on this association.
   Methods. We followed up a randomly selected sample (n = 649) of
   ethnically diverse parents and their children aged 12 to 17 years over a
   5-year period. We conducted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis
   to examine the relation between negative life events and time to
   initiation of sexual intercourse. Family structure and family income
   were assessed as confounders.
   Results. Negative life events were significant predictors of time to
   initiation of sexual intercourse in adolescents. After controlling for
   demographic variables, youths reporting 1 negative life event had a
   hazard of initiation of sexual intercourse 1.40 times greater and youths
   reporting 2 or more negative life events had a hazard of initiation of
   sexual intercourse 1.61 times greater compared with youths reporting no
   negative life events. Family structure and family income were not
   significant confounders of the relation between initiation of sexual
   intercourse and negative life events.
   Conclusions. Interventions to prevent initiation of sexual intercourse
   should focus on youths with recent negative life events, regardless of
   family income and structure.

   and an urban-industrialized community from the US. We find that in
   addition to taxonomic and metabolic differences between urban and
   traditional lifestyles, hunter-gatherers form a distinct sub-group among
   traditional peoples. As observed in previous studies, we find that
   Treponema are characteristic of traditional gut microbiomes. Moreover,

   functional potential characterization, we discover these Treponema are
   diverse, fall outside of pathogenic clades and are similar to Treponema
   succinifaciens, a known carbohydrate metabolizer in swine. Gut Treponema
   are found in non-human primates and all traditional peoples studied to
   date, suggesting they are symbionts lost in urban-industrialized
   societies.

AB BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Previous research has documented
   racial/ethnic disparities in diabetes treatments and outcomes. It
   remains controversial whether these disparities result from differences
   in socioeconomic status (SES) or other factors. We examined
   racial/ethnic disparities in therapeutic modalities and diabetes
   outcomes among the large number of pediatric participants in the T1D
   Exchange Clinic Registry.
   METHODS: The cohort included 10 704 participants aged,18 years with type
   1 diabetes for >= 1 year (48% female; mean age: 11.9 +/- 3.6 years;
   diabetes duration: 5.2 +/- 3.5 years). Diabetes management and clinical
   outcomes were compared among 8841 non-Hispanic white (white) (83%), 697
   non-Hispanic black (black) (7%), and 1166 Hispanic (11%) participants.
   The population included 214 high-income black and Hispanic families.
   RESULTS: Insulin pump use was higher in white participants than in black
   or Hispanic participants (61% vs 26% and 39%, respectively) after
   adjusting for gender, age, diabetes duration, and SES (P<.001). Mean
   hemoglobin A1c was higher (adjusted P<.001) in black participants than
   in white or Hispanic participants (9.6%, 8.4%, and 8.7%). More black
   participants experienced diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemic
   events in the previous year than white or Hispanic participants (both,
   P<.001). There were no significant differences in hemoglobin A1c,
   diabetic ketoacidosis, or severe hypoglycemia between white and Hispanic
   participants after adjustment for SES.
   CONCLUSIONS: Even after SES adjustment, marked disparities in insulin
   treatment method and treatment outcomes existed between black versus
   Hispanic and white children within this large pediatric cohort. Barriers
   to insulin pump use and optimal glycemic control beyond SES should be
   explored in all ethnic groups.

AB This paper seeks to develop a nuanced and qualified account of the
   distinctive ways in which religion can inform political conflict and
   violence. It seeks to transcend the opposition between particularizing
   stances, which see religiously informed political conflicts as sui
   generis and uniquely intractable, and generalizing stances, which
   assimilate religiously informed political conflicts to other forms of
   political conflict. The paper specifies the distinctively religious
   stakes of certain political conflicts, informed by distinctively
   religious understandings of right order, as well as the distinctiveness
   of religion as a rich matrix of interlocking modalities and mechanisms
   thatin certain contextscan contribute to political conflict and violence
   even when the stakes are not distinctively religious. At the same time,
   the paper shows that many putatively religious conflicts are
   fundamentally similar to other conflicts over political power, economic
   resources, symbolic recognition, or cultural reproduction.

AB In this article, we outline the analytic limitations of action theories
   and interpretive schemes that conceive of beliefs as explicit mental
   representations linked to a desire-opportunity folk psychology. Drawing
   on pragmatism and practice theory, we recast the notion of belief as a
   species of habit, with pre-reflexive anticipation the primary mechanism
   accounting for both the formation of beliefs and their causal influence
   on action. We demonstrate the utility of this approach in three ways:
   first, by linking it with recent research on the cognitive and motor
   development of infants; second, by drawing out a typology of belief
   states that accounts for a range of different experiential traits; and
   third, by applying the new model to reinterpret two belief-based
   phenomena of broad sociological interest: irrational decision making and
   religious conversion.

AB Peer review guides the intensive reworking of research reports, a key
   mechanism in the construction of social scientific knowledge and one
   that gives substantial creative agency to journal editors and reviewers.
   We conceptualize this process in terms of two types of challenges:
   evidentiary challenges that question a study's methodology and
   interpretive challenges that question a study's theoretical framing. A
   survey of authors recently published in Administrative Science Quarterly
   finds that their peer review experience was dominated by interpretive
   challenges: extensive criticisms, suggestions, and subsequent revision
   concerning conceptual and theoretical issues but limited attention to
   methodological and empirical aspects of the work. Salient differences
   between original submissions and published papers include intensive
   reworking of theory and discussion sections as well as growth and
   turnover in citations and hypotheses. We consider implications of the
   dominance of interpretive challenges in successful revision and possible
   sources of variation across scholarly fields.

AB Social desirability can influence reports of stigma change in that
   subscribing to stigmatizing attitudes might pose a threat to personal
   beliefs of open-mindedness, while endorsing difference might not be as
   troubling. A measure is needed that assesses stigma change but is less
   susceptible to desirability effects. This study examined the
   psychometrics of various assessments of perceived difference from a
   person with mental illness. A total of 460 participants were recruited
   online using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Four measures of difference, the
   Likert Scale of Difference, Semantic Differential: Similar-Different
   Scale, Semantic Differential: Mental Illness versus Other Illness scale,
   and Cause of Perceived Difference Scale were compared to measures of
   stereotypes, affirming attitudes, and care seeking. A vignette
   describing a person with mental illness anchored the Difference Scale
   and a measure of stereotype. Results showed that measures of difference
   yielded significantly higher endorsements than measures of stereotypes;
   the Semantic Differential Scale: Similar-Different was endorsed at a
   higher rate than other difference scales. Difference scores were
   positively related to stereotypes and inversely related to affirming
   attitudes. Difference was also found to influence empowerment separate
   from, and in addition to stereotype. These results suggest a new domain
   as an efficient and sensitive measure of stigma change. (C) 2015

   for various confounders at multiple levels. Respondents participating in
   Wave 1 (2009) and 2 (2010) of the Seoul Welfare Panel Study were used in
   the analysis. The final sample for the current study includes a total of
   5127 participants in 2738 households within 25 administrative areas.
   This study shows that only a small amount of variance in self-esteem was
   attributed to the area level (7.6%). On the other hand, a relatively
   large amount of variance in self-esteem was attributed to the household
   level (52.5%). It has also shown that all individual-level social
   capital indicators including perceived helpfulness, organizational
   participation, and volunteer work were positively associated with
   self-esteem. Among household-level indicators of social capital, only
   organizational participation was associated with self-esteem. However,
   none of the area-level social capital indicators were associated with
   self-esteem. The main finding of the current study suggested that the
   association between social capital and self-esteem varied depending on
   both dimensions and levels of social capital indicators. (C) 2015

AB OBJECTIVE To examine the association of age, gender, and socioeconomic
   status with appointment attendance and completion of 24-hour urine
   collections to identify patient characteristics associated with barriers
   to treatment.
   METHODS A retrospective review was performed under institutional review
   board approval for new patients scheduled at a single metabolic stone
   clinic over a 1.5-year period. Postal codes were used to identify
   poverty and education levels using US Census Bureau data. We evaluated 3
   years of adherence based on "no shows," percentage of stone clinic
   appointments attended, and percentage of 24-hour urine collections
   completed. Quintile analyses were used to further explore nonlinear
   data.
   RESULTS A total of 447 patients were included (246 men and 201 women).
   Mean age was 49 +/- 14.5 years. Younger age, areas of higher poverty,
   and areas of lower education were all weakly to moderately associated
   with increased " no show" rates and decreased clinic attendance. Men
   tended to not show for appointments more frequently than women (P =
   .043). When grouped by age groups, younger age was strongly correlated
   with decreased 24-hour urine collection completion (R = 0.75). When
   divided into age quintiles, relationships between " no shows" and clinic
   attendance were strengthened as they were when patients were divided
   into poverty quintiles.
   CONCLUSION It is critical for providers to be aware of health
   disparities in medical stone management. Low education, high poverty,
   and younger age are associated with suboptimal evaluation follow-up. Of
   note, the lowest adherence was in younger patients, a population that
   requires the most urgent workup. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Though cumulative emotional and physical effects of disasters may
   diminish evacuees' short and long-term mental and physical health,
   social factors may buffer such consequences. We approached survivors of
   the October 2007 San Diego, California firestorms. We gathered data
   during the evacuation and 3 months afterward. Questionnaires measured
   social support as well as PTSD, depression, and anxiety symptoms. Saliva
   samples were used to assess the stress hormone, cortisol. Analyses,
   adjusting for age, gender, and socioeconomic status, showed PTSD
   symptoms were associated with flattening of the diurnal cortisol rhythm
   during evacuation. Secondary analyses showed those reporting a family
   emphasis on moral and religious values had lower psychological distress.
   Though anxiety symptoms had significantly decreased in the overall
   sample at follow-up, blunted cortisol rhythms persisted among those
   individuals with continued high anxiety. Results highlight a possible
   psychological, and perhaps a physiological, benefit of social and
   existential factors in disaster situations. Future work should explore
   the role of psychosocial factors and stress physiology in the
   development of long-term health concerns among individuals exposed to
   disaster.

AB Objective: Research consistently shows a positive association between
   racial discrimination and problematic alcohol use among African
   Americans, but little is known about the micro-processes linking this
   pernicious form of stress to drinking. One possibility is that the
   cumulative effects of discrimination increase individuals' likelihood of
   negative-mood related drinking. In the current study, we examined
   whether individual differences in lifetime perceived racial
   discrimination among African American college students moderate
   relations between daily negative moods and evening alcohol consumption
   in both social and nonsocial contexts. Method: Data came from an online
   daily diary study of 441 African Americans (58% female) enrolled at a
   historically black college/university. Lifetime discrimination was
   measured at baseline. For 30 days, students reported the number of
   drinks they consumed the night before both socially and nonsocially, as
   well as their daytime level of negative mood. Results: In support of the
   hypotheses, only men who reported higher (vs. lower) lifetime
   discrimination showed a positive association between daily negative mood
   and that evening's level of nonsocial drinking. Contrary to expectation,
   women who reported higher (vs. lower) discrimination showed a negative
   association between daily negative mood and nonsocial drinking. Neither
   daily negative mood nor lifetime discrimination predicted level of
   social drinking. Conclusions: These findings provide further evidence
   that the cumulative impact of racial discrimination may produce a
   vulnerability to negative-mood related drinking but only for African
   American men. Importantly, these effects emerged only for nonsocial
   drinking, which may further explain the robust association between
   discrimination and problematic alcohol use.

AB Objective: Converging lines of research suggest that adolescents'
   smoking behaviors are strongly influenced by the characteristics of
   their social network and the social processes their network facilitates.
   The primary goal of this study was to conduct a detailed comparison of
   the social networks of adolescent smokers and nonsmokers to determine
   what aspects relate the most to smoking status. A secondary goal was to
   conduct within-group analyses to examine relationships between key
   measures of behavior-specific social support and (a) smoking
   susceptibility among nonsmokers, and (b) readiness to quit smoking among
   smokers. Method: A matched sample of 190 adolescent smokers and
   nonsmokers (M-age = 16.8 years; 51% female) completed a questionnaire in
   which they nominated and reported on up to 10 important people in their
   lives. This measure allowed us to examine adolescents' overall networks
   (both peers and family) and to investigate numerous aspects, including
   general network characteristics (e.g., size of network, average contact
   with network members), social support (e.g., importance of people in the
   network), and the pervasiveness of smoking in the network (e.g.,
   percentage of smoking peers). Results: The pervasiveness of smoking in
   adolescents' social network was the strongest distinguisher of smokers
   versus nonsmokers. In addition, behavior-specific social support was
   strongly associated with susceptibility to initiate smoking among
   nonsmokers and readiness to quit among smokers. Conclusions: This
   research offers insight into potential targets for prevention and early
   intervention by demonstrating how social networks can both promote and
   attenuate risk for smoking.

AB Objective: Advancing our initial, cross-sectional study, which showed
   that adult Latinas' mother daughter attachment relates to their
   substance use, the current, longitudinal study tests whether mother and
   daughter attachment scores at baseline predict their substance use over
   time. Method: We analyzed data from a convenience sample of 133 Latina
   adult mothers (mean age = 52 years, SD = 10) and 133 Latina adult
   daughters (mean age = 27, SD = 9) at baseline and at 5-year and 6-year
   follow-ups after baseline (attrition rate = 16%). Multilevel
   longitudinal modeling was used to examine the effect of mother daughter
   attachment at baseline on their substance use over time. Results: Each
   unit of increase in the attachment score at baseline is associated with
   a 0.28 drink decrease in monthly alcohol use (p < .05) and a lower
   likelihood of being a heavy alcohol or other drug user [exp(beta) =
   0.97, p < .01] compared with average attachment score at baseline (M =
   91.52, SD = 18.00). Time and older age at baseline are associated with
   decreased substance use. Being born outside the United States is
   associated with decreased risk of heavy alcohol or other drug use. Being
   a mother is associated with increased substance use. Conclusions: The
   findings of this longitudinal study on adult Latinas indicate that
   mother daughter attachment has long-lasting effects on substance use
   trajectories among adult Latinas. Future research should focus on (a)
   investigating social and cultural factors mediating this relationship
   and (b) greater substance use among Latina mothers compared with
   daughters.

   SettingPopulation-based study of three communities in the Chicago area.
   ParticipantsAfrican Americans (n=2,284) and non-Hispanic whites (1,354)
   with a mean age of 79.3.
   MeasurementsDemographic factors, socioeconomic status (SES), healthcare
   access, cynical hostility, perceived discrimination, depression, and
   institutional trust in health care.
   ResultsAfrican Americans reported substantially lower healthcare trust
   than non-Hispanic whites (P<.001). After adjustment for demographic
   variables and SES, only race (P<.001) and age (P=.008) were
   significantly associated with healthcare trust scores. The association
   between race and healthcare trust was slightly attenuated after
   adjusting for cynical hostility, depressive symptoms, and perceived
   discrimination (P<.001). Each of these variables was negatively
   associated with healthcare trust, and together these accounted for
   approximately 15% of racial differences in healthcare trust.
   ConclusionPsychological factors, not demographic characteristics, SES,
   or healthcare factors, appear to contribute the most to disparities in
   healthcare trust between older African Americans and non-Hispanic

AB In treated cohorts, individuals with bipolar disorder are more likely to
   report childhood adversities and recent stressors than individuals
   without bipolar disorder; similarly, in registry-based studies,
   childhood adversities are more common among individuals who later become
   hospitalized for bipolar disorder. Because these types of studies rely
   on treatment-seeking samples or hospital diagnoses, they leave
   unresolved the question of whether or not social experiences are
   involved in the etiology of bipolar disorder. We investigated the role
   of childhood adversities and adulthood stressors in liability for
   bipolar disorder using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on
   Alcohol and Related Conditions (n = 33 375). We analyzed risk for
   initial-onset and recurrent DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) manic episodes during the study's
   3-year follow-up period. Childhood physical abuse and sexual
   maltreatment were associated with significantly higher risks of both
   first-onset mania (odds ratio (OR) for abuse: 2.23; 95% confidence
   interval (CI) = 1.71, 2.91; OR for maltreatment: 2.10; CI = 1.55, 2.83)
   and recurrent mania (OR for abuse: 1.55; CI = 1.00, 2.40; OR for
   maltreatment: 1.60; CI = 1.00, 2.55). In addition, past-year stressors
   in the domains of interpersonal instability and financial hardship were
   associated with a significantly higher risk of incident and recurrent
   mania. Exposure to childhood adversity potentiated the effects of recent
   stressors on adult mania. Our findings demonstrate a role of social
   experiences in the initial onset of bipolar disorder, as well as in its
   prospective course, and are consistent with etiologic models of bipolar
   disorder that implicate deficits in developmentally established
   stress-response pathways.

   family-of-origin socioeconomic status (SES), in a sample of 2,494 pairs
   of adolescent twins, non-twin biological siblings, and adoptive siblings
   assessed with individually administered IQ tests. We hypothesized that
   SES would covary positively with additive-genetic variance and
   negatively with shared-environmental variance. Important potential
   confounds unaddressed in some past studies, such as twin-specific
   effects, assortative mating, and differential heritability by trait
   level, were found to be negligible. In our main analysis, we compared
   models by their sample-size corrected AIC, and base our statistical
   inference on model-averaged point estimates and standard errors.
   Additive-genetic variance increased with SES-an effect that was
   statistically significant and robust to model specification. We found no
   evidence that SES moderated shared-environmental influence. We attempt
   to explain the inconsistent replication record of these effects, and
   provide suggestions for future research.

AB Objective. Neighborhood disadvantage (ND), incivilities, and crime
   disproportionately impact minority women, discouraging physical activity
   (PA). Social support (SS) is a cultural tool promoting PA in minority
   women. Socially supportive environments may promote PA in disadvantaged
   neighborhoods, yet few studies have investigated the mediating role of
   social support among minority women. This study examined SS as a
   mediator among ND, incivilities, crime, and PA.
   Methods. The Health Is Power study aimed to increase PA in African
   American and Hispanic Latina women (N = 410) in Houston and Austin, TX.
   ND and crime data were taken from the National Neighborhood Crime Study.
   Incivilities were measured using the Pedestrian Environment Data Scan
   (PEDS). SS was measured using the Family and Friend Support for Exercise
   Habits scale and physical activity was measured using the International
   Physical Activity Questionnaire. Linear regression analysis was used to
   examine SS as a mediator following the Baron and Kenny method.
   Results. ND was negatively associated with PA and SS. SS was not a
   mediator as it was not significantly associated with ND, crime, and
   incivilities (F-(3,F-264) = 2.02, p > .05) or PA (F-(1,F-266) = 3.8 p =
   .052).
   Conclusion. ND significantly discourages PA and limits SS. Future
   research should focus on developing strategies to overcoming these
   negative environmental factors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB This article examines the place-making of global
   borderlandssemiautonomous, foreign-controlled geographical locations
   geared toward international exchange. I use the case study of the Subic
   Bay Freeport Zone (SBFZ), Philippines, as an example of a global
   borderland that resides within a space formerly occupied by a colonial
   power. I show how elite Filipinos adapted and transformed the spatial
   boundaries the U.S. military initially erected. The earlier boundaries
   differentiating Americans from Filipinos and military personnel from
   civilians helped the native elite to perpetuate familiar patterns of
   inequality based on nationality, class, and skin color. This
   differentiation occurs through: (1) the indirect and direct exclusion of
   the poor vis-a-vis the SBFZ's sociospatial organization and (2) the
   maintenance of cultural practices (litter, traffic) and moral discourses
   (of what is good and bad) formerly associated with the base, so that the
   SBFZ remains distinct from the surrounding city of Olongapo. Places of
   power have legacies, structural and spatial residues that continue to
   influence cultural practices and discourses even after the original uses
   of a place are transformed.

AB Scholarship in urban sociology has pointed to the reliance of city
   governments on ever-more market mechanisms for organizing social and
   economic policy. This form of governance involves prioritizing cities'
   cultural and social assets for their value in a global competition of
   urban brands, each competing for new infusions of human and investment
   capital. At the same time, however, cities have been at the center of
   seemingly progressive policy efforts aimed at promoting innovation,
   sustainability, and creativity. These themes represent a newly dominant
   planning discourse in cities across the globe. While researchers have
   thoroughly examined how creative classes and creative cities may exclude
   everyday, working-class, or poor residents, new urban imaginaries
   focused on sustainability potentially imply less stratified urban
   outcomes. Analyzing two high-profile interventions in Buenos Aires,
   Argentinaa sustainable urban regeneration plan for the historic
   downtown, and the creation of an arts cluster in the impoverished south
   of the citythis paper argues that despite divergent narratives, creative
   and sustainable urban projects suggest similar policy agendas, planning
   assumptions, and relationships to market mechanisms. Increasingly,
   global policies, whose design and objectives may appear to contradict
   market logics, may have outcomes that further them.

   disciplines' mounting predictions of Black exceptionalism' and imminent
   assimilation of Asians and Latina/os into whiteness/non-Blackness, a
   two-part alternative approach is briefly suggested: (1) critically
   engage the most theoretically and politically challenging scholarship in
   Black studies (notably outside sociology) that asserts the singularity
   of anti-Black racism; and (2) think through the social positions of
   non-Black peoples of color in light of and not losing sight of the first

AB This paper examines the precolonial and colonial history of race in
   Korea, which has been overlooked in the study of race, empire, and
   Korean history. While the study of race claims to be global, it
   implicitly assumes that racism becomes possible through physical contact
   with different races'. Rather than examining the emergent racial
   politics after the recent global migration, I suggest that racism could
   emerge regardless of collective racial migration and contact. Further,
   recent colonial studies have overlooked the colonized, the Japanese
   Empire and its colonized. Accordingly, I question the absence of race in
   Korean historiography and the assumption of Korean racial naivete based
   on the supposed racial homogeneity. Further, I demonstrate how the
   notions of race and blackness are fundamentally embedded in Koreans'
   understanding of the Age of Empire. Thus, this paper calls for a new
   global' approach to the study of race and empire that questions these
   overlooked assumptions.

AB After the Spanish-American War of 1898, anti-imperialists and
   imperialists hotly debated whether to keep the Philippines as a colony.
   The generation' schema, which communicated racialized views of
   Filipinos/as and their ability to self-govern once they had been
   educated by white Americans, developed in these debates. For both
   imperialists and anti-imperialists, the generation' schema was rooted in
   racialized neo-Lamarckian notions of how the environment (i.e. US
   tutelage and training) could change the character of a non-white group.
   Therefore, this article analyzes debates between anti-imperialists,
   imperialists, and Filipinos/as as they each deployed generations' in the
   field of the colonial state. Using archival sources authored by
   imperialists, anti-imperialists, and Filipinos I find imperialists
   argued that future generations of Filipinas/os held more hope for
   independence in order to dismiss Filipina/o and anti-imperialist demands
   for immediate independence, while anti-imperialists and Filipinos/as
   used the schema to garner policies that incrementally led to
   independence in 1946.

   Composed as much in the style of history as economics, what explains the
   appeal of this very long, carefully drafted and technically dense text?
   This review is woven of three threads: the method of research behind it;
   its fit with theory and practice in the critical social sciences; and
   what it exemplifies about the ambiguity of leaping from a science
   laboratory into the world of revolutionary praxis. To close, the
   European project of economic management will be briefly discussed,
   suggesting in reference to both French regulation theory and German
   Ordoliberalism why the recent Nobel Prize in Economics, which many

AB This article elaborates the social ontology and methodology of carnal
   sociology as a distinctive mode of social inquiry eschewing the
   spectatorial posture to grasp action-in-the-making, in the wake of
   debates triggered by my apprenticeship-based study of boxing as a
   plebeian bodily craft. First I critique the notions of (dualist) agent,
   (externalist) structure, and (mentalist) knowledge prevalent in the
   contemporary social sciences and sketch an alternative conception of the
   social animal, not just as wielder of symbols, but as sensate,
   suffering, skilled, sedimented, and situated creature of flesh and
   blood. I spotlight the primacy of embodied practical knowledge arising
   out of and continuously enmeshed in webs of action and consider what
   modes of inquiry are suited to deploying and mining this incarnate
   conception of the agent. I argue that enactive ethnography, the brand of
   immersive fieldwork based on "performing the phenomenon," is a fruitful
   path toward capturing the cognitive, conative, and cathectic schemata
   (habitus) that generate the practices and underlie the cosmos under
   investigation. But it takes social spunk and persistence to reap the
   rewards of "observant participation" and achieve social competency (as
   distinct from empirical saturation). In closing, I return to Bourdieu's
   dialogue with Pascal to consider the special difficulty and urgency of
   capturing the "spirit of acuteness" that animates such competency but
   vanishes from normal sociological accounts.

   rhythms seen through observation, photos, and videos, and informed
   interviewing. Combined methods give a larger picture of all the

   heavily from embodied mind theories in neurocognitive science and
   philosophy of mind. However, it also resonates with feminist
   epistemologies, such as sociologist Dorothy Smith's view that sociology
   should begin with and from the body. While both carnal sociology and the
   neurocognitive traditions it draws from ignore decades of feminist
   contributions to embodied epistemologies, I argue that feminist thought
   has much to contribute to materially grounded accounts of corporeal
   knowledge. Attention to feminist thought should also help enactive
   ethnographers consider the limits to the method, and the ethical and

AB The authority to diagnose is a distinguishing prerogative of modern
   medicine. While a growing body of research addresses various aspects of
   diagnosis, few studies analyze just how it is achieved through
   talk-in-interaction. This paper examines how clinicians assembled a
   diagnosis of a child who was evaluated for autism. Drawing on audio and
   video recordings at a clinic for developmental disabilities, I use a
   combination of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis to show how a
   critical fact about the child's mental functioning was formulated,
   challenged, and transformed across three consecutive stages of his
   evaluation: (1) testing, (2) a case conference among clinicians, and (3)
   an informing interview where the diagnosis was delivered to the parents.
   I analyze how this fact emerged as an outcome of clinician-child
   interactions, and how clinicians used storytelling to render its
   diagnostic implications. In addition to examining how these stories are
   methodically produced, I argue that they frame the child's behavior in
   ways that suggest a lack of competence while eliding the skills and
   competencies he may have been displaying.

AB Having more physical limitations predicts greater depressive symptoms.
   However, relatively few studies examine self-conceptions as potential
   explanations for this association. Using ordinary least squares
   regression on panel data collected in Miami-Dade County, Florida (2001
   and 2004, N = 1,362), we examine the effect of functional limitations on
   five dimensions of the self: self-esteem, mastery, mattering,
   introspection, and emotional reliance. We find that having more, and
   increasing, functional limitations diminishes self-esteem and mastery
   and increases introspection and emotional reliance. These dimensions of
   the self collectively account for approximately one third of the effect
   of limitations on depressive symptoms, with self-esteem and mastery
   having the largest mediating effects. This study builds on prior
   findings by using panel data to address not only the influence of
   functional impairment on multiple dimensions of the self-concept but
   also the role of each in explaining disability's effect on depressive
   symptoms. It also responds to the call for the sociology of mental
   health to give greater attention to self and identity processes.

AB Background: Marked increases in mean body mass index (BMI). and
   prevalence of obesity and overweight in the United States are well
   known. However, whether these average increases were accompanied by
   changing dispersion (or SD) remains understudied.
   Objective: We investigated population-level changes in the BMI
   distribution over time to understand how changes in dispersion reflect
   between-group compared with within-group inequalities in weight gain in
   the United States.
   Design: Using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
   survey (1993-2012), we analyzed associations between mean, SD, and
   median BMI and BMI at the 5th and 95th percentiles for 3,050,992
   non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic men and women aged
   25-64 y.
   Results: Overall, an increase of 1.0 in mean BMI (in kg/m(2)) was
   associated with an increase of 0.70 (95% CI: 0.67, 0.73) in the SD of
   BMI. A change of 1.0 in median BMI was associated with a change of 0.18
   (95% CI: 0.14, 0.21) in the BMI value at the 5th percentile compared
   with a change of 2.94 (95% Cl: 2.81, 3.07) at the 95th percentile.
   Quantile-quantile plots showed unequal changes in the BMI distribution,
   with pronounced changes at higher percentiles. Similar patterns were
   observed in subgroups stratified by sex, race-ethnicity, and education
   with non-Hispanic black women and women with less than a high school
   education having highest mean BMI, SD of BMI, and BMI values at the 5th
   and 95th percentiles.
   Conclusions: Mean BMI, and the percentage of overweight and obese
   individuals do not fully describe population changes in BMI. Increases
   in within-group inequality in BMI represent an underrecognized
   characteristic of population-level weight gain. Crucially, similar
   increases in dispersion within groups suggest that growing inequalities
   in BMI at the population level are not driven by these socioeconomic and
   demographic factors. Future research should focus on understanding
   factors driving inequalities in weight gain between individuals.

AB Conducting research in areas with diverse cultures requires attention to
   community sensitization and involvement. The process of community
   engagement is described for a large community-based, cluster-randomized,
   controlled trial comparing daily 4% chlorhexidine umbilical cord wash to
   dry cord care for neonatal mortality prevention in Southern Province,
   Zambia. Study preparations required baseline formative ethnographic
   research, substantial community sensitization, and engagement with three
   levels of stakeholders, each necessitating different strategies.
   Cluster-specific birth notification systems developed with traditional
   leadership and community members using community-selected data
   collectors resulted in a post-natal home visit within 48 hours of birth
   in 96% of births. Of 39,679 pregnant women enrolled (93% of the target
   of 42,570), only 3.7% were lost to follow-up or withdrew antenatally;
   0.2% live-born neonates were lost by day 28 of follow-up. Conducting
   this trial in close collaboration with traditional, administrative,
   political, and community stakeholders facilitated excellent study
   participation, despite structural and sociocultural challenges.

AB Objective. To describe end-stage renal disease (ESRD) quality of care
   (receipt of pre-ESRD nephrology care, access to kidney transplantation,
   and placement of permanent vascular access for dialysis) in US patients
   with ESRD due to lupus nephritis (LN-ESRD) and to examine whether
   quality measures differ by patient sociodemographic characteristics or
   US region.
   Methods. National surveillance data on patients in the US in whom
   treatment for LN-ESRD was initiated between July 2005 and September 2011
   (n = 6,594) were analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs)
   with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were determined for each quality
   measure, according to sociodemographic factors and US region.
   Results. Overall, 71% of the patients received nephrology care prior to
   ESRD. Black and Hispanic patients were less likely than white patients
   to receive pre-ESRD care (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.63-0.85] and OR 0.73 [95% CI
   0.60-0.88], respectively) and to be placed on the kidney transplant
   waitlist within the first year after the start of ESRD (HR 0.78 [95% CI
   0.68-0.91] and HR 0.82 [95% CI 0.68-0.98], respectively). Those with
   Medicaid (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.44-0.58]) or no insurance (HR 0.36 [95% CI
   0.29-0.44]) were less likely than those with private insurance to be
   placed on the waitlist. Only 24% had a permanent vascular access, and
   placement was even less likely among the uninsured (OR 0.62 [95% CI
   0.49-0.79]). ESRD quality-of-care measures varied 2-3-fold across
   regions of the US, with patients in the Northeast and Northwest
   generally having higher probabilities of adequate care.
   Conclusion. LN-ESRD patients have suboptimal ESRD care, particularly
   with regard to placement of dialysis vascular access. Minority
   race/ethnicity and lack of private insurance are associated with
   inadequate ESRD care. Further studies are warranted to examine
   multilevel barriers to, and develop targeted interventions to improve
   delivery of, care among patients with LN-ESRD.

   judge a woman with physical disability more negatively than a woman with
   intellectual disability, but that there would be a less pronounced
   difference for judgments of men with physical and intellectual
   disability. Participants (N = 173) read short descriptions of a male or
   female character who was physically or intellectually disabled. They
   evaluated the character's warmth and competence and reported how much
   social distance they wanted from the character. Contrary to our
   expectations, participants reported significantly less desire for social
   distance from physically disabled women than intellectually disabled
   women. As predicted, evaluations of men were not affected by the type of
   disability the target character possessed.

   from the model and modeling exercises demonstrate the need to increase
   energy efficiency because the reduction in demand it generates extends
   the policy space for decreasing emissions and reduces vulnerability to

AB Residential fires, while constituting a small fraction of fire
   incidents, are responsible for the majority of civilian fire-related
   injuries. This study investigates census tract neighborhood
   socioeconomic factors as correlates of civilian injuries occurring
   during residential fires in Baltimore, Maryland, between 2004 and 2007.
   Civilian residential fire related injuries were geocoded and linked to
   the American Community Survey 2005-2009 data. Negative binomial
   regression was used to analyze the relationship between fire-injury
   rates and neighborhood socioeconomic indicators including household
   income and percentages of households below the poverty line, persons
   aged 25 years or older with at least a bachelor's degree, homes built in
   1939 or earlier, vacant properties, and owner-occupied homes. Between
   January 2004 and July 2007, there were 482 civilian fire-related
   injuries that occurred during 309 fires. At the census tract level, a
   10% increase in the number of vacant homes was associated with an
   increase in injury rates by a factor of 1.28 (95% confidence interval
   1.05-1.55). A 10% increase in persons aged more than 25 years with at
   least a bachelor's degree was associated with a decrease in injury rates
   by a factor of 0.86 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.96). Neighborhood
   measures of education and housing age proved good indicators for
   identifying areas with a higher burden of fire-related injuries. Such
   analyses can be useful for fire department planning.

AB Implementation of the Medicare ESRD prospective payment system (PPS) and
   changes to dosing guidelines for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents
   (ESAs) in 2011 appear to have influenced use of injectable medications
   among dialysis patients. Given historically higher ESA and vitamin D use
   among black patients, we assessed the effect of these policy changes on
   racial disparities in the management of anemia and mineral metabolism.
   Analyses used cross-sectional monthly cohorts for a period-prevalent
   sample of 7384 maintenance hemodialysis patients at 132 facilities from
   the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) Practice
   Monitor. Linear splines with knots at each policy change were used in
   survey-weighted regressions to estimate time trends in hemoglobin (Hgb),
   erythropoietin (EPO) dose, intravenous (IV) iron dose, ferritin,
   transferrin saturation (TSAT) concentration, parathyroid hormone (PTH),
   IV vitamin D dose, cinacalcet use, and phosphate binder use. From August
   2010 to December 2011, mean Hgb declined from 11.5 to 11.0 g/dI
   (P<0.001), mean EPO dose declined from 20,506 to 14,777 U/wk (P<0.001),
   and mean serum PTH increased from 340 to 435 pg/ml (P<0.001). No
   meaningful differences by race were observed regarding the rates of
   change of management practices or laboratory measures (all P>0.21). Mean
   EPO and vitamin D dose and serum PTH levels remained higher in black's.
   Despite evidence that anemia and mineral metabolism management practices
   have changed significantly over time, there was no immediate indication
   of racial disparities resulting from implementation of the PPS or ESA
   label change. Further studies are needed to examine effects among
   patient and facility subgroups.

   subculture and locates it along the two dimensions of distinctiveness

AB The issue of implementing diameter caps as a means of preserving
   old-growth trees on forest restoration projects continues to permeate
   collaborative land management discussions and treatment decisions on
   public lands in the Southwest and, indeed, throughout the western United
   States. We examine the ecological and social results of the
   collaborative Fort Valley Ecosystem Restoration Project on U.S. Forest
   Service lands near Flagstaff, Arizona. Since this experiment had areas
   treated with and without a diameter cap, we sought to determine: 1) the
   ecological consequences of implementing a 16-inch diameter cap, 2)
   whether the fears and concerns of the environmental groups who proposed
   the diameter cap were, in fact, warranted, and 3) how the local
   collaborative responded to implementing the diameter cap. The ecological
   data revealed that a site's management history played a major role in
   how a diameter cap would affect the restoration of stand structure in
   terms of tree density and tree size. The data suggest that, if
   implemented, diameter caps are best applied in a manner that takes into
   account both site conditions and stand management history. In general,
   we found the concerns about the loss of old-growth trees due to thinning
   treatments were not realized at Fort Valley. Finally, stakeholder
   surveys indicate that while the discussion of diameter caps caused
   tension within the collaborative group, the overall goal of forest
   restoration was not compromised. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Objective: To evaluate the associations between hearing loss and
   educational attainment, income, and unemployment/underemployment in U.S.
   adults.
   Study Design: National cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Ambulatory examination centers.
   Patients: Adults aged 20 to 69 years who participated in the 1999 to
   2002 cycles of the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination
   Survey) audiometric evaluation and income questionnaire (N = 3,379).
   Intervention(s): Pure-tone audiometry, with hearing loss defined by
   World Health Organization criteria of bilateral pure-tone average of
   more than 25 dB (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz).
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Low educational attainment, defined as not
   completing high school; low income, defined as family income less than
   $20,000 per year; and unemployment or underemployment, defined as not
   having a job or working less than 35 hours per week.
   Results: Individuals with hearing loss had 3.21 times higher odds of low
   educational attainment (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.20-4.68)
   compared with normal-hearing individuals. Controlling for education,
   age, sex, and race, individuals with hearing loss had 1.58 times higher
   odds of low income (95% CI, 1.16-2.15) and 1.98 times higher odds of
   being unemployed or underemployed (95% CI, 1.38-2.85) compared with
   normal-hearing individuals.
   Conclusion: Hearing loss is associated with low educational attainment
   in U.S. adults. Even after controlling for education and important
   demographic factors, hearing loss is independently associated with
   economic hardship, including both low income and
   unemployment/underemployment. The societal impact of hearing loss is
   profound in this nationally representative study and should be further
   evaluated with longitudinal cohorts. Received institutional review board

AB A growing body of research shows that cognitive remediation (COG REM),
   consisting of drill-and-practice and/or strategy training in
   neurocognitive functions, produces moderate improvements in
   neurocognition. These improvements generalize to functioning when COG
   REM is provided with other rehabilitation interventions (Wykes et al.,
   2011). The number of studies using COG REM as an adjunct to other
   behavioral-based rehabilitation interventions however remains small and
   consists of widely varying interventions with few active control
   conditions. This study compared the effects of an extended (6-month),
   standardized, computer-assisted cognitive remediation intervention,
   administered along with a standardized program of social skills-training
   (SST), with those of an active control condition that included
   participation in the same SST program and a computer skills training
   program (Computer Skills). Sixty-four individuals with schizophrenia
   recruited from two treatment sites were randomly assigned to one of two
   conditions and were assessed by blinded raters on neurocognitive
   measures, performance-based measures of social skill, and ratings of
   psychosocial function before and after treatment. Results revealed that
   the COG REM group improved significantly more in attention, working
   memory, and empathy than the Computer Skills group, but there were no
   differences between groups on other measures of psychosocial functioning
   or skills. Taken together, these findings suggest that COG REM used in
   the context of other evidence-based psychosocial interventions (SST)
   improves working memory in schizophrenia and suggests that this effect
   may generalize to improved empathy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB While strong arguments can be made that prosumption today can be seen as
   a primal phenomenon and an evolutionary process, the strongest argument
   is that it involves a revolutionary set of developments producing a
   dramatically new world of prosumption. While those developments can be
   seen in both the material and digital worlds (although they augment one
   another), they are clearest in the digital world, especially the
   Internet. Among the forces that are creating this new world of
   consumption are new means of prosumption (e.g., IKEA, massive online
   open courses, automated teller machines) which are made possible by a
   variety of new technologies (the computer, the Internet). However,
   overarching these and other changes is the emergence of a new form of
   capitalism, prosumer capitalism. In addition to exploiting often
   low-paid commodified workers, prosumer capitalism increasingly
   prioritizes the exploitation of largely uncommodified prosumers who are
   generally unpaid. Prosumers offer the capitalist many other advantages
   (e.g., no long-term obligations such as high-cost benefit programs).
   There are few, if any, obligations to prosumers with the result that
   they fit well with today's reigning neoliberal philosophy. The new world
   of prosumption could have been a more positive development had it not
   been usurped by capitalist interests.

AB This article considers the question of whether, as a number of scholars
   have suggested, we can (or should) develop a theory of institutions from
   the perspective of evolutionary psychology (EP), construed broadly. To
   do so, the article reviews EP's core explanatory strategy and the main
   claims that have been made by proponents of an EP institutional theory,
   focusing on arguments about (1) welfare states and (2) honor cultures
   and the institutions associated with them. On the one hand, the article
   argues, there are both logical and empirical problems with current
   efforts to develop EP theories of these institutional domains. On the
   other hand, sociology's relative absence from the development of such
   theories contributes to these problems, and sociologists can learn from
   EP. Above all, insights drawn from EP may help us to construct better
   accounts of various institutions' micro-foundations. To this end,
   collaboration and exchange between EP scholars and sociologists is
   called for, and some suggestions are made about how this might be done
   most fruitfully.

AB Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, plays an important role in
   reproduction and angiogenesis. Studies examining leptin in preeclampsia
   are inconsistent, possibly because of small sample sizes and variability
   in sampling and outcome. We conducted a nested case-control study to
   examine associations between serum leptin (measured: 9-26 weeks
   gestation) and preeclampsia among 430 primiparous preeclamptic women and
   316 primiparous normotensive controls from the Danish National Birth
   Cohort. Median (interquartile range) leptin concentrations were
   calculated. Associations between leptin and preeclampsia (blood pressure
   >= 140/90 mm Hg), term preeclampsia (preeclampsia and delivery >= 37
   weeks gestation), or preterm preeclampsia (preeclampsia and delivery <37
   weeks gestation) were examined using generalized linear models adjusting
   for body mass index, gestational age at blood draw, maternal age,
   smoking, and socio-occupational status. As leptin is increased in obese
   women and the risk of preeclampsia increases with body mass index, we
   used the Sobel test to examine whether leptin is a mediator of this
   relationship. After adjustments, leptin concentrations were
   significantly higher in women with preeclampsia (30.5 [24.6]; P=0.0117)
   and term preeclampsia (30.4 [24.9]; P=0.0228) compared with controls
   (20.9 [28.3]). There was no significant difference between preterm
   preeclampsia (30.6 [23.4]; P=0.2210) and controls. Leptin is a possible
   mediator of the association between body mass index and preeclampsia
   (P=0.0276). Leptin concentrations are higher in women with preeclampsia
   compared with normotensive controls and may mediate some of the
   relationship between body mass index and preeclampsia.

AB The state incentivizes investors to entrust capital to public
   corporations by granting shareholders enforceable rights over managers.
   However, these rights create legal access points through which social
   movements can make nonpecuniary claims on the corporation. I use
   original historical research on the Securities and Exchange Commission's
   administration of federal securities law to show that concern over
   nonpecuniary claims motivates the state to enact the role of market
   protector. In this role, the commission insulates managers of
   corporations from shareholders' claims that it deems illegitimate
   because they are insufficiently profit-oriented. Thus the inverse of
   Polanyi's observation that society protects itself from markets is also
   true: the state creates market boundaries so that always embedded
   markets function more like autonomous, profit-oriented markets.
   Accordingly, the extent to which corporate democracy represents general,
   social interests or narrow, profit-oriented interests is largely a
   function of political contestation and state policy.

AB A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human mu-opioid receptor
   gene (OPRM1 A118G) has been widely studied for its association in drug
   addiction, pain sensitivity, and, more recently, social behavior. The
   endogenous opioid system has been shown to regulate social distress and
   reward in a variety of animal models. However, mechanisms underlying the
   associations between the OPRM1 A118G SNP and these behaviors have not
   been clarified. We used a mouse model possessing the human equivalent
   nucleotide/ amino acid substitution to study social affiliation and
   social defeat behaviors. In mice with the Oprm1 A112G SNP, we
   demonstrate that the G allele is associated with an increase in
   home-cage dominance and increased motivation for nonaggressive social
   interactions, similar to what is reported in human populations. When
   challenged by a resident aggressor, G-allele carriers expressed less
   submissive behavior and exhibited resilience to social defeat,
   demonstrated by a lack of subsequent social avoidance and reductions in
   anhedonia as measured by intracranial self-stimulation. Protection from
   social defeat in G-allele carriers was associated with a greater
   induction of c-fos in a resilience circuit comprising the nucleus
   accumbens and periaqueductal gray. These findings led us to test the
   role of endogenous opioids in the A112G mice. Wedemonstrate that the
   increase in social affiliation inGcarriers is blocked by pretreatment
   with naloxone. Together, these data suggest a mechanism involving
   altered hedonic state and neural activation as well as altered
   endogenous opioid tone in the differential response to aversive and
   rewarding social stimuli in G-allele carriers.

AB Survey experiments, like vignette and conjoint analyses, are widely used
   in the social sciences to elicit stated preferences and study how humans
   make multidimensional choices. However, there is a paucity of research
   on the external validity of these methods that examines whether the
   determinants that explain hypothetical choices made by survey
   respondents match the determinants that explain what subjects actually
   do when making similar choices in real-world situations. This study
   compares results from conjoint and vignette analyses on which immigrant
   attributes generate support for naturalization with closely
   corresponding behavioral data from a natural experiment in Switzerland,
   where some municipalities used referendums to decide on the citizenship
   applications of foreign residents. Using a representative sample from
   the same population and the official descriptions of applicant
   characteristics that voters received before each referendum as a
   behavioral benchmark, we find that the effects of the applicant
   attributes estimated from the survey experiments perform remarkably well
   in recovering the effects of the same attributes in the behavioral
   benchmark. We also find important differences in the relative
   performances of the different designs. Overall, the paired conjoint
   design, where respondents evaluate two immigrants side by side, comes
   closest to the behavioral benchmark; on average, its estimates are
   within 2% percentage points of the effects in the behavioral benchmark.

AB Background
   Approximately 800 women die of pregnancy-related complications every
   day. Over half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Most
   maternal deaths can be prevented with high quality maternal health
   services. It is well established that use of maternal health services
   vary by place of residence and socioeconomic status (SES), but few
   studies have examined the determinants of quality of maternal health
   services in SSA. The purpose of this study is to examine the
   determinants of antenatal care (ANC) quality in Ghana-focusing on the
   role of place of residence and SES (education and wealth). The analysis
   also examines the interactions of these variables and the mediating role
   of ANC timing, frequency, facility type, and provider type.
   Methods
   The data are from the Ghana Maternal Health Survey (N = 4,868). Analytic
   techniques include multilevel linear regression with mediation and
   moderation analysis.
   Results
   Urban residence and higher SES are positively associated with higher ANC
   quality, but the urban effect is completely explained by
   sociodemographic factors. Specifically, about half of the urban effect
   is explained by education and wealth alone, with other variables
   accounting for the remainder. The effects of education are conditional
   on wealth and are strongest for poor women. Starting ANC visits early
   and attending the recommended four visits as well as receiving ANC from
   a higher level facility and from a skilled provider are associated with
   higher quality ANC. These factors partially explain the SES
   differentials.

AB BACKGROUND: Early life stress (ELS) can compromise development, with
   higher amounts of adversity linked to behavioral problems. To understand
   this linkage, a growing body of research has examined two brain regions
   involved with socioemotional functioning-amygdala and hippocampus. Yet
   empirical studies have reported increases, decreases, and no differences
   within human and nonhuman animal samples exposed to different forms of
   ELS. This divergence in findings may stem from methodological factors,
   nonlinear effects of ELS, or both.
   METHODS: We completed rigorous hand-tracing of the amygdala and
   hippocampus in three samples of children who experienced different forms
   of ELS (i.e., physical abuse, early neglect, or low socioeconomic
   status). Interviews were also conducted with children and their parents
   or guardians to collect data about cumulative life stress. The same data
   were also collected in a fourth sample of comparison children who had
   not experienced any of these forms of ELS.
   RESULTS: Smaller amygdala volumes were found for children exposed to
   these different forms of ELS. Smaller hippocampal volumes were also
   noted for children who were physically abused or from low socioeconomic
   status households. Smaller amygdala and hippocampal volumes were also
   associated with greater cumulative stress exposure and behavioral
   problems. Hippocampal volumes partially mediated the relationship
   between ELS and greater behavioral problems.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests ELS may shape the development of brain
   areas involved with emotion processing and regulation in similar ways.
   Differences in the amygdala and hippocampus may be a shared diathesis
   for later negative outcomes related to ELS.

AB Functional accounts of hierarchy propose that hierarchy increases group
   coordination and reduces conflict. In contrast, dysfunctional accounts
   claim that hierarchy impairs performance by preventing low-ranking team
   members from voicing their potentially valuable perspectives and
   insights. The current research presents evidence for both the functional
   and dysfunctional accounts of hierarchy within the same dataset.
   Specifically, we offer empirical evidence that hierarchical cultural
   values affect the outcomes of teams in high-stakes environments through
   group processes. Experimental data from a sample of expert mountain
   climbers from 27 countries confirmed that climbers expect that a
   hierarchical culture leads to improved team coordination among climbing
   teams, but impaired psychological safety and information sharing
   compared with an egalitarian culture. An archival analysis of 30,625
   Himalayan mountain climbers from 56 countries on 5,104 expeditions found
   that hierarchy both elevated and killed in the Himalayas: Expeditions
   from more hierarchical countries had more climbers reach the summit, but
   also more climbers die along the way. Importantly, we established the
   role of group processes by showing that these effects occurred only for
   group, but not solo, expeditions. These findings were robust to
   controlling for environmental factors, risk preferences,
   expedition-level characteristics, country-level characteristics, and
   other cultural values. Overall, this research demonstrates that
   endorsing cultural values related to hierarchy can simultaneously
   improve and undermine group performance.

   mountainous territory of northeastern Albania, is home to two culturally
   and linguistically distinct peoples: Gorani and Albanians. We
   investigated the divergences and convergences of ethnobotanical
   strategies among the groups with respect to the use of 104 plant

   have pushed for a better understanding of the relationship between
   intimacy and economy. Such efforts have been inspired, in large part, by
   Viviana Zelizer (2000, 2005). In her inquiry on the purchase of
   intimacy, Zelizer proposed seminal differentiations between the "hostile
   worlds," "nothing but," and "connected lives" perspectives, and advanced
   a cultural relational analysis of the economy. In this essay, we review
   research that applies Zelizer's framework, and suggest substantive and

AB A global anti-corruption movement rapidly mobilized and
   institutionalized during the mid-1990s. Using data for 119 countries
   between 1984 and 2012, I examine the effects of this movement on rated
   levels of perceived corruption. Results from multivariate regression
   analyses show that the global surge in anti-corruption organizing,
   monitoring, and legalization was paradoxically associated with an
   increase in rated levels of corruption, over and above a host of
   political, economic, social, and cultural factors shown in previous
   research to explain perceived corruption. With the international
   standardization, scrutinization, and stigmatization of corruption,
   activities once hidden from view or previously regarded as standard
   operating procedure' came to be denominated, detected, and decried as
   illegitimate. In turn, these processes gave the impression that
   corruption worsened, when in fact it may have remained stable or even
   improved. These findings lend support to institutional approaches in
   sociology and the information paradox' concept in political science.

AB Background:Delta(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol has been shown to modulate
   anxiety and facilitate the extinction of fear by inhibiting amygdala
   reactivity. Since functional coupling between the amygdala and
   prefrontal cortex is implicated in affective processes, it is possible
   that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol affects amygdala-prefrontal cortex
   functional connectivity in ways that differ across amygdala subregions:
   basolateral, centromedial, and superficial.
   Methods: The aim of the study was to examine the effects of
   Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol on functional connectivity between
   amygdala subregions and the prefrontal cortex during socio-emotional
   threat in healthy adults using a double-blind, placebocontrolled,
   within-subjects design. Sixteen subjects completed a functional magnetic
   resonance imaging task designed to probe amygdala responses to social
   threat. Amygdala subregion-prefrontal cortex functional connectivity was
   compared between Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and placebo using
   generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses.
   Results: Findings indicated that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol enhanced
   basolateral and superficial amygdala connectivity to the rostral
   anterior cingulate/medial prefrontal cortex.
   Conclusion: These effects, including Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol's
   potential ability to reduce threat perception or enhance socioemotional
   regulation, may help understand the neurocircuitry of affect.

AB Objectives. We investigated 50-year US trends in age at menarche by
   socioeconomic position (SEP) and race/ethnicity because data are scant
   and contradictory.
   Methods. We analyzed data by income and education for US-born
   non-Hispanic Black and White women aged 25 to 74 years in the National
   Health Examination Survey (NHES) I (1959-1962), National Health
   Examination and Nutrition Surveys (NHANES) I-III (1971-1994), and NHANES
   1999-2008.
   Results. In NHES I, average age at menarche among White women in the
   20th (lowest) versus 80th (highest) income percentiles was 0.26 years
   higher (95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.09, 0.61), but by NHANES
   2005-2008 it had reversed and was -0.33 years lower (95% CI = -0.54,
   -0.11); no socioeconomic gradients occurred among Black women. The
   proportion with onset at younger than 11 years increased only among
   women with low SEP, among Blacks and Whites (P for trend <.05), and high
   rates of change occurred solely among Black women (all SEP strata) and
   low-income White women who underwent menarche before 1960.
   Conclusions. Trends in US age at menarche vary by SEP and race/ethnicity
   in ways that pose challenges to several leading clinical, public health,
   and social explanations for early age at menarche and that underscore
   why analyses must jointly include data on race/ethnicity and
   socioeconomic position. Future research is needed to explain these
   trends.

AB Objectives. We examined variations in having a usual source of care
   (USC) among non-Hispanic White and Asian American adults in California.
   Methods. Data were from the 2005 and 2009 California Health Interview
   Survey. Using a modified Anderson model, we used multiple logistic
   regression to compare odds of having a USC between non-Hispanic White (n
   = 38 554) and Asian American adults (n = 7566) and to examine
   associations with acculturation factors (English proficiency, length of
   residence, residence in a racially concordant neighborhood) and key
   enabling (employment, income, insurance) and predisposing (education)
   factors.
   Results. Race-related disparities between Asian Americans and
   non-Hispanic Whites in having a USC were no longer significant after
   accounting for acculturation factors. Limited English proficiency and
   short time in the United States (< 5 years) were significantly
   associated with not having a USC for both races. Increasing levels of
   education and insurance were not associated with better access among
   Asian Americans.
   Conclusions. Key differences exist in how Asian American and
   non-Hispanic White adults access care. Acculturation factors are key
   drivers of disparities and should be included in access-to-care models
   with Asians. Insurance and education are differentially significant for
   Asian Americans and non-Hispanic Whites.

   determine whether uterine cancer survival varied by self-reported
   relationship status.
   Methods. Data were downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results program for women diagnosed with uterine cancer (between
   1991 and 2010 in nine geographic regions). Patients with complete
   clinical data for analysis were categorized as married, single, widowed
   or other (divorced or separated). Differences in distributions were
   evaluated using Chi-square, exact and/or Mantel-Haenszel test. Uterine
   cancer survival was analyzed by Kaplan Meier method with log-rank test
   and multivariate Cox regression analysis.
   Results. Of 47,420 eligible patients, 56% were married, 15% were single
   and 19% were widows. Married vs. non-married women had a higher

   cancer and local disease (p < 0.0001), and a reduced risk of cancer
   death (HR = 0.8, 95% CI = 0.77-0.84). Multivariate evaluation of uterine
   cancer survival by relationship type indicated that widows consistently
   had significantly worse uterine cancer sutvival than single, married and
   other women in all patients and subset analyses (p < 0.0001).
   Conclusion. While marital status is associated with differential uterine
   cancer survival, evaluation of selfreported relationship by type
   indicated that the poor outcome observed in widows explained most of the
   benefit attributed to marriage. This report identifies widows as a new

   benefiting from personalized care and social support. Published by

AB Evidence of protest expansion both in the United States and abroad has
   stimulated theoretical discussion of a "movement society," with some
   arguing that protest activities are becoming a standard feature of
   democratic politics. In advancing this claim, many have highlighted the
   role of domestic factors for example, generational change or economic
   affluence without fully accounting for the possibility that
   international dynamics may play an important role as well. The lack of
   work is surprising not only because the trend in protest is
   international in scope, but also because work in comparative sociology
   suggests globalization may make an important contribution. This study
   addresses the empirical gap by examining how political globalization (as
   measured by memberships in international organizations) and economic
   globalization (as measured by trade activity and foreign investment)
   influence trends in protest participation. Using data from World Values
   Surveys of 37,716 respondents in 17 advanced democracies merged with
   data on several national and international indicators, this study
   examines how the probability of participating in protest has changed
   over time as a result of these two forms of globalization. The results
   of multivariate, multilevel analysis combined with simulations indicate
   that trends in political globalization have expanded protest activity,
   while trends in economic globalization have limited that expansion.
   These results suggest that social movement scholarship should continue
   to examine the implications of globalization for protest behavior and
   other social movement dynamics.

AB A central mechanism by which medicalization occurs is through domain
   expansion, wherein an existing diagnostic definition widens to include
   cases beyond its original scope. This has been especially commonplace
   with respect to mental illness diagnoses. In contrast, there are few
   clear instances of domain contraction. The controversy surrounding the
   revisions to autism in advance of the publication of the fifth edition
   of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) is
   thus of considerable importance. Many autism advocates feared the new
   definition of autism would exclude a significant number of individuals
   who are already diagnosed. We examine lay claims making to this
   perceived instance of domain contraction through a content analysis of
   online reader comments to a high-profile New York Times article
   reporting on the DSM-5 autism criteria. Our analysis points to an
   amorphous group of social stakeholders who express a variety of concerns
   about unabated medicalization. We also identify the stance of diagnostic
   domain defense, which is an oppositional response by laypeople with a
   personal connection to a diagnosis to a real or perceived challenge to
   the definitional boundaries of that diagnosis. Our analysis explicates
   the dimensions of diagnostic domain defense, which include its grounding
   in experiential certainty and anguish, and the accrual and deployment of
   diagnostic resources. We make a case for the utility of this concept for
   theorizing the relationship between lay claims making, diagnoses, and
   medicalization. We also make a case for the use of online reader
   comments as a way to unobtrusively study lay claims making related to
   pressing social problems in the Internet era.

AB Rock climbing entails far more than simply climbing rocks. Modern sport
   climbing is, rather, rooted in the myriad ways in which climbers engage
   with rock climbs, the specific human-made spaces mapped onto the cliff
   faces that athletes seek to ascend. This interaction includes forms of
   learning to read and create visual representations of climbs, physically
   training to prepare their bodies and hone their techniques, learning how
   to haptically and kinaesthetically engage with and learn from the rock,
   and overall developing a climbing-specific habitus. By exploring the
   relationship between a number of climbers and a climb in Rumney, New
   Hampshire, called Pretzel Logic, this article argues that the climb and
   climber are mutually constituted through a highly fluid actor-object
   engagement rooted in ongoing learning and adaptation. By extension, this
   article argues that interaction with objects-and not solely other
   humans-can be central to the formation of habitus and bodily practice.

AB Despite the important roles families play in the lives of many
   individuals with mental illness across cultures, there is a dearth of
   data worldwide on how family members perceive the process of cultural
   assessment as well as to how to best include them. This study addresses
   this gap in our knowledge through analysis of data collected across six
   countries as part of a DSM-5 Field Trial of the Cultural Formulation
   Interview (CFI). At clinician discretion, individuals who accompanied
   patients to the clinic visit (i.e. patient companions) at the time the
   CFI was conducted were invited to participate in the cultural assessment
   and answer questions about their experience. The specific aims of this
   paper are (1) to describe patterns of participation of patient
   companions in the CFI across the six countries, and (2) to examine the
   comparative feasibility, acceptability, and clinical utility of the CFI
   from companion perspectives through analysis of both quantitative and
   qualitative data. Among the 321 patient interviews, only 86 (at four of
   12 sites) included companions, all of whom were family members or other
   relatives. The utility, feasibility and acceptability of the CFI were
   rated favourably by relatives, supported by qualitative analyses of
   debriefing interviews. Cross-site differences in frequency of
   accompaniment merit further study.

AB BackgroundAlcohol consumption is typically correlated with the alcohol
   use behaviors of one's peers. Previous research has suggested that this
   positive relationship could be due to social selection, social
   influence, or a combination of both processes. However, few studies have
   considered the role of shared genetic and environmental influences in
   conjunction with causal processes.
   MethodsThis study uses data from a sample of male twins (N=1,790) who
   provided retrospective reports of their own alcohol consumption and
   their peers' alcohol-related behaviors, from adolescence into young
   adulthood (ages 12 to 25). Structural equation modeling was employed to
   compare 3 plausible models of genetic and environmental influences on
   the relationship between phenotypes over time.
   ResultsModel fitting indicated that one's own alcohol consumption and
   the alcohol use of one's peers are related through both genetic and
   shared environmental factors and through unique environmental causal
   influences. The relative magnitude of these factors, and their
   contribution to covariation, changed over time, with genetic factors
   becoming more meaningful later in development.
   ConclusionsPeers' alcohol use behaviors and one's own alcohol
   consumption are related through a complex combination of genetic and
   environmental factors that act via correlated factors and the
   complementary causal mechanisms of social selection and influence.
   Understanding these processes can inform risk assessment as well as
   improve our ability to model the development of alcohol use.

AB In this study, I used the growth curve model to examine the association
   between grandparents' (first generation (G1)) life-course exposure to
   chronic poverty and grandchildren's (third generation (G3)) body mass
   index (BMI; weight (kg)/height (m)(2)) growth trajectories. This
   association was estimated separately for male and female grandchildren.
   Analyses were based on prospective data from a US longitudinal survey,
   the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (1968-2011), and 2 of its
   supplemental studies: the Child Development Supplement (1997-2011) and
   the Transition into Adulthood Study (1997-2011). A prospectively
   enrolled nationally representative cohort of 2,613 G3 youth (1,323 male,
   1,290 female) sampled in the 2 supplemental studies was linked to 1,719
   grandparents from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics core sample.
   Chronic exposure to poverty among grandparents was prospectively
   ascertained annually over a 30-year period prior to the collection of
   data on grandchildren. Findings suggested that grandparents' chronic
   poverty exposure was positively associated with the slope of the BMI
   trajectory among granddaughters (beta = 0.10, 95% confidence interval:
   0.03, 0.17) but not among grandsons (beta = 0.02, 95% confidence
   interval: -0.04, 0.08). The association between grandparents' chronic
   poverty exposure and granddaughters' BMI growth slope remained even
   after controlling for parental (second generation (G2)) socioeconomic
   status and BMI.

AB Objectives To determine whether there is a relationship between early
   life adversity (ELA) and biological parameters known to predict health
   risks and to examine the extent to which circumstances in midlife
   mediate this relationship.
   Methods We analyzed data on 1180 respondents from the biomarker
   subsample of the second wave of the National Survey of Midlife
   Development in the United States. ELA assessments were based on
   childhood socioeconomic disadvantage (i.e., on welfare, perceived low
   income, and less educated parents) and other stressors (e.g., parental
   death, parental divorce, and parental physical abuse). The outcome
   variable was cumulative allostatic load (AL), a marker of biological
   risk. We also incorporate information on adult circumstances, including
   than following: education, social relationships, and health behaviors.
   Results Childhood socioeconomic adversity and physical abuse were
   associated with increased AL (B = 0.094, standard error = 0.041, and B =
   0.263, standard error = 0.091 respectively), with nonsignificant
   associations for parental divorce and death with AL. Adult education
   mediated the relationship between socioeconomic ELA and cumulative AL to
   the point of nonsignificance, with this factor alone explaining nearly
   40% of the relationship. The association between childhood physical
   abuse and AL remained even after adjusting for adult educational
   attainments, social relationships, and health behaviors. These
   associations were most pronounced for secondary stress systems,
   including inflammation, cardiovascular function, and lipid metabolism.
   Conclusions The physiological consequences of early life socioeconomic
   adversity are attenuated by achieving high levels of schooling later on.
   The adverse consequences of childhood physical abuse, on the other hand,
   persist in multivariable-adjusted analysis.

AB Although several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that having a
   disadvantaged family background is a risk factor for subsequent symptoms
   of depression, few studies have examined the mediating mechanisms that
   explain this long-term relationship. Thus, this study uses US national
   longitudinal data and integrates social stress theory with the life
   course perspective by focusing on two mediating mechanismsthe chronic
   stress of poverty and self-esteem during the transition to adulthood.
   Results reveal that self-esteem largely mediates the inverse
   relationship between parental education and levels of depressive
   symptoms in young adulthood. However, the inverse relationship between
   parental occupational prestige and depressive symptoms among young
   adults is not mediated by self-esteem, but rather long durations of
   poverty across 16years. Overall, these findings suggest that different
   components of family socioeconomic status can leave a lasting imprint on
   mental health via the self-concept and the chronic stress of poverty
   throughout the journey to adulthood. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley &

AB In the literature on property rights, there is general consensus framed
   by people such as Boserup and Demsetz that common property regimes will
   change to private property regimes when resources are scarce and
   population increases. This is mostly correct where land tenure is
   concerned. However, there are many cases where common property regimes
   continue even though the population has grown and resources have become
   scarcer. Ocean areas are almost always held as common property. This
   article analyzes property regimes that develop for land and ocean and
   the conditions under which they do so. The analysis is based on
   worldwide ethnographic case studies. I argue that the form property
   regimes take is determined by economic defendability. Many variables
   influence economic defendability, ranging from technical change and
   physical attributes of the resource to government action and cultural
   factors. That arable land is usually held privately suggests this
   solution is adaptive for land with high economic defendability. However,
   the fact that many ocean areas, forests, pastures, and swidden lands are
   held as common property suggests that this type of tenure may be an
   optimal solution when the value of resources are low relative to defense
   costs.

AB Northern Chile's Atacama Desert is one of the most unforgiving
   landscapes on the planet; however, a variety of complex risk-mitigation
   strategies facilitated long-term human occupation of the region. Using a
   burgeoning corpus of human, floral, and faunal stable carbon and
   nitrogen isotope data, the present work examines patterns of mobility,
   exchange, and social interaction in northern Chile's Formative Period
   (1500 BC-AD 400). While the geographic barriers and harsh climatic
   conditions of the Atacama Desert, in concert with substantial logistic
   considerations, established constraints on human diet at the site and
   local levels, regional dietary variation speaks to frequent and possibly
   even regular interzonal movements of people and/or foodstuffs. Through
   isotopic analysis of the remains of 86 individuals, we examine regional
   patterns of dietary variation in light of recently advanced hypotheses
   concerning the nature of mobility, exchange, and social interaction in
   Formative Period northern Chile. These data indicate both systematic
   regional exchange in foods and other goods and the central role of sites
   in the Calama oases in facilitating this exchange and movement.

AB Objective. Although engagement in social networks is important to
   health, multiple different dimensions exist. This study identifies which
   dimensions are associated with chronic disease risk behaviors.
   Methods. Cross-sectional data on social support, loneliness, and
   neighborhood social cohesion from 5381 participants, aged 45-84 from the
   Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis was used.
   Results. After adjusting for individual characteristics and all social
   engagement variables, social support was associated with lower smoking
   prevalence (PR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.82, 0.94), higher probability of having
   quit (PR = 1.03,95% CI: 1.01, 1.06) and a slightly higher probability of
   achieving physical activity recommendations (PR = 1.03,95% CI:
   1.01,1.06). Neighborhood social cohesion was associated with very
   slightly higher probability of achieving recommended (PR = 1.03,95% CI:
   1.01, 1.05) or any regular (PR = 1.0,95% CI: 1.01, 1.04) physical
   activity, and a higher probability of consuming at least five daily
   fruit and vegetable servings (PR = 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.09).
   Conclusions. Both social support and neighborhood social cohesion, a
   less commonly considered aspect of social engagement, appear to be
   important for chronic disease prevention interventions and likely act
   via separate pathways. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB Social capital is an important resource that can be mobilized for
   purposive action or competitive gain. The distribution of social capital
   in social-ecological systems can determine who is more productive at
   extracting ecological resources and who emerges as influential in
   guiding their management, thereby empowering some while disempowering
   others. Despite its importance, the factors that contribute to variation
   in social capital among individuals have not been widely studied. We
   adopt a network perspective to examine what determines social capital
   among individuals in social-ecological systems. We begin by identifying
   network measures of social capital relevant for individuals in this
   context, and review existing evidence concerning their determinants.
   Using a complete social network dataset from Hawaii's longline fishery,
   we employ social network analysis and other statistical methods to
   empirically estimate these measures and determine the extent to which
   individual stakeholder attributes explain variation within them. We find
   that ethnicity is the strongest predictor of social capital. Measures of
   human capital (i.e., education, experience), years living in the
   community, and information-sharing attitudes are also important.
   Surprisingly, we find that when controlling for other factors, industry
   leaders and formal fishery representatives are generally not well
   connected. Our results offer new quantitative insights on the
   relationship between stakeholder diversity, social networks, and social
   capital in a coupled social-ecological system, which can aid in
   identifying barriers and opportunities for action to overcome resource
   management problems. Our results also have implications for achieving
   resource governance that is not only ecologically and economically
   sustainable, but also equitable.

AB BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Studies in adults indicate that dietary
   polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition may play a role in
   development of adiposity. Because adipocyte quantity is established
   between late childhood and early adolescence, understanding the impact
   of PUFAs on weight gain during the school-age years is crucial to
   developing effective interventions.
   SUBJECTS/METHODS: We quantified N-3 and N-6 PUFAs in serum samples of
   668 Colombian schoolchildren aged 5-12 years at the time of recruitment
   into a cohort study, using gas-liquid chromatography. Serum
   concentrations of N-3 (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic
   acid, docosahexaenoic acid) and N-6 PUFAs (linoleic acid,
   gamma-linolenic acid, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid)
   were determined as percentage total fatty acids. Children's
   anthropometry was measured annually for a median of 30 months. We used
   mixed-effects models with restricted cubic splines to construct
   population body mass index-for-age z-score (BAZ) growth curves for age-
   and sex-specific quartiles of each PUFA.
   RESULTS: N-3 ALA was inversely related to BAZ gain after adjustment for
   sex, baseline age and weight status, as well as household socioeconomic
   level. Estimated BAZ change between 6 and 14 years among children in the
   highest quartile of ALA compared with those in the lowest quartile was
   0.45 (95% confidence interval: 0.07, 0.83) lower (P-trend = 0.006).
   CONCLUSIONS: N-3 ALA may be protective against weight gain in school-age
   children. Whether improvement in PUFA status reduces adiposity in
   pediatric populations deserves evaluation in randomized trials.

   impact of the practice on the individual, and the likelihood of adverse
   impact. Infant circumcision is permissible under this test. We conclude
   that infant circumcision may be proscribed as violating local norms,
   even though it does not violate human rights.

AB Patients with obesity face widespread social bias, but the importance of
   this social stigma to patients relative to other quality of life (QOL)
   factors is unclear.
   Our aim was to examine the importance of obesity-related social stigma
   relative to other QOL factors on reducing patients' overall well-being.
   We used a cross-sectional telephone interview.
   The study was conducted at four diverse primary care practices in
   Greater Boston.
   Three hundred and thirty-seven primary care patients aged 18-65 years
   and with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m(2) or higher participated in
   the study.
   Patients' health utility (preference-based QOL measure) was determined
   via responses to a series of standard gamble scenarios assessing
   willingness to risk death to lose various amounts of weight or to
   achieve perfect health. We used the Impact of Weight on Quality of
   Life-lite instrument to assess QOL domains specific to obesity (physical
   function, self-esteem, sexual life, public distress or social stigma,
   and work), and we examined variation in utility explained by these
   domains.
   Depending on patients' race/ethnicity, mean health utilities ranged from
   0.92 to 0.99 among men and from 0.89 to 0.93 among women. After
   adjustment for race, BMI, and education, none of the QOL domains
   explained much of the variation in utility among men, except for work
   function among Hispanic men. In contrast, social stigma was the leading
   QOL contributor to utility for Caucasian women (explaining 6 % of the
   marginal variation beyond demographics and BMI). In contrast, sexual
   function was the most important contributor among African American women
   (3 % marginal variation), and work life was most important among
   Hispanic women (> 20 % in variation). Lower scores in one domain did not
   always translate into lower well-being. Moreover, QOL summary scores
   often explained less of the variation than some individual domains.
   Obesity-related social stigma had disproportionate adverse effects on
   Caucasian women patients' well-being, whereas weight-related impairment
   in work function was particularly important among Hispanic patients and
   impaired sexual function was important to diminished well-being among
   African American women although its impact appeared modest.

AB This article examines the critique of greed in America, with special
   reference to how that critique of greed varies with economic conditions.
   American history is characterized by an alternation between celebrations
   of acquistion and calls for asceticism. This dialectical process
   illustrates a fundamental cultural contradiction of American capitalism,
   first discussed by Daniel Bell. The analysis focuses on the disourse of
   greed during the Great Recession of 2008, and suggests that cultural
   criticisms of greed have powerful, but limited, political effectiveness.
   As economic crises continue and people come to blame polticians who fail
   to resolve them, rather than the "greedy" who are purported to cause
   them.

AB This paper investigates the invention of a Chinese National Day from
   1949 through 1987 in Taiwan to illuminate the significance of mnemonic
   work in nation-building. The 1949 Retreat after the Chinese Civil War
   resulted in a serious legitimacy crisis for the government of the
   Republic of China; thus, (re)inventing the National Day became an
   important mission to maintain and even strengthen this shaky regime.
   While the role of the standardized commemorative narrative in
   influencing people's collective memory is granted, this article
   emphasizes the aspect of embodied memory in nation-remembering. I point
   out that the official Chinese nationalism constructed its National Day
   as inevitably bustling, memorialized, accepted, heroic, familial-ized,
   blessed, and pivotal-ized to shape the impression of a sacred and
   memorable day. This paperwhile essentially consistent with Billig's
   argument of banal nationalismsuggests that national identity is
   accumulated by many symbolically encoded elements found in daily life;
   it goes further to argue that banal nationalism needs the hot
   nationalism found in special occasions to encode, refresh, and redefine
   the symbolic meaning of entities. That is, the oscillations between
   sacred and profane are needed to guarantee that patriotic emotions can
   be continually created and maintained.

AB Phase I testing of investigational drugs relies on healthy volunteers as
   research participants. Many U.S. healthy volunteers enroll repeatedly in
   clinical trials for the financial compensation. Serial participants are
   incentivized to ignore restrictions on their participation, and no
   centralized clinical trial registry prevents dual enrollment. Little is
   currently known about how healthy volunteers participate in studies over
   time, hampering the development of policies to protect this group. We
   detail a methodology developed as part of a longitudinal study to track
   in real-time healthy volunteers' Phase I participation. Illustrating
   these data through three case studies, we document how healthy
   volunteers use strategies, such as qualifying for studies at more than
   one clinic and traveling significant distances, to maximize their
   participation. Our findings suggest that clinical trial diaries can
   generate critical information about serial research participation and
   point to ethical issues unique to healthy volunteers' involvement in
   Phase I clinical trials.

AB Purpose: Socioeconomic disadvantage is often evaluated at single points
   in the adult life course in health research. Social mobility models
   suggest that socioeconomic patterns may also influence disease risk.
   This study examines cumulative socioeconomic disadvantage (CSD) in
   relation to cardiovascular disease mortality (CVDM).
   Methods: Data were from the Alameda County Study (n = 2530). The CSD
   indices included father's education, the respondent's education, and
   either average or latent variable trajectory models of adulthood
   household income (1965-1994). Proportional hazards models were used to
   assess the associations between CSD and CVDM.
   Results: The CSD measures were not associated with CVDM in men. Among
   women, the magnitude of the association between CSD and CVDM was greater
   for the income trajectory (hazard ratio(3) (vs) (0) = 4.73, 95%
   confidence interval = 2.20-10.18) compared with the average income
   (hazard ratio(3 vs) (0) = 3.78, 95% confidence interval = 1.67-8.53) CSD
   measure.
   Conclusions: Measures of CSD that incorporate patterning of resources
   over the life course were associated with CVDM for women but not men.
   Patterning of available socioeconomic resources may differentially
   influence chronic disease risk and mortality by gender, and future work
   should continue to investigate how greater patterns variability in
   available resources influences health outcomes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB Purpose: Non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) are disproportionately affected by
   the AIDS epidemic. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral
   therapy (HAART), survival after AIDS diagnosis has increased
   dramatically, yet survival among NHBs is shorter compared with
   non-Hispanic whites. Racial residential segregation may be an important
   factor influencing observed racial disparities in survival.
   Methods: We linked data on 30,813 NHBs from the Florida Department of
   Health HIV/AIDS Reporting system (1993-2004) with death records and
   applied segregation indices and poverty levels to the data. Weighted Cox
   models were used to examine the association between segregation measured
   on five dimensions and survival, controlling for demographic factors,
   clinical factors, and area-level poverty. Analyses were stratified by
   pre-HAART (1993-1995), early HAART (1996-1998), and late-HAART
   (1999-2004) eras.
   Results: In the late-HAARTera, adjusting for area-level poverty,
   segregation remained a significant predictor of survival on two
   dimensions: Concentration (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval,
   1.13-1.56) and centralization (hazard ratio, 1.44; 95% confidence
   interval, 1.12-1.84). Area-level poverty was an independent predictor of
   survival.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that certain dimensions of
   segregation and poverty are associated with survival after AIDS
   diagnosis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is more common in males than females. An
   underrepresentation of females in the ASD literature has led to limited
   knowledge of differences in social function across the sexes.
   Investigations of face perception represent a promising target for
   understanding variability in social functioning between males and
   females. The current study analyzed electrophysiological brain
   recordings during face perception to investigate sex differences in the
   neural correlates of face perception and their relationship to social
   function. Event related potentials (ERP) were recorded from children
   with ASD while viewing faces, inverted faces, and houses. Relative to
   males, females showed attenuated response at an ERP marker of face
   perception, the N170. Among females, but not males, atypical face
   response was associated with symptom severity. Observed sex differences
   reflect influential differences in social information processing, and
   impairment in these features correlates with deficits in social
   information processing in females, but not males, with ASD. These
   findings hold significance for future treatment protocols, which should
   account for differences in males and females with ASD in clinical
   presentation and neural phenotypes.

   The sample consisted of 384 males and 313 females who were admitted to
   four prison-based substance abuse treatment programs. Results showed
   that female inmates experienced a longer time to re-arrest than male
   inmates. Higher self-reported ratings of decision making confidence and
   peer support were associated with a lower likelihood of re-arrest for
   males. Males with higher self-esteem ratings were more likely to be
   re-arrested than males who reported lower self-esteem. Females with more
   self-reported criminal involvement had a higher rate of re-arrest than
   did those with less criminal involvement. In contrast to males, females
   with relatively high self-reported self-esteem had a lower rate of
   re-arrest than their counterparts who reported low self-esteem. Clinical
   implications include the importance of enhancing decision-making
   confidence and peer support for males and self-esteem for females. (C)

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with risk of various cancer
   types because of correlation between SES and causal factors or increased
   case ascertainment, or both. Studies evaluating the association between
   glioblastoma and occupational or SES factors have yielded inconsistent
   results. We evaluated the association between SES and glioblastoma risk
   using a large, population-based cancer registry dataset.
   Data of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were
   used to evaluate the impact of SES on glioblastoma risk. SES was divided
   into quintiles on the basis of census tract of residence. Census tracts
   are small, geographically defined areas with relatively homogeneous
   population characteristics.
   Higher SES was strongly associated with increased risk of glioblastoma
   (p < .001). Relative to persons living in census tracts of the lowest
   SES quintile, the highest SES quintile had a rate ratio of 1.45 (95 % CI
   1.39-1.51) (p < .001). Similar associations were seen in population
   subgroups defined by age, sex, and race.
   The strong association between higher SES and greater glioblastoma risk
   is unlikely to represent an ascertainment effect because glioblastoma is
   rapidly progressive and ultimately fatal. A number of previously
   proposed glioma risk factors may be correlated with SES, including atopy
   and allergy rates, cellular telephone use, and body morphometric
   measures. Further research is needed to define the mechanism of this
   association.

   symptoms and youth internalizing problems. Future longitudinal research
   should investigate whether low income and parent-youth stress may

AB We begin by illustrating that long before the cognitive revolution,
   social psychology focused on topics pertaining to what is now known as
   social cognition: people's subjective interpretations of social
   situations and the concepts and cognitive processes underlying these
   interpretations. We then examine two questions: whether social cognition
   entails characteristic concepts and cognitive processes, and how social
   processes might themselves shape and constrain cognition. We suggest
   that social cognition relies heavily on generic cognition but also on
   unique concepts (e.g., agent, intentionality) and unique processes
   (e.g., projection, imitation, joint attention). We further suggest that
   social processes play a prominent role in the development and unfolding
   of several generic cognitive processes, including learning, attention,
   and memory. Finally, we comment on the prospects of a recently
   developing approach to the study of social cognition (social
   neuroscience) and two potential future directions (computational social
   cognition and social-cognitive robotics). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

   externally rated event narratives using standardized criteria. The odds
   of experiencing a physical health problem at follow-up were

   prejudice event during the follow-up period compared to those who did
   not. This association persisted after adjusting for experiences of
   general stressful life events that were not related to prejudice.
   Self-appraised minority stress exposures were not associated with poorer

   events have a unique deleterious impact on health that persists above

AB Epidemiological research suggests that different indicators of
   socioeconomic status (SES) such as income and education may have
   independent and/or interactive effects on health outcomes. In this
   study, we examined both simple and more complex associations (i.e.,
   interactions) between different indicators of SES and ambulatory blood
   pressure (ABP) during daily life. Our sample consisted of 94 married
   couples who completed a one-day ABP protocol. Both income and education
   were independently related to systolic blood pressure and only income
   was significantly related to diastolic blood pressure. There were also
   statistical interactions such that individuals with high levels of both
   income and education evidenced the lowest ABP. Gender moderated these
   findings. Three-way interactions revealed that, in general, women appear
   to benefit from either indicator of SES, whereas men appear to benefit
   more from income. The findings are consistent with epidemiological
   research and suggest one important physiological mechanism by which
   income and education may have independent and interactive effects on
   health.

AB Health disparities by socioeconomic status (SES) exist for many
   outcomes, including patients' subjective health status after myocardial
   infarction (MI). The Reserve Capacity Model (RCM), a theoretical means
   to understand such disparities, was tested to examine the possible
   mediating effects of cognitive-emotional factors on the association
   between SES and health status. Data from 2,348 post-MI patients in
   PREMIER were used. Indicators of SES were collected during
   hospitalization via personal interviews, while participants completed
   measures of stress and reserves at 1 month, depressive symptoms at 6
   months, and health status at 1 year through telephone interviews.
   Structural equation model results provide partial support for the RCM,
   as cognitive-emotional factors partially mediated the association
   between SES and mental health status. For physical health status,
   results supported direct rather than indirect effects of SES. Findings
   suggest psychosocial interventions with patients of low SES will have
   their greatest effects on appraisals of psychological health status.

   sociodemographic characteristics and to examine associations with
   adolescent body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, physical activity and
   sedentary behaviors. Data from two linked epidemiological studies were
   used for cross-sectional analysis. Parents (n = 3,424; 62 % females) and
   adolescents (n = 2,182; 53.2 % girls) were socioeconomically and
   racially/ethnically diverse. Fathers reported more parent-adolescent
   conversations about healthful eating and physical activity with their
   sons and mothers reported more weight-focused conversations with their
   daughters. Parents of Hispanic/Latino and Asian/Hmong youth and parents
   from lower socioeconomic status categories engaged in more conversations
   about weight and size. Adolescents whose mothers or fathers had
   weight-focused conversations with them had higher BMI percentiles.
   Adolescents who had two parents engaging in weight-related conversations
   had higher BMI percentiles. Healthcare providers may want to talk about
   the types of weight-related conversations parents are having with their
   adolescents and emphasize avoiding conversations about weight
   specifically.

AB Social support is one potential source of health-related resiliency in
   Hispanics with diabetes. This study examined relationships of structural
   (i.e., social integration) and functional (i.e., perceived) social
   support with glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin; HbA1c) in the
   Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos Sociocultural Ancillary
   Study. This study included 766 men and women representing multiple
   Hispanic ethnic backgrounds, aged 18-74 years, with diagnosed diabetes
   who completed fasting blood draw, medication review, and measures of
   sociodemographic factors, medical history, structural support (Cohen
   Social Network Index), and functional support (Interpersonal Support
   Evaluation List-12). After adjusting for sociodemographic covariates and
   medication, a one standard deviation increase in functional support was
   related to an 0.18 % higher HbA1c (p = 0.04). A similar trend was
   observed for structural support; however, this effect was
   non-significant in adjusted models. Greater functional support was
   associated with poorer glycemic control in Hispanics.

   diabetes prevalence in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of
   Latinos Sociocultural Ancillary Study. Participants were 5,181 adults,
   18-74 years old, representing diverse Hispanic backgrounds, who
   underwent baseline exam with fasting blood draw, oral glucose tolerance
   test, medication review, sociodemographic assessment, and sociocultural
   exam with functional and structural social support measures. In adjusted
   analyses, one standard deviation higher structural and functional social
   support related to 16 and 15 % lower odds, respectively, of having
   diabetes. Structural and functional support were related to both
   previously diagnosed diabetes (OR = .84 and .88, respectively) and newly
   recognized diabetes prevalence (OR = .84 and .83, respectively). Higher
   functional and structural social support are associated with lower
   diabetes prevalence in Hispanics/Latinos.

AB Background Disparities in cancer incidence and mortality have been
   observed by measures of area-level socioeconomic status (SES); however,
   the extent to which these disparities are explained by individual SES is
   unclear.
   Methods Participants included 60 756 men and women in the VITamins And
   Lifestyle (VITAL) study cohort, aged 50-76 years at baseline (2000-2002)
   and followed through 2010. We constructed a block group SES index using
   the 2000 US Census and fit Cox proportional hazards models to estimate
   the association between area-level SES (by quintile) and total and
   site-specific cancer incidence and total cancer mortality, with and
   without household income and individual education in the models.
   Results Lower area-level SES was weakly associated with higher total
   cancer incidence and lower prostate cancer risk, but was not associated
   with risk of breast cancer. Compared with the highest-SES areas, living
   in the lowest-SES areas was associated with higher lung (HR: 2.21, 95%
   CI 1.69 to 2.90) and colorectal cancer incidence (HR: 1.52, 95% CI 1.11
   to 2.09) and total cancer mortality (HR: 1.68, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.93).
   Controlling for individual education and household income weakened the
   observed associations, but did not eliminate them (lung cancer HR: 1.43,
   95% CI 1.07 to 1.91; colorectal cancer HR: 1.35, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.88;
   cancer mortality HR: 1.28, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.48).
   Conclusions Area-level socioeconomic disparities exist for several
   cancer outcomes. These differences are not fully explained by individual
   SES, suggesting area-level factors may play a role.

AB Objective: Social factors play an important role in quitting smoking in
   the general population, but relatively little is known about social
   influences on smoking cessation efforts among individuals with serious
   mental illness who suffer disproportionately high rates of smoking. This
   study examined social factors as predictors of using smoking cessation
   treatment among adults with serious mental illness.
   Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized
   study comparing two versions of a motivational decision support system
   for smoking cessation treatment including 124 smokers with schizophrenia
   or severe mood disorders. Hierarchical logistic regression with blocked
   entry of theoretically linked predictor variables was used to model two
   types of social influences (explicit and implicit) as predictors of
   using cessation group therapy or smoking cessation medication.
   Results: Approximately 31% of participants initiated smoking cessation
   treatment during the 2-month follow-up. Hierarchical logistic regression
   analyses revealed that over and above demographic and personal factors,
   implicit social influences (others' approval of treatment) significantly
   predicted use of smoking cessation medication, while explicit social
   influences (smoking with others) significantly predicted use of
   cessation group therapy.
   Conclusions: For people with serious mental illness, social factors
   appear to influence use of smoking cessation treatment above and beyond
   personal factors and may be specific to the type of treatment. These
   data support the need to further explore the role of social factors as
   potential leverage points for engagement in smoking cessation treatments
   in this population. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Optimal adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is key to viral
   suppression, but may be impeded by psychosocial consequences of
   HIV-infection such as stigma and depression. Measures of adherence in
   India have been examined in clinic populations, but little is known
   about the performance of these measures outside clinical settings. We
   conducted a cross-sectional study of 151 Tamil-speaking people living
   with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) in India recruited through HIV support networks and
   compared single item measures from the Adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group
   (AACTG) scale, a visual analog scale (VAS), and a question on timing of
   last missed dose. Depression was measured using the Major Depression
   Inventory (MDI) and HIV-related stigma was measured using an adaptation
   of the Berger Stigma Scale. Mean age was 35.6 years (SD +/- 5.9); 55.6%
   were male; mean MDI score was 11.9 (SD +/- 9.1); and mean stigma score
   was 67.3 (SD +/- 12.0). Self-reported perfect adherence (no missed
   doses) was 93.3% using the AACTG item, 87.1% using last missed dose, and
   83.8% using the VAS. The measures had moderate agreement with each other
   (kappa 0.45-0.57). Depression was associated with lower adherence
   irrespective of adherence measure used, and remained significantly
   associated in multivariable analyses adjusting for age and marital
   status. Stigma was not associated with adherence irrespective of the
   measure used. The VAS captured the greatest number of potentially
   non-adherent individuals and may be useful for identifying PLHA in need
   of adherence support. Given the consistent and strong association
   between poorer adherence and depression, programs that jointly address
   adherence and mental health for PLHA in India may be more effective than
   programs targeting only one.

   exciting new research in this special issue advocates for the importance
   of a gender lens on questions of religion in order to highlight issues,
   practices, peoples, and theories that would otherwise not be central to
   the discipline. We encourage sociologists who study religion to engage
   more in interdisciplinary and intersectional scholarship, acknowledge
   developments in the global South, and develop more compelling
   theoretical frameworks that analyze religion from a gendered
   perspective. Our aim is to bring religion to the attention of gender and
   feminist scholars and to encourage religion scholars to consider gender
   not just as a variable but as a social structure. We hope that both
   groups of scholars will consider gender and religion as mutually
   constitutive social categories.

AB Evidence-based policy making often has a direct or indirect goal of
   promoting family resilience. The authors consider the ways in which
   scholarly disagreements about evidence can challenge this goal, focusing
   on the debate regarding whether adult-infant bedsharing increases the
   risk of infant mortality. A central issue is whether scholars conclude
   that public policy should recommend against all bedsharing or only
   bedsharing in particular risky circumstances. The authors use
   context-based evidence-based policy making (Dobrow, Goel & Upshur, 2004)
   as a framework for a review of studies of sudden infant death syndrome
   (SIDS) correlates and SIDS mechanisms related to bedsharing as well as
   the reasons parents bed share. The authors discuss the implications of
   different interpretations of the evidence and point to the potential of
   adversarial collaboration in helping to address the points of
   disagreement and ultimately better support family resilience. The issues
   discussed in this case are broadly relevant to other debated evidence
   for family policy making.

AB Indirect reciprocity is a mechanism for the evolution of cooperation
   that is relevant for prosocial behavior among humans. Indirect
   reciprocity means that my behavior towards you also depends on what you
   have done to others. Indirect reciprocity is associated with the
   evolution of social intelligence and human language. Most approaches to
   indirect reciprocity assume obligatory interactions, but here we explore
   optional interactions. In any one round a game between two players is
   offered. A cooperator accepts a game unless the reputation of the other
   player indicates a defector. For a game to take place, both players must
   accept. In a game between a cooperator and a defector, the reputation of
   the defector is revealed to all players with probability Q. After a
   sufficiently large number of rounds the identity of all defectors is
   known and cooperators are no longer exploited. The crucial condition for
   evolution of cooperation can be written as hQB > 1, where h is the
   average number of rounds per person and B = (b/c) -1 specifies the
   benefit-to-cost ratio. We analyze both stochastic and deterministic
   evolutionary game dynamics. We study two extensions that deal with
   uncertainty: hesitation and malicious gossip. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB The literature on food stores, neighborhood poverty, and race/ethnicity
   is mixed and lacks methods of accounting for complex spatial and
   temporal clustering of food resources. We used quarterly data on
   supermarket and convenience store locations from Nielsen TDLinx (Nielsen
   Holdings N.V., New York, New York) spanning 7 years (2006-2012) and
   census tract-based neighborhood sociodemographic data from the American
   Community Survey (2006-2010) to assess associations between neighborhood
   sociodemographic characteristics and food store distributions in the
   Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of 4 US cities (Birmingham,
   Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and San Francisco,
   California). We fitted a space-time Poisson regression model that
   accounted for the complex spatial-temporal correlation structure of
   store locations by introducing space-time random effects in an intrinsic
   conditionally autoregressive model within a Bayesian framework. After
   accounting for census tract-level area, population, their interaction,
   and spatial and temporal variability, census tract poverty was
   significantly and positively associated with increasing expected numbers
   of supermarkets among tracts in all 4 MSAs. A similar positive
   association was observed for convenience stores in Birmingham,
   Minneapolis, and San Francisco; in Chicago, a positive association was
   observed only for predominantly white and predominantly black tracts.
   Our findings suggest a positive association between greater numbers of
   food stores and higher neighborhood poverty, with implications for
   policy approaches related to food store access by neighborhood poverty.

AB Background-Previous research suggests that neighborhood-level
   racial/ethnic residential segregation is linked to health, but it has
   not been studied prospectively in relation to cardiovascular disease
   (CVD).
   Methods and Results-Participants were 1595 non-Hispanic black, 2345
   non-Hispanic white, and 1289 Hispanic adults from the Multi-Ethnic Study
   of Atherosclerosis free of CVD at baseline (aged 45-84 years). Own-group
   racial/ethnic residential segregation was assessed by using the G(i)*
   statistic, a measure of how the neighborhood racial/ethnic composition
   deviates from surrounding counties' racial/ethnic composition.
   Multivariable Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to estimate
   hazard ratios for incident CVD (first definite angina, probable angina
   followed by revascularization, myocardial infarction, resuscitated
   cardiac arrest, coronary heart disease death, stroke, or stroke death)
   over 10.2 median years of follow-up. Among blacks, each standard
   deviation increase in black segregation was associated with a 12% higher
   hazard of developing CVD after adjusting for demographics (95%
   confidence interval, 1.02-1.22). This association persisted after
   adjustment for neighborhood-level characteristics, individual
   socioeconomic position, and CVD risk factors (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95%
   confidence interval, 1.02-1.23). For whites, higher white segregation
   was associated with lower CVD risk after adjusting for demographics
   (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.96), but not after
   further adjustment for neighborhood characteristics. Segregation was not
   associated with CVD risk among Hispanics. Similar results were obtained
   after adjusting for time-varying segregation and covariates.
   Conclusions-The association of residential segregation with
   cardiovascular risk varies according to race/ethnicity. Further work is
   needed to better characterize the individual-and neighborhood-level
   pathways linking segregation to CVD risk.

AB Background: Between roughly 500 BCE and 300 BCE, three distinct regions,
   the Yangtze and Yellow River Valleys, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the
   Ganges Valley, saw the emergence of highly similar religious traditions
   with an unprecedented emphasis on self-discipline and asceticism and
   with "otherworldly,'' often moralizing, doctrines, including Buddhism,
   Jainism, Brahmanism, Daoism, Second Temple Judaism, and Stoicism, with
   later offshoots, such as Christianity, Manichaeism, and Islam. This
   cultural convergence, often called the "Axial Age,'' presents a puzzle:
   why did this emerge at the same time as distinct moralizing religions,
   with highly similar features in different civilizations? The puzzle may
   be solved by quantitative historical evidence that demonstrates an
   exceptional uptake in energy capture (a proxy for general prosperity)
   just before the Axial Age in these three regions.
   Results: Statistical modeling confirms that economic development, not
   political complexity or population size, accounts for the timing of the
   Axial Age.
   Conclusions: We discussed several possible causal pathways, including
   the development of literacy and urban life, and put forward the idea,
   inspired by life history theory, that absolute affluence would have
   impacted human motivation and reward systems, nudging people away from
   short-term strategies (resource acquisition and coercive interactions)
   and promoting long-term strategies (self-control techniques and
   cooperative interactions).

AB Street greenery plays an important role in enhancing the environmental
   quality of a city. Current urban environmental studies mainly focus on
   the distribution of desirable land uses (e.g., open spaces and parks).
   Few studies have been conducted on street greenery in residential areas,
   although it may provide a series of benefits to urban residents, such as
   energy saving, provision of shade, and aesthetic values. Google Street
   View (GSV) provides profile views of urban landscapes, and thus may be
   used for residential street greenery assessment. In this project, GSV
   was used in a case study to examine the relationships between the
   spatial distributions of residential street greenery and some
   socioeconomic variables in different block groups of Hartford,
   Connecticut, USA. The green view index was calculated based on the GSV
   images captured at different horizontal and vertical view angles to
   quantitatively represent how much greenery a pedestrian can see from
   ground level. Results showed that people with various social conditions
   have different amounts of street greenery in their living environments
   in Hartford. People with higher incomes tend to live in places with more
   street greenery. In summary, this study makes contribution to literature
   by providing insights into the living environments of urban residents in
   terms of street greenery, and it also generates valuable reference data
   for future urban greening programs. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

AB We analyze the citation impacts (,cited') and citation practices
   (,citing') of sociological journals which publish mainly in German, and
   discuss major drawbacks of using the journal impact factor (IF) to
   assess the quality of these journals. First, sociological literature
   moves very slowly in terms of citations, whereas journal impact factors
   (IF) measure short-term impact at research fronts. Second, the citation
   distributions are heavily skewed because of the so-called Matthew effect
   (Merton) of cumulative advantages; one should not use quasi-averages
   (such as the IF) given this skewness. The alternative of using
   non-parametric statistics (e.g., percentiles), however, requires
   delineation of the reference sets. We discuss the unsolved problems in
   the case of (inter)disciplinary delineations and show empirically the
   ecological fallacy in nevertheless attributing journal characteristics
   to individual papers. Algorithmic constructs (e.g., the various
   rankings) cannot be used for policy or management purposes without
   validation or specification of statistical error.

AB The development of targets is foundational in conservation. Although
   progress has been made in setting targets, the diverse linkages among
   ecological and social components make target setting for coupled
   social-ecological systems extremely challenging. Developing integrated
   social-ecological targets is difficult because it forces policy makers
   to consider how management actions propagate throughout
   social-ecological systems, and because ultimately it is society, not
   scientists, that defines targets. We developed an interdisciplinary
   approach for identifying management targets and illustrate this approach
   using an example motivated by Puget Sound, USA. Our approach blends
   ecological modeling with empirical social science to articulate
   trade-offs and reveal societal preferences for different
   social-ecological states. The framework aims to place information in the
   hands of decision makers and promote discussion in the appropriate
   forums. Our ultimate objective is to encourage the informed
   participation of citizens in the development of social-ecological
   targets that reflect their values while also protecting key ecosystem
   attributes.

AB I explored one aspect of social-ecological change in the context of an
   Alaskan human-Rangifer system, with the goal of understanding household
   adaptive responses to perturbations when there are multiple forces of
   change at play. I focused on households as one element of social
   resilience. Resilience is in the context of transition theory, in which
   communities are continually in a process of change, and perturbations
   are key points in the transition process. This case study of Anaktuvuk
   Pass, Alaska, USA, contributes to the understanding of cultural
   continuity and household resilience in times of rapid change by using
   household survey data from 1978 to 2003 to understand how households
   adapted to changes in the cash economy that came with oil development at
   the same time as a crash in the caribou population and state-imposed
   limits on caribou harvests. The research illustrates that households are
   resilient in the way they capture opportunities and create a new system
   so that elements of the old remain while parts change.

   development of effective interventions to enhance resilience
   necessitates understanding that resilience in the individual is
   dependent on multiple layers of society. Further, we suggest that there
   is a bidirectional relationship between systems-level resilience (i.e.,
   resilience of romantic partners, family members, neighborhoods, and
   larger social contexts) and individual resilience. We suggest directions
   for future research and interventions, with the goal of stimulating

AB National Wildlife Refuges (NWRs) in the United States play an important
   role in the adaptation of social-ecological systems to climate change,
   land-use change, and other global-change processes. Coastal refuges are
   already experiencing threats from sea-level rise and other change
   processes that are largely beyond their ability to influence, while at
   the same time facing tighter budgets and reduced staff. We engaged in
   workshops with NWR managers along the U.S. Atlantic coast to understand
   the problems they face from global-change processes and began a
   multidisciplinary collaboration to use decision science to help address
   them. We are applying a values-focused approach to base management
   decisions on the resource objectives of land managers, as well as those
   of stakeholders who may benefit from the goods and services produced by
   a refuge. Two insights that emerged from our workshops were a
   conspicuous mismatch between the scale at which management can influence
   outcomes and the scale of environmental processes, and the need to
   consider objectives related to ecosystem goods and services that
   traditionally have not been explicitly considered by refuges (e.g.,
   protection from storm surge). The broadening of objectives complicates
   the decision-making process, but also provides opportunities for
   collaboration with stakeholders who may have agendas different from
   those of the refuge, as well as an opportunity for addressing problems
   across scales. From a practical perspective, we recognized the need to
   (1) efficiently allocate limited staff time and budgets for short-term
   management of existing programs and resources under the current refuge
   design and (2) develop long-term priorities for acquiring or protecting
   new land/habitat to supplement or replace the existing refuge footprint
   and thus sustain refuge values as the system evolves over time.
   Structuring the decision-making problem in this manner facilitated a
   better understanding of the issues of scale and suggested that a
   long-term solution will require a significant reassessment of objectives
   to better reflect the comprehensive values of refuges to society. We
   discuss some future considerations to integrate these two problems into
   a single framework by developing novel optimization approaches for
   dynamic problems that account for uncertainty in future conditions.

AB Since the mid-20th century, the Pyrenean pastoral social-ecological
   system (SES) has undergone socioeconomic and demographic transformations
   leading to changes in grazing practices and a decline in the livestock
   industry. Land abandonment has contributed to an ecological transition
   from herbaceous vegetation cover to shrublands and forests, leading to a
   loss of ecosystem services, including biodiversity and forage. I
   interviewed 27 stockmen (ganaderos) in two valleys of the central
   Pyrenees to document their traditional ecological knowledge and
   observations of environmental, social, economic, and cultural changes in
   the valleys. I used poetic analysis, a qualitative data analysis
   approach, to illustrate and analyze one ganadero's experience of
   social-ecological change. First, I created seven poems based on an
   interview transcript with this ganadero. Second, I analyzed the poetry I
   created, to see what new insights and understanding about system
   dynamics and the lived experience of SES change emerged from analysis of
   the transcript re-presented as poetry. Third, I compared key themes that
   emerged from this analysis with findings across the other 26 interviews.
   Fourth, I read the poems and presented the associated analysis to
   multiple audiences, to gauge their impact and effectiveness in
   communicating research findings. Finally, I synthesized across the
   themes raised in the seven poems. Poetic analysis revealed emotional and
   cultural dimensions of change, especially the importance of occupational
   and place identity, in the experience of the ganadero. The transcript
   re-presented as poetry portrayed the ganadero as an agent in creating
   and maintaining a cultural landscape and as both an adaptor and resister
   to SES change. Poetic analysis also uncovered telling contradictions,
   adaptive capacities, and barriers to adaptation in this SES that went
   unappreciated with conventional qualitative analysis approaches. This
   exploratory study illustrates the potential of poetry as a method of
   data analysis and communication in SES research.

AB There has been an increasing interest in nonpecuniary measures to
   encourage prosocial behavior. Among these is the use of social
   comparison, or social information. Although successful in promoting, for
   instance, greater resource conservation, studies of this measure have so
   far relied on the assumption of the availability of social information.
   In situations in which information is costly to collect and disseminate,
   alternative mechanisms must be considered. This study explores the use
   of voluntary disclosure to provide social information in a linear public
   goods game in a lab experiment. It finds that individuals tend to
   disclose their contribution information when given the option,
   suggesting that voluntarily disclosed social information remains a
   possible policy option when the cost of information collection is high.
   In addition, voluntarily revealed contributions are significantly higher
   than contributions under mandated disclosure, leading to greater
   cooperation in the voluntary disclosure treatments under certain
   circumstances. Finally, evidence is provided that voluntary disclosure
   may be helpful in attenuating the boomerang effect, i.e., when high
   contributors reduce their contributions in response to social
   information.

   Order to the psychoanalytic conception of the self and thereby open up
   new possibilities of interpretation and transformation. Goffman's
   concept of the Interaction Order enables us to understand more clearly
   the Freudian concepts of superego, ego-ideal, and the introjected
   Father. Next, we draw out the dramaturgical approach of both Goffman and
   Freud in terms of performing self and performing illness and discuss how
   the psychoanalytic reading of Goffman's work sheds light on the
   formation of neuroses and the neurotic symptoms which Freud
   characterized as a type of performance. Here we link Freud's "symptoms"
   to Goffman's modes of disordered or flawed modes of interaction,
   specifically hysteria connected to havoc and obsessive compulsive
   disorder connected to hyperritualization. This dialectical reading
   allows us to rethink notions of sociality and thereby opens new
   possibilities for constituting the relation between the self and the

AB The presented book "Mass Flourishing" by Edmund Phelps, winner of the
   2006 Nobel Economics Prize, proposes a new perspective on what the
   prosperity of nations is. According to the author, the prosperity at a
   national scale comes from the broad involvement of people with
   innovations. These processes of innovation serve as a source of dynamism
   for economic development but can be restricted by institutions if not
   fueled by the right values. However, in the XX century, the history of
   the prosperity of the Western world, which began in the XIX century,
   stopped partially due to the fact that the understanding of what the
   prosperity means was lost and institutions were diluted by conservative
   values resistant to modern life. For instance, there are calls for
   greater social security and for more attention to the value of
   communities and families. Moreover, Phelps develops a new concept of
   economy that is both modern and fair. The Journal of Economic Sociology
   publishes the book's introduction "Advent of the Modern Economies", in
   which the author indicates the roots of modern economies from the XIXth
   to the first half of the XX century. The flourishing of modern economies
   came to Britain and the USA, later to France and Germany. The
   peculiarities of modern economies include conditions within the
   frameworks of those ordinary people with different talents having
   opportunities for personal development and self-expression.

   This article explores the social mechanisms that enabled the global

   intellectual fields contributed to this process. There are "global
   Bourdieus." Throughout his career Bourdieu was a defender of the
   dominated, and a sharp critic of established powers; his work provides
   individuals in a variety of central and peripheral fields weapons
   against social domination whatever its form. This narrative weds

   sociological theorist, an aspect of his work that has not received the
   attention it deserves. We focus specifically on the significance of Du
   Bois's theory of Double Consciousness. This theory argues that in a
   racialized society there is no true communication or recognition between
   the racializing and the racialized. Furthermore, Du Bois's theory of
   Double Consciousness puts racialization at the center of the analysis of
   self-formation, linking the macro structure of the racialized world with
   the lived experiences of racialized subjects. We develop our argument in
   two stages: The first section locates the theory of Double Consciousness
   within the field of classical sociological theories of the self. We show
   how the theory addresses gaps in the theorizing of self-formation of
   James, Mead, and Cooley. The second section presents an analysis of how
   Du Bois deploys this theory in his phenomenological analysis of the
   African American experience. The conclusions point out how the theory of
   Double Consciousness is relevant to contemporary debates in sociological
   theory.

   conditions of industrial cities, prefigured important later work and
   offered a sociologically richer understanding of urban processes than
   the canonized classical urban theoristsWeber, Simmel, and Park. I focus
   on two key areas of Du Bois's urban theory: (1) racial stratification as
   a fundamental feature of the modern city and (2) urbanization and urban
   migration. While The Philadelphia Negro has gained recent praise for Du

   marginalized activists subvert the dominant terms of legal debate? To
   what extent can they establish their legitimacy? This paper advances

   affirmative action supporters. BAMN had a marginalized allied-outsider
   status in the legal cases, as it made a radical civil rights claim for a
   moderate, elite-supported policy: that affirmative action corrects
   systemic racial discrimination. BAMN activists pursued their agenda by
   passionately defending and, at once, critiquing the university's
   policies. However, the organization's militancy remained a liability
   among university leaders, who prioritized the consistency of their
   diversity claims. The analysis forwards a scholarly understanding of the
   legacy of race-conscious policies.

AB Scholars in nonhuman animal studies and criminology have argued that
   more attention should be paid to the violence sanctioned by society,
   that of animal slaughter for industrial food production. Slaughterhouses
   and the communities surrounding these facilities present ideal sites for
   investigating how the violence of nonhuman animal slaughter work impacts
   individuals and society. The main research questions addressed in this
   study were whether the presence of a slaughterhouse in a rural community
   had an effect on violent crime arrest rates and what impact these
   facilities have on social disorganization in the community. Previous
   research on slaughterhouse communities has established a correlation
   between slaughterhouse employment and violent crime. This research
   examined the relationship between the presence of a slaughterhouse in
   the community and violent crime rates. Findings indicated that the
   location of a slaughterhouse in a county was associated with increases
   in the total arrest rate, arrests for rape, and arrests for offenses
   against the family in comparison to counties without a slaughterhouse,
   pointing to a relationship between the violence of killing nonhuman
   animals and violence towards humans.

AB A rare R1a1 Y-haplogroup (Y-HG) L657 clade subtype designated as LPKSTR
   is found in most male members of a clan of "founder" families within the
   Goud Saraswat Brahmin community in Lotli town in Western India. TMRCA
   calculations using pairwise comparisons to control cohorts suggested a
   probable migration history distinct from the canonical narrative for
   medieval migration of orthodox Brahmin families to South India. Using
   Y-HG centroid analysis, chi-square analysis of TMRCA distributions and
   archeological find-spots, and discriminant function analysis we show
   that the parental Z93 L342.2 subclade in which LPKSTR occurs originated
   in West Asia and that LPKSTR individuals migrated toward the southeast
   by a Bolan Pass route distinct from the traditionally presumed route of
   Brahmin ingress into the Indian subcontinent. The proposed migration
   route is supported by archeological, toponymic, numismatic, linguistic,
   iconographic, and literary data. Lastly, we present cultural metrics
   demonstrating that these LPKSTR lineages retained distinct family
   practices with respect to literacy, religious practice, and emigration
   not shared with orthodox Brahmins of canonical geographic origin within
   the same community, despite centuries of intermarriage. Long-term
   transmission of differentiated family practices within a patrilineal
   endogamous community has rarely been documented.

AB Social roles are thought to play an important role in determining the
   capacity for collective action in a community regarding the use of
   shared resources. Here we report on the results of a study using a
   behavioral experimental approach regarding the relationship between
   social roles and the performance of social-ecological systems. The
   computer-based irrigation experiment that was the basis of this study
   mimics the decisions faced by farmers in small-scale irrigation systems.
   In each of 20 rounds, which are analogous to growing seasons,
   participants face a two-stage commons dilemma. First they must decide
   how much to invest in the public infrastructure, e.g., canals and water
   diversion structures. Second, they must decide how much to extract from
   the water made available by that public infrastructure. Each round
   begins with a 60-second communication period before the players make
   their investment and extraction decisions. By analyzing the chat
   messages exchanged among participants during the communication stage of
   the experiment, we coded up to three roles per participant using the
   scheme of seven roles known to be important in the literature: leader,
   knowledge generator, connector, follower, moralist, enforcer, and
   observer. Our study supports the importance of certain social roles
   (e.g., connector) previously highlighted by several case study analyses.
   However, using qualitative comparative analysis we found that none of
   the individual roles was sufficient for groups to succeed, i.e., to
   reach a certain level of group production. Instead, we found that a
   combination of at least five roles was necessary for success. In
   addition, in the context of upstream-downstream asymmetry, we observed a
   pattern in which social roles assumed by participants tended to differ
   by their positions. Although our work generated some interesting
   insights, further research is needed to determine how robust our
   findings are to different action situations, such as biophysical
   context, social network, and resource uncertainty.

AB Social-ecological organization is a multidimensional phenomenon that
   combines material and symbolic processes. However, the coupling between
   social and ecological subsystem is often conceptualized as purely
   material, thus reducing the symbolic dimension to its behavioral and
   actionable expressions. In this paper I conceptualize social-ecological
   systems as doubly coupled. On the one hand, material expressions of
   socio-cultural processes affect and are affected by ecological dynamics.
   On the other hand, coupled social-ecological material dynamics are
   concurrently coupled with subjective dynamics via coding, decoding,
   personal experience, and human agency. This second coupling operates
   across two organizationally heterogeneous dimensions: material and
   symbolic. Although resilience thinking builds on the recognition of
   organizational asymmetry between living and nonliving systems, it has
   overlooked the equivalent asymmetry between ecological and
   socio-cultural subsystems. Three guiding concepts are proposed to
   formalize double coupling. The first one, social-ecological asymmetry,
   expands on past seminal work on ecological self-organization to
   incorporate reflexivity and subjectivity in social-ecological modeling.
   Organizational asymmetry is based in the distinction between social
   rules, which are symbolically produced and changed through human agents'
   reflexivity and purpose, and biophysical rules, which are determined by
   functional relations between ecological components. The second guiding
   concept, conscious power, brings to the fore human agents' distinctive
   capacity to produce our own subjective identity and the consequences of
   this capacity for social-ecological organization. The third concept,
   congruence between subjective and objective dynamics, redefines
   sustainability as contingent on congruent relations between material and
   symbolic processes. Social-ecological theories and analyses based on
   these three guiding concepts would support the integration of current
   structuralist-functionalist methods, which sufficiently and
   appropriately characterize ecological organization, with ethnographic
   and narrative methods exploring human intentionality, reflexivity, and
   biographical development.

AB Education and learning possess powerful potential in affecting future
   resilience and sustainable states. Here, I focus on unpacking and
   examining the connections and feedbacks between social-environmental
   systems (SESs), resilience, and compulsory education. SESs have been
   problematized as frequently having a poor fit between environmental
   change and policy solutions. The last few decades have witnessed global
   recognition of climate change in the Arctic. This has led to discussion
   and debate over the role of schools in addressing local knowledge,
   environmental changes, and community priorities. In Alaska, USA, and
   other Arctic regions, the role of public schools in improving this fit
   has been largely overlooked. I hypothesize that, as extensions of
   governments, public schools in the North American Arctic and other
   locations offer an opportunity to create better linkages between
   societies and environments through governance. Secondarily, at the
   individual level, education is a vital component of resilience, but such
   education must embrace multiple perspectives in its curriculum to honor
   and access the diversity offered by local and traditional ecological
   knowledge and Western methods. Lastly, at the societal scale, schools
   are an untapped resource with which to meet the challenge of bolstering
   capacity for adaptation in a time of rapid transformation for Arctic
   societies.

AB Extreme weather events coupled with sea level rise and erosion will
   cause coastal and riverine areas where people live and maintain
   livelihoods to disappear permanently. Adaptation to these environmental
   changes, including the permanent relocation of millions of people,
   requires new governance tools. In the USA, local governments, often with
   state-level and national-level support, will be primarily responsible
   for protecting residents from climate-change impacts and implementing
   policies needed to protect their welfare. Government agencies have a
   variety of tools to facilitate protection in place and managed coastal
   retreat but have very limited tools to facilitate community relocation.
   In addition, no institutional mechanism currently exists to determine
   whether and when preventive relocation needs to occur to protect people
   from climate change impacts. Based on research involving four Alaska
   Native communities threatened by climate-induced environmental impacts,
   I propose the design and implementation of an adaptive governance
   framework to respond to the need to relocate populations. In this
   context, adaptive governance means the ability of institutions to
   dynamically respond to climate change impacts. A component of this
   adaptive governance framework is a social-ecological monitoring and
   assessment tool that can facilitate collaborative knowledge production
   by community residents and governance institutions to guide sustainable
   adaptation strategies and determine whether and when relocation needs to
   occur. The framework, including the monitoring and assessment tool, has
   not been systematically tested. However, the potential use of this tool
   is discussed by drawing on empirical examples of Alaskan communities
   faced with accelerating rates of erosion.

AB Background: Despite decreases in the use of illicit drugs in the United
   States, prescription medications have become a major category of
   substances used by young adults. Objective: This study examines the
   relationship between the socioeconomic status (SES) of young adult
   respondents (ages 24-32) and their history of nonmedical use of
   prescription medications (NUPM). Method: A secondary analysis was
   conducted with nationally representative data gathered from several
   waves (n = 15 701) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health (Add Health). Four categories of NUPM were examined: (i)
   sedatives; (ii) tranquilizers; (iii) stimulants; and (iv) pain killers.
   SES was defined by several measures in the Add Health survey. Given the
   complex sampling plan of the Add Health, all analyses were weighted
   appropriately. Results: Results indicated higher levels of personal SES,
   such as having health insurance or not experiencing a financial hardship
   in the past year, decreased the likelihood of reporting lifetime NUPM.
   In contrast higher levels of parent SES (e.g. parental education) were
   associated with an increased likelihood of reporting lifetime use of
   NUPM tranquilizers and stimulants. Conclusions: The results of this
   study suggest parental SES may have a stronger influence over NUPM than
   personal levels of SES, particularly for the categories of tranquilizers
   and stimulants. Furthermore, these findings indicate more research is
   needed on this subject to better understand the NUPM epidemic in order
   to effectively develop comprehensive clinical, public health, and
   policy-related intervention and prevention approaches.

AB The collection of large-scale administrative records in electronic form
   by many cities provides a new opportunity for the measurement and
   longitudinal tracking of neighborhood characteristics, but one that will
   require novel methodologies that convert such data into
   research-relevant measures. The authors illustrate these challenges by
   developing measures of "broken windows" from Boston's constituent
   relationship management (CRM) system (aka 311 hotline). A 16-month
   archive of the CRM database contains more than 300,000 address-based
   requests for city services, many of which reference physical
   incivilities (e.g., graffiti removal). The authors carry out three
   ecometric analyses, each building on the previous one. Analysis 1
   examines the content of the measure, identifying 28 items that
   constitute two independent constructs, private neglect and public
   denigration. Analysis 2 assesses the validity of the measure by using
   investigator-initiated neighborhood audits to examine the "civic
   response rate" across neighborhoods. Indicators of civic response were
   then extracted from the CRM database so that measurement adjustments
   could be automated. These adjustments were calibrated against measures
   of litter from the objective audits. Analysis 3 examines the reliability
   of the composite measure of physical disorder at different
   spatio-temporal windows, finding that census tracts can be measured at
   two-month intervals and census block groups at six-month intervals. The
   final measures are highly detailed, can be tracked longitudinally, and
   are virtually costless. This framework thus provides an example of how
   new forms of large-scale administrative data can yield ecometric
   measurement for urban science while illustrating the methodological
   challenges that must be addressed.

AB Recent methodological debates in sociology have focused on how data and
   analyses might be made more open and accessible, how the process of
   theorizing and knowledge production might be made more explicit, and how
   developing means of visualization can help address these issues. In
   ethnography, where scholars from various traditions do not necessarily
   share basic epistemological assumptions about the research enterprise
   with either their quantitative colleagues or one another, these issues
   are particularly complex. Nevertheless, ethnographers working within the
   field of sociology face a set of common pragmatic challenges related to
   managing, analyzing, and presenting the rich context-dependent data
   generated during fieldwork. Inspired by both ongoing discussions about
   how sociological research might be made more transparent, as well as
   innovations in other data-centered fields, the authors developed an
   interactive visual approach that provides tools for addressing these
   shared pragmatic challenges. They label the approach "ethnoarray"
   analysis. This article introduces this approach and explains how it can
   help scholars address widely shared logistical and technical
   complexities, while remaining sensitive to both ethnography's epistemic
   diversity and its practitioners shared commitment to depth, context, and
   interpretation. The authors use data from an ethnographic study of
   serious illness to construct a model of an ethnoarray and explain how
   such an array might be linked to data repositories to facilitate new
   forms of analysis, interpretation, and sharing within scholarly and lay
   communities. They conclude by discussing some potential implications of
   the ethnoarray and related approaches for the scope, practice, and forms
   of ethnography.

AB Some studies have shown disproportionate cancer incidence burden in

   wide geographic spans. Counties in SEER 18 registries (years 2001-2011)
   were classified by their Rural-Urban Continuum Code (RUCC) and
   aggregated into urban, adjacent rural, and non-adjacent rural and were
   also aggregated into 3 regions: North, South, and West. Two-way ANCOVA
   was performed with region and RUCC as factors with adjustment for rates
   of common risk factors obtained from the County Health Rankings (2013).
   RUCC has a significant effect on incidence rate in urban areas on breast
   (P = 0.001) and prostate (P = 0.009). Colorectal significantly varies by
   region (P<0.0001), and the effect of rurality significantly varies
   across regions with North highest (P = 0.0005). Lung rates significantly
   vary across both region and RUCC (P<0.0001 and P = 0.0001,
   respectively). The analysis shows that risk-adjusted cancer incidence
   varies significantly across regions. However, we also found that rural
   cancer incidence significantly varied across otherwise-similar rural
   areas implying that 'rural' is not a homogeneous classification.

AB Purpose - We propose an elaboration of the social structure and
   personality framework from sociological social psychology that is
   intended to promote integration across social psychological traditions
   and between social psychology and sociology, using the study of
   inequality as an example.
   Methodology/approach - We develop a conceptualization of "generic"
   proximate processes that produce and reproduce inequality in
   face-to-face interaction: status, identity, and justice.
   Findings - The elaborated framework suggests fundamental questions that
   analysts can pose about the macro-micro dynamics of inequality. These
   questions direct attention to the "how" and "why" of macro-micro
   relations by connecting structural and cultural systems, local contexts,
   and the lives of individual persons; highlighting implicit processes;
   making meaning central; and directing our attention to how people act
   efficaciously in the face of constraint.
   Practical implications - Applying this framework, scholars can use
   existing theories and generate new ones, and can do so inductively or
   deductively.
   Social implications - Research on inequality is enriched by social
   psychological analyses that draw on the full complement of relevant
   methods and theories.
   Originality/value - We make visible the social psychological
   underpinnings of sociological research on inequality and provide a
   template for macro-micro analyses that emphasizes the centrality of
   social psychological processes.

AB I discuss the concept of complexity and the burgeoning field of complex
   systems and their relevance to sociology. I begin by comparing and
   contrasting various definitions of complexity and then describe the
   attributes of systems capable of producing complexity: diversity,
   networked interactions, interdependent behavior, and adaptation. Next, I
   survey the contributions of complexity sciences with the most resonance
   with sociology. I organize those contributions into four categories:
   dynamics, aggregation, distributions, and functional properties of
   structure and diversity. On the basis of that survey, I conclude that
   incorporating complexity science into sociology requires the
   introduction of new models and methodologies as well as a more expansive
   approach to empirical research, and that the benefits of a deeper
   engagement with complexity will be substantial.

AB Charter schools have been on the educational reform landscape for over
   twenty years. In the last ten years, a number of rigorous studies have
   examined the effects of these schools on student achievement and
   educational attainment. Findings reveal mixed results where student
   achievement is concerned (i.e., some positive, some negative, some
   neutral) and positive results in terms of educational attainment (i.e.,
   high school graduation and college attendance). The article places this
   research within a framework that draws on both market and institutional
   theories, and concludes that additional research on the social
   organization of charter schools and traditional public schools is needed
   to better understand the conditions under which school choice is or is
   not effective.

AB The existing evidence linking recessions to individual and population
   health presents a puzzle. Some studies show that people who experience
   the kinds of labor market, housing, and asset shocks that proliferate in
   recessions suffer negative health consequences, whereas other studies
   show that mortality rates fall when the economy worsens. This review
   synthesizes evidence from these distinct research traditions in light of
   emerging findings from the Great Recession of 2007-2009. It traces
   pathways by which macroeconomic changes "get under the skin" and
   generate contradictory aggregate-and individual-level consequences.
   Research on the longer-term health effects of recessions could be
   strengthened by integrating theoretical and analytical approaches from
   sociology. These include a multilevel perspective that considers how
   individuals cope with recessions as members of families and communities
   embedded in different policy environments, and attention to cascades of
   recessionary shocks, individuals' strategies for coping with them, and
   the way these intersect with health trajectories.

AB At the close of World War II, "development" began to evolve along two
   paths. On the first path, scholars aimed to generate theoretical
   understandings of social change, especially at the national level
   (development studies). On the second path, policy makers in governments
   and other development-focused organizations initiated actions to promote
   positive social change, especially in poor or war-torn nations
   (development practice). In this article, we review the recent trajectory
   of "development" in sociology, paying close attention to the
   intersections between development studies and development practice.
   Through explicit comparisons to economics and political science, we
   demonstrate how the prominence of development sociology has varied
   historically in relation to its proposed policy prescriptions. We
   conclude by highlighting five uniquely sociological contributions that
   could powerfully improve contemporary interdisciplinary development
   conversations, and by calling for greater sociological attention to the
   complex ways in which a growing transnational field of development
   practitioners is shaping a multiplicity of development outcomes.

AB Improving science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)
   education, especially for traditionally disadvantaged groups, is widely
   recognized as pivotal to the United States's long-term economic growth
   and security. In this article, we review and discuss current research on
   STEM education in the United States, drawing on recent research in
   sociology and related fields. The reviewed literature shows that
   different social factors affect the two major components of STEM
   education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b)
   attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional
   on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological
   characteristics matter for both components, as do structural influences
   at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels.
   However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES)
   predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological
   factors are more important influences on participation and achievement
   in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family
   SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally,
   American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic
   resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States
   and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require
   more research, a task that is best accomplished through
   interdisciplinary approaches.

AB This paper begins by outlining the basic attitudinal differences between
   the elite and the rest of society. Understanding these divergent views
   does not require resorting to arguments that reply upon error,
   ignorance, manipulation, or differences in individual character.
   Instead, both elites and others are correct in their understanding of
   these processes because they overgeneralize from their own experience.
   The major proposition of this paper is that if we compare the economic
   conditions of the average American and to that of the elite, we find
   that they are, in important ways, the inverse of one another. During
   times when Americans as a whole were experiencing economic advancement
   and mobility, elites were comparatively stagnant. And today, as most
   Americans are locked in place, elites observe tremendous mobility. The
   counter-cyclical character of the elite has important implications for
   our understanding of elite culture, and elite response to inequality and
   redistribution.

AB The environment of most organizations is beset by continuous change,
   instability, flux, and unpredictability. If organizations are to survive
   and prosper under such conditions, they must be capable of dynamic
   adaption and stable and reliable performance. Organization theory
   recognizes the importance of both imperatives, but typically assumes
   that they pull organizations in different directions. Building on
   Selznick's theory of institutionalization, we argue that institutions
   can, should and sometimes do master the challenge of being responsive
   and stable, while avoiding the potentially destructive tendencies of
   rigidity and opportunism. Contrary to a prominent view that strong
   institutionalization leads to inertia, Selznick's theory suggests that
   strong institutions are capable of preemptive adaptation to protect the
   character of their institutions. We describe this state as one of
   dynamic conservatism and explore four types of preemptive internal
   reform strategies: strategic retreat, selfcannibalization,
   experimentation, and repositioning. We conclude with a consideration of
   factors that might moderate the ability of strong institutions to
   proactively change in order to remain the same.

AB This paper examines the life and career of the prominent sociologist
   Werner Stark (1909-1985), born and raised in Marienbad, Bohemia, and
   after 1918 in the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia. As a prolific
   and wide-ranging scholar whose many works failed to find an enduring
   place in American sociology, Stark is a prime example of academic
   marginalisation. The authors analyse Stark's major contributions from
   the standpoint of the sociology of knowledge. They argue that his ideas
   regarding human nature, the need for social discipline, and the
   desirability of community were rooted in a pervasive biographical
   marginality that found resolution in his conversion to Catholicism. In
   turn, these ideas reinforced the marginality from which they emerged.
   The reception of Stark's work in the United States was governed by a
   perceived incompatibility of his outlook with the assumptions and goals
   of his American audience. In particular, Stark offered an explicitly
   value-directed sociology, one which asserted the importance of social
   order, individual discipline, and universal community, at a time (the
   1960s and 1970s) when the field sought to maintain its credibility as an
   objective scientific discipline in the face of growing challenges from
   sociologists and non-sociologists alike. Stark's American colleagues
   focused on aspects of his work that were incompatible with their own
   cultural and disciplinary orientations and this obscured the full range
   of his achievements, especially his analyses which anticipated
   contemporary sociological work.

AB A central and long-standing theoretical problem in sociology concerns
   how differentiated social units are integrated. This problem, however,
   has been peripheralised since the decline of functionalism, while
   legitimation and regulation/power-differentials have moved to the
   forefront. This article argues that by reconceptualising the concept,
   generalised symbolic media, a robust theory of integration can be
   posited that does not sacrifice the importance of regulation (control)
   or legitimation (meaning). This paper extends both the Simmelian and
   functionalist versions of media by: (1) precisely defining the concept;
   (2) examining its two forms a specialised institutional language and an
   external referent of value; (3) elucidating the three modes of
   orientation various media impose; and (4) extending the function of
   media beyond (social) exchange to include other institutional processes
   such as communicative action, performance, and ritualised interaction.
   Ultimately, a reconceptualised theory of generalised symbolic media
   offers sociology a mechanism that simultaneously highlights the
   diversity found across institutional spheres, as well as the limits
   humans have in dealing with the problems posed by differentiation.

   Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study evaluating racial
   disparities relating to stroke, subclinical brain infarction,
   leukoaraiosis, as well as cognitive change and dementia. ARIC is a
   biracial cohort of 15,792 participants from four U.S. communities,
   initially recruited in 1987-1989, and seen at a total of 5 in-person
   visits (most recently seen in 2011-2013) with annual follow-up phone

   rates of vascular risk factors explain at least some of these observed
   disparities by race, but particular risk factors, including diabetes,
   may differentially affect the brain in African-American versus white
   participants. In addition, we will review some of the disparities by

AB Rapid climate change poses complex challenges for conservation,
   especially in tropical developing countries where biodiversity is high
   while financial and technical resources are limited. The complexity is
   heightened by uncertainty in predicted effects, both for ecological
   systems and human communities that depend heavily on natural resource
   extraction and use. Effective conservation plans and measures must be
   inexpensive, fast-acting, and able to increase the resilience of both
   the ecosystem and the social-ecological system. We present conservation
   practitioners with a framework that strategically integrates climate
   change planning into connectivity measures for tropical mountain
   ecosystems in Costa Rica. We propose a strategy for doubling the amount
   of habitat currently protected in riparian corridors using measures that
   are relatively low cost and fast-acting, and will employ and expand
   human capital. We argue that habitat connectivity must be enhanced along
   latitudinal gradients, but also within the same elevational bands, via a
   lattice-work corridor system. This is needed to facilitate range shifts
   for mobile species and evolutionary adaptation for less mobile species.
   We think that conservation measures within the elevational bands must
   include conservation-friendly land uses that improve current and future
   human livelihoods under dynamic conditions. Key components include
   community involvement, habitat priority-setting, forest landscape
   restoration, and environmental services payments. Our approach is
   fundamentally adaptive in that the conservation measures employed are
   informed by on-the-ground successes and failures and modified
   accordingly, but are relatively low risk and fast-acting. Our proposal,
   if implemented, would satisfy tenets of climate-smart conservation,
   improve the resilience of human and ecological communities, and be a
   model for other locations facing similar challenges.

AB As the magnitude, complexity, and urgency of many sustainability
   problems increase, there is a growing need for universities to
   contribute more effectively to problem solving. Drawing upon prior
   research on social-ecological systems, knowledge-action connections, and
   organizational innovation, we developed an integrated conceptual
   framework for strengthening the capacity of universities to help society
   understand and respond to a wide range of sustainability challenges.
   Based on experiences gained in creating the Senator George J. Mitchell
   Center for Sustainability Solutions (Mitchell Center), we tested this
   framework by evaluating the experiences of interdisciplinary research
   teams involved in place-based, solutions-oriented research projects at
   the scale of a single region (i.e., the state of Maine, USA). We
   employed a multiple-case-study approach examining the experiences of
   three interdisciplinary research teams working on tidal energy
   development, adaptation to climate change, and forest vulnerability to
   an invasive insect. Drawing upon documents, observations, interviews,
   and other data sources, three common patterns emerged across these cases
   that were associated with more effective problem-solving strategies.
   First, an emphasis on local places and short-term dynamics in
   social-ecological systems research provides more frequent opportunities
   for learning while doing. Second, iterative stakeholder engagement and
   inclusive forms of knowledge co-production can generate substantial
   returns on investment, especially when researchers are dedicated to a
   shared process of problem identification and they avoid framing
   solutions too narrowly. Although these practices are time consuming,
   they can be accelerated by leveraging existing stakeholder
   relationships. Third, efforts to mobilize interdisciplinary expertise
   and link knowledge with action are facilitated by an organizational
   culture that emphasizes mutual respect, adaptability, and solutions.
   Participation of faculty associated with interdisciplinary academic
   programs, solutions-oriented fields, and units with partnership-oriented
   missions hastens collaboration within teams and between teams and
   stakeholders. The Mitchell Center also created a risk-tolerant culture
   that encouraged organizational learning. Solutions-focused programs at
   other universities can potentially benefit from the lessons we learned.

   as a participatory method for understanding social-ecological systems
   (SESs). In recent years, FCM has been used in a diverse set of contexts
   ranging from fisheries management to agricultural development, in an
   effort to generate transparent graphical models of complex systems that
   are useful for decision making, illuminate the core presumptions of
   environmental stakeholders, and structure environmental problems for
   scenario development. This increase in popularity is because of FCM's
   bottom-up approach and its ability to incorporate a range of individual,
   community-level, and expert knowledge into an accessible and
   standardized format. Although there has been an increase in the use of
   FCM as an environmental planning and learning tool, limited progress has
   been made with regard to the method's relationship to existing
   resilience frameworks and how the use of FCM compares with other
   participatory modeling/approaches available. Using case study data
   developed from community-driven models of the bushmeat trade in
   Tanzania, we examine the usefulness of FCM for promoting resilience
   analysis among stakeholders in terms of identifying key state variables
   that comprise an SES, evaluating alternative SES equilibrium states, and
   defining desirable or undesirable state outcomes through scenario
   analysis.

   multilevel selection in particular, can improve on these fronts. We
   outline a multilevel evolutionary framework for describing
   social-ecological change and detail how multilevel cooperative dynamics
   can determine outcomes in environmental dilemmas. We show how this
   framework complements existing sustainability frameworks with a
   description of the emergence and persistence of sustainable institutions
   and behavior, a means to generalize causal patterns across
   social-ecological contexts, and a heuristic for designing and evaluating
   effective sustainability interventions. We support these assertions with
   case examples from developed and developing countries in which we track
   cooperative change at multiple levels of social organization as they
   impact social-ecological outcomes. Finally, we make suggestions for
   further theoretical development, empirical testing, and application.

AB Anthropogenic climate change has impacted and will continue to impact
   the natural environment and people around the world. Increasing
   temperatures and altered rainfall patterns combined with socio-economic
   factors such as population changes, land use changes and water transfers
   will affect flows and nutrient fluxes in river systems. The Ganga river,
   one of the largest river systems in the world, supports approximately
   10% global population and more than 700 cities. Changes in the Ganga
   river system are likely to have a significant impact on water
   availability, water quality, aquatic habitats and people. In order to
   investigate these potential changes on the flow and water quality of the
   Ganga river, a multi-branch version of INCA Phosphorus (INCA-P) model
   has been applied to the entire river system. The model is used to
   quantify the impacts from a changing climate, population growth,
   additional agricultural land, pollution control and water transfers for
   2041-2060 and 2080-2099. The results provide valuable information about
   potential effects of different management strategies on catchment water
   quality.

AB Objective.To estimate changes in self-report and treatment of diabetes
   and hypertension between 2001 and 2012 among Mexican aged 50-80,
   assessing the contribution of education and health insurance coverage.
   Materials and methods. The Mexican Health and Aging Study was used to
   estimate associations of education and insurance on prevalence and
   treatment of diabetes and hypertension in 2001 and 2012. Multivariate
   decomposition was used to assess the contribution of changes in the
   composition of covariates vs. their "effects" on changes in prevalence
   and treatment over time. Results. Increases in the prevalence/diagnosis
   and treatment during the period are largely attributable to the
   expansion of health insurance. Its effects on diagnosis/prevalence and
   treatment have also increased overtime. Conclusions.The expansion of
   Seguro Popular likely improved screening and treatment. More research is
   needed to assess if these have translated into better control and a
   lower burden of disease.

AB We examine the adaptability of collaborative governance regimes
   associated with publicly managed ecosystems as they move from
   direction-setting to implementation phases. This is an under-researched
   topic and is particularly relevant given the growth of collaborative
   environmental governance efforts around the globe. Through an in-depth
   analysis of a case study spanning 10 years of the Front Range Roundtable
   in Colorado, USA, we examine the effect of forces internal and external
   to the Roundtable on three attributes associated with the adaptive
   capacity of environmental governance: social capital, learning, and
   flexibility in implementing innovative actions. We find that the
   Roundtable has been highly sensitive to internal and external changes,
   and that the absence of mechanisms through which social networks and
   learning can be durably linked to implementation decisions of
   bureaucracies with management authority compromises the Roundtable's
   continued adaptability. From this case study, we develop three
   empirically testable propositions related to social capital and
   learning, national policy change, and boundary objects as collaborative
   regimes transition to implementation, along with an analytical framework
   to examine collaborative governance change and adaptability over time.

AB Countries in the Caribbean region, including Belize, are vulnerable to
   coastal erosion. Experts and scholars have assessed the effects of
   coastal erosion in the region in physical and economic terms, most often
   from a sectoral perspective. However, less attention has been directed
   to the localized and nonquantifiable effects of coastal erosion in the
   region. We address this research gap by presenting an empirical study of
   a village in southern Belize that has experienced significant coastal
   erosion since the mid-1980s. Drawing on interviews, a mapping exercise,
   and a literature review, we analyze how villagers are experiencing the
   impacts of coastal change, and what the resulting risks and losses mean
   for the socioeconomic stability of the village. We identify five
   categories of local values affected by coastal erosion, ranging from
   alteration of social activities to the loss of properties. We
   demonstrate that the totality of impacts bear consequences to the
   village's continued viability, which adds uncertainty to the lives of
   local residents.
