AB Why and to what extent do people make significant purchases from people
   with whom they have prior noncommercial relationships? Using data from
   the economic sociology module of the 1996 General Social Survey, we
   document high levels of within-network exchanges. We argue that
   transacting with social contacts is effective because it embeds
   commercial exchanges in a web of obligations and holds the seller's
   network hostage to appropriate role performance in the economic
   transaction. It follows that within-network exchanges will be more
   common in risky transactions that are unlikely to be repeated and in
   which uncertainty is high. The data support this view. Self-reports
   about major purchases are consistent with the expectation that exchange
   frequency reduces the extent of within-network exchanges. Responses to
   questions about preferences for in-group exchanges support the argument
   that uncertainty about product and performance quality leads people to
   prefer sellers with whom they have noncommercial ties. Moreover, people
   prefer to avoid selling to social contacts under the same conditions
   that lead buyers to seek such transactions; and people who transact with
   friends and relatives report greater satisfaction with the results than
   do people who transact with strangers, especially for risk-laden
   exchanges.

AB Background: Studies have found that female faculty publish less, have
   slower career progress, and generally have a more difficult time in
   academic careers than male faculty. The relation of family (dependent)
   responsibilities to gender and academic productivity is unclear.
   Objective: To describe dependent responsibilities by gender and to
   identify their relation to the aspirations, goals, rate of progress,
   academic productivity, and career satisfaction of male and female
   medical school faculty.
   Design: 177-item survey questionnaire.
   Setting: 24 randomly selected medical schools in the contiguous United
   States.
   Participants: 1979 respondents from a probability sample of full-time
   academic medical school faculty.
   Measurements: The main end point for measuring academic productivity was
   the total number of publications in refereed journals. Perceived career
   progress and career satisfaction were assessed by using Likert scales.
   Results: For both male and female faculty, more than 90% of time devoted
   to family responsibilities was spent on child care. Among faculty with
   children, women had greater obstacles to academic careers and less
   institutional support, including research funding from their
   institutions (46% compared with 57%; P < 0.001) and secretarial sup port
   (0.68 full-time equivalents compared with 0.83 full-time equivalents; P
   = 0.003), than men. Compared with men with children, women with children
   had fewer publications (18.3 compared with 29.3; P < 0.001), slower
   self-perceived career progress (2.6 compared with 3.1; P < 0.001), and
   lower career satisfaction (5.9 compared with 6.6; P < 0.001). However,
   no significant differences between the sexes were seen for faculty
   without children.
   Conclusions: Compared with female faculty without children and compared
   with men, female faculty with children face major obstacles in academic
   careers. Some of these obstacles can be easily modified (for example, by
   eliminating after-hours meetings and creating part-time career tracks).
   Medical schools should address these obstacles and provide support for
   faculty with children.

AB Inhabitants of the Croatian islands of Brac, Hvar, Korcula, and the
   Peljesac Peninsula have been the subject of extensive previous studies
   of local population differentiation. Most of these studies used
   biological and ecological variables, but some also considered historical
   and sociological factors. In this study we use genetic, morphological,
   kinship, and language distance data, collected for individuals from 26
   rural communities on the islands of Brac, Hvar, Korcula, and the
   Peljesac Peninsula in the Adriatic, to further explore the interaction
   of historical, sociological, and biological factors in small populations
   and to test the significance of some of these proposed causes. First, we
   use matrix correlation methods to evaluate the relationships among
   different types of distance measures. The specific measures of genetic
   distance used here do not correlate well with other measures of
   population distance, and it appears that for the studied genetic systems
   the populations are not strongly differentiated. As expected, kinship
   and language distances have a high degree of association. Morphological
   differences among populations seem to be more closely tied to kinship
   distances than to genetic distances. This may result from modification
   of some morphological features by environmental rather than genetic
   factors, or it may be attributed to extensive, selective, nonrandom
   emigration of the population during the first decade of the twentieth
   century. In the second part of our analysis we use matrix correlation
   methods to evaluate and possibly identify the external factors that have
   contributed to the population differences. Specifically, we use design
   matrices to test hypotheses that population differences can be explained
   by one of the following factors: geographic isolation on the islands and
   peninsula, distance from the mainland, geographic barriers within the
   islands and peninsula, and the historical factors that differentially
   affected the three islands and the peninsula. Most of these design
   matrices reflect geographic distances; although correlations between
   morphological variables and simple geographic distance between
   localities were not significant, correlations between these localities
   and a design matrix incorporating geographic distance along with
   geographic barriers, such as bodies of water and mountain ranges, are
   particularly important for explaining distances among kin. Design
   matrices provide an important tool for quantifying the relationship
   between historical and geographic factors, and measures of population
   distance.

AB I compared one genetic marker, skin reflectances, between Bolivians of

   and 65 girls) and at low altitude in Santa Cruz (400 m; 140 boys and 117
   girls). Reflectances were measured at three wavelengths (425 nm, 545 nm,
   and 685 nm) on two different sites: the medial surface of the inner
   upper arm and the forehead. Principal components analysis was used to
   reduce age-, sex-, and surname-standardized reflectances to three
   independent components. The first principal component, which assesses
   the genetic component of melanin concentration, did not differ between
   samples, indicating that there are no significant differences between
   lowland and highland Bolivians of European ancestry with respect to the
   genetic component of skin reflectances. The second principal component,
   which assesses the influence of tanning on skin reflectance, also did
   not differ significantly between highlanders and lowlanders. Finally,
   the third principal component, which assesses the impact of vascularity
   on skin reflectance, was significantly lower in residents of La Pat than
   in residents of Santa Cruz, suggesting a greater vascularity-induced
   darkening of skin color in highlanders than lowlanders, possibly
   reflecting the higher hemoglobin concentrations that are typical of
   highland populations.

AB This essay describes institutional ethnography as a method of inquiry
   pioneered by Dorothy E. Smith, and introduces a collection of papers
   which make distinctive contributions to the development of this novel
   form of investigation. Institutional ethnography is presented as a
   research strategy which emerges from Smith's wide-ranging explorations
   of the problematic of the everyday world. Smith's conception of the
   everyday world as problematic involves a critical departure from the
   concepts and procedures of more conventional sociologies. She argues for
   an alternative sociology which begins with the standpoint of the actor
   in everyday life, rather than from within a professional sociological
   discourse aligned with the society's ruling institutions. The familiar
   sociologies of everyday life do not suffice for this purpose, since they
   deal with local settings and social worlds, but stop short of examining
   how these are knitted into broader forms of social organization In
   contrast, institutional ethnography examines how the scenes of everyday
   life are shaped by forms of social organization which cannot be fully
   grasped from within those scenes. The principal tasks of institutional
   ethnography include describing the coordination of activities in the
   everyday world, discovering how ideological accounts define those
   activities in relation to institutional imperatives, and examining the
   broader social relations in which local sites of activity are embedded.
   The four papers which follow demonstrate that specific contributions to
   institutional ethnography can be made in relation to a wide array of
   topics, methods, and interests.

   psychosocial predictors of high-risk sexual behavior and condom use. The
   sample included 824 ninth-graders, most of whom are African American. We
   conducted separate analyses for whites and African Americans. Predictors
   included alcohol and substance use, delinquency, prosocial behaviors,
   and family and peer influences. We found that problem behaviors
   predicted high-risk sexual behavior; but the effects were stronger for
   white youth. We also found that friends' behaviors were more predictive
   than family influences, except for family conflict. In general, the
   models explained more variance for white youths than for
   African-American youths. The results suggest that problem behavior
   theory and social interactions theory may be most relevant for white
   youth and that other models may be necessary to explain high-risk sexual
   behavior among African-American youths.

AB Information on reproductive attitudes is now routinely collected in
   fertility surveys in developing countries, and has become very important
   for understanding fertility behaviour. The quality of this information,
   however, is rarely assessed, partly due to lack of necessary data. In
   this paper, the recently completed panel survey in Morocco by the
   Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) was used to investigate the
   consistency of reporting of ideal number of children, reproductive
   intentions and the planning status of the last birth. The validity of
   reproductive intentions for subsequent fertility behaviour was also
   examined. The findings indicate that the three measures of reproductive
   attitudes are subject to different degrees of measurement error. The
   measure of reproductive intentions is the most consistent of the three,
   followed by ideal number of children. The latter is much more consistent
   at the aggregate level than at the individual level. The reliability of
   the planning status of the last birth is marred, mainly by an unwanted
   child being reclassified as 'wanted' with time since the birth of the
   child. The reproductive intentions of women were also found to be
   positively related to their subsequent fertility.

AB Breast-feeding and weaning practices were observed for a cohort of 81
   children under 3 years of age in the context of a longitudinal study of
   social, ecological and nutritional factors affecting growth in a
   semi-nomadic population of pastoralists in northern Tanzania (WaDatoga
   of Mbulu District). The adequacy of indigenous infant and young child
   feeding practices was assessed in relation to current international
   recommendations. Objectives were to provide baseline data for future
   investigations of any changes in young child feeding practices which
   accompany population shifts towards settlement and non-pastoral modes of
   subsistence, and to improve understanding of the strengths and
   limitations of indigenous feeding practices in this type of population.
   It was found that while breast-feeding was universally initiated, other
   aspects of young child feeding practices do not meet current
   international recommendations. Prelacteal feeds are commonly used,
   supplementary feeding with non-human milks usually occurs before 4
   months of age, use of solid foods normally begins later than 6 months,
   and breast-feeding does not continue until 2 years of age for the
   majority of children. The data have implications for the design of
   breast-feeding promotion and improved weaning food interventions among
   African pastoralists.

   and their ability to make use of "the sociological imagination" (Mills
   1959). Like any instructional method, professors must carefully plan and
   structure internships to ensure that they are effective. Whenever

AB Aims. To develop and test a non-recursive model that examines the
   effects of parental psychoactive substance use disorder (PSUD) on the
   reciprocal relationships among stressful life events, family attachment,
   peer drug use and adolescent drug use. Design. A 3-year prospective
   cohort study followed adolescents from three types of families defined
   by a parental diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder. Setting. A large
   metropolitan area in the upper Midwestern United States. Participants.
   Seven hundred and seventy-seven 10-16-year-old adolescents from three
   groups of families: 214 who resided in families in which a parent was
   diagnosed with PSUD, 181 who resided in families in which a parent was
   diagnosed with an affective disorder (but no co-morbid PSUD), and 382
   who resided in families in which both parents were free of any
   diagnosable disorder. Measurements. Psychiatric disorder was defined by
   the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). Two follow-up
   interviews of adolescent respondents were used to measure stressful life
   events via the Junior High Life Experiences Survey, family attachment
   via FACES-III and a child-parent strain index, peer drug use, and two
   self-reported drug use scales designed to measure past-year alcohol use
   and illicit drug use (e.g. marijuana, cocaine, inhalants). Findings.
   Nested structural equation models with latent variables revealed that
   adolescents fr om PSUD families were at heightened risk of stressful
   life events, peer drug use, attenuated family attachments and drug use
   during the first follow-up period. In rum, peer drug use was strongly
   associated with drug use during the second follow-up period. However,
   drug use during the first follow-up also led to greater peer drug use
   and attenuated family attachment during the second follow-up period. The
   findings support a non-recursive model describing relations among
   adolescent drug use, peer drug use and family attachment. Conclusions.
   Parental psychoactive substance use disorder puts adolescents at
   significant risk of becoming embedded in a cycle of drug use,
   associations with drug using peers, and poor family relations.

   information from one historical period to illuminate another. It begins
   by showing how the strengths and weaknesses of methods commonly used to
   compare institutions or regions reappear in comparisons between times.
   The discussion then turns to alternative approaches. The use of
   narrative and of path dependency to construct explanatory sequences are
   strategies that strike a welcome balance between causal generalization
   and historical detail. But these approaches typically fail to identify
   either the causal mechanisms or the trajectories that link events in
   different eras. These gaps can be filled by rethinking sequences of
   events across periods as reiterated problem solving. Successive U.S.
   industrial relations regimes since 1900 are used to illustrate this

AB Most analyses of resistance, subjectivity, and identity formation have
   been developed out of research on predominantly 'western' industrialized
   nations. This research has been full of insight, but it has limited our
   understanding of the importance of historical specificity, of
   conjunctural relations, and of the ways class, gender, and race/ethnic
   histories and experiences take an specific meanings in different
   contexts. By focusing on one of these 'different contexts'-South Korea
   and its recent moves to institute career education and to have more
   students identify as manual workers-we wish to show how such
   specificities work to produce particular forms of resistance,
   subjectivity, and identity. In the Republic of Korea (South Korea), the
   dominant faction of the power bloc has tried to reconstitute work
   subjectivity through education as part of its ongoing hegemonic project.
   This has been done in order to deal with economic stagnation and to
   recover the bloc's political and ideological power which was seriously
   weakened by the democratic and labor movements of the 1980s. This paper
   examines the ways in which administrators, teachers, and students in
   Korean commercial high schools responded to the policies and work
   subjectivities that were newly articulated by the dominant group. Data

AB Marital dysfunction is a significant problem in the U.S., with
   far-ranging effects on the mental health, Physical health, and economic
   well-being of people who experience it. In addition, marital discord and
   divorce appear to have adverse effects on children. This review
   describes the historical roots of current prevention programs and
   critically reviews marriage preparation programs that have been examined
   in the peer-reviewed literature. The results of 13 studies suggest that
   behaviorally oriented, skills-based marriage preparation Programs can
   lead to behavioral changes that may help, prevent the emergence of
   marital dysfunction. Whereas there has been modest improvement in the
   methodology of the program evaluations, suggestions for continued
   improvements are made. Ways to enhance the effectiveness of marriage
   preparation programs using the principles of prevention are described.

AB Two hundred sixty-eight African-American and white children and their

   was to examine the potential collective impact of maternal hostile
   coping styles and perceptions of family functioning upon youths'
   cardiovascular (CV) functioning 2.4 years later, within the context of
   SES and ethnicity. The mother completed a set of questionnaires that
   included the Cook-Medley Hostility Scale and three scales from the
   Family Environment  Scale (FES). Childrens' systolic and diastolic blood
   pressure (SBP and DBP) and impedance cardiography derived total
   peripheral resistance (TPR) was measured at rest two years later.
   Mothers with lower SES and African-American mothers reported higher
   levels of hostility compared to those with higher SES and white mothers,
   respectively. Lower SES mothers reported lower levels of family cohesion
   and expressiveness than higher SES mothers. Whites reported more family
   conflict and expressiveness  than African Americans. African-American
   and lower SES youth exhibited higher SBP and DBP values than whites and
   higher SES youth. Among lower SES African-American youth, CV functioning
   tended to be impacted negatively when their mothers rated themselves
   high in hostility. Findings suggest that ethnicity and SES may have
   independent as well as interactive impacts on the influence of maternal
   coping styles on the CV functioning of their children, particularly
   those from lower SES backgrounds.

AB Influenced by classical sociology, constructionist tradition and Pierre
   Bourdieu's writings, this article examines the capital of Russian
   bankers who are perceived as the prime movers of Russia's transition to
   the market. The bankers were selected as subjects for analysis because
   they represent profit-making enterprises in a country where money and
   capital had pejorative meanings prior to the recent capitalist-style
   reforms. It was not money but social relations that served as a primary
   medium of exchange in the Soviet system. Exploring what constitutes the
   major 'currency' in the new Russia, this article also questions whether
   the bankers' constructions of self and society differ from the
   prevailing code of the Russian/Soviet cultural repertoire that is seen
   as anti-individualistic, anti-materialistic and anticapitalist. Relying
   upon a survey of 484 bankers and 61 interviews with managers from Moscow
   and St Petersburg commercial banks, the article comes to the conclusion
   that these bankers possess substantial holdings in the form of money and
   social resources, and are also culturally well equipped for market
   experiences. However, their economic, social and cultural capital is
   only partially converted into symbolic capital interpreted as the most
   universal form of capital. Inadequacy of symbolic capital may question
   the legitimacy of other economic, social and cultural assets, and have
   negative repercussions for market-building in Russia.

AB Objective: Although the recent spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually
   transmitted diseases (STDs) in China has been associated with sexual
   activities, little information has been available about sexual behavior
   in rural areas with high HIV prevalence. Studies identifying high-risk
   sexual behaviors are needed to formulate effective prevention programs.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used to measure sexual
   activities using a two-stage cluster sampling method. A two-part
   anonymous questionnaire was used. Sensitive questions related to sexual
   behavior were administered using a tape recorder, earphones, and an
   answer sheet which did not include the text.
   Results: In total, 1057 subjects were interviewed. Among 886 sexually
   active individuals, 7.8% had > 1 sexual partner, 22.8% had premarital
   sex, 2.4% had anal intercourse, 4.1% had oral intercourse, and 2.3% had
   both anal and oral intercourse. Less than 2% reported past or current
   sexually transmitted diseases. Overall, 10.4% used condoms, only 11.2%
   for every sexual act. History of premarital and extramarital sex was
   higher in younger people.
   Conclusions: Sexual norms in rural China are changing rapidly and
   high-risk sexual behavior among young rural residents is increasing.
   Strategies to prevent HIV/AIDS should include education to promote
   delayed onset of sexual activity, safer sexual behavior, and condom use.

BP 3101
EP 3104
PD SEP 1998
PY 1998
AB Purpose: Diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer is a major health
   problem, especially among low-income men. Opportunities vary for early
   detection of prostate cancer for low-income black and white men because
   of financial, cultural, and social factors. In this study we evaluated
   the association of poor literacy skills with higher rates of
   presentation of advanced stages of prostate cancer among low-income
   black and white men who received care in equal-access medical systems.
   Patients and Methods: Literacy and stage at diagnosis of prostate cancer
   were evaluated in 212 low-income men who received medical care in
   Shreveport, LA, and Chicago, IL. The patients' literacy was assessed
   with the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), an
   individually administered reading screening test designed specifically
   for use in the medical setting. Logistic regression models were used to
   evaluate predictors of metastatic disease at presentation as a function
   of patient age, race, literacy, and city.
   Results: Whereas black men were almost twice as likely to present with
   stage D prostate cancer (49.5% v 35.9%; P < .05), they were
   significantly more likely to have literacy levels less than sixth grade
   (52.3% v 8.7%; P < .001). However, after adjustment for differences in
   literacy, age, and city, race was not a significant predictor of
   advanced-stage prostate cancer.
   Conclusion: Low literacy may be an overlooked but significant barrier to
   the diagnosis of early stage prostate cancer among law-income white and
   black men. The development of culturally sensitive, low-literacy
   educational materials may improve patient awareness of prostate cancer
   and improve the frequency of diagnosis of early-stage cancer. J Clin

AB This study, modeled after a study conducted in the New England region of

   Respondents to a questionnaire survey indicated a median
   willingness-to-pay of A$100 (A$=Australian dollars) (upper
   quartile=A$150, lower quartile=A$50) per household per year for 5 years
   and a mean of A$124.37 (95%Cl=A$107.49-141.24). A conservative estimate
   of the aggregate value of wetlands in New South Wales, based on
   willingness-to-pay values reported by respondents and assuming that
   nonrespondents are not willing to pay for wetland conservation, is A$38
   million per year for the next 5 years. In absolute terms,
   willingness-to-pay in New South Wales was somewhat lower than that of
   New England, but when compared as a fraction of the gross domestic
   product for Australia and the United States, willingness-to-pay was
   slightly higher in New South Wales. Over 90% of respondents considered
   the intrinsic value of wetlands and the importance of conserving
   wetlands for future generations when answering questions about
   willingness-to-pay. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

PD SEP 1998
PY 1998
AB Objective: This article examines the differences in the clinical course
   of alcohol dependence in men and women, interpreting results in light of
   the gender differences in nonalcoholics and potential findings from the
   general population. Method: As part of the Collaborative Study on the
   Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA) protocol, a detailed semistructured
   interview was administered to 1,085 alcohol dependent women and 2,120
   alcohol dependent men, along with 1,936 women and 1,233 men who a ere
   drinkers but not alcoholic. Subjects were alcohol dependent probands,
   controls, and relatives of each. Results: The men's and women's rank
   orders of alcohol-related life events were similar for alcohol dependent
   subjects, with a rho (rho) of .95, a figure that remained constant even
   when only primary alcoholics were considered. In general, those items
   for which the two genders evidenced differences in either the mean age
   of occurrence or the proportion of people who experienced an event were
   similar to gender differences in drinking among nonalcoholics or the
   literature on the general population. These included for women a lower
   maximum number of drinks per day, a 1- to 2-year later onset of several
   early alcohol-related problems and fewer years between the onset of
   problems and seeking help. Female alcoholics also showed a lower
   proportion with legal, job or personal problems related to alcohol.
   There were also high levels of similarity (rho = .76, p > .001) for 28
   life events related to alcohol for 1,936 women and 1,233 men who were
   drinkers but not alcohol dependent. Conclusions: Overall, the time
   course of alcohol-related problems for men and women were more similar
   than different. While there was evidence of a "telescoping" of the time
   between the onset of problems and treatment for women, the gender
   differences in ages of onset of events were relatively small. These data
   support the conclusion that, after considering gender differences in
   drinking in society, there is little evidence that the natural history
   of alcohol dependence in women is substantially different than in men.

AB Background. Current research on the etiology of cigarette smoking has
   largely focused on the identification of psychosocial predictors of
   tobacco onset. Few data are available on the predictors of different
   stages of smoking among adolescents. The present study examines the
   psychosocial predictors of different stages of smoking, including trial,
   experimental, and regular use, among high school students.
   Method. The predictor variables were measured when the students were in
   the 7th grade. Logistic regression was used to predict different smoking
   stages at grade 12.
   Results. The results show that four domains of psychosocial variables,
   including social and interpersonal factors, attitudinal and belief
   factors, intrapersonal factors, and use of other substances, predicted
   one or more stages of smoking. The important correlates of transition
   from trial to experimental use (all P value <0.001) included friends'
   smoking and approval, cigarette offers by friends, smoking intentions,
   school grade, and alcohol and marijuana use. The significant predictors
   of the transition from experimental to regular use included only
   parental smoking (P < 0.01) and family conflicts (P < 0.05). We found
   some gender differences in these predictors.
   Conclusions. Psychosocial predictors may differ by different stages of
   smoking. (C) 1998 American Medical Association.

AB Demographic, social, and economic influences on cause of death are

   theory and empirical studies as a framework to examine effects of 28
   independent variables in four groups-demographic, sociocultural,
   economic, and housing/health/crime-on standardized mortality by cause.
   Data at the state Level are mostly from the Mexican census of 1990.
   Effects are analyzed through spatial analysis and regression. The
   principal causes of death reveal distinctive geographical patterns. The
   regression findings only partially validate hypothesized effects.
   Overall, the most important predictors are crowding, housing
   characteristics, marriage and divorce, and manufacturing workforce. By
   variable group, there are effects for specific causes of death. For
   instance, hypothesized direct economic prosperity influences are present
   for one cause category, mixed for two, and refuted for cancer and heart
   disease. The findings are discussed and interpreted relative to the
   research literature and reveal differences from epidemiologic transition
   theory, effects that are specific to Mexico, and divergence from some of
   the patterns in advanced nations.

AB The study examines Chinese fertility in Canada in the contest of
   minority-status and fertility. Chinese-Canadians are compared with
   British Canadians, who are considered in this analysis as the majority
   group. The study is unique in three ways. First, we argue that
   discrimination brings a minority group not only psychological insecurity
   but also social-economic insecurity, which can be measured by Chinese
   husbands' economic status relative to the British Second, we analyze the
   relationship between discrimination against the Chinese at the social
   class level and Chinese fertility behavior at the individual, level,
   which has been ignored by most previous studies. Third, we describe
   "insecurities" effects to explain the fertility behavior of the Chinese
   across social classes, including the lower classes to which many
   researchers believe the minority status hypothesis is not applicable. We
   conclude that discrimination variations over social classes combined
   with normative influence are a major factor in causing class fertility
   differentials between the Chinese and the British in Canada.

   and across geographic areas using a multivariate framework, We find
   substantial improvements in female educational attainment over the last
   fifty years and a strong relationship between education and the

   associated with declines in the marriage rate, increased contraceptive
   use, and lower fertility. Education accounts for some of the changes
   over time in the demographic outcomes, but the pattern varies by

AB There are two main ways in which resource extraction can lead to
   prosperity for extractive regions. The first involves temporally
   delimited benefits-those that can only exist so long as extraction is
   laking place-while the second involves the potential for benefits that
   will endure beyond the period of extractive operations. As the scale of
   extraction has increased over time there has been a dramatic reduction
   in the potential duration of temporally delimited benefits for resource
   deposits of any given magnitude. While there remains a possibility that
   extraction could still be associated with benefits that ale not
   temporally delimited, primarily through the development of "linked"
   industries, many studies have documented cases where linked industries
   have failed to emerge. Still, a full rest of the possibility requires
   that we also look for cases in which a significant degree of linkage
   capture did occur. The dearest 20th century example we have been able to
   identify involves the offshore oil industry in southern Louisiana, where
   consistent growth in extraction was coupled with what appeared to be
   massive diversification. Even in this case, however, increased
   technological specialization, relative to that of earlier centuries,
   meant that the "linked" industries ultimately proved to have few markets
   that were not tied to the specific forms of extraction they served.
   Rather than representing diversification and development, the linked
   industries thus proved to be temporally delimited as well, experiencing
   a decline in employment during the oil price crash of the 1980s that
   actually proved to be at least as severe as the "bust" in the
   oil-extraction sector itself.

AB Environmental justice has become a major focus of research within the
   environmental social sciences. Early studies mostly examined the unequal
   distribution of natural resource hazards in an advanced capitalist
   political-economy. More recent studies have quantitatively gauged the
   relationship between sociodemographic factors and exposure to toxic
   chemical pollution. In this article, I use presentations at the recent
   meetings of the American Sociological Association (Toronto, August 1997)
   to suggest where the third generation of research into environmental
   justice may be heading. The literature is at a crossroads. We know
   enough to argue that there is a problem, but we cannot clearly
   articulate relationships, causation, or policy demands. New research
   techniques and social theories may begin to allow us to accomplish these
   more ambitious tasks.

AB The principal argument advanced in this essay pertains to the social,
   collective, and indeed generation-embedded nature of critical social
   knowledge production. Critical theory has been developed in the West,
   and among the American intellectuals first of all, as a collective,
   generational endeavour. The so called "uppity generation", which was a
   cohort of the social science and the humanities scholars who came of age
   in the 1960s, unlike in East-Central Europe, has been absorbed by the
   existing institutional structure of the higher education system and was
   capable to transform the very principle and the idea upon which the
   organization of the Western society rested. This task was accomplished
   by turn of attention to the autonomous powers of the capitalist state.
   The structural and political processes in the East-Central Europe, as it
   is demonstrated in this study, worked in contrast with Western patters,
   and therefore, even though the social scientists were relatively closer
   - in epistemological sense - to the discovery of the complex
   relationship between social movements, the state, and social change,
   they failed to produce critical theory of society that would explain the
   nature of the systemic transition of the 1989-1998.

AB Lifetime employment was a cornerstone of the Chinese socialist system
   constructed under Mao. In this system organizations served the function
   of social security and as a result, many organizations were overburdened
   with bloated work forces and retirees that drew from organizational
   coffers well into old age. Labor contracts fundamentally alter this
   system, as they allow firms to end the socialist institution of lifetime
   employment. Yet there is significant variation on the
   institutionalization of labor contracts in organizations. Based on a
   sample of 81 films in industrial Shanghai, I show that organizations
   that are experiencing uncertainty in the economic transition are more
   likely to institutionalize labor contracts on an organizationwide basis.
   There are two types of ol organisational uncertainty in the economic
   transition: economic uncertainty and administrative uncertainty In cases
   of economic uncertainty, firms that lost money in 1990 and firms that
   are burdened by large forces of retired workers are more likely to place
   their workers on labor contracts. In the case of administrative
   uncertainty firms that are at the highest levels of the industrial
   hierarchy are also significantly more likely to place their workers on
   labor contracts. Although these upper level firms were the most
   protected under the command economy: these are being forced to handle
   the greatest among the responsibilities in the economic transition and
   as a result, they experience the greatest sense of being set adrift by
   the state.

AB An important segment of writings on postindustrialization is distinctly
   utopian in stressing the greater mastery and control made possible by
   recent innovations in information technology. The utopian theme
   underscores the technical outcomes of innovations and highlights their
   benefits for ameliorating social problems. By contrast, our work
   suggests that many of the social problems in contemporary society are a
   consequence of recent innovations in information technology. We argue
   that postindustrial theorists are correct in stressing mastery over
   certain technical problems but incorrect in slighting the destabilizing
   effect innovations have on organizations and the markets in which these
   organizations participate. These destabilizing effects complicate
   organizational strategies by increasing market risk and uncertainty.
   Since most organizations are risk aversive, social problems are created
   as organizations externalize their costs and pass along risk to other,
   more dependent actors. Illustrations from two institutions, politics and
   the economy, indicate that many postindustrial innovations are
   associated with heightened competition as well as greater risk and
   uncertainty across the institutional order. We conclude that
   postindustrial technology introduces no net gain in managing the
   complexities of the social world. Risk and control are both integral to
   technological innovation and constitute the paradox of
   postindustrialization.

   status accrued by symbolic tools. Additionally, the role standardization
   has played in the development of engineering as a profession is explored
   in historical context as are the recurring themes of speed and "the

   world of messy practice and their conceptual framework regarding
   so-called "high technology" do not map well onto one another. The study
   illustrates the perspective of science and technology studies that views
   all technology as socially shaped and society shaping, its construction

AB The relative merits of cooperation and self-interest in an ensemble of
   strategic interactions can be investigated by using finite random games.
   In finite random games, finitely many players have finite numbers of
   actions and independently and identically distributed (iid) random
   payoffs with continuous distribution functions. In each realization,
   players are shown the values of all payoffs and then choose their
   strategies simultaneously. Noncooperative self-interest is modeled by
   Nash equilibrium (NE). Cooperation is advantageous when a NE is
   Pareto-inefficient. In ordinal games, the numerical value of the payoff
   function gives each player's ordinal ranking of payoffs. For a fixed
   number of players, as the number of actions of any player increases, the
   conditional probability that a pure strategic profile is not pure
   Pareto-optimal, given that it is a pure NE, apparently increases, but is
   bounded above strictly below 1. In games with transferable utility, the
   numerical payoff values may be averaged across actions (so that mixed
   NEs are meaningful) and added across players. In simulations of
   two-player games when both players have small, equal numbers of actions,
   as the number of actions increases, the probability that a NE (pure and
   mixed) attains the cooperative maximum declines rapidly; the gain from
   cooperation relative to the Nash high value decreases; and the gain from
   cooperation relative to the Nash low value rises dramatically. In the
   cases studied here, with an increasing number of actions, cooperation is
   increasingly likely to become advantageous compared with pure
   self-interest, but self-interest can achieve all that cooperation could
   achieve in a nonnegligible fraction of cases. These results can be
   interpreted in terms of cooperation in societies and mutualism in
   biology.

   drug-addicted adults. Data included retrospective accounts of childhood
   family factors, adolescent antisocial tendency, and self-reported
   hostility and risk-taking prior to treatment entry. A developmental
   model was tested that included adolescent antisocial tendency as a
   mediator of the relationship between childhood parenting factors and
   adulthood antisocial tendency. The effects of parental support and
   conflict were found to operate primarily through adolescent measures.
   Specifically, lower levels of parental support and higher levels of
   conflict with parents predicted greater adolescent antisocial tendency,
   which in turn predicted more hostility and risk-taking in adulthood.
   Thus, parental support appears to serve as a buffer against deviant
   behavior and drug use.

   relating to illicit drug use among women with various disabilities.
   Multiple regression analyses revealed that age, illicit drug use by a

   attitudes toward substance use by people with disabilities were
   significantly related to illicit drug use by the study population. The

   dependence in performance and the role of competitive industry
   conditions. Numerous organizational changes made by SOEs during early

   performance from 1989 to 1993 was highly path-dependent, although this
   dependence was mediated by the competitive conditions: Stronger markets
   displayed less path dependence. Overall the results favor the

   using condoms with nonsteady partners. It is suggested that the

AB Objectives: Despite the fact that socioeconomic status (SES) has been
   shown to have important implications in health related issues,
   population-based cancer registries in the United States do not routinely
   collect SES information. This study presents a model to estimate the SES
   of cancer patients in the registry database.
   Methods: At the Los Angeles Cancer Surveillance Program (CSP), we
   developed a model to estimate each cancer patient's SES from aggregate
   measurements of the census tract of residence (n = 1,640) at time of
   diagnosis. We then applied the SES estimates to observe the relationship
   between SES and risk of cancers of the female breast and reproductive
   organs including cancers of the ovary, cervix uteri, and corpus uteri.
   The analyses were performed on the cumulative records (n = 127,819) of
   cancer patients diagnosed between 1972 and 1992 in Los Angeles County,
   California, for the mutually exclusive racial/ethnic groups of
   non-Hispanic Whites, Hispanic Whites, Blacks, Asians, and persons of
   other ethnic groups.
   Results: We found SES is positively associated with female breast
   cancer, ovarian cancer, and cancer of the corpus uteri, but inversely
   associated with cervical cancer. These SES trends were quite consistent
   across age groups among non-Hispanic White women. Variations by
   race/ethnicity in the SES patterns were also found, with Asians
   exhibiting little association.
   Conclusions: Our model of measuring SES is sufficiently sensitive to
   capture the trends. Adopting the aggregate approach to measure SES in
   population-based registry data appears to be useful.

AB Mobilizing collective action to cope with climate change is difficult at
   any level, but the larger the 'community' the more difficult the task.
   How to achieve cooperation in the common interest without imposing
   excessive governmental coercion is a fundamental political conundrum.
   Using the cultural typology suggested by Cultural Theory (CT), this
   paper explores diverse worldviews that inform individual and collective
   attitudes relevant to climate change. Responses from a sample of 441 
   individuals to statements drawn from the public discourse on
   environmental issues are used to classify respondents according to the
   cultural types posited by CT. Analysis indicates that most respondents
   mix elements of CT's egalitarianism, hierarchy, and individualism,
   though many individuals clearly lean toward one or another of the
   cultural types. There seems to be a melding of individualistic and
   hierarchic elements in opposition to egalitarian elements. Definitions
   of what is natural, fair  and right - of equity - are fundamental issues
   between cultures, and non-coercive resolution of issues may be promoted
   by exploring cultural interstices, where cosmological boundaries are

AB We propose a framework for understanding the role that the social
   sciences should play in ecosystem management. Most of the ecosystem
   management literature assumes that scientific understanding of
   ecosystems is solely the purview of natural scientists. While the
   evolving principles of ecosystem management recognize that people play
   an important role, social considerations are usually limited to
   political and decision-making processes and to development of
   environmental education. This view is incomplete. The social science
   aspect of ecosystem management has two distinct components: one that
   concerns greater public involvement in the ecosystem management
   decision-making process, and one that concerns integrating social
   considerations into the science of understanding ecosystems. Ecosystem
   management decisions based primarily on biophysical factors can polarize
   people, making policy processes more divisive than usual. Ecological
   data must be supplemented with scientific analysis of the key social
   factors relevant to a particular ecosystem. Objective social science
   analysis should be included on an equal basis with ecological science
   inquiry and with data from public involvement. A conceptual framework is
   presented to communicate to ecological scientists the potential array of
   social science contributions to ecosystem management.

AB Violence has become a major part of life in many schools, homes and
   communities in the USA. It is especially devastating to children and
   adolescents who are vulnerable because of emotional, social and
   cognitive difficulties. The goal of this study was to develop an
   instrument that would be reliable in assessing the relationship and
   degree of exposure to violence in three different settings: the media,
   home/community and school. An 81-item, self-report questionnaire was
   developed, obtaining information on demographics, assessing the degree
   of exposure to violence, and screening youngsters who may have
   experienced negative emotional consequences and sought professional help
   on account of such exposure, in a total of 702 students. The
   questionnaire was administered on two different occasions over a
   three-week time period to a randomly selected group of 120 high school
   students in order to determine the instrument's reliability. To examine
   its consistency, two types of reliability estimates were completed. The
   split-half reliability correlation coefficient was 0.74, indicating good
   internal consistency, and the test-retest reliability was 0.95. The
   results of this study suggest that this is a reliable instrument to
   measure the degree of exposure to trauma and violence in adolescents.
   Further, this instrument is easy to administer, is not very time
   consuming, and has been standardized on a large adolescent population.

AB An intensive informal recycling system exists in the neighboring cities
   of Nuevo Laredo, Mexico and Laredo, TX. Qualitative and quantitative
   research was conducted in the area. It was found that the recovery of
   aluminum is carried out by three types of individuals: dumpsite
   scavengers, street scavengers and source-separation at homes and small
   businesses. Further, scavenging activities can be broken down into
   full-time and part-time. These individuals recover approximately 75% of
   the cans consumed by the area's population. Aluminum recovery in the
   area shows strong linkages with the formal sector and with the
   international economy. The informal recovery of aluminum in Laredo and
   Nuevo Laredo illustrates the international economic integration between
   Mexico and the US on their common border. This paper challenges previous
   characterizations of scavengers as being poor and marginal. (C) 1998

AB Objective: To document self-reported beliefs and behaviours in relation
   to colorectal cancer (CRC) and screening for CRC.
   Data collection: A stratified random sample was selected from the
   telephone directory, and structured telephone interviews were conducted
   using a computer-assisted telephone interviewing system.
   Participants: 500 men and 500 women aged 40-60 years, 70% randomly
   selected from the Melbourne metropolitan area and 30% from rural
   Victoria. The response rate to the initial telephone invitation of 1569
   eligible people was 63.7%.
   Outcome measures: Awareness of and experience with CRC; knowledge of CRC
   risk, risk reduction behaviours, and screening tests for CRC;
   willingness to have screening tests for CRC; and test preferences.
   Results: The people surveyed were relatively unaware of their personal
   risk of CRC, despite 61% (95% CI, 57%-65%) knowing someone who had CRC.
   Although 51% (95% CI, 48%54%) could not name any CRC screening test, 68%
   (95% CI, 65%-71%) knew of the value of a high fibre diet in prevention.
   However, 67% (95% CI, 64%-70%) thought it was unlikely they would have a
   screening test for CRC in the next two years, but 64% (95% CI, 61%-67%)
   considered that some person could influence their decision to have a
   test, 60% (95% CI, 56%-64%) stating that they would be influenced by a
   doctor. Faecal occult blood testing and sigmoidoscopy were equally
   acceptable. In general, women were more knowledgeable than men. There
   were no systematic age or urban/rural differences.
   Conclusions: There is a Variable understanding of CRC in the community.
   Although prevention is well understood, this is not true of screening.
   General practitioners are likely to be influential in the uptake of any
   screening programs.

AB A field-interview survey of the distribution and abundance of the
   cheetah Acinonyx jubatus was conducted in Kenya between May and
   September 1989, and June and August 1990. Two hundred and twenty
   respondents ranging from wildlife conservationists to traditional
   pastoralists gave precise descriptions of cheetah observations,
   including dates and locations of sightings, and number, age class, and
   sex of the cheetahs observed. The 369 detailed sightings collected
   consisted of 249 observations of all-adult groups and 120 observations
   of family groups. The average number of adults in all-adult sightings
   was 1.8 + SE 0.07, and the average litter size in family groups was 2.6
   + SE 0.10. Density estimates across the country ranged from 0.009 to
   0.102 cheetah km(-2), and were generally higher than elsewhere in
   Africa. A total number of 793 cheetahs was estimated in Kenya protected
   areas, and Masailand and the dry northern Districts appear to offer the
   best prospects for cheetah conservation in Kenya based on relative prey
   availability. The proportion of family groups among all sightings was
   twice as high in protected areas as on rangelands, and protected areas
   also held larger groups of males. The results do not support the thesis
   that cheetahs fare better on rangelands than in protected areas.
   Comparison with earlier surveys in Kenya showed remarkable stability in
   cheetah distribution and social structure over time. No firm conclusion
   could be drawn on trends in cheetah numbers, although scattered evidence
   supported a scenario of stability rather than decline in the last
   decades. Despite their limitations, interview based surveys can produce
   valuable results for monitoring elusive high-profile carnivores. (C)

AB T.N. Madan,made the study of comparative moral systems into an important
   mainstay of Indian sociology. In this essay we will be using the idea of
   'moral practice' to compare notions of efficacy in psychotherapy and
   various forms of religious healing. We argue that the realm of 'the
   moral' in ethnographic analysis consists nor of abstract rules or
   ideologies, but of whatever has overwhelming practical relevance in the
   lives of the people and communities we study Both psychotherapy and
   religious healing systems define efficacy in terms of culture-specific
   understandings of personhood and moral order: these, however are
   mediated by the irreducible contingencies of social position, political
   strategy, and life histories of both sufferers and healers, as well as
   by large scale economic and political forces. Healing efficacy emerges
   from this study as a shifting, multi-vocal, and sometimes unattainable
   value. By turning our attention from the language of moral concepts to
   that of moral stakes, therefore, we are attempting to accommodate a
   concern with the concrete experience of suffering and healing as they
   are embedded in lived worlds of human experience.

AB Research suggests that individuals with physical disabilities frequently
   experience devaluation and uncertain social interactions. Some
   sociologists have recently advocated a sociology of acceptance, wherein
   individuals with disabilities are not automatically stigmatized but may
   receive acceptance and civility. The purpose of this article is to
   examine the perceptions individuals with physical disabilities have
   regarding the reactions of able-bodied persons toward their
   participation in a sport and physical fitness setting, as well as to
   explore how these individuals respond to the attitudes and behavior
   demonstrated by able-bodied persons. In-depth, tape-recorded interviews
   were conducted with 19 males, between the ages of 20 and 41, with
   physical disabilities. Findings indicate that respondents perceive
   able-bodied persons discount and overlook their physical ability to
   participate in sport and physical fitness activity. Such expressions of
   unequal respect and regard by the able-bodied demonstrate differential
   treatment or a lack of acceptance. Nonetheless, these individuals with
   physical disabilities do not internalize the negative assessments
   because of masculinizing sport outcomes and minority group membership.
   Reasons for revisiting a sociology of acceptance are discussed.

   associated with use of agricultural chemicals for water quality, food
   safety, food quality, health of applicator, health of farm animals,
   wildlife, beneficial plants, beneficial insects, and human health. Study
   findings revealed that respondents perceived use of farm chemicals posed
   little or no threat to any of the assessed items. A composite index was
   formulated from the responses to the nine items and was titled Perceived
   Risk. Variance in the Perceived Risk index was regressed against social
   learning variables. The findings revealed that approximately 32% of the
   variance was explained by the predictive variables included in the
   model. It was concluded that the theoretical perspective was somewhat

   children. These rates differ from those reported for the 1980s and
   1970s, when the contraceptive use rate was around 6% and more than 85%
   of women desired more children, suggesting a trend towards fertility
   limitation over the years. Logistic regression analysis showed that
   contraceptive use was positively associated with age, number of living
   children, age at marriage, education, and economic status, and
   negatively associated with Islamic and traditional religious
   affiliations. Government and other health clinics, hospitals, and
   government paramedical personnel were the major sources of contraceptive
   supplies. The lower desire for more children might relate to demographic
   pressure from the recent improved child survival rate compounded by
   recent economic hardship.

AB Background. This study examined the association between blood pressure
   (BP), selected health behaviors, and various dimensions of religiosity
   among females,
   Methods. Data were obtained on 112 females who were at least 35 years of
   age and of Judeo-Christian faiths. Resting BP measures were taken with
   an automated sphygmomanometer, height and weight were measured to
   determine body mass index (BMI), and intermediate health variables
   (e,g,, physical activity, smoking, diet, and alcohol consumption) were
   measured by questionnaire, A multifactorial questionnaire was used to
   assess various dimensions of religiosity. Multiple regression path
   analyses were conducted to determine the direct and indirect effects of
   religiosity on BP with age and BMI controlled statistically.
   Results. The direct effects of religiosity on SEP and DBP were more
   substantial than the indirect effects through the intermediate health
   variables, suggesting that religiosity may be associated with lower
   levels of BP via a direct pathway, such as improving the ability to cope
   with stress, In general, DBP was more influenced by religiosity than SEP
   and the dimensions of "intrinsic religiosity" and "religious coping"
   were most influencial, Results also indicated that "religious
   experiences" may exert a greater beneficial effect on DBP in older
   (50-80 years) age groups.
   Conclusions. These results support a direct relationship between
   religiosity and BP, rather than an indirect effect through intermediate
   health behaviors. (C) 1998 American Health Foundation and Academic

AB Objective: This study examines social processes that construct the

   mechanisms that constitute the process of role constriction in
   employment for individuals with chronic illness, Method: Sixty-six
   persons meeting the Centers for Disease Control case definition of
   chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) participated in a longitudinal study
   involving three waves of data collection over 3 years. Qualitative and
   quantitative methods were combined in the research, which included
   face-to-face semistructured interviews, telephone interviews, and
   self-report questionnaires. Materials presented in this study are drawn
   principally from the Year 1 face-to-face and telephone interviews.
   Results: When patterns of symptoms and of the illness course in CFS
   intersect with work requirements, they impede performance and place ill
   individuals at risk for job loss. Persons with CFS devise and implement
   specific strategies to resist role constriction and remain in the work
   force. Conclusions: Role constriction is a social process of
   marginalization in chronic illness. Opposing forces of marginalization
   and resistance define the social course in chronic illness and suggest
   that chronicity can be thought of as a marginalized position in social
   space.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the apparent social
   mediation of a postpartum somatic illness, na tadoka ni vasucu,
   occurring among ethnic Fijian women. Method: During their first two
   postpartum days, 85 consecutive newly delivered ethnic Fijian women were
   recruited for a prospective study on na tadoka ni vasucu at the Sigatoka
   District Hospital in Nadroga, Fiji. Subjects underwent translated
   structured interviews and responded to the Kellner Symptom Questionnaire
   and to visual analog scales to assess social supports and occurrence of
   mood symptoms or an episode of na tadoka. ni vasucu in the postpartum
   period. Semistructured ethnographic interviews were also conducted with
   subjects who reported an episode of na tadoka ni vasucu. Data were
   collected in the initial postpartum days and again at 2 to 5 months
   postpartum; 82 women completed the study. Results: Na tadoka ni vasucu
   is a somatic syndrome occurring in 9% (N = 7) of this sample. Both
   quantitative and narrative data demonstrate that this syndrome is
   associated with perceived inferior social supports. Despite its
   relatively infrequent occurrence and benign clinical course, the
   disorder is a subject of serious social concern within the Fijian
   community. Conclusions: Although na tadoka ni vasucu seems to be
   clinically trivial, because of its cultural salience it is nonetheless
   able to mobilize intensive social surveillance and care for the
   postpartum mother. The moral concern generated by this culturally marked
   disorder, as well as its association with perceived inferior social
   supports, suggest a dialectical relationship between somatic idiom and
   its social context.

AB Background: The definition of outcome in antidepressant treatment
   studies may be a crucial factor influencing the relationship between
   possible treatment variables and treatment response. We therefore wanted
   to investigate possible relationships between baseline severity of
   depression and anxiety, and different definitions of outcome among
   outpatients with major depressive disorder undergoing antidepressant
   treatment. Methods: Two hundred and forty-eight patients diagnosed with
   major depression with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R
   Diagnosis - Patient Edition were treated with fluoxetine 20 mg/day for 8
   weeks. Patients were evaluated both pretreatment and posttreatment with
   the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Ham-D-17), the
   Clinical Global Impressions Scales for Severity (CGI-S) and Improvement
   (CGI-I). We chose four continuous definitions of response using a linear
   regression method to analyze the relationship to baseline anxiety and
   depression. We used a logistic regression analysis for the relationship
   between seven categorical definitions of response and baseline severity
   of depression and anxiety. Results: Greater endpoint severity was
   significantly positively related to greater baseline severity of
   depression and anxiety. Lesser baseline severity of depression or
   anxiety predicted a greater degree of response on either the endpoint
   CGI-I score (with lower scores indicating greater improvement) or the
   percent change in HAM-D-17 score (with higher percent change indicating
   greater improvement). For all seven categorical definitions of response,
   lower baseline scores were significantly related to the probability of
   being a responder. Conclusions: These findings support the impression
   that how outcome is defined affects the strength and direction of
   observed relationships with predictive variables. Methodological
   implications are discussed.

AB Background: Consistent and correct condom use remains important to human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention. Although many studies evaluate
   consistent condom use, few examine how condoms are used during
   intercourse,
   Goals: Assess how user practices affect exposure to risks of pregnancy
   and infection during condom use.
   Study Design: A cross-sectional survey on condom behaviors in the past
   month was conducted among 98 male students attending two Georgia
   universities.
   Results: Altogether, 35 of 270 total: condom uses (13.0%, 95% confidence
   interval, 7.4-18.5) resulted in potential exposure to sexually
   transmitted disease and/or HIV infection or pregnancy. Both consistent
   and inconsistent users were similarly likely to report potential
   exposures during condom use.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest condom problems occur among both
   consistent and inconsistent users. Future studies of condom
   effectiveness must distinguish whether condoms were used both
   consistently and correctly.

PY 1998
AB This article explores the ways that the feminist organization
   Sociologists for Women in Society(SWS) has become an arena of change in
   the discipline of sociology, academic institutions, and larger society.
   We begin with an examination of feminist models of power and change,
   followed by a brief history of SWS and an exploration of the use of
   power in sociology, academia, and beyond. We find that SWS has
   influenced both the organizational governance structures of sociology
   (such as the American Sociological Association) and the production of
   sociological scholarship. As a result, the presence of women is more
   apparent than ever before, and sociological paradigms are more inclusive
   and attentive to the voices of "outsiders." Academic institutions have
   been challenged and changed by an SWS presence and the monitoring of
   women's experiences in the academy. Beyond the discipline and academia,
   SWS strives to participate in the making of public policy that affects
   women's lives and to be a presence both domestically and internationally
   in issues affecting the status and well-being of women. We conclude with
   the recommendation that sociologists use their experiences and knowledge
   to create change in the institutions where women practice and the world
   in which they live.

AB This article traces the impact of philosophical questions regarding the
   grounds of moral autonomy and heteronomy (rule-from-another as opposed
   to rule-from-oneself) on classical sociological theory, arguing that
   both Weber and Durkheim understood sociology to have a contribution to
   make in the debate,with Kant over the grounds of ethical action. Both
   insisted that the only possible ethical action was one within the bounds
   of rational knowledge that was inherently authoritative, but this sat
   uneasily with their focus on the relation between concrete social
   authority and the authoritativeness of beliefs in the sociology of
   religion. In rejecting Comte's explicit avowal of the embodiment of
   moral authority in the secular priesthood of sociologist, Weber and
   Durkheim had to paper over the social authority supporting the
   formulation of this rational knowledge. Each then produced a sociology
   of knowledge without a well-specified mechanism, in turn encouraging the
   development of the sociology of knowledge as ct flawed sub-discipline.

AB This paper proposes a sociology of the person that focuses upon the
   socially defined, publicly visible beings of intersubjective experience.
   I argue that the sociology of the person proposed by Durkheim and Mauss
   is more accurately described as a sociology of institutions of the
   person and neglects both folk or ethnopsychologies of personhood and the
   international production of persons. I draw upon the work of Goffman to
   develop a sociology of the person concerned with means, processes, and
   relations of person production. I also propose that the work of Goffman,
   Foucault, and others provides insights into the contemporary technology
   of person production and into how its control and use affects relations
   of person production. I conclude with a brief outline of the theoretical
   connections among institutions of the person, folk psychologies, the
   social constitution of the person, and the prospect of a distinctively
   sociological psychology.

AB The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the issues
   associated with using a laptop computer and presentation software during
   lectures. This discussion is informed by our own experience as well as
   end of the semester grades and student course evaluations from six
   sections of introductory social statistics that were taught between the
   fail of 1995 and the spring of 1997. Direct student quotes are used
   throughout the paper to emphasize particular points and to provide
   insight into students' perspectives on the computer presentations. Based
   on this objective and subjective evidence, we conclude that computer
   presentations can act as useful tools in courses like social statistics
   and methods. These presentations encourage classroom interaction,
   heighten interest, and provide a structure to lectures that can
   facilitate student comprehension and performance. This article also
   discusses potential problems that arise when using this technology.

AB The radical shift in human reproduction in the late 19th century, known
   as the demographic transition, constitutes a major challenge to
   evolutionary approaches to human behaviour. Why would people ever choose
   to limit their reproduction voluntarily when, at the peak of the
   Industrial Revolution, resources were apparently so plentiful? Can the
   transition be attributed to standard life history tradeoffs, is it a
   consequence of cultural evolutionary processes, or is it simply a
   maladaptive outcome of novel and environmental social conditions?
   Empirical analyses and new models suggest that reproductive decision
   making might be driven by a human psychology designed by natural
   selection to maximize material wealth. If this is the case, the
   mechanisms governing fertility and parental investment are likely to
   respond to modern conditions with a fertility level much lower than that
   that would maximize fitness.

AB Darwinian evolution has to provide an explanation for cooperative
   behaviour. Theories of cooperation are based on kin selection (dependent
   on genetic relatedness)(1,2), group selection(3-5) and reciprocal
   altruism(6-9). The idea of reciprocal altruism usually involves direct
   reciprocity: repeated encounters between the same individuals allow for
   the return of an altruistic act by the recipient(10-16). Here we present
   a new theoretical framework, which is based on indirect reciprocity(17)
   and does not require the same two individuals ever to meet again,
   individual selection can nevertheless favour cooperative strategies
   directed towards recipients that have helped others in the past.
   Cooperation pays because it confers the image of a valuable community
   member to the cooperating individual. We present computer simulations
   and analytic models that specify the conditions required for
   evolutionary stability(18) of indirect reciprocity. We show that the
   probability of knowing the 'image' of the recipient must exceed the
   cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act. We propose that the
   emergence of indirect reciprocity was a decisive step for the evolution
   of human societies.

   Main Outcome Measures.-Breast cancer stage at diagnosis.
   Results.-Of the 540 patients, 94 (17.4%) presented with TNM stage III or
   IV disease. The following demographic and socioeconomic factors were
   significant predictors of advanced stage: being African American (odds
   ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9-4.7); having low
   income (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.1-6.5); never having been married (OR, 2.9;

   1.1-2.5); or lacking transportation (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.6).
   Univariate analysis also revealed a large number of cultural beliefs to
   be significant predictors. Examples include the following beliefs: air
   causes a cancer to spread (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.8-4.3); the devil can

   1.1-3.5); and chiropractic is an effective treatment for breast cancer
   (OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4). When the demographic and socioeconomic
   variables were included in a multivariate logistic regression model, the
   OR for late stage among Af rican Americans decreased to 1.8 (95% CI,

   when the belief measures were included with the demographic and
   socioeconomic variables, the OR for late stage among African Americans
   decreased further to 1.2 (95% CI, 0.6-2.5).
   Conclusions.-Socioeconomic factors alone were not sufficient to explain
   the dramatic effect of race on breast cancer stage; however,
   socioeconomic variables in conjunction with cultural beliefs and

   between duration of residence and access to ambulatory care among
   Caribbean immigrant adolescents.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey of adolescents at a New York City high
   school was conducted. Multivariate modeling methods were used to adjust
   for demographic and socioeconomic covariates.
   Results. Duration of residence was strongly and directly associated.
   with access to ambulatory care after adjustment for ethnicity.
   Conclusions. Caribbean immigrant adolescents, particularly recent
   immigrants, have reduced access to ambulatory care.

   loaded firearms, and handguns were examined.
   Methods. Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System in 22
   states were used to estimate the prevalence of adults and children
   exposed to household firearms.
   Results. The prevalence of adults living in households with firearms
   ranged from 12% to 57%; the corresponding ranges were 1% to 23% for
   loaded firearms and 5% to 36% for handguns. The prevalence of children
   less than 18 years of age living in households with loaded firearms
   ranged from 2% to 12%.
   Conclusion. Important variations among states exist in the prevalence of
   adults and children living in households with firearms, loaded firearms,
   and handguns.

AB I seek to explain the emergence of social differentiation by developing
   a theory of information and social structure. This theory makes
   explanations of social differentiation offered by Spencer and Durkheim
   more precise by borrowing simple assumptions from Carley's constructural
   model and from the symbolic interactionist perspective. My arguments
   amplify an important insight of the classical theorists: No assumption
   of individual differences is necessary to explain the emergence of
   social differentiation. Computer simulations show that simple
   assumptions about interaction patterns, communication, the social
   construction of knowledge, and forgetting imply that originally
   undifferentiated social systems will become differentiated over time.
   The simulations show that system size negatively affects cultural
   homogeneity and positively affects social differentiation. Memory, or
   the capacity of individuals to store information, is determined by the
   information technologies individuals have at their disposal. Memory
   positively affects cultural homogeneity and negatively affects social
   differentiation. Memory also positively affects the size of integrated
   social systems such as organizations and societies. I consider
   implications of this theory for the origins of sociodemographic
   dimensions, the study of inequality, and the sociology of culture.

AB Many concepts in sociology are difficult or impossible to objectively
   measure. This limitation forces a reliance on subjective measures that
   typically contain both systematic and random measurement errors.
   Systematic errors, or "biases," are the focus of this paper. Campbell
   and Fiske's (1959) multitrait-multimethod (MTMM) research design is the
   best known social scientific procedure for uncovering systematic errors,
   but the data requirements for classical MTMM designs are too demanding
   for many areas of sociology in which secondary data are the norm. We
   show that the benefits of the MTMM design are available under more
   relaxed conditions. In addition, we illustrate how researchers can
   examine the determinants of systematic errors and gain insights into the
   potential for confounding or spurious effects caused by systematic
   errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of these methods using the
   subjective measures of liberal democracy used in several recent ASR
   papers and provide additional examples, including measures of the
   reputational quality of graduate programs and job evaluations for
   comparable-worth investigations. We conclude that sociologists can do
   far more to understand the systematic error present in their subjective
   variables.

   (70% Black, 30% White) who received prenatal care at University Hospital
   at the University of Alabama in Birmingham from 1985 to 1989. Various
   maternal characteristics were evaluated at the first prenatal visit. Two
   24 h recalls were obtained at 18 and 30 wk of gestation to calculate the
   intakes of dietary zinc and other nutrients. Student's t test, chi(2),
   Pearson correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analyses were
   used to compare and evaluate the determinants of zinc and other nutrient
   intakes in Black and White subjects. The mean prepregnancy body mass
   index and the mean intake of zinc, energy, and all the other nutrients
   except calcium were significantly higher in Black than in White
   subjects. There was a significant correlation between zinc and energy
   intake (r = 0.69, p = 0.001). Age, marital status, parity, socioeconomic
   status, smoking, and alcohol intake were not significant predictors of
   zinc or other nutrient intakes. After adjusting for energy intake, race
   was the only significant predictor of dietary zinc intake. Race and
   energy intake explained 24% of the variation in zinc intake. Results of
   this study indicate that after adjusting for other covariates, race and
   energy intakes are the only predictors of zinc intake in low-income
   pregnant women.

AB The sociology of religion claims to possess a cross-culturally valid
   objectivity that is belied by its paradigm shifts in both classical and
   recent times. Its sequential emphasis on such issues as the changing
   bases of religious authority, secularization and rational choice depends
   in large part on Western models of religion, of the relationship between
   the individual and society, and on key Western values. These are not
   shared by other traditions. Classical Confucianism provides sociological
   models, core concepts and values that are distinctly different from
   those of the West. It has the potential to generate a sociology of
   religion altogether unlike the one to which we are accustomed. This
   article begins the task of outlining such a potential sociology.

AB OBJECTIVE: To compare the health characteristics and service utilization
   patterns of homeless women and low-income housed women who are heads of
   household,
   DESIGN: Case-control study.
   SETTING: Community of Worcester, Massachusetts.
   PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 220 homeless mothers and 216 low-income housed
   mothers receiving welfare,
   MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures included health status,
   chronic conditions, adverse lifestyle practices, outpatient and
   emergency department use and hospitalization rates, and use of
   preventive screening measures. Both homeless mothers and housed mothers
   demonstrated low levels of physical and role functioning and high levels
   of bodily pain. Prevalence rates of asthma, anemia, and ulcer disease
   were high in both groups. More than half of both groups were current
   smokers. Compared with the housed mothers, homeless mothers reported
   more HIV risk behaviors. Although 90% of the homeless mothers had been
   screened for cervical cancer, almost one third had not been screened for
   tuberculosis. After controlling for potential confounding factors, the
   homeless mothers, compared with the housed mothers, had more frequent
   emergency department visits in the past year (adjusted mean, homeless vs
   housed, 1.41 vs .95, p = .10) and were significantly more likely to be
   hospitalized in the past year (adjusted odds ratio 2.22; 95% confidence
   interval 1.13, 4.38).
   CONCLUSIONS:Both homeless mothers and low-income housed mothers had
   lower health status, more chronic health problems, and higher smoking
   rates than the general population. High rates of hospitalization,
   emergency department visits, and more risk behaviors among homeless
   mothers suggest that they are at even greater risk of adverse health
   outcomes. Efforts to address gaps in access to primary care and to
   integrate psychosocial supports with health care delivery may improve
   health outcomes for homeless mothers and reduce use of costly medical
   care services.

AB Emerging vector-borne diseases represent a formidable challenge to
   public health. Part of the challenge lies in the promoting behaviors
   such as self-protection from tick bites and use of mosquito nets early
   in the process of disease emergence to limit their impact on health.
   This paper will review two of the lessons that have been learned in
   research on HIV prevention, and their applicability to vector control
   programs. First, programs such as Thailand's 100 Percent Condom Program
   have demonstrated the importance of implementing structural and
   environmental interventions to complement approaches that promote
   behavior change in individuals. Second, experience has shown that HIV
   and AIDS not only result in discrimination and lack of rights, but also
   that HIV and AIDS are much more likely to occur in people who are
   discriminated against or who lack basic human rights. Many vector-borne
   diseases are also more common among populations lacking basic human
   rights such as control over their land, political rights and access to
   water and sanitation. Tools such as geographic information systems and
   modeling of transmission could play an crucial role in showing us both
   the geography of human rights and social inequalities, and demonstrating
   how processes such as climate change interact with human rights to favor
   disease emergence. Spatial analyses can also indicate where structural
   and environmental interventions to promote human behavior change might
   be most effective.

   theories, I code and analyze data on organizational characteristics and
   workplace experiences from the existing population of English-language
   ethnographies (N = 108). The analysis confirms existing understandings,
   such as the importance of job autonomy for pride and effort. The
   analysis also generates new findings, including the finding of a
   positive influence of organizational effectiveness on both coworker
   relations and relations with management. Methodological checks indicate
   that data from organizational ethnographies can be coded reliably and
   without bias. However, the initial ethnographic observations differ
   somewhat based on ethnographers' theoretical orientations and time spent
   in the field The article concludes with a discussion of possible
   extensions of the analysis to other subfields in sociology that have
   accumulated bodies of ethnographic observation.

AB Research on the science enterprise ordinarily assumes that any hierarchy
   among academic departments reflects an egalitarian system based on
   merit. This assumption is predicated on the view that departmental
   prestige is primarily a function of faculty scholarship. In this
   article, the association between prestige and scholarship is examined
   for the discipline of sociology using evaluative ratings from three
   national studies and objective data on publications. Scholarship is
   found to be far less important in determining prestige ratings than
   either the past reputations of departments or their affiliated
   universities. Publishing is not necessarily a straightforward means of
   securing a department's prestige. Instead past reputation reflective of
   an institutional context, rather than scholarly productivity, appears to
   be the critical property bearing on how departments are viewed.

   the institutional practice of class rule in Ireland (see Fernand Braudel
   [1980] On History, Chicago: University of Chicago; Theda Skocpol [1979]

   Small-holding peasants and middle-class groups sought to reform the
   feudal practice of jurisdictional privileges by the greater gentry of
   Anglo-Irish landlords. A middle-class group of Irish nationalists
   exercised their "hegemony" over small-holding peasants during a social
   movement for Catholic Emancipation in the 1820s (see Antonio Gramsci
   [1975] Selections from the Prisons Notebooks, New York: International
   Publishers). The outcomes of this social movement included the political
   empowerment of Catholic "whigs" to reform the feudal practices of
   corporations in Irish towns and the frustration of peasant interests to
   reform the feudal practices of Anglo-Irish landlordism in the

AB In previous work, we have noted a certain rigidity in sociology's
   approach to the topic of social relations (Cerulo 1997; Cerulo and Ruane
   1997; Cerulo, Ruane, and Chayko 1992). With few exceptions, literature
   on the subject dichotomizes social relations with reference to the scope
   of the interaction (small group versus large group) and the mode by
   which social actors connect (direct connections versus mediated
   connections). Further, many researchers implicitly rank the social value
   of each relational form. Sociologists typically identify a society's
   primary and most valuable relations as the result of direct, physically
   copresent exchange, exchange involving relatively few interactants. In
   contrast, secondary relations often are characterized as faceless,
   impersonal, ingenuous, and fleeting-the result of large-group exchange
   established via mediated or mechanized connections. Cerulo (1997)
   suggested the need to reformulate any definition of social relations
   built upon the small group/large group or the direct/mediated
   dichotomies. She presented several critical elements upon which new
   definitions could be built. In this piece, we configure those elements,
   building six new analytic taxonomies-tools we hope will provoke a richer
   discussion of connecting, interacting, and resulting forms of social
   relations.

AB A certain type of film, the "genre stretcher," is of special interest to
   the sociology of deviance because it captures deviantizing discourse as

   and with it the capacity for rendering symbolically coherent social
   action and cultural differentiation through narrative. This article
   investigates two instances of a genre stretcher-Tightrope (1983) and
   Cruising (1980)-and places analytic emphasis on interpreting their
   distinctive persona, the "inverted detective." This figure encases
   features of an emergent moral imagination in its condensation of certain
   conundrums, especially the problem of reinscribing deviance in a
   poststigma surround. The films thereby animate and trace out the
   implications of a discourse that was initiated by the 1960s and 1970s
   "revolt against stigma"; they function as allegories of the relations
   between normality and deviance amid symbolic instability.

   1830s-1980s in east-central Illinois. Seasonal conception patterns
   reflect winter and spring peaks, with indication of the spring peak
   dissipating more recently. Seasonal mortality patterns show a tendency
   for younger people to die in late summer and older people to die in late
   winter. Contrary to national patterns, we found female deaths exceeding
   male deaths in the 10-64 age group. As expressions of gender bias,
   females are disproportionately identified on gravestones in terms of
   familial relationships. Of the different cemetery types surveyed (1
   family, 4 neighborhood, 2 community, 3 church), only the church
   cemeteries continue to be used, suggesting a sectarian role in

   debate within the sociology of religion concerning the viability of

AB This article develops and tests a model that seeks to explain individual
   variation in the approval of suicide. The model draws on the three
   leading theories of crime/deviance: strain, social learning, and social
   control theories. It is predicted that individuals will be most
   approving of suicide when (1) they have had major life problems that
   could not be solved through conventional channels, (2) they were taught
   or exposed to beliefs that favored or were conducive to suicide, and (3)
   they are not strongly attached or committed to conventional individuals
   and groups. These predictions are explored with data from the 1990 and
   1991 General Social Surveys, based on a nationally representative sample
   of adults ia the United States. The results provide partial support for
   the predictions, especially the second prediction, with the strongest
   correlates of suicide approval being education, political liberalism,
   and a set of religion variables.

AB Few studies have addressed the social and behavioural aspects of
   lymphatic filariasis. The research reported here investigated the
   ethnographic context of filarial elephantiasis among women in Leogane,
   Haiti, and focused on explanatory models of the illness, the impact of
   the disease on women's lives, and the difficulties patients experienced
   in following a therapeutic regimen provided at a local hospital.
   Qualitative data were collected through focus group and individual
   interviews and direst observation of patients enrolled in the treatment
   programme. Results indicate that traditional understanding and treatment
   for the disease are prevalent in the community, although biomedical
   explanations are gaining credence as a consequence of long-term
   filariasis control activities in this area. Women's lives are
   substantially burdened both socially and economically by the physical
   impairment of elephantiasis, most notably in the loss of income due to
   restrictions on mobility. The degree of social discrimination
   encountered varies by the timing of onset of symptoms in the life
   course. Difficulties encountered with the physical therapy regimen
   included maintenance of the compressive bandage and availability of
   suitable foot wear. Similarities between these findings and those
   reported for other parts of the world are noted. Recommendations from
   the study cite the need for community education and peer support
   activities to provide a knowledge base and support structure for current
   and future intervention programmes.

AB Objective: To evaluate a program of anticipatory guidance in which
   pediatric residents and nurse practitioners in a continuity practice
   gave parents books for their young children along with developmentally
   appropriate educational materials describing why and how to share the
   books and promoting reading as part of a bedtime routine.
   Study Design: Comparison of 2 cross-sectional groups using consecutive,
   structured, face-to-face or telephone interviews of parents. One group
   was a historical control or a comparison group (group 1). The other was
   the intervention group (group 2),which included families who had
   received 2 books and educational materials for the children as part of
   the program to promote book sharing and bedtime routines.
   Subjects: Before the institution of the program to promote book sharing
   and bedtime routines, the parents in 51 families with healthy children
   12 to 38 months of age who regularly attended continuity clinics
   conducted by the house-staff were interviewed; these families
   constituted group 1. Group 1 included a low-income population of
   Hispanic, African American, and non-Hispanic white families. Group 2
   included 100 families with similar sociodemographic characteristics with
   healthy 12- to 38-month-old children who had received 2 books and
   educational materials at all 6- to 36-month well-child visits as part of
   the program.
   Results: The intervention was found to be effective in promoting
   child-centered literacy activities. When asked open-ended questions, 4
   (8%) of the parents in group 1 and 21 (21%) of the parents in group 2
   said 1 of their child's 3 favorite activities included books (P=.04); 11
   (22%) of theparents in group 1 and 42 (42%) of the parents in group 2
   said 1 of their 3 favorite activities with their child was book sharing
   (P=.01); and 10 (20%) of the parents in group 1 and 35 (35%) of the
   parents in group 2 said that they share books 6 or 7 times a week at
   bedtime (P=.05). By mentioning 1 of these 3 important child-centered
   book-sharing activities, 17 (33%) of the parents in group 1 and 69 (69%)
   of the parents in group 2 (P <.001) demonstrated positive child-centered
   literacy orientation. A multiple logistic regression analysis
   controlling for parental education, ethnicity, and reading habits, as
   well as for the sex and age of the children, found child-centered
   literacy orientation more likely to be present in group 2 than in group
   1 families, with an odds ratio (OR) of 4.7 (95% confidence interval
   [CI], 2.1-10.5; P<.001). Book sharing as part of a bedtime routine was
   more frequent in group 2 (mean+/-SD, 3.9+/-2.6 nights per week) than in
   group 1 (mean+/-SD, 2.5+/-2.7 nights per week; P=.002); however, no
   significant differences in prolonged bedtime struggles, parent-child
   cosleeping, frequent night waking, or how children fell asleep were
   found between the groups. Instead, in multivariate analysis, bedtime
   struggles occurred more often with younger parents (P=.03) and fewer
   children at home (P=.02), while parent-child cosleeping (P<.001) and
   frequent night waking (P=.04) were less likely to occur when children
   usually fell asleep alone in their own beds.
   Conclusions: This simple and inexpensive intervention by pediatric house
   staff, consisting of the provision of children's books and educational
   materials at well-child visits, resulted in increased enjoyment of and
   participation in child-centered book-related activities in low-income
   families. Primary care providers tie, physicians and nurse
   practitioners) serving underserved pediatric populations may have a
   unique opportunity to promote child-centered literacy in at-risk groups.

AB Objective: To determine the characteristics of hunger in young children
   who attend ambulatory pediatric clinics in a midwestern city.
   Design: Consecutive sample.
   Setting: Ambulatory pediatric clinics of an inner-city teaching
   hospital.
   Participants: English-speaking caregivers of 2578 children younger than
   5 years.
   Main Outcome Measure: Structured survey measures of hunger, family
   characteristics, assistance program use, child feeding practices, and
   anthropometrics.
   Results: In this population, 171 (6.6%) were hungry, and 842 (32.7%)
   were at risk for hunger. Hunger status was associated with increased age
   (P<.001), decreased maternal education level (P=.013), maternal nonwhite
   race (P<.002), a history of homelessness (P<.001), and parental
   unemployment (P<.001). Hunger status was associated with use of Aid to
   Families with Dependent Children (P<.001) and food stamps (P<.001) but
   not with participation in The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for
   Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). Results of anthropometrics indicated
   that mean growth percentiles were no different between hunger
   categories.
   Conclusions: Housing, dietary, and family characteristics are
   identifiable risk factors for early childhood hunger. Hunger cannot be
   identified, however, using anthropometrics. It is disconcerting that
   fewer hungry children and children at risk for hunger participate in WIC
   compared with other programs. These data suggest the potential for more
   aggressive identification and intervention at the primary care and
   social service levels to benefit hungry children.

AB Public participation in environmental management decisions has
   frequently led to conflict. This paper examines the role of
   environmental values in fueling these conflicts, based on a data base
   and sample content analysis of written public comments solicited in 1994
   regarding the highly contentious Clinton Forest Plan (also known as
   Option 9) proposed for management of federal forests in the US Pacific
   Northwest. The analysis considered whether those respondents favoring
   more versus less environmental protection than was offered in Option 9
   held entirely different values, identifying which antagonistic values
   appeared to be most fundamental and where (ii at all) values consensus
   occurred. It also compared values emanating from respondents within and
   outside the affected region, although few major differences were
   detected in this regard. Results suggest that strong values differences
   did exist among those preferring greater versus less environmental
   protection, in particular as concerned the extent, form, and spatial and
   temporal scope of justification of their positions, their ideas of
   forests, and the appropriate role of people in forest management.
   Disagreement concerned far more than purely environmental values: a
   major point of difference involved human benefits and harms of the
   proposed forest plan. Indeed, both sides' positions were overridingly
   anthropocentric and consequentialist-a values orientation that almost
   inevitably spells conflict in light of the commonly differentiated
   social impacts of environmental management decisions. Although public
   involvement in environmental management thus cannot be expected to lead
   to a clear and consensual social directive, the Pacific Northwest case
   suggests that viable environmental management solutions that take this
   range of values into account can still be crafted.

   history both before and after the burn injury. Complex psychiatric
   comorbidity and substance abuse disorders that occurred before the burn
   injury each significantly raised the risk of unemployment before the
   burn injury; preburn substance abuse also affected unemployment at 4
   months after the burn injury. Trends for higher unemployment rates at 12
   months after discharge also were noted among those with a preburn
   history of complex psychiatric comorbidity and alcohol use, anxiety, or
   mood disorder. Preburn substance-use disorder raised the risk of
   attrition from the 12-month study; whereas, those diagnosed at the time
   of discharge with post-traumatic stress disorder or with two or more
   current psychiatric disorders after the burn injury dropped out less
   often. The greater risk for unemployment and attrition observed among
   subjects with psychiatric disorders before the burn injury suggests the
   need for routine screening, tracking, and assistance in accessing
   supportive or rehabilitative services to remove barriers to employment.

AB OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution
   of the executive cognitive functions to self-reported and observed
   performance of activities of daily living and instrumental activities of
   daily living.
   DESIGN: These data were collected as part of a cross-sectional survey of
   community-dwelling older persons, using statistical sampling, in a
   two-county area of southern Colorado.
   SETTING: Participants were interviewed and administered measures of
   general cognition, depression, executive functioning, and performance of
   self-care and instrumental activities, either in their homes or at the
   study clinic.
   PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1158 community-dwelling persons between the
   ages of 60 and 99 participated. Of these, 657 were female, 501 were
   male, 637 were Hispanic, and 521 were non-Hispanic whites.
   MEASUREMENTS: Subjects were administered the Mini-Mental State Exam
   (MMSE), a measure of executive functioning (the Behavioral Dyscontrol
   Scale), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D),
   and the Structured Assessment of Independent Living Skills (SAILS, a
   measure of observed performance of daily tasks). They also were
   interviewed regarding their reported ADL and IADL status using measures
   from the Longitudinal Study on Aging.
   RESULTS: Both general mental status and executive functioning
   demonstrated statistically significant univariate associations with all
   seven functional status measures (both self-report and observed
   performance). In a series of ordinary least squares regression models,
   executive functioning was a predictor for self-reported ADLs and
   observed performance of complex IADL tasks such as managing money and
   medications. Mental status did not predict self-reported functioning but
   was a predictor of observed performance. Depression was a significant
   variable for self-report measures but not for observed performance.
   Executive functioning and general mental status demonstrated some degree
   of independence from one another.
   CONCLUSION: Executive functioning is an important determinant of
   functional status for both self-reported and observed ADLs and IADLs and
   should be assessed routinely when evaluating the mental status and
   functional abilities of older people. These results replicate and extend
   previous research on executive functioning among older persons by
   examining these factors in a large bi-ethnic community sample.

   repertoire with their most recent opposite-sex partner. The 5% of NA
   engaging in vaginal oral, and anal intercourse with their most recent

   their most recent opposite-sex partner regardless of gender canal: women
   24% vs, 4%, p < 0.001; men: 33% vs. 6%, p < 0.001; oral: women 95% vs,

AB Log-linear models are useful for analyzing cross-classifications of
   counts arising in sociology, but it has been argued that in some cases,
   an alternative approach for formulating models-one based on
   simultaneously modeling univariate marginal logits and marginal
   associations-can lead to models that are more directly relevant for
   addressing the kinds of questions arising in those cases. In this
   article, the authors explore some of the similarities and differences
   between the log-linear models approach to modeling categorical data and
   a marginal modeling approach. It has been noted in past literature that
   the model of statistical independence is conveniently represented within
   both approaches to specifying models for cross-classifications of
   counts. The authors examine further the extent to which the two families
   of models overlap, as well as some important differences. The authors do
   not present a complete characterization of the conditions describing the
   intersection of the two families of models but cover many of the models
   for bivariate contingency tables and for three-way contingency tables
   that are routinely used in sociological research.

AB This article discusses Mann's model of power and its application to the
   sociology of gender. The model is used in a cross-national study of
   gender power in Poland and in the United States. It is demonstrated that
   the collective power of American men and their distributive power over
   women have been higher than the power of Polish men. Moreover, the power
   of American men has been diffused and extensive, while that of Polish
   men has been authoritative and intensive throughout most of the period
   since World War II. The nature of gender power is shown to influence the
   levels of sex segregation in higher education; Sex segregation in the
   Polish system of higher education was lower than in the American system
   in 1965 and in the 1970s, but it was slightly higher in the 1980s. These
   results are interpreted as reflecting historical changes in both
   countries: the increase in the collective power of American women and
   shifts in the reach of political and ideological power in Poland.

AB Rates of infant mortality and prematurity or low birthweight serve as

   population data documenting the still serious problem of perinatal
   outcome in the USA as well as in other economically developed countries.
   International comparisons suggest that nations which have the greatest
   inequality of income and social opportunity also have the most adverse
   perinatal, child and adult health outcomes. Furthermore, the data assert
   that these effects are independent of average national wealth or gross
   national economic productivity. Health status differs by social class
   and race, even among the most affluent sectors of the population. All
   social classes, even the wealthiest, suffer the health consequences of
   social inequalities. An explanatory socio-psychological theory of
   causality is proposed.

   in American Indians, was tested in a sample of 582 adult Southwestern
   American Indian males and females in large multigenerational pedigrees.
   All information was obtained from semistructured psychiatric interviews
   that were independently blind-rated for DSM-III-R diagnoses, Three main
   outcome measures were used: the relationship between binge drinking and
   (1) alcohol dependence and other psychiatric disorders, (2) substance
   abuse treatment, and (3) four behavioral problem
   categories-violence/lawlessness, physical, social, and work. Binge
   drinking and alcohol dependence were strongly associated. Most hinge
   drinkers were diagnosed as alcohol dependent. However, when controlling
   far alcohol dependence and other covariates, binge drinking was
   independently associated with an increase in odds for positive diagnoses
   for multiple psychiatric disorders, and far social, work, physical, and
   violence/lawlessness behavioral problems. In sum, binge drinking was
   found to be a common and severe problem with deleterious consequences in
   multiple domains of functioning. Assessment instruments should be
   designed to elicit information on binge patterns of drinking and
   strategies devised to provide appropriate treatment.

AB The objective of this study was to report trends in alcohol problems
   among whites, blacks, and Hispanics between 1984 and 1995. Data were
   obtained from two nationwide probability samples of U.S. households, the
   first conducted in 1984 and the second in 1995. The 1984 sample
   consisted of 1777 whites, 1947 blacks, and 1453 Hispanics, The 1995
   sample included 1636 whites, 1582 blacks, and 1585 Hispanics. On both
   occasions, interviews (average length, 1 hr) were conducted in
   respondents' homes by trained interviewers, me results indicate that
   between 1984 and 1995, alcohol problems were stable among white and
   blade men and increased among Hispanic men. The rates of three or more
   alcohol problems for men of each ethnic group for 1984 and 1995 were:
   12% and 11% for white men, 16% and 13% for black men, and 9% and 16% far
   Hispanic men, respectively. Problem prevalence was stable and relatively
   low among women in all three ethnic groups. Overall, the prevalence of
   alcohol problems continues to be high among men in the United States.
   Even though recent research has shown that rates of frequent heavy
   drinking among white men have declined, we found no corresponding
   decrease in problem prevalence. Rates of frequent heavy drinking and
   alcohol-related problems between 1984 and 1995 have remained especially
   high among black and Hispanic men, suggesting that men of these two
   ethnic groups should be specifically targeted for renewed prevention
   efforts.

   Women Twins Study carried out in 1989-1990 in Oakland, California. Among
   twin pairs, 91% (95% confidence interval (CI) 89-94%) agreed on their

AB Objective: The effect of religious belief and activity on remission of
   depression were examined in medically ill hospitalized older patients.
   Method: Consecutive patients aged 60 years or over who had been admitted
   to medical inpatient services at a university medical center were
   screened for depressive symptoms. Of 111 patients scoring 16 or higher
   on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, 94 were
   diagnosed with depressive disorder (DSM-III major depression or
   subsyndromal depression) by a psychiatrist using a structural
   psychiatric interview. After hospital discharge, depressed patients were
   followed up by telephone at 12-week intervals four times. At each
   follow-up contact, criterion symptoms were reassessed, and changes in
   each symptom over the interval since last contact were determined. The
   median follow-up time for 87 depressed patients was 47 weeks. Religious
   variables were examined as predictors of time to remission by means of a
   multivariate Cox model, with controls for demographic, physical health,
   psychosocial, and treatment factors. Results: During the follow-up
   period, 47 patients (54.0%) had remissions; the median time to remission
   was 30 weeks. Intrinsic religiosity was significantly and independently
   related to time to remission, but church attendance and private
   religious activities were not. Depressed patients with higher intrinsic
   religiosity scores had more rapid remissions than patients with lower
   scores. Conclusions: In this study, greater intrinsic religiosity
   independently predicted shorter time to remission. To the author's
   knowledge, this is the first report in which religiosity has been
   examined as a predictor of outcome of depressive disorder.

AB Objective: This paper interprets eating disorders (including anorexia
   and bulimia) as one (nonfunctional) manifestation, in modern
   environments, of evolved psychological mechanisms which modulate the
   standard of feminine bodily attractiveness as a response to economic
   conditions. Method: Published evidence from anthropology, sociology, and
   psychology was used to evaluate predictions that (1) where economic
   independence is possible, women favor a slender standard and (2) where
   women lack economic power, marriage tends to be favored and the standard
   becomes more curvaceous. These patterns were tested by correlating U.S.
   economic data with changing standards of bodily curvaceousness in Vogue
   and Playboy. Psychological and biological mechanisms by which the
   slender standard produces anorexia and bulimia were examined. Results:
   Published evidence and the empirical data suggest that the standard of
   bodily curvaceousness is determined by the economics of reproduction.
   Discussion: These ideas permit integration of the research on eating
   disorders in several disciplines and suggest many avenues for future
   enquiry. (C) 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB A treatment package consisting of a DRO procedure, token fines, and
   prompted relaxation was used to reduce the agitated-disruptive behavior
   of a person with autism and mental retardation living in a community
   group home. The agitated-disruptive behaviors (cursing, hitting,
   kicking, throwing objects, and verbal threats) were measured during
   three different activities in a group home. The baseline rates of the
   agitated-disruptive behavior during one of these activities was
   relatively low, during another was moderate, and during the third was
   high. DRO procedures were partially implemented by a peer with Down
   syndrome and mental retardation during a portion of the study. Effects
   of the DRO procedures were as follows: During each activity an initial
   reduction of agitated-disruptive behavior was dependent on choosing an
   appropriate DRO interval, with shorter DRO intervals required during
   activities in which the baseline rates of the agitated-disruptive
   behavior were higher. Once shorter DRO intervals had been used to reduce
   agitated-disruptive behavior, longer DRO intervals were effective in
   maintaining those reductions. Reductions were maintained for up to 6
   months.

PY 1998
AB A procedure for assessing birth spacing goals, an important component of
   fertility preferences, is proposed and applied to 1993 Costa Rican data.
   Based on a reverse or backward survival analysis, preferred birth
   intervals are estimated to range between 3.5 and 4.5 years (1.5 years
   for the interval union to first birth). These intervals are 2 or 3 years
   shorter than crude estimates from data on open or last closed intervals,
   which are upwardly biased by selection and left censoring effects. To
   achieve these spacing preferences, a cohort must spend about two-thirds
   of the time using contraception (one-third in the interval union to
   first birth). An inverse association between desired family size and
   desired birth interval is evident only in parity-specific analyses.

   recent debate over the legalization of medical marijuana (California's

   factors to the rise of drug use among adolescents. The In-DEPTH program,
   a unique drug education model that educates, prevents, and provides
   intervention strategies in adolescent marijuana use, has in small
   multisite surveys shown initial success in decreasing marijuana use and
   positively changing beliefs. The program is based on pharmacology,

   The syntactic complexity of the children's language samples correlated
   positively with increases in C-unit length, and regression analyses
   revealed that syntactic complexity was the best predictor of mean C-unit
   length. Children with longer average C-unit lengths produced greater

AB Background-Several studies have indicated that a variety of social
   relationships are important predictors of morbidity and mortality in
   patients with coronary artery disease, but little attention has been
   focused oil the prognostic importance of these factors in the growing
   population of elderly patients with heart failure. To address this
   issue, we sought to determine whether emotional support is associated
   with fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in elderly patients
   hospitalized with heart failure.
   Methods and Results-We reviewed the medical records of 292 subjects aged
   greater than or equal to 65 years who were hospitalized with clinical
   heart failure and were part of the New Haven, Corm, cohort of the
   Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly, a
   longitudinal, community-based study of aging that included a
   comprehensive assessment of psychosocial support. In the unadjusted
   analysis, lack of emotional support was significantly associated with
   the 1-year risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular outcomes [odds
   ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 4.9]. After adjustment for
   demographic factors, clinical severity, comcorbidity and functional
   status, social ties, and instrumental support, the absence of emotional
   support remained associated with a significantly higher risk (odds
   ratio, 3.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 7.8), The test for
   interaction between emotional support and ses was significant (P=.01).
   In the fully adjusted model, the odds ratio for women was 8.2 (95%
   confidence interval, 2.5 to 27.2) compared with 1.0 (95% confidence
   interval, 0.3 to 3.3) for men.
   Conclusions-Among elderly patients hospitalized with clinical heart
   failure, the absence of emotional support, measured before admission, is
   a strong, independent predictor of the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal
   cardiovascular events in the year after admission. In this cohort, the
   association is restricted to women.

AB The social origins of sociology are rooted in urban modernity, and
   specifically in civil society. Such a point of origins occasioned the
   growth of totalistic systems of social representation, which culminated
   in the modem state. The two contexts sealed sociology's role as a sort
   of bridge between civil society and the state or, more generally,
   between traditions of prosaic social communities and those of applied,
   action-oriented systematicity. The paper argues that modern processes of
   globalization have reshuffled the cards, as civil society has become
   more globalized and less beholden to state jurisdiction, and as the
   state has increasingly become less competent as an agent of strategic
   action in a world typified by globalization. This particular impasse has
   become detrimental to sociology, since it caused the relocation of its
   addressees away from the communicative bridges that have linked them
   since the inception of modernity.

   Parliamentry committees, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was
   proclaimed in May 1997. Despite a rich legacy of empirical research
   pointing drug policy in a new direction, away from aggressive
   criminalization, the new law reaffirms both the seriously deviant status
   of illicit drug users and the primacy of the criminal justice model over
   public health and social justice alternatives. I review the research
   evidence and analytic contributions provided to these deliberations by
   Canadian scholars from sociology and related disciplines, often

AB Objectives: To examine tobacco use among New York City resident Latin
   Americans from different countries of origin and with different levels
   of acculturation reflected by language use. Design: Effective health
   promotion programs, particularly those aimed at smoking cessation and
   prevention, require careful investigation into possible cultural and
   societal factors influencing predictors and barriers to preventive
   health behavior. National data characterizing cigarette smoking behavior
   among  broadly defined racial/ethnic groups (eg, black, Hispanic) have
   rarely examined the extent or importance of cultural variation and
   acculturation within and among ethnic groups. This report addresses
   these issues. Methods: In this study, we examine self-reported cigarette
   smoking behavior from a 1992 telephone survey of a quota sample of
   Puerto Rican, Dominican, Colombian, and Ecuadorian Hispanics living in
   New York City. We compare results from these data with results from a
   random sample of  New York City Hispanics from the Tobacco Use
   Supplement to the 1992-93 Current Population Survey. Results: Both data
   sets demonstrated that Puerto Ricans were significantly more likely to
   be current smokers and ever smokers than the other three Latino groups.
   Among Hispanic women in the quota sample, those who chose to complete
   the interview in English were much more likely to report ever smoking
   than those women who chose to complete the interview in Spanish.
   Conclusions: The relationship  between smoking behavior and
   acculturation (as measured by language usage) appears to be complex and
   sensitive to methodological issues of sampling and interview language.

AB Recent developments in the sociology of religion have suggested that a
   new approach, or "paradigm," is guiding research in the sociology of
   religion, and is gaining empirical support. This new approach has as its
   core proposition the notion that competition between religious
   denominations has a positive effect on religious involvement, and,
   conversely, that religious monopolies tend to inhibit personal
   religiosity. This study attempts to apply this general hypothesis to the
   nations of Western Europe, and to extend the range of dependent
   variables to which the pluralist program can be applied. We generally
   find strong support for the new research program, in that Catholics in
   primarily Protestant countries exhibit higher levels of religious
   observance than do Catholics in countries with Catholic majorities, as
   well as greater adherence to Catholic social teaching.

AB Among the processes most thoroughly analyzed by social scientists
   studying religion have been conversion/affiliation and, more recently,
   deconversion/disaffiliation (Snow and Machalek 1984; Bromley 1991).
   Recent theory and research on these processes have been stimulated by a
   variety of developments, such as the historic, absolute decline in
   mainline church membership coupled with an unanticipated surge in
   conservative church membership, a mass exodus from traditional religious
   orders, the rapid growth and subsequent decline of controversial new
   religious movements, and widespread experimentation with a diverse array
   of New Age and quasi-religious groups. The primary focus of research has
   been on the nature of individual transformation and the process by which
   it occurs, which has concentrated theory and research at a microsocial
   level. Indeed, in assessing recent theory and research on conversion,
   Machalek and Snow (1993:69) observe that "it is somewhat ironic that
   sociologists have shown little reluctance to subordinate social
   contextual variables to individual variables in their efforts to explain
   the causes of conversion" and call for a shift in analytic focus "to the
   role of temporal, organizational and macrosocial factors." The same
   observation can be made about deconversion/disaffiliation. In fairness,
   there is a long history in sociology of analyzing "role types" that
   emerge in specific social contexts (Klapp 1954), and there have been
   some attempts to create types of conversion/affiliation (Lofland and
   Skonovd 1981) and deconversion/disaffiliation (Richardson et al. 1986)
   in a manner that potentially would link role and organization structure.
   The exit typology developed hew and applied to religious organizations
   constitutes an effort to connect that social process and its
   accompanying interpretive narrative to organizational context.(1) I
   argue that the process of exit and the way that it is interpreted is
   significantly determined by the power and social location of the
   organization from which exit occurs. Specifically, I begin by specifying
   three types of organizations in contemporary American society based on
   level of tension with the surrounding environment Allegiant, Contestant,
   and Subversive - and three corresponding types of exit characteristic of
   these organizational forms - Defector, Whistle-blower, and Apostate.(2)
   The form of exit analyzed here is not the typical leavetaking that
   occurs in organizations of ail kinds. Rather, I examine cases where
   exiting is contested But these are particularly significant events
   because they reveal the capacity of organizations to exert power when it
   is in their interest to do so. I employ a variety of illustrative cases
   of exit to articulate the way in which the position of the organization
   in the social order influences the way that the exit process is
   structured.

   the siblings. Adolescent siblings of children with retardation living at
   home (N = 25) or in residential placement (N = 20) were contrasted with
   siblings of children without retardation (N = 28), on measures obtained
   from their mothers and themselves. Despite their different situations,
   these siblings were highly similar on measures of psychological
   adjustment, self-esteem, and family environment. Sibling relationships,
   however, were less intense, with less warmth but also lower conflict, in
   families where the child lived out of the home. Most siblings of
   children with retardation reported positive personal growth experiences
   while also expressing realistic concerns about the future. Siblings of
   children with retardation had beliefs and attitudes about placement that
   were highly consistent with the child's current living situation.

AB Objective. To better understand the experiences, challenges, and
   adaptations of parents with children who have disfiguring facial
   hemangiomas.
   Design. Qualitative, descriptive.
   Methods. In-depth interviews were performed with the parent(s) of 25
   children, aged 5 months to 8 years. Each child was referred to the
   Pediatric Dermatology Practice, Department of Dermatology, University of
   California, San Francisco, with a facial hemangioma of 1 cm diameter or
   greater. Interviews were ethnographic in style, centering on the
   description by parents of the particular challenges faced, supports
   received, and adaptive strategies developed in coping with their child's
   hemangioma. Analysis was by open coding of interview transcripts. Coded
   statements were organized within common categories and these further
   gathered into 4 principal themes: 1) parental emotion and adaptation; 2)
   experiences with public reactions; 3) issues related to parent-child
   interactions; and 4) expressed satisfaction/dissatisfaction with medical
   care.
   Results. Disfiguring facial hemangiomas were found to be associated with
   parental reactions of disbelief, fear, and mourning, particularly during
   the growth phase. Reactions of strangers forced parents to confront
   varied aspects of social stigmatization. A broad array of effects on the
   parent-child interaction were observed, often connected with variables
   extrinsic to the hemangioma, including especially the support and
   acceptance by the extended family. Half of those studied expressed
   substantial dissatisfaction with aspects of their medical care.
   Conclusions. Disfiguring facial hemangiomas in young children are
   frequently associated with parental reactions of loss and grief, despite
   the generally benign nature of the lesion and the prognosis for eventual
   involution. Physicians are faced with specific challenges in providing
   effective anticipatory guidance and support to parents.

   of the intention to stop childbearing and of contraceptive use among
   urban women in Mozambique. It uses data from a survey of 1,585 married
   women conducted in Greater Maputo in 1993, and it employs logistic
   regression for multivariate analysis. The results of the analysis
   indicate that although the stopping intention and contraceptive use are
   interrelated and similarly affected by such factors as education or the
   area of residence, the intention to stop childbearing is mainly driven
   by women's perception of their material conditions and socioeconomic
   security, while contraceptive use is largely a product of social
   diffusion and the legitimization of innovative, Western-origin
   information and technologies. The study proposes that these findings may
   help explain the unique features of the fertility transition in

AB Using data from the 1990 National Family and Fertility Survey (NFFS) and

   amenorrhoea in Ethiopia. The results show that 91 in every 100 mothers
   breastfed their child for at least 6 months. The median duration of
   breastfeeding stands at Is months, and amenorrhoea lasts for a median
   duration of 12 months. Significant variations in breastfeeding and
   amenorrhoea duration are also observed among the different categories of
   breastfeeding women. The median duration of breastfeeding for lactating
   women is 24 months, 6 months far those who weaned, and 2 months for
   those whose child died. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhoea is
   14 months for breastfeeding women, 12 months for those who weaned, and 6
   months for those whose child died. Discrete-time hazard models reveal
   that child death has the strongest effect on the resumption of menses.
   Net of other factors, the risk of returning to menses increased 3 times
   for mothers whose child died. The effect of child death, however,
   decreases over time. Weaning also has a significant positive effect;
   and, like child death, its effect diminishes as time passes. The study
   further shows significant differences in the risk of returning to
   postpartum mensas by socioeconomic characteristics of the women, even
   though they are breastfeeding.

AB Corporate innovation is often argued to result from, and be encouraged
   by, market competition. The tradition is to test such arguments with
   market concentration data; firms with stronger control over their market
   can afford the long-run investment of R&D. Network theory has broadened
   our understanding of how competition is a function of structure within
   and beyond a market. Producers earn high profit margins to the extent
   they are few and their customers and suppliers are many and
   disorganized. The first condition is measured by the traditional
   concentration ratio for a market. The second condition is measured by
   the network constraint of suppliers and customers. My purpose in this
   paper is to describe how our understanding of the market competition
   effect on innovation is enriched when the concentration measure of
   marker competition tradition in economics is replaced with the network
   model of market competition now prevalent in sociology. Results indicate
   that markets facing competitive environments, in high constraint market
   positions, show greater R&D intensity and faster rates of innovation
   than do industries facing less competitive pressure. These effects
   persist even with controls for technological opportunity and
   appropriability, in contrast to traditional models using only
   concentration data to measure competition. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

AB Over the last decade, environmental sociology has produced a tremendous
   stream of research pertaining to environmental justice issues. In
   general, we now know that low income groups and communities of color are
   disproportionately exposed to toxic wastes. In this paper I argue that
   future research requires a shift in methodological approach. Learning
   how groups come to be exposed to toxic wastes requires an understanding
   of the organizational processes that shape decisions regarding
   production practices and regulatory enforcement strategies. I conclude
   by making three claims: (I) Documenting that disempowered groups are
   exposed to toxic wastes more than other groups is important.
   Disentangling whether race or class matters more is more dubious. (2) If
   we want to make claims about process, we should study process and not
   outcomes. (3) Insofar as we have to study outcomes, we should be more
   aware of which outcomes we want to study and what types of inferences we
   are able to draw from outcomes.

AB With the aim of contributing to a sociology of age, this essay develops
   framework for understanding age as accomplished, i.e., as something that
   is both a process and the outcome of ongoing interactional work. The
   common expression "act your age" provides the useful metaphor of
   performance. We perform our own age constantly, but we also give meaning
   to other ages and to age more generally in our actions and interactions,
   our beliefs and words and feelings, our social policies. This essay
   offers two routes to the conclusion that age is accomplished. The first
   involves drawing parallels between the study of age and the study of
   gender The second route uses Existing scholarship, which recognizes that
   age is far more social than chronological. I draw on work in the social
   constructionist, symbolic interactionist, and life course traditions to
   develop the framework of age-as-accomplished and to show its potential
   to organize much of what we already have leaned about age and aging.

   collective behavior on the one hand and critical studies on the other.
   Relatively recently, however, as interest in hegemonic processes becomes
   more popular and critical theory gains new prominence, there is a
   corresponding rise in attention to the integrative, if hegemonic, role
   of the media of mass communication. This paper explores that role,

AB The socioeconomic gap between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas
   increased during the 1980s. We test three competing explanations for
   this trend during the 1980s: overdependence on manufacturing, especially
   in nonmetro labor markets, the emergence of producer services as st
   catalyst of socioeconomic growth, and federal spending. Using a model
   that is informed by a variety of perspectives in sociology and economic
   geography, and commuter zones (CZs) as spatial units of analysis, we
   estimate the effects of manufacturing concentration, producer service
   concentration, and federal spending on per capita income, per capita
   earnings, and private nonfarm employment growth during the 1983-1988
   business cycle recovery. The OLS and interaction models show that all
   three factors help explain why metro areas outperformed nonmetro areas
   during this time period. The effects of producer service concentration,
   however, best fit with our expectations. Implications of our findings
   are discussed.

AB This article suggests that American sociology has developed a defacto
   tradition in the sociology of the marked that devotes greater
   epistemological attention to "politically salient" and "ontologically
   uncommon" features of social life, Although the "unmarked" comprises the
   vast majority of social life, the "marked" commands a disproportionate
   share of attention from sociologists. Since the marked already draws
   more attention within the general culture, social scientists contribute
   to re-marking and the reproduction of common-sense images of social
   reality This has important analytic consequences. This article argues
   for developing a stronger tradition in a sociology of the unmarked that
   explicitly foregrounds "politically unnoticed" and taken-for-granted
   elements of social reality. Three strategies are proposed toward this
   end: (1) reversing conventional patterns of markedness to foreground
   what typically remains unnamed and implicit, (2) marking everything by
   filling in all the shades of social continue so that each shares the
   same degree of epistemological ornamentation, and (3) developing an
   analytically nomadic perspective that observes social phenomena from
   multiple vantage points.

AB Although the focus of their work was rarely explicitly sociological,
   Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari developed concepts that have important
   and often profound implications for social theory and practice. Two of
   these, sense and segmentarity provide us,with entirely new ways to view
   sociological problems of meaning and structure. Deleuze conceives sense
   independently of both agency and signification, That is, sense is
   neither the manifestation of a communicating subject nor a structure of
   language-it is noncorporeal, impersonal, and prelinguistic, in
   his,words, a "pure effect or event." With Guattari, Deleuze notes that
   it is not a question of how subjects produce social structures, but how
   a "machinics of desire" produces subjects. In Deleuze and Guattari,
   desire is not defined as a want or a lack, but as a machinery of forces,
   flows, and breaks of energy. The functional stratification we witness in
   social life is only the molar effect of a more primary segmentation of
   desire that occurs at the molecular level, at the level of bodies. In
   Deleuze and Guattari, bodies are not just human bodies, but "anorganic"
   composites or mixtures, organic form itself being a mode of the body's
   subjectification. The problem of the subject, and thus of the
   constitution of society, is first a problem of how the sense of bodies
   is produced through the assembly of desiring-machines. The subject, we
   could sag: is the actualization of desire on the incorporeal surface of
   bodies.

AB Context.-Civilians were often the casualties of fighting during the
   recent Liberian civil conflict. Liberian health care workers played a
   crucial role in documenting violence against women by soliders and
   fighters during the war.
   Objective.-To document women's experiences of violence, including rape
   and sexual coercion, from a soldier or fighter during 5 years of the
   Liberian civil war from 1989 through 1994.
   Design.-Interview and survey.
   Setting.-High schools, markets, displaced persons camps, and urban
   communities in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1994.
   Participants.-A random sample of 205 women and girls between the ages of
   15 and 70 years (88% participation rate).
   Results.-One hundred (49%) of 205 participants reported experiencing at
   least 1 act of physical or sexual Violence by a soldier or fighter.
   Survey participants reported being beaten, tied up, or detained in a
   room under armed guard (17%); strip-searched 1 or more times (32%); and
   raped, subjected to attempted rape, or sexually coerced (15%). Women who
   were accused of belonging to a particular ethnic group or fighting
   faction or who were forced to cook for a soldier or fighter were at
   increased risk for physical and sexual violence. Of the 106 women and
   girls accused of belonging to an ethnic group or faction, 65 (61%)
   reported that they were beaten, locked up, strip-searched, or subjected
   to attempted rape, compared with 27 (27%) of the 99 women who were not
   accused (P less than or equal to.02, .07, .001, and .06, respectively).
   Women and girls who were forced to cook for a soldier or fighter were
   more likely to report experiencing rape, attempted rape, or sexual
   coercion than those who were not forced to cook (55% vs 10%; P less than
   or equal to.001, .06, and .001, respectively). Young women (those
   younger than 25 years) were more likely than women 25 years or older to
   report experiencing attempted rape and sexual coercion (18% vs 4%, P=.02
   and .04, respectively).
   Conclusions.-This collaborative research allowed Liberian women to
   document wartime violence against women in their own communities and to
   develop a unique program to address violence against women in Liberia.

AB People make subjective judgments about the severity of environmental
   problems and on future land use relying on certain information, and on
   their experiences with the problem. This article examines perceptions of
   the severity of environmental problems, willingness to expend future
   funds to solve these problems, and future land use for the Department of
   Energy's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina as a function of
   race. The null hypothesis that there are no racial differences in
   perceptions was tested. Of those interviewed, 23% of the 399 people were
   black, 75% were white, and 2% identified themselves as other. Blacks
   were significantly more willing than whites to spend federal funds to
   solve environmental problems such as cleaning up the SRS and Superfund
   sites, fixing ozone depletion, and reducing the threats from radon and
   high-tension power lines. There were statistically significant racial
   differences in preferences for future land use at the SRS, with blacks
   having a higher preference for using it as a preserve, and whites having
   a higher preference for a research park, camping, hiking, and hunting.
   These results indicate that the environmental concerns of the blacks
   interviewed were equal to or stronger than those of the whites. This is
   in contrast to much of previously published work that shows that blacks
   exhibit lower concerns and actions than whites for environmental
   problems.

AB Establishing and sustaining strong doctor-patient relationships is an

   relationships that the effectiveness of our work as healers is mediated.
   In recent years, a research literature emerging from the application of
   social science to medicine is beginning to highlight certain specific
   physician behaviors, especially those involved in doctor-patient
   communication, as actions of considerable importance to both physicians
   and patients. Successful physicians will further understand that our
   patients and their families also have high expectations for additional
   behaviors of physicians, particularly those recognized in the popular
   culture as professional, respectful of patients' circumstances, and
   supportive of patients' efforts. To the extent that physicians make an
   explicit effort to understand and appreciate the <<life-world>> of
   patients, and even to modify medical recommendations in order to
   maximize the meaningfulness and goodness-of-fit of these
   recommendations, the "art" of medicine also becomes an essential part of
   routine clinical practice. In the final analysis, new science, art, and
   behavioral competence are all required for strengthening doctor-patient
   relationships.

AB Behavioral approaches to reducing the adverse health effects of
   consuming fish with high contaminant levels benefit from understanding
   attitudes and perceptions about the relative safety of fish. Gender
   differences in attitudes about fish safety were investigated by
   interviewing 197 men and 94 women who attended a Duck Decoy show at
   Tuckerton, NJ. There were significant gender differences in perceptions
   of the safety of fish, ducks, and deer, with women generally believing
   that it was less safe to eat these foods than did men. Although people
   correctly perceived that ocean fish were safer than bay-caught fish from
   a chemical contaminant perspective, perceptions were less clear with
   respect to consuming predatory or herbivorous, or large versus small
   fish. Although men significantly perceived small fish as safer than
   large fish, women did not. However, people correctly believed that
   bluefish (a predaceous fish) were less safe than flounder (an
   herbivore). People uniformly believed it was safer to eat fish they
   caught themselves or bought in a fish store than those from a
   supermarket. These results suggest that any program to inform the public
   about the potential dangers from contaminated fish should take into
   account gender differences in perceptions.

   parenting differences between addicts and their parents were reported
   for the three indices mentioned, as well as for parent discipline and

   male youths (mean age 15.8 years) in a residential center for alcohol
   and substance misuse were compared with the families of a community
   control group (mean age 16.3 years). Within-subject group comparisons
   also were made. Family structure, interactive processes, maternal and
   paternal alcohol and substance use, and criminality were assessed
   through direct interview and/or self-report. The families of alcohol-and
   substance-misusing boys were markedly disadvantaged or impaired on
   numerous family structure, process, and substance-misusing behavioral
   variables in comparison with community controls. Within the alcohol-and
   substance-misusing group itself, family process variables, maternal
   alcohol symptoms, and maternal criminality differentiated boys with more
   vs. less severe drug-dependence symptoms. Maternal alcohol problems and
   criminality were more important than family process variables. Paternal
   alcohol or substance misuse or criminality did not differentiate proband
   symptom severity. We concluded that maternal alcohol symptoms and
   criminality differentiate severity of drug dependence in severely

AB Objectives: To explore the covariation of risk behaviors in a national
   sample of American Indian reservation-based youth using listwise
   principal components factor analysis and to determine how these risk
   behaviors may vary by age and sex.
   Design: Analysis of data from the National Indian Adolescent Health
   Survey, a validated anonymous self-report questionnaire of 162 items
   addressing various health domains.
   Setting: The survey was administered nationally in more than 200
   reservation-based schools.
   Participants: Thirteen thousand nine hundred twenty-three
   reservation-based American Indian or Alaska Native students in grades 7
   through 12 representing more than 50 tribes. The listwise factor
   analysis sample included 7687 respondents with complete data.
   Main Outcomes Measures: Item loadings and factor correlations by age and
   sex for 30 risk behaviors across various health domains.
   Results: Three risk behavior factors were fairly stable across sex and
   age: (1) the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs, (2) risky sexual
   behavior; and (3) suicidal behaviors. Correlations between these and
   other factors suggested different strengths of relationships by sex and
   age. Other factors, including violence, truancy, and delinquency, showed
   differences in item loading on factors and correlations between factors.
   The use of tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs was most frequently
   associated with other risk behavior factors, and suicidal behaviors
   showed the next highest frequency of intercorrelations.
   Conclusions: There are sex and age differences in the covariation of
   risk behaviors, and suicidal behaviors should be further investigated to
   determine if our findings are unique to American Indian youth. Health
   interventions that focus categorically on 1 risk dimension should also
   emphasize substance use prevention and intervention. To prevent
   substance abuse among American Indian youth, research efforts need to
   focus on effective strategies for coping with social and psychological
   stressors.

AB Questionnaire data were collected from 205 lesbians and 224 heterosexual
   women in Brazil, Peru, the Philippines, and the United States between
   1981 and 1988. Items include direction of childhood sexual interests,
   age of first awareness of sexual attraction, cross-attractions, age of
   first sexual contact, sex of partner in first sexual contact, age of
   awareness that sexual attractions were serious, and age of realization
   of adult sexual orientation. In general, similarities in the development
   of lesbian sexuality and differences between lesbians and heterosexual
   women were found, regardless of culture. Findings include: Lesbians were
   more sexually active as children and displayed more sexual interest in
   girls than heterosexuals; did in boys; lesbians tended to become aware
   of their attractions to women later than heterosexuals realized
   attractions to men; lesbians reported considerably more early attraction
   to men than heterosexuals did to women; lesbians reported earlier sexual
   contact than did heterosexual women; the sex of the partner of first
   sexual contact for lesbians was split roughly equally between males and
   females whereas heterosexuals reported contact with males almost
   exclusively; childhood awareness that sexual attractions were serious
   were similar in lesbians and heterosexuals; lesbians defined themselves
   as homosexual later than heterosexuals defined themselves as
   heterosexual. We conclude that norms for heterosexual behavior impact
   the development of lesbian sexuality and identity, impeding, but not
   obliterating, their development. Lesbian sexuality and identity
   eventually emerge regardless of culture.

AB OBJECTIVE: To assess attitudes to body size and obesity in Samoans, a
   Pacific island group characterised by very high levels of obesity and
   traditionally strong positive cultural views of large bodies.
   DESIGN: Cross sectional study of Samoan adults in Samoa and New Zealand.
   SUBJECTS: 84 female and 77 male Samoans in Samoa and 41 female and 24
   male Samoans in Auckland, New Zealand, aged 25-55 y.
   MEASUREMENT: Body mass index (BMI), standardised survey questionnaires
   of perceptions of bodyweight and health, diet and exercise, and
   perception of body sizes on a continuous scale.
   RESULTS: Although Samoans in both countries display high population
   levels of obesity, ideal body sizes are slim and body dissatisfaction
   and attempted weight losses were apparent, However, women and men above
   normal weight did not characteristically perceive themselves as obese,
   were as positive about their body size, weight and health, and obese
   women were no more likely to be attempting to lose weight than their
   slimmer peers.
   CONCLUSIONS: The traditional Samoan veneration of large bodies is not
   apparent as ideal body sizes are slim. An important difference in values
   with Western industrialised societies is the absence of a strongly
   negative view of obesity.

AB Although a role for family and parent factors in the development of
   behavioral problems in childhood is often acknowledged, the roles of
   specific parental characteristics in relation to specific child actions
   need further elucidation. We studied parental "Big Five" personality
   traits and psychiatric diagnoses in relation to their children's
   antisocial diagnoses and naturalistically observed antisocial behaviors,
   in boys with and without the diagnosis of Attention-Deficit
   Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). First, regardless of comorbid antisocial
   diagnosis, boys with ADHD, more often than comparison boys, had mothers
   with a major depressive episode and/or marked anxiety symptoms in the
   past year, and fathers with a childhood history of ADHD. Second,
   compared to the nondiagnosed group, boys with comorbid ADHD+Oppositional
   Defiant or Conduct Disorder (ODD/CD) had fathers with lower
   Agreeableness, higher Neuroticism, and more likelihood of having
   Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Third, regarding linkages between parental
   characteristics and child externalizing behaviors, higher rates of child
   overt antisocial behaviors observed in a naturalistic summer program
   were associated primarily with maternal characteristics, including
   higher Neuroticism, lower Conscientiousness, presence of Major
   Depression, and absence of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. The association
   of maternal Neuroticism with child aggression was larger in the ADHD
   than in the comparison group. In contrast, higher rates of observed
   child covert antisocial behaviors were associated solely with paternal
   characteristics, including history of substance abuse and higher
   Openness. Results provide external validation in parent data for a
   distinction between overt and covert antisocial behaviors and support
   inclusion of parent personality traits in family studies. The
   interaction of maternal Neuroticism and child ADHD in predicting child
   aggression is interpreted in regard to a conceptualization of child by
   parent "fit."

AB Purpose: To describe the health related quality of life (HRQL), partner
   relationships, sexual functioning, and body image concerns of breast
   cancer survivors (BCS) in relation to age, menopausal status, and type
   of cancer treatment.
   Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional sample of BCS in two large
   metropolitan areas was invited to participate in a survey study that
   included the following standardized measures: the RAND 36-item Health
   Survey; the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D);
   the Dyadic Adjustment Scale (DAS): the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial
   (BCPT) Symptom Checklist; the Watts Sexual Functioning Questionnaire
   (WSFQ); and subscales from the Cancer Rehabilitation Evaluation System
   (CARES).
   Results: Eight hundred sixty-four BCS completed the survey RAND Health
   Survey scores were as good or better than those of healthy, age-matched
   women, and the frequency of depression was similar to general population
   samples. Marital/partner adjustment was similar to normal healthy
   samples, and sexual functioning mirrored that of healthy, age-matched
   postmenopausal pausal women. However, these BCS reported higher rates of
   physical symptoms (eg, joint pains, headaches, and hot flashes) than
   healthy women. Sexual dysfunction occurred more frequently in women who
   had received chemotherapy (all ages), and in younger women who were no
   longer menstruating. In women greater than or equal to 50 years,
   tamoxifen therapy was unrelated to sexual functioning.
   Conclusion: BCS report more frequent physical and menopausal symptoms
   than healthy women, yet report HRQL and sexual functioning comparable to
   that of healthy, age-matched women. Nevertheless, some survivors still
   experience poorer functioning, and clinicians should inquire about
   common symptoms to provide symptomatic management or counseling for
   these women. (C) 1998 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB Over the past decade, Zygmunt Bauman has published a series of books
   that sketch out a postmodern turn in society, theory, culture, ethics
   and politics. Changes in contemporary society and culture, Bauman
   argues, require new modes of thought, morality and politics to
   appropriately respond to the new social conditions. This requires a
   reconfiguration of critical social theory and new tasks for a postmodern
   sociology. Bauman thus poses fundamental challenges to contemporary
   social theory and provides an original and provocative postmodern
   version of the sociological imagination, developing sketches of the
   fundamental social and cultural changes of our time, and the ways that
   theory and politics must be changed to creatively map and democratically
   respond to these questions. Bauman's critical reflections on modern
   theory and society, and his postmodern turn, require serious critical
   responses to his challenges to conventional wisdom and practice. In my
   study, I sketch out what I consider to be important in Bauman's recent
   work, what I see as problematical, and how Bauman's project - that is
   also my own - might be advanced. While my focus might appear to be
   predominantly critical, I attempt to generate a constructive dialogue
   with his thought that will advance our mutual interests and perhaps help
   illuminate some interesting contemporary topics and debates.

AB Violence against women is a global phenomenon linked to patriarchal
   cultural values and social structures that subordinate women. In Latin
   America, grass roots women's organizations and the Inter-American
   Commission of Women have recently turned their attention to pressing the
   governments of the Americas to address the endemic problem of violence
   against women. The work of the Inter-American Commission of Women has
   been particularly important but widely ignored in this area. As a
   specialized commission of the Organization of American States, the
   Inter-American Commission of Women has long worked to improve the rights
   and status of women throughout the Americas and has recently succeeded
   in negotiating an important international convention, the Inter-American
   Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence
   Against Women. This convention breaks new ground by defining violence
   against women as a violation of women's human rights and by identifying
   the duties of states to address the problem.
   This article traces the historical and contemporary role of the
   Inter-American Commission of Women in negotiating international norms
   aimed at defining and securing women's rights in the Americas. It
   outlines the specific work the commission carried out in negotiating the
   Convention on Violence Against Women, which has been in force since
   1995, and it examines the innovative international norms found in the
   convention. It shows that, despite problems of public obscurity and
   state resistances to change, the commission has pressed governments from
   the international level to address and improve women's rights. Combined
   with a growing women's movement at the grass roots level in the
   Americas, the governments of the region are now having to take real
   steps to combat violence against women. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Research at the frontlines of wars shows that the realities of war are
   quite different from the public presentations of war. The experiences of
   those surviving in the midst of war are frequently worlds apart from the
   "images" of political violence (mis)portrayed in public media, formal
   military texts, the literature, and war museums. This has allowed for a
   number of myths about war and human aggression to hold sway in both
   academic and popular culture that, as the basis for policies, can
   actually further harm those subjected to war. For example, although the
   vast majority of cultural and military treatises on war focus on
   soldiers, more children than soldiers are killed in wars in the world
   today. If this core reality of war is omitted from analyses, solutions
   become impossible. On the other hand, people often look at statistics
   like these and decry the inevitability of aggression in human nature and
   society. Yet, data from combat soldiers have shown that through much of
   modern history, the majority of combat soldiers on the front lines do
   not fire their weapons, at least not at other humans. They do not flee
   war, but they cannot bring themselves to kill others. When these facts
   are excluded from public discourse on political violence, we sacrifice
   our potential for understanding the human capacity for peacebuilding.
   Without actual war zone research-research conducted at the front lines
   of wars-it is impossible to distinguish between fact and fiction in
   these formal presentations of war. In exploring some of the common myths
   about war and comparing them with data collected at the front lines,
   this article examines the question of why these myths emerge with such
   force and chronicles the cultural construction of aggression. In
   conclusion, the article suggests that a new kind of empiricism is
   necessary for studying such difficult, dangerous, and complex phenomena
   as political aggression and peacebuilding. It is an empiricism that
   necessitates both sophisticated methodological tools attuned to wartime
   realities and theoretical insights capable of explaining them. Examples
   take the reader through key dilemmas and solutions in the search for a
   more representative, and responsible, understanding of political
   violence and peace. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   this "natural fertility" indigenous population of the Pacific island of
   Guam exhibit low levels of couple infertility which are counteracted by
   high levels of adult male mortality, while new unions formed after the
   death of female partners tend to reduce completed fertility by only
   about one child. Delayed age at the time of union formation is largely
   compensated by reduction in birthspacing intervals among offspring of
   older fathers. Early terminators, formerly fertile couples of
   reproductive age who fail for unspecified biological or behavioral
   reasons to continue reproducing, affect an equal or even larger impact
   than adult male mortality on failure to attain theoretical male
   fertility maxima in this population. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB Mortality, fertility, and migration data were used to identify
   population structure in a group of Old Order Amish living in New York
   State. Two thousand and sixteen individuals were accounted for since the
   community was first formed in 1948 and this is nearly total
   ascertainment of the population. Further, ethnography compared Amish
   households to neighboring non-Amish households to understand differences
   in health beliefs, caregiving patterns, and economic strategies. Despite
   evidence that suggests that the Amish have health risks comparable to
   U.S. population and that they under-utilize health care, this study
   demonstrates that Amish age standardized death rates are 19% below the
   U.S. death rate in 1960. Natural fertility combined with low infant
   mortality, migrating to form new communities when population density
   increased, and selective but appropriate use of western biomedicine have
   emerged as strong cultural patterns that facilitated reproductive
   success and longevity among the Amish. (C) 1998 Wiley-Liss.

AB This paper reviews the origins and definitions of social capital in the
   writings of Bourdieu, Loury, and Coleman, among other authors. It
   distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their
   dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature
   emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits
   mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these
   positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also
   deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review
   four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples.
   Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an
   individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final
   sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I
   argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability,
   social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However,
   excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.

AB Computer-assisted data analysis is usually associated with the analysis
   of aggregate data according to the tenets of logical positivism. But
   there are more than twenty computer programs designed to assist
   researchers analyzing ethnographic data, and these programs may be used
   by researchers with a variety of epistemological orientations. Some
   computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDA) programs automate
   analysis procedures that have been used by generations of ethnographers.
   Others open up new directions through the use of linked coding schemes,
   hypertext, and case-based hypothesis testing. Ethnographers interested
   in computer assistance must acquaint themselves with the variety of
   capabilities and programs available because no one program dominates the
   CAQDA field. In this article, we provide an overview of the theoretical
   and practical considerations bearing on the choice of CAQDA software.

AB The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of contemporary
   sociology in Japan. The sociological discipline in Japan has made
   remarkable progress since World War II. The rapid economic growth during
   the 1960s, which was prompted by Western influence, had an effect on the
   direction of the discipline's development. After providing a brief
   overview of historical events, I consider scholarly publications during
   the last 30 years to illuminate substantive trends in sociological
   research. As might be predicted, the changing substantive interests of
   Japanese sociologists have been in many ways a response to societal
   changes and needs. I also examine the trends in theory, methods, and
   empirical research. A content analysis of articles published in the
   major Japanese sociological journals shows the growing emphasis on
   theoretical scholarship and the decreasing emphasis on empirical
   research in recent years. The conclusion presents some considerations
   concerning the future direction of Japanese sociology.

AB Objective: To determine whether gender-specific patterns of risk
   behaviors are associated with a self-reported history of ever having
   been forced or pressured to have sexual intercourse among sexually
   active adolescents.
   Subjects and Methods: In 1995, 21 297 eighth-through 12th-grade students
   in 79 public and private schools in Vermont were anonymously surveyed.
   Data were analyzed for 7884 sexually active students (3931 girls and
   3953 boys). Demographic variables and indicators of violence, suicide,
   recent substance use, sexual behavior, pregnancy, and weight control
   behavior were assessed. Data were analyzed with multiple logistic
   regression.
   Results: Of the sexually active students, 30.3% of the girls and 9.9% of
   the boys reported ever being forced or pressured to have sexual
   intercourse. Among sexually active girls, being in 1 or more physical
   fights in the past year (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 1.40-1.94), seriously considering suicide (OR, 1.97; CI,
   1.69-2.31), more years of sexual activity (OR, 1.52; CT, 1.43-1.61), not
   using a condom at last sexual intercourse (OR, 1.28; CI, 1.09-1.49), and
   having been pregnant more often (OR, 1.40; CI, 1.16-1.69) were
   associated with having been forced or pressured to have sex. For
   sexually active boys, seriously considering suicide (OR, 1.64; CI,
   1.23-2.20), more years of sexual activity (OR, 1.21; CI, 1.12-1.31),
   more male partners in the past 3 months (OR, 1.30; CI, 1.14-1.48), more
   female partners in the past 3 months (OR, 1.09; CI, 1.01-1.18), not
   using a condom at last sexual intercourse (OR, 1.37; CI, 1.03-1.82),
   having been involved in more pregnancies (OR; 1.64; CI, 1.29-2.08), and
   having vomited or used laxatives (OR, 3.44; CI, 2.18-5.43) were
   associated with having been forced or pressured to have sex.
   Conclusions: Patterns of risk behaviors differed among sexually active
   male and female adolescents reporting being forced or pressured to have
   sex. Having been forced or pressured to have sex was associated with
   externalizing behavior, such as fighting, among girls and with
   internalizing behavior, such as bulimia, among boys. These unexpected
   associations have notable implications for screening adolescents for a
   history of having been forced or pressured to have sex.

   City carried out in 1995 revealed that 51 % of them had fully completed
   the series of childhood immunizations, immunization coverage in slum
   households was only half that in non-slum households.
   Apart from residence in a slum household other characteristics strongly
   associated with the completion of the entire series of childhood
   immunizations included the following: educational level of the mother,
   number of children in the family household, mother's employment status,
   distance from the nearest immunization site, and number of home visits
   from family-planning field workers.
   The findings point to the need to improve childhood immunization
   promotion and service delivery among slum populations. Two promising
   strategies for improving coverage are to reduce the number of missed
   opportunities for immunization promotion during encounters between
   health workers and clients, and to identify through visits to households
   those children who need additional immunizations. in the long run,
   increasing the educational level of women will provide a strong stimulus
   for improving childhood immunization coverage in the population.

AB Aron Gurwitsch's critique of Schutz's essay "The Stranger" is the
   starting point for this consideration of Schutz's relationship with
   phenomenology. This relationship is based on Schutz's emphasis on the
   value of the "average" as a phenomenological structure. In opposing
   sociology to philosophy, Gurwitsch takes this value as inferior in
   comparison with what he sees as cardinal issues of transcendental
   phenomenology. What Gurwitsch finds incompatible with phenomenological
   inquiry - the idea and practice of the natural attitude within the
   social sphere - Schutz turns into the core of his philosophy. "The
   phenomenology of the natural attitude" is as essentially philosophical
   as any reflectively practiced human science. The problem of how
   everydayness is constituted requires a phenomenological insight that
   leads the explorer - through reconstructing the meaning in terms of the
   mundane - straight to the origin.

AB The process of opinion formation leading to collective behavior in large
   groups is modeled with a probabilistic and statistical mechanical theory
   of micro-sociological behavior. By assuming that the probability of
   making a given decision is proportional to the number of people who have
   made the same decision, this theory of microinteractions predicts the
   manner in which individuals will respond to groups, how groups will
   respond to individuals, and how minorities and majorities will respond
   to each other. In particular, the theory accurately predicts
   observations of chivalry, tip sizes, conformity, and gawking in groups.
   Guided by intuition of social behavior and analogies with physical
   theories, social forces and social temperatures have also been
   introduced as concepts relevant to group interactions. These parameters
   significantly improve the theory's fit to empirical data.

   type of collective behavior observed in a group depends sensitively on
   the group's social temperature with consensus more likely at higher

   lower temperatures. An analytical derivation using a mean field
   approximation confirms this behavior and also identifies a critical
   social temperature (T(s)approximate to 1) above which organized
   collective behavior disappears. Using social forces as well as social

   The authors recruited 186 homeless, runaway and street youths using

   histories, current daily activities, and sexual and drug-related risk
   behaviors using qualitative and quantitative techniques. Youths reported
   high lifetime rates of injection drug use (45%), recent drug and alcohol
   use (100%), and current homelessness (84%). Injection drug using youths
   were more likely than noninjection drug using youths to report traumatic
   psychosocial histories, including parental substance use and forced
   institutionalization, use of alcohol and other noninjection drugs, a
   history of survival sex, and the use of squats or abandoned buildings as

   homicide reported a variety of motives for committing these acts. We
   also found that there were similarities and differences between the
   types, not only in terms of the kinds of motives reported but also in
   terms of the extent to which planning was involved. Likewise, there were
   similarities and differences between the different types of homicides
   regarding the type and amount of alcohol and other drugs used by

   on family primary socialization published in The Journal of Marriage and
   the Family and its predecessor, Family Living, from 1939 through 1989.
   Articles were analyzed according to the following paradigmatic
   dimensions: image of the subject matter, theory, methodology, purpose
   and object of study. Evidence is found for both pluralism and hegemony.
   Pluralism is evidenced from the competition between systems theory and
   symbolic interaction as dominating theoretical frameworks. A
   constraining hegemony in research on primary socialization was also
   identified as use of survey methods, basic purposes, focus on
   parent-child relationships and the adolescent stage of development.
   There was a conspicuous lack of concern with linkages of the family to
   other institutions involved in primary socialization, or with the
   development of goals, motivation, or cognitive ability. Funding sources
   appear to be contributing to this hegemony, possibly constraining the
   breadth of development in the field.

AB Genetic factors can interact with environmental factors to influence the

   such mechanisms: "genetic control of sensitivity to the environment,"
   and "genetic control of exposure to the environment." "Genetic control
   of sensitivity to the environment" suggests that genes, in part, render
   individuals relatively vulnerable or relatively invulnerable to the
   pathogenic effects of environmental stress. In support of this
   hypothesis, evidence is presented that the depressogenic effect of
   stressful life events is substantially greater in those at high versus
   low genetic risk to the MD. "Genetic control of exposure to the
   environment" suggests that genetic factors influence the probability
   that individuals will select themselves into high vs. low risk
   environments. In support of this hypothesis, evidence from a population
   based twin study suggests that certain classes of stressful life events
   are modestly heritable. The genetic risk factors for MD in part express
   themselves by influencing the probability that individuals will
   experience stressful life events, particularly of an interpersonal
   nature.

   disorder were randomly selected from the caseload of a community mental
   health center in Boulder, Colorado, and 70 were similarly selected from
   public psychiatric treatment services in and around Bologna, Italy.
   Subjects were interviewed with QOL and needs assessment instruments and
   rated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Objective QOL measures
   favored Bologna subjects over Boulder subjects, particularly with
   respect to employment, accommodation, and family life. In a factor
   analysis, objective QOL variables sorted separately from subjective
   satisfaction ratings, suggesting that they measure different underlying
   constructs. Patient needs in both Boulder and Bologna samples were
   primarily psychological and social rather than basic survival issues.
   Boulder subjects were more likely to report accommodation needs. Many
   apparent QOL advantages for Bologna subjects could be attributed to the
   greater frequency with which the Italian patients lived with family of
   origin, Living with family also appeared to confer practical benefits in
   meeting needs. Objective CL)OL measures discriminated between patient
   populations better than subjective ratings of satisfaction and
   well-being.

EP 26
PD 1998
PY 1998
AB The protection of habitat for an officially designated "threatened"
   species, the Northern Spotted Owl, is widely seen as having endangered
   the survival of a very different "species," namely the rural American
   logger. In spite of the widespread agreement on this point, however, it
   is not clear just how many jobs have been endangered, over just how long
   a period, due to the protection of spotted-owl habitat and of the
   environment more broadly. In the present paper, we analyze longer term
   employment trends in logging and milling, both nationally and in the two
   states of the Pacific Northwest where the spotted-owl debate has been
   most intense, to determine the length of time over which such
   environmental protection efforts have been creating the loss of logging
   and milling jobs. There are three potential key "turning points" since
   the start of high-quality employment data in 1947-the 1989 controversy
   over the federal "listing" of the Northern Spotted Owl under the
   Endangered Species Act, the earlier increase in environmental
   regulations accompanying the first Earth Day in 1970, and the
   still-earlier "locking up" of timber after the passage of the Wilderness
   Protection Act in 1964. We also examine the effects of two other
   variables that have received considerable attention in the ongoing
   debates-levels of U.S. Forest Service timber harvests and the exporting
   of raw logs. We find that the 1989 listing of the spotted owl has no
   significant effect on employment-not even in the two states where the
   debate has been most intense. Instead, the only statistically
   significant turning point came with the passage of the Wilderness Act in
   1964. The direction of the change, however, was precisely the opposite
   of what is generally expected. Both nationally and in the Pacific
   Northwest, the greatest decline in timber employment occurred from 1947
   until 1964-a time of great economic growth, a general absence of
   "unreasonable environmental regulations," and growing timber harvests.
   The period since the passage of the Wilderness Act has been one of
   increased complaints about environmental constraints, but much less
   decline in U.S. logging employment. If logging jobs have indeed been
   endangered by efforts to protect the environment in general and
   spotted-owl habitat in particular, what is needed is a plausible
   explanation of how the influence of the owls could have begun more than
   forty years before the species came under the protection of the
   Endangered Species Act.

AB This research incorporates the sociology of emotions into the study of
   parenting by examining the theoretical relationship between the mother
   identity and mothers' emotional response of jealousy to father-child
   interactions. Using identity theory, we predict that in response to
   father-child interactions, mothers with a more prominent mother identity
   will report the emotional experience of jealousy, and mothers with a
   more salient mother identity will report coping strategies designed to
   reduce the jealous experience. Since prominence captures the affective
   dimension of an identity, it should be tied to one's emotional response
   in a situation. Further, while salience captures the behavioral
   dimension of an identity, it should be related to the coping strategies
   which follow from and manage one's emotional response in a situation.
   The results confirm these expected relationships. We discuss not only
   how emotion may serve to maintain the mother identity, but also how
   mothers' emotion may unintentionally serve to maintain social structural
   arrangements with respect to parenting.

AB Law and legal forms now flow very rapidly around world society. This is
   difficult to understand if we take only a realist and "bottom-up" view
   of the law: local processes would engender internationalization only out
   of rather slowly evolving interaction and interdependence. But it is
   easy to understand if we add a more institutionalist view of the law-and
   the sovereignty of the modern state, with which it is now linked-as
   constructed out of a common and universalistic world cultural frame. In
   this paper, we develop such a view and show its implications. Modern
   legal systems, worldwide, rest on universalistic and rationalistic
   cultural assumptions about the natural and moral world outside of
   society. First, sovereignty is a peculiar claim: it is a claim to
   autonomous decision power, but under exogenous universal principles and
   addressed to an exogenous and often universal audience. Second, law,
   with remarkable uniformity, creates states which are "defined'' by and
   constituted from legally-assumed "societies." Emphasizing the dependence
   of the authority of modern law on universalistic cultural principles
   transcending specific societies call help explain distinctive features
   of modem legal systems: ii the rapid worldwide diffusion of rather
   standardized legal principles and arrangements; 2) the ritualistic
   character of the enactment and implementation of modem law; and 3) the
   widespread and expansive legal assumption of an integrated and
   rationalized nature and cosmos. To highlight these implications, we
   contrast the law with organizational rule-making at the other end of the
   spectrum: rule-making which is not very closely tied to universal
   principles tends to have a very different character.

AB Research indicates that some of the most important factors in promoting
   individual development and academic achievement for undergraduate
   students are student involvement, student integration, and high effort
   at academic tasks (e.g., Astin 1984; Kuh 1996; Pascarella and Terenzini
   1991; Terenzini and Wright 1987). Student involvement and integration
   are often measured by frequency of academic and social interactions with
   faculty members, participation in student organizations, integration
   into the major program, and participation in research projects. These
   experiences can be conceived of as part of the academic and professional
   socialization of students and often occur outside the traditional
   college classroom. In this paper, we discuss the importance of these
   out-of-class experiences and review the literature on outcomes of this
   "other" or "informal" curriculum. In addition, we argue, by sharing some
   data on academic and professional socialization from students, faculty
   members, and departments, that most departments do not adequately
   provide these beneficial opportunities. After a discussion of barriers
   to providing these experiences, we conclude with a call, and some
   suggestions, for increasing these important learning opportunities for
   our undergraduate students.

   skills in the context of a large "nonmethods" class in sociology. The
   experiment measured students' mastery of these skills by comparing their
   competence at quantitative reasoning at the beginning and end of the
   class term. The results revealed that students' abilities to interpret
   and manipulate empirical data increased significantly. Further, the
   increase occurred independent of students' basic reasoning skills as
   measured by baseline SAT verbal and math scores. This paper discusses
   the implications of these findings for teaching quantitative methods in
   sociology undergraduate curricula.

AB This article assesses the introduction of a computer laboratory
   experience using a popular statistical package into a behavioral science
   statistics class required of all sociology, psychology and business
   administration majors at a small, liberal arts college. The computer
   exercises were expected to improve student performance and student
   comprehension of the material presented in the course. A
   quasi-experimental design was used to compare student performance for a
   group of students prior to the introduction of the computer exercises
   with a similar group of students after the introduction of the computer
   exercises. Results indicate that the computer laboratory experience did
   not improve student performance or student comprehension of basic
   statistical concepts. This article suggests that computer skills are an
   important part of the sociology major and that the acquisition of
   computer skills should be regarded as a curriculum goal in and of itself
   rather than as a mechanism for improving knowledge of statistics or
   research methods.

AB The driving force behind the improvement in the quality of life, the
   rising standard of living, improving health, and increasing longevity,
   is a process called 'technophysio evolution', which began about 300
   years ago, accelerated during the twentieth century, and is still in
   progress. Increased spending on health care and on pensions is an
   appropriate concomitant of technophysio evolution, and should be
   welcomed. Only wasteful medical services should be restricted. The
   resources available now and in the future can provide increasingly long
   and healthy lives of relative luxury for all. However, methods of
   financing health care and retirement need to be modernized. In the
   future, luxury will be defined increasingly in terms of spiritual rather
   than material resources. The test of well-being in the future for both
   young and old will be measured increasingly in terms of the quality of
   health and the opportunity for self-realization.

AB As part of a World Health Organization collaborative study in 12 centres
   in developing and developed countries within defined urban and rural
   catchment areas with populations of 348786 and 103865, respectively, a
   total of 155 and 54 cases of first-onset schizophrenia, respectively,
   were identified over a 24-month period by a comprehensive and active
   recruitment of all cases. Approximately 50% of the subjects in both
   cohorts were in the age range of 15-24 years. There was a preponderance
   of males in the younger age group and of females in the older age group.
   The majority of cases had no family history and had shown good
   adjustment in childhood and adolescence. The onset was much more
   frequently acute and much less often insidious in our samples and (more
   so in the rural cohort), compared to the figure for all developed
   countries' sites. With regard to early manifestations of the disorder,
   there was a much higher incidence of loss of interest in appearance and
   cleanliness, being irritable and angry without reason, and loss of
   appetite, sleep or interest in sex in both of our samples, and of being
   excited or overactive for days or weeks in our rural cohort than in the
   developed countries' centres as a whole. On the other hand, claiming
   impossible things, behaving as if hearing voices and feeling persecuted,
   harmed or bewitched were much less frequent in our rural cohort than in
   the urban cohort or the developed countries' centres as a whole. With
   regard to the clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid,
   hebephrenic/disorganized and residual types were under-represented in
   our samples (more so in the rural sample), and catatonic type and acute
   schizophrenic episode were over-represented compared to the developed
   countries' centres. Moreover, the proportion of subjects of CATEGO class
   S+ was lower in our samples. With regard to onset, early manifestations
   and clinical subtypes of schizophrenia, our rural cohort deviated most
   from developed countries' centres as a whole, with our urban sample
   falling in between, thus indicating the role of socio-cultural factors
   in general, and urbanization in particular, in these variables in
   schizophrenia.

AB The classics of postwar political sociology argued that a key to
   understanding political divisions in democratic polities lies with
   membership in social groups. Much recent scholarship, however, has
   argued that political cleavages arising out of social group memberships
   have declined. This study investigates these claims, analyzing the
   magnitude of and interrelationship among four major social
   cleavages-race, religion, class, and gender-in U.S. presidential
   elections since 1960. We improve over dichotomous measures of religion
   and class and introduce statistical models that permit measurement of
   relative shifts in the vote choice of the core groups making up each
   cleavage. Our results do not support claims about the declining
   magnitude of social cleavages. The race cleavage has increased
   considerably since 1960, and the gender cleavage more modestly during
   this period, while the class cleavage has remained stable, and the
   religion cleavage has declined slightly. We find evidence of a slight
   increase in social group cleavages in presidential elections from 1960
   through 1992. Net of change in the race cleavage, the overall social
   cleavage has been stable during this period.

   and how it relates to students' sexual profiles. Among the men, some
   traditional social class differences are found, indicating that class
   differences persist among some upwardly mobile men. For the women, fewer
   social class differences appear. Further, we compare our 1992 sample of
   554 college students, 19-22 years old, with a university sample of 904
   similar age students from 1967, and find our sample more coitally
   experienced. College students today are following norms that in the past
   were associated with a lower educational level. Implications of our
   findings for class convergence theory are addressed. Reliable birth
   control, gains in equality by women, and the sexual images of television
   and other media are discussed as major factors contributing to the
   increased sexual permissiveness among university students of the 1990s.

AB Martin Offenbacher's statistical study comparing the school enrollment
   of German Protestants to Catholics plays a significant role in the
   articulation of the Weber and Merton theses. The current study provides
   an overdue correction of obvious flaws in Offenbacher's data. There
   follows a subsequent reassessment of that recalculated data indicating a
   now diminished difference between Catholic and Protestant school
   'preference.' Any remaining disparity between the denominations' school
   'choice' is seen here as attributable to operative practical factors as
   opposed to Weber's and Merton's long-standing attribution to differing
   religious values. The paper argues more generally that the theoretical
   appeal enjoyed by the conceptually linked Weber and Merton theses in
   sociology may have invited the all too facile acceptance of idealist
   interpretation at the expense of practical factors in explanations for
   discrete denominational behaviors.

   first stage in this model: receiving skills, As expected, schizophrenic
   subjects (N = 29) were less skillful than normal subjects (N = 15) on
   measures of social problem solving, understanding of social sequences,
   and social judgment, In addition, performance on these tasks was
   significantly related to nonverbal social perception, but only for the

   related to other measures of social functioning in schizophrenia.
   Implications of these findings for understanding and treating social

AB THE results of three studies of affect recognition in schizophrenia, all
   using the same measures (the Face Emotion Identification Test, the Face
   Emotion Discrimination Test, and the Test of Facial Recognition), are
   reviewed. The studies differed on two important subject characteristics:
   patient chronicity and medication status. One study examined chronically
   ill, unmedicated patients (Kerr and Neale 1993); a second study included
   chronically ill, medicated patients (Mueser et al. 1996); and a third
   study examined acutely ill, medicated patients (Bellack, Blanchard and
   Mueser 1996). Results across the three studies suggest that chronicity
   of the illness, but not medication status, was related to poor
   performance on the affect recognition tests. Furthermore, chronically
   ill patients tended to perform poorly on the control task (the Test of
   Facial Recognition) as well as the affect perception tasks, suggesting a
   generalized impairment in facial perception. The implications of the
   findings for research on social perception are considered, as well as
   for interventions designed to improve social competence in
   schizophrenia.

AB THIS article summarizes a series of studies conducted by our group that
   examined the social perceptual deficits of schizophrenia. Research
   suggested that social perceptual deficits are more pronounced in
   patients with nonparanoid schizophrenia than comparison groups
   comprising normal controls or individuals with paranoid schizophrenia.
   The social perceptual deficits of schizophrenia were affected by the
   level of abstraction of cue descriptors; the level of emotional arousal
   engendered by the situation; the presence of extraneous, emotionally
   arousing stimuli; and the familiarity of the situation. These deficits
   were not found in standardization and cross-validation samples of normal
   controls, suggesting that these differential deficits represent a
   characteristic of the disorder rather than a psychometric confound.
   Social perceptual deficits in schizophrenia were significantly
   associated with verbal recall memory and relatively unrelated to visual
   vigilance, These latter findings were used in a study on rehabilitation
   of cue perception which showed that memory rehabilitation significantly
   improved cue perception whereas attention focusing strategies had no
   appreciable effects.

AB THE relatively recent emergence of studies of social cognition in
   schizophrenia represents an important development in efforts to better
   understand the behavioral difficulties exhibited by schizophrenia
   patients. In this discussion each of the four key articles in this issue
   is briefly reviewed in order to highlight its major contributions and to
   emphasize relevant methodological and conceptual issues within the
   field. It is argued that although these four papers, and the larger body
   of work they represent, make significant contributions, the field of
   social cognition in schizophrenia as a whole could benefit from
   integrating insights from the normal social cognition literature, data
   on social-and emotional-processing deficits in neurological populations,
   and newer models of information processing. Following the review of the
   four papers, several key issues central to the continued advancement of
   this research area will be discussed, including the need to (a) move
   from linear to nonlinear models of social cognition in schizophrenia;
   (b) explore those aspects of social cognition that are responses to
   experience, as opposed to focusing solely on social cognition as a
   causal factor in behavior; (c) consider the role of affective and
   neuropsychological factors in social cognition; and (d) explore aspects
   of social cognition in schizophrenia other than those involving problem
   solving. In addition, the implications of research on social cognition
   for the development of social skills rehabilitation interventions are
   discussed.

AB Data on the themes of international environmental treaties from 1870 to
   1990 are used to demonstrate an historical shift in the definition of
   "nature" from resource to life-sustaining global ecosystem. This newer
   scientific model increased nature's relevance to world society, and thus
   catalyzed an exponential rise in international discourse and activity
   concerning the environment. The effect is evident in event-history
   analyses of the rate at which international environmental treaties were
   formed during the period 1870-1990. Two organizational changes also
   played a role in the proliferation of international environmental
   treaties: the overall structuration of the world polity had a positive
   effect, and the consolidation of an official intergovernmental
   environmental domain had a negative effect, even with the effects of
   population growth and industrial degradation held constant.

AB Evolutionary biologists seek to understand human behavior by postulating
   that many of our current social behaviors and emotions represent
   heritable adaptations that were selectively advantageous during our
   ancestral (pre-agricultural, preindustrial) human environment. Studies
   of animal species that live in societies structured similarly to those
   of our ancestors (i.e. in multi-generational family groups) may thus
   provide insights into the genetically influenced behavioral
   predispositions that may be present in ourselves.
   The evolutionary approach argues that family groupings have a biological
   basis. They form under particular ecological and demographic conditions
   when the reproduction of individuals is enhanced by prolonging the
   association between parents and young. Because families are comprised of
   close genetic relatives, a high degree of cooperation is expected
   between their members. Conflict is also expected, however because the
   reproductive interests of parents, offspring, and other family members
   are rarely identical Such conflicts are intensified in reconstituted
   (step) families because replacement mates (stepparents) are unrelated to
   offspring of the previous pairing, and errant offspring are less related
   to future young of the new pairing.
   I develop a set of predictions specifying when, where, and between whom
   conflict is expected in reconstituted family environments. After briefly
   documenting the robustness of this approach in explaining the behavior
   of non-human species, I examine its value for interpreting patterns of
   behavior in human stepfamilies.
   I suggest that much of the increased conflict seen in modem human
   families is due to the recent surge in numbers of stepfamily households.
   Increased understanding of our behavioral predispositions can help us to
   design better conflict resolution strategies for human families in
   crisis I offer a five point program for incorporating such knowledge
   into family counselling.
   The evolutionary perspective does not challenge or contradict the
   intellectual frameworks of sociology or psychology. Rather it seeks
   explanations for human behavior at a different level of analysis. In
   doing so it provides additional information of a new dimension which
   should lead to a better understanding of the types and frequencies of
   human family dysfunction.

AB This paper analyzes the impact of managerial social status on the
   normative evaluation of managerial acts in organizational contexts. We
   test several propositions on the relationship between social status and
   normative;evaluation derived from Donald Black's theoretical framework
   on social control. The research design consists of a factorial survey of
   200 managers. Each respondent evaluated the seriousness of a normatively
   questionable managerial act. In each vignette, the perpetrator's social
   status was systematically manipulated in either a high or a low
   condition. The results generally support the argument that the higher a
   manager's social status the less vulnerable that individual is to
   unfavorable normative evaluations, holding constant the act. The paper
   closes with discussion of our findings in light of social structural and
   rational choice perspectives on informal social control in
   organizations. Additionally, we discuss methodological issues related to
   experimental research on informal social control in organizations, the
   consistency of our findings with those from previous studies of social
   control across diverse settings, potential;theoretical applications and
   extensions of Black's framework in organizational contexts, and
   practical implications for the implementation of corporate codes of

   and solidarity are maintained in an urbanized industrialized,

   issues of(1) the persistence of territorially based affective ties and
   primary relations in an urban world and (2) the micro/macro links
   connecting community residents and the larger society. This article
   argues that social bonds and solidarity are now transformed from
   affective ties into more diffuse relationships as individuals
   purposively use the externally shared meanings of housing and community
   in American society to situate themselves, simultaneously locating
   themselves with others who share their values and preferences and
   asserting their social status and social identity to others.

AB Although it is evident in his work from the beginning, Durkheim's
   epistemological argument did not appear in its completed form until the
   1912 publication of The Elementary Forms of the Religions Life. There
   Durkheim outlined a theory of enacted social practice as the foundation
   for an epistemology. Yet neither Durkheim's contribution to a theory of
   social practice nor his epistemological argument have been recognized as
   such. The early critics played a pivotal role in creating and
   perpetuating this misunderstanding. The first highly negative wave of
   criticism in English, which treated Durkheim's arguments as naive,
   inadequate philosophy, appeared between 1915 and 1924. Inadequate as
   these initial criticisms were, citations show that they have been
   heavily relied upon. On these critics' authority, scholars rejected
   Durkheim's epistemology altogether, focusing instead on his sociology of
   knowledge and sociology of religion.

   the interaction was negative. In contrast, the longitudinal analyses did
   not provide strong support for our interactive model. Personality
   variables were significant predictors longitudinally, but in only one
   analysis did an environment variable significantly predict problem
   drinking. Furthermore, none of the interactions was significant
   predictors over time. Overall, the findings suggest that social learning
   models based on the interaction of personality and environmental
   influences may be more appropriate for predicting concurrent, as opposed
   to future problems, and that Mure research should include
   person-environment interactions. In addition, cultural tolerance of
   heavy drinking may be an important determinant of the role of
   psychological vulnerability in the development of problem drinking.

AB A number of brief screening instruments to identify alcohol dependence
   exist, but the validity of these instruments across ethnic groups or
   regions of the country is not well established. The sensitivity and
   specificity of a number of standard screening instruments (CAGE, brief
   MAST, AUDIT, TWEAK, and RAPS), as well as other measures (History of
   Trauma Scale, breathalyzer reading, self-reported drinking before the
   event, and consuming five or more drinks at a sitting at least monthly)
   are compared against ICD-10 and DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence
   between probability samples of Black and White emergency roam patients
   in Santa Clara County, CA (n = 716) and in Jackson, MS (n = 1330).
   Variability in the sensitivity of screening instruments among current
   drinkers was found to be greater between samples for both Blacks and
   Whites, than for Blacks compared with Whites within the same sample. The
   AUDIT, TWEAK, and RAPS seemed to perform well by gender and injury
   status for both Blacks and Whites in the two samples, and no significant
   differences were found in the performance of these instruments across
   sample sites. To evaluate the influence of regional differences in
   alcohol dependence an differences found in the performance of screening
   instruments, using logistic regression with the simultaneous entry of
   demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, injury status, and site)
   and drinking variables (breathalyzer reading, self-reported drinking
   before the event, and drinking five or. more drinks at a sitting at
   least monthly) to predict alcohol dependence in a merged sample of these
   patients (Jackson vs. Santa Clara) site was not found to be significant.
   Data suggest that, whereas region of the country may not be important in
   predicting alcohol dependence in emergency room populations, regional
   differences in the performance of screening instruments for alcohol
   dependence may exist, even when ethnicity is taken into account. Given
   distinct regional differences in drinking patterns and problems in the
   U.S., further research on commonly used screening instruments is needed
   to determine those screeners most efficient for identifying problem
   drinking.

AB Medical policy-makers have concluded that stress from wartime trauma and

   symptoms observed in US veterans who served in the Persian Gulf War, The
   author reviewed scientific articles from peer-reviewed journals
   referenced in the final report of the Presidential Advisory Committee on
   Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses and conducted a MEDLINE literature search,
   All reported prevalence rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
   in Gulf War veterans were defined by critical cutpoints on psychometric
   scales constructed by summing veterans' responses on standardized
   symptom questionnaires rather than by clinical psychiatric interviews,
   Observed PTSD rates varied from 0% to 36% (mean, 9%), Correcting for
   measurement errors with previously determined values of the sensitivity
   (range 0.77 to 0.96) and specificity (range 0.62 to 0.89) of the
   psychometric tests yielded estimated true PTSD rates of 0% for 18 of the
   20 reported rates, Mean scores on the Mississippi PTSD scale in all
   subgroups of Gulf War veterans were within the range of values for
   well-adjusted Vietnam veterans (50-89) and far below that of Vietnam
   veterans with psychiatrically confirmed PTSD (120-140). Most PTSD and
   ''stress-related symptoms'' reported in studies of Gulf War Veterans
   appear to represent false-positive errors of measurement reflecting
   nonspecific symptoms of other conditions.

AB This article empirically examines contextually conditioned construction
   of symbolic resources during political debate over the 1969 revised
   Philadelphia Plan-a crucial moment in the shaping of federal equal
   employment law. Tying together political sociology's concept of policy
   feedback with legal and cultural sociology's concept of culture as a
   resource, the article explains how actors who were hampered by the
   explicit language used to embed equal opportunity values into law turned
   apparent constraint into an opportunity to transform law. The article
   simultaneously illuminates an underdeveloped aspect of equal employment
   law's unfolding and builds more general theory to help explain how law's
   language, general cultural values expressed in law, and alternative
   methods used to interpret law mediate the effects of past law on future
   law. Defining concepts of value centrality and explicitness of legal
   language, the article uses its case study to suggest hypotheses about
   how variation in centrality of cultural values and explicitness of
   language used to incorporate these values into law affect variation in
   mobilization of different types of cultural strategies by actors
   struggling over law interpretation and enforcement.

   pooled from two samples numbering more than 450 respondents. Internal
   analyses established that the DEP5 had adequate internal reliability and
   stability over 2 years. Furthermore, confirmatory factor analyses
   indicated that the DEP5 measured depressive reactions as distinct from

AB Objective: The purpose of this research was to determine whether risk
   factors for a maltreatment report in the first year of life, especially
   the interaction of life event stress and social support, persist into
   the second and third years of life.
   Method: Predominantly low income mothers who had been interviewed
   shortly after the birth of infants in a longitudinal cohort were
   re-interviewed around the infants' first birthdays, and reports to North
   Carolina's Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect were tracked for
   substantiated maltreatment reports.
   Results: Variables significantly associated with a substantiated
   maltreatment report in the second or third year of life (p < .01) were
   first year maltreatment reports and participation in Medicaid. Three
   interactions between a stressful life event indicator variable and a
   social support indicator variable were significant predictors of
   substantiated second or third year reports (p < .05).
   Conclusions: Even in the presence of significant risk factors from the
   first year of life, life event stress can increase the risk of a
   substantiated maltreatment report in the second or third years of life,
   but social support may moderate the effect of life events. (C) 1997

AB Objective: To identify perinatal factors that are predictive of
   disruption in primary caregiving among infants of substance abusing
   women.
   Method: A randomized longitudinal cohort study. One hundred and fifty
   two mother/infant dyads were assessed for evidence of disruption of
   primary caregiving or neglect during the first 18 months of life,
   defined by mother's inability to provide care. Data analyzed included
   neonatal characteristics, urine toxicology at delivery, maternal history
   of drug use, maternal depression, social support, and social and health
   history.
   Results: Sixty-six infants (43.4%) had disruption in their primary care
   during the first 18 months of their life, 86 infants (56.6%) remained in
   the care of their mothers. Women who were younger, were heroin users,
   had two or more children, had other children in foster care, and
   reported depressive symptoms were least likely to provide ongoing
   primary care for their infant.
   Conclusions: Although all infants born to substance abusing women are at
   a high risk for disruption in the continuity of their primary
   caregiving, maternal demographic and psychosocial factors present at
   delivery can predict which infants are likely to experience an early
   disruption in their primary caregiving. Identifying these families can
   enable health care providers to monitor them more closely and, when
   appropriate, encourage support from the extended family. (C) 1997

AB Objectives: The article constructed an integrated conceptual framework
   for understanding child physical abuse based on a content analysis of
   different theories. Three major determinants of physical abuse were
   identified: exposure to aggression, exposure to stressors, and access to
   resources. To test the framework, we included variables from all three
   major categories in the analyses.
   Methodology: Data from a case-comparison study that included 81
   physically abusive and 148 nonabusive mothers was used. Logistic
   regression determined the relative importance of the predictors.
   Results: The probability of child physical abuse varied in the expected
   direction with the number of emotional resources received (listening,
   help with decision-making, companionship), the number of stressors
   experienced, and the mothers exposure to physical abuse by their own
   mothers, current partners, and former partners. The estimation results
   showed that exposure to aggression in one's own childhood (abused by
   one's own mother) and exposure to domestic violence in one's adult life
   (abused by one's previous and current partners) were the most potent
   factors for predicting whether a mother physically abused her child.
   Conclusion: The results suggest further research on the
   interdependencies between domestic violence and child physical abuse.

AB Objective: While child sexual abuse and its negative effects have been
   of increasing interest to researchers and practitioners, more empirical
   focus has been given to measuring mental health consequences rather than
   other areas of life functioning such as parenting. Furthermore, recent
   questions have been raised about whether documented negative effects of
   abuse stem from the abuse itself or the more general negative family
   environment which often accompanies it. The aim of the current study was
   to examine the impact of a history of child sexual abuse and more
   general family relationship quality on the parenting of a sample of
   low-income mothers.
   Method: The current study was a secondary analysis of archived data
   collected by Zuravin (1996) on 518 low-income mothers. Parenting was
   assessed using measures such as frequency of worry about child problems,
   views of self as a parent, and how child discipline problems were
   handled.
   Results: Child sexual abuse was associated with more negative views of
   self as a parent and the greater use of physical punishment strategies
   even after accounting for differences in family-of-origin relationship
   quality.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that sexual abuse may be a risk
   factor for more negative views of self as a parent beyond differences
   between abused and nonabused samples in more general assessments of
   family-of-origin quality. Implications for future research and
   intervention are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   in combination with high war zone stress was associated with the highest
   levels of PTSD and psychopathology. This is consistent with Israeli

   long-term effects on psychological well-being. In contrast, homecoming
   support was related negatively as a direct effect to both PTSD and other

   group developed PTSD symptoms in anticipation of deployment to the
   Persian Gulf Those soldiers with prior Vietnam service had statistically
   significant odds ratios for PTSD (between about 5 and 24) compared with
   soldiers without Vietnam service. These findings indicate that for some

   sufficient to exacerbate symptoms or provoke a new episode of PTSD and
   this risk is substantially greater than that for soldiers without such

AB Approximately 250,000 Vietnam veterans suffered cerebral malaria, an
   illness that often results in damage to subcortical white matter and
   fronto-temporal areas of neocortex. Case reports dating back 2500 years
   indicate that survivors of cerebral malaria show depression, poor
   memory, personality change, and irritability/violence. The purpose of
   the present study was to compare the neuropsychiatric status of Vietnam
   veterans who had suffered cerebral malaria in the remote past (i.e.,
   1966 to 1969) with that of Vietnam veterans wounded in combat who had
   not suffered malaria or other neurological conditions. Findings indicate
   that cerebral malaria results in multiple, major, substantially
   underappreciated neuropsychiatric symptoms in Vietnam veterans,
   including poor dichotic listening, ''personality change,'' depression,
   and, in some cases, partial seizure-like symptoms. Findings strongly
   suggest that history of malaria should be considered in any medical,
   psychological, or psychiatric workup of a Vietnam War veteran because a
   positive response could result in substantial changes in diagnosis and
   treatment.

   may have special concerns that may have to be addressed by the
   investigators prior to initiation of the study. Concerns may include the

   programs, Such concerns require culturally sensitive strategies which
   may include trust-building and the provision of ancillary services,

AB For Weberian Marxists, the social theories of Max Weber and Karl Marx
   are complementary, contributions to the analysis of modern capitalist
   society. Combining Weber's theory of rationalization with Marx's
   critique of commodity fetishism to develop his own critique of
   reification, Georg Lukacs contended that the combination of Marx's and
   Weber's social theories is essential to envisioning socially
   transformative modes of praxis in advanced capitalist society. By
   comparing Lukacs's theory of reification with Habermas's theory of
   communicative action as two theories in the tradition of Weberian
   Marxism, I show how the prevailing mode of "doing theory" has shifted
   from Marx's critique of economic deter terminism to Weber's idea of the
   inner logic of social value spheres. Today, Weberian Marxism can make an
   important contribution to theoretical sociology by reconstituting itself
   as a framework for critically examining prevailing societal definitions
   of the rationalization imperatives specific to purposive-rational social
   value spheres (the economy, the administrative state, etc.). In a second
   step, Weberian Marxists would explore how these value spheres relate to
   Each other and to value spheres that are open to the type of
   communicative rationalization characteristic of the lifeworld level of
   social organization.

AB The process is traced whereby crucially important, multiple denotations
   of classical sociology's key notion referring to social position-the
   Weberian German concept of Stand-have been stripped to create a
   simplified and inaccurate representation of social inequalities. Some
   historical material from central Europe is surveyed, with a brief look
   at Japan, to demonstrate validity problems created by blanket
   application of the culturally specific, streamlined notions of
   status/class. As an alternative, a notion of contingent social closure
   argues that relaxing the modernizationist assumptions of a single
   transition from estate to status/class increases the
   comparative-historical sensitivity of research on social structure,
   inequality, and stratification. A dynamic reading of Polanyi suggests a
   reconceptualization of institutions as the "raw material" of social
   change. This might help to avoid the outdated contrast of the "West" vs.
   its "Others".

AB Background. This study examined the relationship between depressive
   symptoms and polydrug use (alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine) among blacks
   in a high-risk community.
   Methods, A street sample (N = 570) from four high-risk communities in
   Birmingham, Alabama, was collected through personal interviews.
   Interviewers asked respondents about their drug use behavior during the
   past 30 days, as well as about their depressive symptoms during the past
   week.
   Results. Odds ratios and logistic regressions, adjusted for age and sex,
   were used to assess the relationship between depressive symptoms and
   drug and polydrug use (drug use involving cocaine). Results showed that
   depressive symptoms are significantly associated with polydrug use.
   However, depressive symptoms were not associated with alcohol use or
   with the combination of alcohol and marijuana use.
   Conclusions. Depressive symptoms are related to polydrug use involving
   cocaine, though the causal relationship is uncertain. Previous reports
   on depressive symptoms and alcohol or marijuana may be inconclusive.

AB This paper analyses the effect of income and education on life
   expectancy and mortality rates among the elderly in 33 countries for the
   period 1960-92 and assesses how that relationship has changed over time
   as a result of technical progress. Our outcome variables are life
   expectancy at age 60 and the probability of dying between age 60 and age
   so for both males and females. The data are from vital-registration
   based life tables published by national statistical offices for several
   years during this period. We estimate regressions with determinants that
   include GDP per capita (adjusted for purchasing power), education and
   time (as a proxy for technical progress). As the available measure of
   education failed to account for variation in life expectancy or
   mortality at age 60, our reported analyses focus on a simplified model
   with only income and time as predictors. The results indicate that,
   controlling for income, mortality rates among the elderly have declined
   considerably over the past three decades. We also find that poverty (as
   measured by low average income levels) explains some of the Variation in
   both life expectancy at age 60 and mortality rates among the elderly
   across the countries in the sample. The explained amount of variation is
   more substantial for females than for males. While poverty does
   adversely affect mortality rates among the elderly (and the strength of
   this effect is estimated to be increasing over lime), technical progress
   appears far more important in the period following Igbo. Predicted
   female life expectancy (at age 60) in 1960 at the mean income level in
   1960 was, for example 18.8 years; income growth to 1992 increased this
   by an estimated 0.7 years, whereas technical progress increased it by
   2.0 years.
   We then use the estimated regression results to compare country
   performance on life expectancy of the elderly, controlling for levels of
   poverty (or income), and to assess how performance has varied over time.
   High performing countries, on female life expectancy at age bo, for the
   period around 1990, included Chile (1.0 years longer life expectancy),
   China (1.7 years longer), France (2.0 years longer), Japan (1.9 years
   longer), and Switzerland (1.3 years longer). Poorly performing countries
   included Denmark (1.1 years shorter life expectancy than predicted from
   income), Hungary (1.4 years shorter), Iceland (1.2 years shorter),
   Malaysia (1.6 years shorter), and Trinidad and Tobago (3.9 years
   shorter). Chile and Switzerland registered major improvements in
   relative performance over this period; Norway, Taiwan and the USA, in
   contrast showed major declines in performance between 1980 and the early
   1990s.

AB Objectives. This study examines : the impact of the condom availability
   program in New York City public high schools by comparing rates of
   sexual activity and condom use for New York students and similar
   students in Chicago.
   Methods. A total of 7119 students from 12 randomly selected New York
   schools and 5738 students from 10 Chicago schools participated in a
   cross-sectional survey.
   Results. New York students, compared with Chicago students, reported
   equal rates of sexual activity but higher rates of condom use at last
   intercourse (odds ratio [OR] = 1.36). For higher-risk students (those
   with three or more sexual partners in the past 6 months), condom use was
   greater in New York (OR = 1.85) than in Chicago.
   Conclusions. Condom availability has a modest but significant effect on
   condom use and does not increase rates of sexual activity. These
   findings suggest that school-based condom availability can lower the
   risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases for urban teenagers
   in the United States.

AB Objectives. Four occupation-based measures were used to derive estimates
   of social position's effect on all-cause mortality among men and women
   in a large national cohort.
   Methods. The National Longitudinal Mortality Study provided information
   on principal occupation and 9-year follow-up for 229 851 persons aged 25
   through 64 years. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate
   the age-adjusted risk of death relative to six ordinal categories of
   social position. The Slope Index of Inequality described average change
   in death rates across categories.
   Results. Risk of death was consistently elevated among persons at lower
   positions in the social hierarchy. Estimates comparing lowest with
   highest categories varied within a narrow range (1.47-1.92 for men and
   1.23-1.55 for women). However, several discrepancies among analyses were
   noted. The analysis by US census groups revealed nonlinear associations,
   whereas those using other scales found incremental increases in risk.
   Effect modification by sex was observed for analyses by two of the four
   measures. Race/ethnicity did not modify the underlying association
   between variables.
   Conclusions. Our analysis complements previous findings and sup ports,
   with few qualifications, the interchangeability of occupation-based
   measures of social position in mortality studies. Explanations for why
   relative risk estimates were modified by sex are offered.

AB Objectives. Recent studies have demonstrated that income inequality is
   related to mortality rates. It was hypothesized, in this study,that
   income inequality is related to reduction in social cohesion and that
   disinvestment in social capital is in turn associated with increased
   mortality.
   Methods. In this cross-sectional ecologic study based on data from 39
   states, social capital was measured by weighted responses to two items
   from the General Social Survey: per capita density of membership in
   voluntary groups in each state and level of social trust, as gauged by
   the proportion of residents in each state who believed that people could
   be trusted. Age-standardized total and Cause-specific mortality rates in
   1990 were obtained for each state.
   Results. Income inequality was strongly correlated with both per capita
   group membership (r = -.46) and lack of social trust (r = .76). In turn,
   both social trust and group membership were associated with total
   mortality, as well as rates of death from coronary heart disease,
   malignant neoplasms, and infant mortality.
   Conclusions. These data support the notion:that income inequality leads
   to increased mortality via disinvestment in social capital.

   predictor. Mental ability did not account for the education effect.
   Conclusions. Higher education's association with a lower rate of

   more-educated women have for higher-status employment and its
   health-related benefits. Measures of women's own occupational status

AB The purpose of this study is to determine how children's health

   The study is based on data from over 7,000 children born to once-married
   mothers identified in the 1988 Child Health Supplement to the National
   Health Interview Survey. The effects of 15 childhood health conditions
   on the mothers' risk of divorce are estimated with Cox's proportional
   hazard models. Controlling for demographic, marital, and reproductive
   measures, we find that mothers' prospects for divorce are affected both
   positively or negatively by their children's health status, depending on
   the type of childhood condition and, in the case of low birth weight
   children, timing within the marriage. Women whose children have
   congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy, are blind, or had low birth
   weight appear to have higher risks of marital disruption than mothers of
   healthy children. In contrast, mothers whose children have migraines,
   learning disabilities, respiratory allergies, missing/deformed digits or
   limbs, or asthma have somewhat lower rates of divorce.

AB In this paper we examine the effects of socioeconomic development, the
   status of women, and family planning on fertility and the extent to
   which these effects vary among the nineteen districts of Bangladesh. The
   1983 and 1991 Bangladesh Contraceptive Prevalence Survey data are used
   to examine the effects of these factors on differences in contraceptive
   use among currently married women aged 15-49. The proportion of
   currently married women aged 15-49 using contraception was 46.3 per cent
   in 1991, a considerable increase from 26.5 per cent in 1983.
   Contraceptive use rates for all the districts increased substantially
   over the period between 1983 and 1991 and the gap between Dhaka's rate
   and those of other districts was narrower in 1991 than in 1983. An
   analytical model composed of socioeconomic development, status of women,
   and family planning variables is tested using logistic regression. The
   legit model is used to evaluate the effects of a selected group of
   variables on the probability of using contraceptive methods. The
   analysis demonstrates clearly that socioeconomic development and women's
   status significantly impact the use of contraceptive methods in
   Bangladesh. The results also suggest that better-educated, employed
   women are more likely to use contraception than those who have little or
   no formal education and who are not employed. In 1983, rural-urban
   differences in contraceptive use were significant, but in 1991 area of
   residence was not significant, which suggests that family planning
   programs may have played an important role in providing contraceptive
   information and technology to rural areas. Our analysis also suggests
   that family planning programs operated more efficiently in some
   districts than in others, and regional differences remained important in
   1991 as they were in 1983. Decomposition analysis suggests that shifts
   in population structure favored increased contraceptive use in
   Bangladesh. This analysis also indicates that change in rate is also
   important, contributing about 21 per cent of the overall increase in
   contraceptive use.

PY 1997
AB In the United States, national health status data pertaining to Asian
   and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are rarely disaggregated. By
   aggregating API data, however, the poor health status of some API groups
   is often masked by the favorable health status of others. The purpose of
   this paper is two-fold: (1) to compare mortality rates of the five major
   ethnic groups in Hawaii (Caucasians, Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, and
   Hawaiians) and (2) to explore methodological issues related to
   comparative studies of API health indicators. Standardized and
   age-specific mortality rates and 95 per cent confidence intervals for
   major causes of death were estimated for 1990 based on Hawaii vital
   records and population data. In general, death rates were highest for
   Hawaiians and lowest for Japanese and Chinese, illustrating the
   importance of API data disaggregation and suggesting that special
   attention be paid to improving the health of Hawaiians.
   Methodologically, the study demonstrated that, while some compromises in
   analysis are required, legitimate comparisons across API groups can be
   made if data sets are available.

AB Assortative mating results both from social homogamy (coming for similar
   environments) and active phenotypic assortment (seeking a mate with
   desired attributes). Dating advertisements provide a means of assessing
   the role of active phenotypic assortment in the absence of social
   homogamy. The relative frequency of mention of different attributes
   (given limited advertising space) is informative regarding the salience
   of these attributes in active phenotypic assortment. Sex differences in
   self descriptions and in attributes desired in others in dating
   advertisements provide a means of evaluating sociobiological issues.
   Data were analyzed from 191 ads placed by females and 253 ads placed by
   males seeking to meet members of the opposite sex. The most frequently
   mentioned attributes are age, race, occupation, moral characteristics,
   and physical attractiveness. While close to 80 per cent of the
   advertisers provided information concerning their own race/ethnicity,
   only a minority of those providing such information limited their quest
   for a partner to members of their own race/ethnicity. There is
   substantial assortative mating for religion, family background, status,
   and educational attainment, yet these attributes are rarely (religion
   and education) or never (family background) mentioned in advertisements,
   suggesting that assortative mating on these dimensions may be solely a
   consequence of social homogamy.

EP 275
PD FAL-WIN 1997
PY 1997
AB The phenomenon of circumcision may well serve a range of religious and
   symbolic functions. In addition to these conceptual categories, we argue
   that circumcision also serves a more mundane, practical function of
   lowering excitability and distractibility quotients-sexual arousal - of
   pubescent males, i.e., biasing young males more toward increased
   tractability which would enhance group efforts and less toward
   individual goals of amorous exchanges. Neurological data suggest that
   early lesions of the prepuce/foreskin tissues would generate a
   re-organization/atrophy of the brain circuitry. This
   re-organization/atrophy, in turn, is suggested to lower sexual
   excitability. Epithelial data indicate that keratinization of the more
   exposed glans penis would lower the sensibility, hence sexual
   excitability, of the circumcised male's genitalia. In addition,
   circumcision removes the foreskin-prepuce which, by secreting smegma,
   would also minimize any pheromonic qualities which the smegma may
   generate. Inferential data support the hypothesis that a practical
   consequence of circumcision, complementary to any religious-symbolic
   function, is to make a circumcised male less sexually excitable and
   distractible, and, hence, more amenable to his group's authority
   figures.

AB Recent analyses of the cultural dimensions of protest have gone some
   distance in correcting the structuralist and instrumentalist biases of
   early resource mobilization and political process models. They remain
   limited, however. by their retention of dichotomous conceptions of
   culture and structure in the emergence of protest, of cultural and
   instrumental orientations in ongoing collective action, and of cultural
   and political targets of protest. As a result, they have neglected,
   respectively, continuities between structured inequalities and the
   movement challenges that are made to them, the cultural shaping of
   instrumentally rational decisionmaking, and the strategic possibilities
   that lay in cultural challenge made within the sphere of institutional
   politics. I draw on recent theorizing in the sociology of culture and on
   several case studies of collective action in order to highlight these
   lacunae and to propose analytical alternatives.

AB Theories in sociology and other social sciences often postulate
   reciprocal causal relationships. Yamaguchi advaced a model for the
   interdependence of two discrete-time, discrete-state endogenous
   processes. The Yamaguchi model is introduced with a discussion of its
   advantages over conventional methods and a comparison with recently
   developed relevant models To overcome the obstacle that existing
   statistical software cannot directly estimate the Yamaguchi model the
   author has developed a method that converts estimated parameters from
   standard multinomial logit estimation into parameters of the Yamaguchi
   model. This method makes it possible and easier for researchers to
   estimate the Yamaguchi model using standard statistical software and a
   simple programming of linear transformation. The method is simple and
   straightforward and thus merits application to an analysis of
   interdependence with panel darn. This article also provides a detailed
   empirical example to illustrate an application of the method.

AB The social network metaphor is widely used by sociologists to study
   socioeconomic behavior and processes. The use of social networks
   generally takes place within the ranks of sociology, However, a more
   complete social science would result by combining work being done on
   social networks within sociology with mainline economic theory. The
   insights from such a research agenda will help us better understand
   socioeconomic behavior. With this in mind, the main objective of this
   paper is to demonstrate the utility of the network metaphor to
   economists. This objective will be accomplished through developing four
   basic components of social networks, and using them to navigate through
   the existing literature in economic sociology, Furthermore, topics for
   future research in which social networks can provide contributions to
   the explanation of socioeconomic behavior are explored as well.

AB The evolution of Alfred Lindesmith's classic theory of addiction is
   analyzed as a product of the particular intellectual currents and
   controversies in and for which it was developed. These include the
   conflicts that pitted qualitative against quantitative sociology; the
   fledgling discipline of sociology against medicine, psychiatry, and
   psychology; and advocates of therapy for addicts against those who would
   simply punish them. By casting the meaningful experience of drug effects
   exclusively in terms of symbolically mediated mental representations of
   brute physiological sensations, Lindesmith's theory posits an
   epistemologically untenable dualism between mental and bodily perception
   that unnecessarily limits the explanatory scope of sociological
   research. As an alternative to this dualism, a praxiological approach to
   the meaning of drug-induced behavior and experience is proposed.

AB The sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has challenged many of the
   ''core'' conceptions of theory and method that remain entrenched in
   sociology textbooks. In conjunction with recent developments in history
   and philosophy of science, sociologists of science speak of the disunity
   of science and describe the local-historical origins of particular
   scientific facts and laws. ''Core'' sociology textbooks devote no
   attention to the methodological implications of recent sociology of
   science. Elementary textbooks present upbeat versions of the discipline
   that emphasize sociology's scientific methodology; they describe
   sociological methods as implementations of a general research process
   designed along hypothetico-dedective lines. Viewed from the vantage
   point of SSK, such widely disseminated elementary versions of sociology
   promote an asociological conception of science. In this paper we suggest
   that the ''epistemic flattening'' accomplished by SSK's research on the
   natural sciences provides a valuable antidote to current anxieties about
   the coherence and scientific status of sociology.

AB Emerging from recent social and political struggles, the notion of
   'civil society' can and should be transformed into a sociological
   concept on both the theoretical and empirical level. This means going
   beyond the Marxist and social democratic understandings of civil society
   as a world of selfish economic interests, on the one hand, and beyond
   the liberal equation of civil society with legal protections of
   individual rights, on the other. Civil society should be conceptualized
   as a realm of solidarity, a 'we-ness' that simultaneously affirms the
   sanctity of the individual and these individuals' obligations to the
   collectivity. The solidary sphere, in principle and in practice, can be
   differentiated not only from markets and states but from such other
   noncivil spheres as religion, family and science. Yet differentiation
   does not preclude tension and conflict over boundaries. Civil solidarity
   is 'compromised' and 'distorted' by these boundary relations, and also
   by competing, more primordial definitions of community, such as race,
   language, nation, territory, and ethnicity. While civil society can be
   identified with 'universal reason' in a philosophical sense, in
   sociological terms it must be articulated by more concrete and
   identity-related symbolic constructs. For this reason, sociological
   approaches to civil society must be tied to cultural sociology, to
   theories of symbolic codes and narratives.

AB The determinants of and variations in processes of cultural valorization
   ape of increasing interest to sociologists. In the case of high-culture
   literary texts, the central evaluation process takes place through canon
   formation. We explore the mechanisms of canon formation and of cultural
   valorization processes more generally by analyzing the critical history
   of Zora Neale Hurston's novel Their Eyes Were Watching God. Published in
   1937 to lukewarm reviews, the novel is currently considered a core
   canonical text. We specify three processes involved in the
   reconstruction of Hurston's novel and in the establishment of the
   African American literary canon: (I) the application of new evaluative
   criteria, (2) the reconstruction of textual meaning through newly
   available interpretative strategies, and (3) changes in the
   institutional and organizational environment that allowed new claims on
   high-status critical positions to be made by those previously outside
   the literary hierarchy. The implications of this study for theoretical
   models of cultural valorization in sociology are considered.

AB This article argues that the medical record is an important focus for
   sociological research. In medical work, the modern patient's body that
   Foucault has so aptly described is produced through embodied, materially
   heterogeneous work, and the medical record plays a crucial role in this
   production. It does not simply represent this body's history and
   geography; it is a central element in the material rewriting of these.
   Simultaneously, the record fulfills a core role in the production of a
   body politic. As the record is involved in the performance of the
   patient's body, it is also involved in the performance of the clinic in
   which that body comes to life. Finally, we argue that different records
   and different practices of reading and writing are intertwined with the
   production of different patient's bodies, bodies politic, and bodies of
   knowledge. As organizational infrastructure, the medical record affords
   the interplay and coordination of divergent worlds. Seen as a site where
   multiple stories about patients and organizations are at stake,
   including the interoperability between these stories, the medical record
   becomes highly relevant both analytically and politically.

   arena. Activist groups are forming alliances nationally and across

   by these groups has been undertheorized in social science literature
   dealing with sustainable agriculture. This article suggests one approach
   to bridging this knowledge gap by considering the origins of these
   movements in the context of theory based on karl Polanyi's (1957) book,
   The Great Transformation. Viewed as examples of Polanyi's concept of the
   double movement of societal societal self-protection, the histories and
   goals of these groups are interpreted as reflecting an ongoing struggle
   to define a place for nonmarket social and environmental concerns that
   are threatened by an increasing emphasis on agricultural competitiveness

   curing; (3) medical sociology in aging research; (4) socialization into

   this review, the added value of ethnographic research to each specific
   area is noted. Ethnographic research has enriched medical sociology with

AB Following Hobbes, many social theorists have claimed that the state

   review the cross-cultural and cross-national evidence on the impact of
   the state on the most common form of extreme violence-lethal conflict
   (i.e., war, rebellion, homicide, and execution). Drawing on the
   sociology of conflict management (Black 1993), I argue that the
   relationship between the state and lethal conflict is nor negative as
   Hobbesian theory predicts. Rather, it appears to be U-shaped. A
   combination of materials from anthropology, criminology, and political
   science suggests that rates of lethal conflict tend to be high when
   state authority is absent and also when it is extremely strong or
   centralized. Between these extremes, in less centralized states, lethal
   conflict typically declines.

   have you discriminated against others? How are you privileged? Results
   reveal an implied white racism, frank gender discrimination toward

   findings are discussed within the context of the systems of inequality

   interdisciplinary approaches and cooperated to produce scientific field
   reports. Although teaching an integrated field course abroad is
   challenging for faculty members and students alike, we conclude that
   this approach is an excellent way to teach about sustainability. This
   report adds to the literature on teaching and learning abroad by also
   considering interdisciplinary collaboration and the formation of a
   learning community.

AB A recent report of the American Sociological Association calls for
   revision of the sociology major to promote greater ''study in depth.'' A
   key recommendation in the report is that the major include at least four
   levels of sequencing. These consist of introductory courses, skills
   courses, advanced substantive courses, and capstone courses. St. Cloud
   State University revised its sociology major to incorporate many of the
   recommendations in the ASA report. An initial revision of the major
   omitted the third level of sequencing, but a recent revision includes
   all four levels. Faculty members concerns about scheduling, enrollments,
   and autonomy slowed the pace of change and influenced the content of the
   major. The experience of St. Cloud State University suggests that
   implementing the ''study in depth'' guidelines is a difficult but
   rewarding process.

AB Postmodernism charges that sociological methods project ways of thinking
   and being from the past onto the future, and that sociological forms of
   presentation are rhetorical defenses of ideologies. Postmodernism
   contends that sociological theory presents reified constructs no more
   based in reality than are fictional accounts. Kenneth Burke's logology
   predates and adequately addresses postmodernism's valid charges against
   sociology. At the same time, logology avoids the idealistic tendencies
   and ethical pitfalls of radical forms of postmodernist deconstruction,
   which acknowledge neither pretextual and extratextual worlds nor the way
   sin which experience is embodied. While not fully articulated, Burke's
   logology gives primacy to an embodies, social world prior to text
   (body-as-World). Sociology can strengthen both its theoretical arsenal
   and its response to postmodernism by reacknowledging and reclaiming
   Burke's logology.

AB Theory in sociology is constructed as a canon, a very short list of
   social theorists who have been endowed with suprahistorical status.
   Drawing on the feminist analysis of gendered consciousness, the author
   argues that social theory is organized exactly as it should be if one
   were thinking like a White male capitalist. The perceptual frameworks it
   employs-a hierarchy of the social, logical dichotomies, decontextualized
   abstraction, an individualist approach-resonate well with descriptions
   of hegemonic masculine consciousness. As a result, social theory has not
   just distorted social perception, it is becoming functionally irrelevant
   in contemporary social life. The author argues that reasonable
   understandings are more likely if we are developing via an epistemology
   of connection, moving from thinking of theory as a holy text to
   organizing theory to create bridges between diverse standpoints, across
   disciplinary boundaries, and between knowing and doing.

AB Recent research on the cognitive abilities of emotional capacities of
   animals has fueled the animal rights movement and renewed debate over
   the differences between human and non-human animals. This debate has not
   been central to sociology, although George Herbert Mead drew a very hard
   line between humans and animals by asserting that the latter were not
   capable of symbolic interaction. Sociologists are now beginning to
   question this assumption, and this article falls within this new line of
   research. We begin by presenting alternative interpretations of symbolic
   interaction that allow for the possibility of such activity in non-human
   animals. We review recent research on symbolic interaction between human
   and dogs, and we present our own research findings on human-feline
   interaction. We conclude that there is growing evidence that symbolic
   interaction is widely distributed throughout the animal kingdom, and
   that it enables animals to survive more effectively in a wide variety of
   environments.

AB The present study examined children's evaluations of potentially
   conflictual situations between peers. Eight-and 11-year-olds evaluated
   two hypothetical target children in three scenarios which differed as to
   the intent of a provocative act (Accidental, Ambiguous, Hostile). In
   addition to grade and sex, relationship between targets was manipulated
   as a between-subjects variable with targets portrayed as either Best
   Friends Acquaintances, or Enemies. Children evaluated targets in terms
   of attributions of intentions, behavior response, affective state of
   targets, and mutual liking between targets. Results indicated that
   aggressor's intentions and victim's behavior response were evaluated as
   positive for the Accidental scenario and as negative for the Hostile
   scenario regardless of target relationship. When aggressor's intentions
   were unclear (e.g., Ambiguous), interactions between Best Friends and
   interactions between Acquaintances were evaluated as positive while
   interactions between Enemies were perceived as negative. Further, while
   all children predicted a negative response by the victim during the
   Hostile situation, younger children predicted the victim's response
   would be less negative than did older children. Children reported Best
   Friends and Acquaintances as liking each other more before the
   provocation situation started than after it occurred while liking
   between Enemies remained unchanged, thus indicating a belief that
   provocations may hurt a positive or neutral relationship. Targets were
   perceived to be in negative affective states during the Accidental and
   Ambiguous scenarios and the aggressor was perceived to be in a neutral
   affective state during the Hostile scenario. Results are discussed in
   terms of previous research on response to provocation and implications
   for research on children's peer conflicts. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The current study compared the social problem-solving skills of a

   25 boys diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD). Past
   research has indicated that contextual factors influence children's
   social problem-solving; thus, three hypothetical conflict situations
   (i.e., child-child, teacher-child, and parent-child) and situations
   which differed by degree of negative intent of the provocateur (i.e.,
   hostile vs. ambiguous intent) were examined. Problem-solving strategies
   were aggregated into three broad dimensions: 1) aggressive/antisocial
   solutions; 2) nonverbal-nonaggressive solutions; and 3)
   verbal-nonaggressive solutions. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed
   more aggressive/antisocial solutions in parent-child conflicts when
   parental intent was ambiguous and in teacher-child conflicts regardless
   of intent. Compared to ODD boys, CD boys proposed fewer
   verbal-nonaggressive solutions in child-child conflicts. The
   implications of these findings for treatment intervention with CD and
   ODD boys were discussed. (C) 1997 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB Objectives. This study explores how local television news structures the
   public and policy debate on youth violence,
   Methods. A content analysis was performed on 214 hours of local
   television news from California. Each of the 1791 stories concerning
   youth, violence, or both was coded and analyzed for whether it included
   a public health perspective.
   Results. There were five key findings. First, violence dominated local
   television news coverage. Second, the specifics of particular crimes
   dominated coverage of violence. Third, over half of the stories on youth
   involved violence, while more than two thirds of the violence stories
   concerned youth. Fourth, episodic coverage of violence was more than
   five times more frequent than thematic coverage, which included links to
   broader social factors. Finally, only one story had an explicit public
   health frame.
   Conclusions. Local television news provides extremely limited coverage
   of contributing etiological factors in stories on violence. If our
   nation's most popular source of news continues to report on violence
   primarily through crime stories isolated from their social context, the
   chance for widespread support for public health solutions to violence
   will be diminished.

   Methods. We surveyed a stratified random sample of community-based,

   Results. Overall, physicians (n = 343; 77% response rate) screened
   younger adolescents for regular smoking during 71.4% (95% confidence
   interval [CI] = 67.9, 74.9) of routine physical exams and older
   adolescents during 84.8% (95% CI = 82.3, 87.4) of such visits. For
   acute-care visits, the screening rates were 24.4% (95% CI = 20.6, 28.1)
   for younger and 40.2% (95% CI = 36.4, 44.0) for older adolescents,

   CI = 32.0, 39.1) of older adolescents about experimental smoking.
   Screening varied by specialty.

   40% first smoked with a family member, and 46% obtained their first
   cigarette from a family member or from home. Correlates of ever having
   smoked were race, sex, having a best friend or family member who smoked,
   and attitudes that smoking is disgusting and that nonsmokers get better
   grades.

AB This study examines the portrayal of homosexuality in abnormal

   between 1980 and 1995. A total of 27 textbooks-16 in psychology and 11
   in sociology-were used. Books published during the 1980s were compared
   with those published in the 1990s. Results from textbooks in print in
   1995 were compared with results from an earlier study of textbooks in
   print in 1980. As was found in the earlier study, three models of
   homosexuals and homosexuality appear in these books-homosexuality as
   illness, homosexuality as sin, and homosexuals as a minority group.
   However, striking changes have occurred in the relative importance of
   these models over the past 15 years. None of the textbooks currently in
   print explicitly describes homosexuality as an illness, compared with
   30% in 1980, although many implicitly do so. The model of homosexuality
   as sin, meanwhile, has gained new life with the emergence of the AIDS
   epidemic. Finally, the minority group model is gaining strength, in both
   sociology and psychology textbooks.

AB Three-way social network data occurs when every actor in a social

   statistical model based on cultural consensus analysis for aggregating
   these separate digraphs into a single consensus digraph. In addition,
   the model allows estimation of separate hit and false alarm rates for
   each actor that can vary within each actor in different regions of the
   digraph. Several standard signal detection models are used to interpret
   the hit and false alarm parameters in terms of knowledge and response
   bias. A published three-way data set by Kumbasar, Romney, and Batchelder
   (American Journal of Sociology, 1994) is analyzed, and the model reveals
   that both response bias and knowledge decrease with distance from ego.

   linguistic forms within the grammar hierarchy reveals clear analogues
   with common social scientific paradigms. Two of these paradigms (which
   are termed structural and process approaches) are already being widely
   exploited by formal methodological techniques. A third paradigm, which
   is rooted in a tradition of interpretive sociology, has been more
   resistant to formalization. Using arguments from theoretical computer
   science, the paper suggests that existing quantitative methodologies can
   be extended to accommodate qualitative arguments which subsume empirical
   domains as diverse as natural language and structurational phenomena.

AB Various substantive literatures in sociology seek small regularities in
   sequences: turning points in the life course, catalytic moments in
   organizational change, sharp turns in occupational trajectories, and the
   like. Commonly these are turning points, but they may also be simple
   local patterns. This paper reports a method for discovering such
   regularities even when they are quite faint, applying that method to
   rhetorical regularities in sociological articles. The paper begins by
   analyzing the overall sequence structure of such articles and then gives
   a basic introduction to Gibbs sampling, one member of the broader class
   of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. It then reports an algorithm
   employing Gibbs sampling to find local sequence regularities and applies
   that algorithm to demonstrate the subsequence regularities present in
   sociological articles. Substantively, the paper shows that the
   rhetorical structure of sociological articles changed from one pattern
   to another in the period 1895-1965 and that certain faint but standard
   rhetorical subsequences became characteristic of articles in the later
   period. Methodologically, it introduces a broad class of methods that
   provide effective approaches to a number to a previously intractable
   statistical questions.

AB Matching to control for covariates in the estimation of treatment
   effects is not common in sociology, where multivariate data are most
   often analyzed using multiple regression and its generalizations.
   Matching can be a useful way to estimate these effects, especially when
   the treatment condition is comparatively rare in a population, and
   controls are numerous but mostly unlike the treatment cases. Matching on
   numerous covariates is abetted by the estimation of propensity scores,
   or functions of the probability that cases are treatments rather than
   controls. This procedure is illustrated in the estimation of the effects
   of an organizational innovation on Medicare mortality within hospitals;
   the data set is very large, but innovative hospitals few, and many of
   the remaining hospitals are quite unlike the hospitals constituting the
   treatment sub-sample. Results are based on variance-components model
   that is extended to consider the effects of an additional covariate.
   They show effects of the organizational innovation comparable to those
   estimated via multiple regression models but with substantially reduced
   standard errors.

AB Epistemological reflection has been a major source of innovation in the
   human sciences while having very little influence on the arts of
   sciences. This variation is explained using a sociological framework
   emphasizing the organizational forms that underpin or are implicit in
   epistemological positions. The fine arts and the harder sciences are,
   respectively, too weakly and too strongly organized to be open to
   epistemological influence. By contrast, the human sciences might
   plausibly be organized either more loosely or more tightly, and
   epistemological argument is used in part to urge movement in one or the
   other direction. This persvective is applied to the academic study of
   literature both historically and in relation to a current
   epistemological dispute between realist and relativist scholars. The
   argument is unresolvable in practice, it is argued, because of
   constraints on scholarly interpretation set by consumers. Parallels are
   drawn with circumstances in sociology.

AB State autonomy is often viewed as the result of the culture, ideological
   coherence, or class background of the state bureaucracies, and of
   institutional characteristics that ensure state effectiveness. This view
   has several problems: it assumes what has to be explained, makes it
   difficult to understand changes in state autonomy, and tends to make
   autonomy the characteristic of strong, cove states. This paper calls for
   a new approach to study state autonomy, one in which power is a
   characteristic of a relationship, not of actors or organizations
   (Emerson 1962), and uses this approach to examine changes in state-class
   relationships based on taxation during the mid 1930s in Bolivia. The
   paper then argues that state autonomy depends on the relative costs of
   state policies and on the availability of political allies to the state
   vis-a-vis the opposing economic elite. This approach allows us to
   specify the power dependence of the state on a gir,en class, the
   conditions under which that relative dependence changes in favor of the
   state, and is applicable to both weak and strong states.

AB ''Stacking'' is one of the oldest and most thoroughly studied phenomena
   in the sociology of sport. Because of this tradition, the literature is
   replete with tabular demonstrations of the stacking phenomenon Many of
   these data arrangements violate an important convention in table
   presentation: Percents should be computed in the direction of the causal
   factor. This procedure allows one to contrast the distribution of the
   dependent variable between/among categories of the independent variable
   and enables determining what differences if any, exist between/among
   categories of the independent variable. The consequences of this
   violation for stacking studies is that, technically, position appears to
   affect race whereas, logically race affects position played. Because so
   many competent researchers have published tables that run the ''wrong
   way,'' it is appropriate to examine the rationale behind the cause and
   effect rule for percentaging tables and instances in which this ''rule''
   may be broken.

AB This paper presents a sociological synthesis of critical pedagogical and
   andragogical teaching techniques for a multidisciplinary classroom.
   Field research was conducted by undergraduate students at a popular
   social setting: local urban and suburban malls. The objective of the
   assignment was to explore critically the basic sociological concepts of
   stratification along such dimensions as race, class, gender, ethnicity,
   and nationality. By extending classroom heuristics into the social world
   of ''everyday life,'' this approach enables students to explore a
   familiar social place-the postindustrial shrine to American consumption
   culture-through the critical lens of the sociological imagination. The
   application of sociological principles learned in the classroom to the
   larger community or ''real world'' helps to enhance the relevance of
   sociology as a scientific discipline to students when they return to the
   traditional academic setting. Although the paper is based on experiences
   from a multidisciplinary class (N=63) that was not trained in
   qualitative research techniques, the assignment can be utilized
   effectively in more advanced undergraduate and graduate courses,
   including research methods classes.

AB Economic stratification and social class occupy a central position in
   sociological discourse as the core organizing features of modern
   societies. Yet such economically centered models of stratification often
   disregard factors like physical violence and the intra-household
   distribution of resources that shape power and autonomy for all groups.
   Using a sample of textbooks from 1983 through 1988, we examine
   ''mainstream'' sociology, that is, the sociology that teachers,
   students, and textbook publishers have treated as nonproblematic. We
   show how stratification analysis is applied to class, race, and gender
   in profoundly unequal ways. Rather than integrating macro, meso, and
   micro levels of social structure as interactive and mutually
   determinative in their discussions of race, class, and gender,
   introductory sociology textbooks segregate stratification processes.
   They discuss class at the societal (or macro) level of analysis, gender
   at the individual (or micro) level, and race at a group (or meso) level.
   We analyze the quantitative and qualitative elements of the coverage of
   class, race, and gender in indexes, texts, pictures, and captions, and
   suggest that attention to feminist theories of gender would produce a
   more integrated, multilevel, and interactive view. of stratification.

AB Two population surveys of Mexico City residents were conducted, the
   first three weeks after the earthquake of September 1985 and the other a
   year later. We found that: (1) small percentages, because of the size of
   the metropolitan area population, translated into large absolute numbers
   for personal disaster behavior; (2) social class (or socioeconomic
   status) was important as a differentiating factor in earthquake-related
   behavior; (3) there was little dissatisfaction with organizational
   efforts to deal with the earthquake consequences along with (4) no
   noticeable increase in dissatisfaction from the time of the initial
   impact up to the year's anniversary of the disaster; (5) the
   earthquake-related sheltering and housing of people was not as
   problematical as the extensiveness of the activity might suggest; (6)
   the volunteering pattern of individuals was quite complex; (7) there was
   extremely heavy mass media usage in the earthquake aftermath; and (8)
   earthquake victims learned little from their experience on how to
   prepare for future disasters. The paper primarily uses these
   generalizations from the survey findings to advance eight basic themes
   about human behavior in disasters that might be comparatively examined
   in future cross-societal studies.

AB The need to better understand landlord involvement in decision-making
   related to pesticide use and water quality issues is evidenced by
   several trends. These trends include the increasing documentation of
   water pollution by farm pesticides, the changing characteristics of farm
   ownership and operator tenure, and evolutions in resource policy and
   protection planning. This paper utilizes a theoretical approach to the
   sociology of land tenure to interpret results from an investigation of
   landlord involvement in environmental decision making regarding
   pesticide selection on rented land. Eight counties with high
   susceptibility of water contamination by pesticides were selected for
   study. Structured, in-person interviews were administered to in-county
   landlords, and a mail survey was used to poll out-of-county landlords.
   Results indicate that participation is generally low with very little
   difference between landlord groups. Renters make most of the
   organizational and operational decisions on rented farmland. Landlord
   participation is predominantly based on economic, rather than on social
   or environmental, factors. Furthermore, while economic variables are
   important predictors of participation for both groups, gender and social
   ties to the renter tend to increase local landlord involvement, but not
   absentee involvement. These results have important implications for both
   federal programs and further research on land tenure and environmental
   stewardship.

   this misreading and shows hotel current poverty scholarship replicates
   this erroneous interpretation of Lewis's work. An attempt is made to
   remedy this situation by arguing that Lewis's subculture of poverty
   idea, far from being a poor-bashing, ideological ploy, is firmly
   grounded in a Marxist critique of capital and ifs productive
   contradictions. As such, Lewis's work is a celebration of the resilience
   and resourcefulness of the poor, not a denigration of the lower class
   and the cultural defenses they erect against poverty's everyday
   uncertainty.

AB With his recent introduction of "posthumanism," a decentered variant of
   constructivist sociology of science, Andrew Pickering advertises novel
   conceptual resources for social theorists. fn fact, he tenders nothing
   less than a fundamental reordering of social thought. By invoking the
   concept of "material agency," Pickering seeks to redefine the
   relationship between "Nature " and "Society," while dismissing the
   "humanist bias" inherent in sociological inquiry. However, for all its
   ambition and good intentions, posthumanism delivers only analytical
   inconsistencies, the consequences of an uneasy synthesis of pragmatist
   and poststructuralist influences. When translated into the language of
   conventional sociological theory, these problems surface as an
   inadequate treatment of human agency The works of the original
   pragmatists, particularly C.S. Peirce and G.H. Mead, illustrate how the
   objectives of posthumanism can be achieved without decentering,
   suggesting a renewed appreciation of "humanist" sociologies.

AB While the ''new institutionalism'' has emersed as a dominant theory of

   its possible limits. Under what circumstances might the neoinstitutional
   predictions regarding organizational inertia, institutional isomorphism,
   the legitimacy imperative, and other fundamental beliefs be overshadowed
   by? more traditional sociological theories accentuating organizational
   adaptation, variation, and the role of specific global and local
   technical environmental demands? We analyze longitudinal data from 1971
   to 1986 for 631 private liberal arts colleges facing strong
   institutional and increasingly strong technical environments. Our
   findings reveal surprisingly little support neoinstitutional
   predictions. (I) Many liberal arts colleges changed in ways contrary to
   institutional demands by professionalizing or vocationalizing their
   curricula; (2) global and local technical environmental conditions, such
   as changes in consumers' references and local economic and demographic
   differences, were strong predictors of the changes observed; (3) schools
   Became less, rather than more, homogeneous over time; (4) schools
   generally did not mimic their most prestigious counterparts; (5) the
   illegitimate changes had no negative (and often had positive)
   performance consequences for enrollment and survival. Our results
   suggest that current research on organization-environment relations map
   underestimate the power of traditional adaptation-based explanations in
   organizational sociology.

   research into the 21st century. It argues that environmental
   sociologists need to avoid the omphaloskepsis that sometimes afflicts
   other fields of sociology, but that there is a real opportunity to do
   so. Three options appear particularly promising: (a) broadening the
   now-established base of sociological research that deals systematically
   with environmental variables; (b) devoting greater attention to the ways
   in which socially constructed ''definitions of the situation'' may
   contribute to (and not simply permit the evading of) the environmental
   problems that societies face; and (c) beginning more line-grained
   analyses of the connections between specific human activities
   (particularly economic activities) and specific components of the
   physical environment. Contributions to date have clearly established the
   fact that such connections exist; the work of a much broader range of
   sociologists will be needed, however, to help develop an improved
   understanding oi the nature, causes, and extent of those connections.

   often signals a disparity between what we as teachers believe is

   this is easier in theory than in practice. Most discussions of
   objectives are quite abstract, suggest an additive, linear understanding

   Schema theory can help us overcome these limitations by recasting

AB The coverage of race and ethnic groups in introductory sociology
   textbooks is studied fora sample of 25 texts. Using index citation
   counts, we assess the extent, ghettoization, and inclusiveness or
   topical breadth of coverage. Race-ethnic coverage is found to be fairly
   extensive and broad; however, it is ghettoized, with the majority of
   citations confined to a chapter on race. Ghettoization is coupled with a
   pattern of topical coverage that finds most references to race-ethnicity
   clustered in a limited set of sociological topics. Together, these
   findings suggest that people of color are marginalized from many of the
   major concerns of the text. Newly published or revised texts appear to
   be more inclusive. Implications for course development and textbook
   selection and revision are discussed.

AB Durkheim's epistemology, the argument for the social origins of the
   categories of the understanding, is his most important and most
   neglected argument. This argument has been confused with his sociology
   of knowledge, and Durkheim's overall position has been misunderstood as
   a consequence. The current popularity of a ''cultural'' or
   ''ideological'' interpretation of Durkheim is as much a misunderstanding
   of his position as the ''functional'' interpretation from which the
   current interpretations seek to rescue him. Durkheim articulated a
   sophisticated epistemology in the classical sense, a point that has been
   entirely missed.

AB East Germany's unanticipated revolution in 1989 poses an interesting
   challenge to social movement research. The relatively spontaneous,
   peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully
   explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective
   action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory
   offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely
   satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political
   contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent
   in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach
   in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social
   networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were!
   shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they
   were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed
   grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.
   Reference to collective identities helped to mobilize and frame
   opposition in East Germany making a swift, unexpected revolution
   possible once the stab began to founder.

AB Southern Louisiana and southern Florida are characterized by the two
   most extensive coastal wetlands in the continental United States. These
   immense, seemingly hostile, and similar environments have experienced
   two very different directions of regional development. Louisiana
   developed much earlier, focusing initially on the extraction of
   renewable resources from the coastal marsh. Later, by the 1920s, the
   discovery of oil and gas led to the rapid development of an offshore,
   nonrenewable extractive system that is literally unparalleled on the
   planet. In contrast, at the time of early settlement, southern Florida
   had fewer recognized renewable or nonrenewable resources; its
   development began later, centered around amenity use rather than
   consumptive use of resources. In spite of potentially massive economic
   benefits, Florida has bitterly fought recent attempts at offshore ail or
   gas exploitation, and coastal tourism in Louisiana seems as unlikely as
   offshore development in Florida. At the same time, however, there are
   significant challenges to the continued vitality of both the oil-based
   economy of southern Louisiana and the tourism-based economy of southern
   Florida. The two contrasting cases provide examples of developmental
   channelization. On the one hand, once an area or region takes a given
   developmental direction, both the process of specialization in a given
   primary activity and the investment of human and economic capital in the
   capture of linkages tied to that primary activity can set in motion a
   process that may effectively preclude other developmental options. On
   the other hand, a given course of development can also be pursued so
   intensively as to bring about its demise.

   homogeneous mental niches for lumping things together yet at the same
   time allowing us to carve seemingly discrete categories out of

   to intersubjective, conventional mindscapes that are neither personal

AB This paper examines several aspects of the changing cultural
   classifications of reproduction through a close reading of obstetrics
   textbooks. Through the discursive construction of the fetus in obstetric
   texts, medical accounts are beginning to classify the fetus as a baby.
   In investigating this transformation, I focus upon two cognitive
   processes: the splitting of the fetus apart from the pregnant woman and
   the concurrent lumping of two distinct mental entities-a fetus and an
   infant into one new medical category: the fetus-infant. In addition,
   textual evidence shows a shift in cognitive orientation away from
   classifying fetuses based on gestational age to an emphasis on what I
   term functional age. Further, new knowledge enables physicians to affect
   functional age, making the fetus with mature function in utero
   conceptually no different from a baby.

AB Despite the many angles from which the biological phenomenon now known

   on how social groups actually draw lines around and mentally partition

   paper examines nor the meaning of ''the menstrual cycle,'' per se, but
   hegemonic Western culture's intersubjective notions of how to carve lip
   this inherently unstructured phenomenon in the first place. Although
   sociologists of cognition have still to consider this sociomental
   structuring of ''the menstrual cycle'' as a case of mental cartography,
   and sociologists of time have still to consider ''menstrual time'' as a
   case of sociotemporality, I conclude that the mental mapping out of what
   constitutes the elements of this rhythm is a highly social act with
   serious implications for women's lives.

AB Perceptions of safety and danger are ''intersubjective''-products of

   objective danger certainly exists, perceptions of danger do not derive
   directly from observation of the empirical world. The objective
   environment provides only inconsistent and ambiguous information,
   permitting ample room for socially constructed beliefs. Three cognitive
   frameworks-the Cautious, Confident and Neutral frameworks-organize
   perceptions of safety and danger. Each framework begins with a default
   assumption about safety and danger and ''marks'' certain items as
   different from this default. In shaping expectations, these frameworks
   also contribute to perceptions of horror, humor, excitement and fear.
   Finally, I use these frameworks to analyze the psychological concept
   ''phobia'' as a sociological phenomenon.

   preferences has been overlooked. We examine an influential model of
   theory growth in social science. This model focuses on theory. We show
   how recent work in the sociology of science suggests an equally
   important place for methodological preference in guiding social
   research. Bringing in method allows us to recognize that what often
   passes for fundamental metatheoretical differences among subfields in
   sociology actually consists of minor squabbles over resource allocation.
   We show that not only does social theory grow strategically through
   theoretical research programs, but that the different forms of
   theoretical work in sociology serve to integrate the work of diverse

AB This paper examines how gay men living with HIV disease come to terms
   with the profound sexual implications of their illness. Based on
   interviews with 25 gay men diagnosed with HIV/AIDS, this paper
   highlights (a) the disruptions that these men experience in their sexual
   feelings and self-images as a result of their illness; (b) the
   challenges they encounter in negotiating and sustaining sexual
   relationships; (c) the declines they experience in their sexual
   attractiveness, desire, and capacities as their illness advances; and
   (d) the changed meanings they give to sex and self as they come to terms
   with the erotic implications of their illness and try to preserve
   valued, intimate identities. In focusing on these themes, this paper
   offers an ''insider's view'' into key dimensions of the moral experience
   of gay men with HIV/AIDS. It also illustrates how the moral experience
   of these men shifts over the course of their illness, especially in
   response to the changes and challenges that arise in their intimate
   relationships and subcultural networks.
   On a broader, analytic level, this paper addresses a research question
   that has been neglected in previous studies of the experience of
   illness-that is, how does serious illness affect the sexuality of
   diagnosed individuals, particularly their construction of sexual and
   intimate identities? Through examining this question, this paper
   contributes to and extends the growing interactionist literature on the
   consequences of illness for self.

   occurs in talk-in-interaction. The practice of agreeing with another by
   repeating what they have said is shown to constitute the action of
   confirming an allusion-that is, confirming both its ''content'' and its
   prior inexplicit conveyance. The author reviews the past treatment of
   ''action'' in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an
   empirically grounded account. The account of ''confirming allusions'' is
   offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several
   instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and
   used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration
   of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is
   formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic
   techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it
   implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of
   repetition in talk-in-interaction. Tn conclusion, the significance of
   both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture

AB Using the case of the African American Olympic protest movement that
   grew out of the crisis of the civil rights struggle in the late 1960s,
   this article is an attempt to argue that work involving identity,
   culture and popular culture is crucial to the study of race and
   ethnicity in the contemporary world. A reconstruction of this movement
   demonstrates, first of all, how a cultural arena like sport can make it
   possible for otherwise powerless racial and ethnic minorities to draw
   attention to their cause. Of course, as with most insurgent movements,
   such initiatives ultimately (and often very quickly) come up against
   structural impediments that work to reject or absorb their challenge and
   reinforce the hegemony of the established regime. But the precise nature
   of the structural constraints operating in this particular case provides
   profound insight into the construction of social order in liberal
   democratic settings and the threat posed by cultural politics to this
   order. More specifically, I argue that athletic protest was
   overwhelmingly condemned and rejected because it threatened to rupture
   the homologies between sport culture and liberal democratic ideology
   that otherwise legitimated a fundamentally individualist,
   assimilationist vision of racial justice and civil rights in the United
   States In more general theoretical terms, then, culturally-oriented
   movements expose the ways in which domination itself is deeply
   structured in and through culture. The article concludes by suggesting
   that this, especially in an age when capital and power have discovered
   techniques to insulate themselves against traditional, materialist forms
   of resistance, is why cultural forums and identity politics have become
   primary sites of the struggle for hegemony.

AB In his writings Alfred Schutz identifies an artificiality in the concept
   of ''life-world'' produced by Edmund Husserl's method of reduction. As
   an alternative, he proposes to assume intersubjectivity as a given of
   everyday life. This eradicates Husserl's distinction between
   ''life-world'' and ''natural attitude.'' The subsequent phenomenological
   project appears to center upon sociological descriptions of the
   ''structures of the life-world'' rather than on a search for apodictic
   truth. Schutz, however actually retains Husserl's emphasis on the
   subject. A tension then arises between the assumption of
   intersubjectivity and individual experience. Rather than clarifying the
   concept of intersubjectivity, this further problematizes it. Drawing
   upon Max Weber's work, Schutz responds by developing a rigorous
   methodology for studying the social world. But having rejected Husserl's
   reduction and conflated ''life-world'' and ''natural attitude,''
   Schutz's analysis moves at the level of daily life itself. Consequently,
   the explanatory categories he proposes appear as abstractions rather
   than as a way of describing lived experience. Schutz, it is concluded,
   initiates a scientistic sociology in which the commonsense structures of
   the ''natural attitude of everyday life'' are subverted and replaced by
   the more rigorous knowledge of the ''scientific attitude.'' Schutz's
   version of phenomenology is ultimately untrue to the spirit of Husserl's
   original project; and deploying his work as a clear-cut alternative to
   scientistic tendencies within sociology is not as straightforward as it
   might at first seem.

AB By any standard, nonrationality is an undertheorized concept in
   sociology. This paper attempts to open a discussion on nonrationality by
   analyzing one of the most fruitful theorizations of the concept:
   Simmels. Simmel developed a theory that placed nonrationality on the
   same plane with rationality and attributed to the former a role as
   fundamental as the latter's in the foundations of action, and as central
   as the latter's in the generation of existential meanings. The gradual
   eclipse of the nonrational elements of life in the expanses of a modern,
   highly rationalized world imply, then, an impoverishment of being. I
   argue that Simmel's theory of the nonrational can serve as a model
   capable of enriching our understanding of society and of the person and
   can, in this sense, serve as a counterpoint to current sociological
   theories that emphasize the rational elements of life and conceive the
   person in primarily rational terms.

   upon writings from Durkheim's later "religious" period to show how
   Durkheim has special relevance today for debates in the
   historical-comparative field. I examine how his substantive writings
   shed light on current discussions regarding civil society; how his
   analytical insights help to show how action within civil society as well
   as other historical contexts is channelled by cultural,
   social-structural, and social-psychological configurations (plus
   transformative human agency); and how his ontological commitment to a
   "relational social realisin" contributes to ongoing attempts to rethink
   the foundations of historical-comparative investigation.

   I should like to reciprocate the compliment by using this commentary not

   from these criticisms to examine their connection to Alexander's work
   more generally. My claim is that as a tool for analyzing the development
   of ideas-the development, that is, of various intellectual products or
   kinds of social-scientific knowledge-Alexander's work is fundamentally
   antisociological. Since my own goal has been to work out a sociology of

   simplified form to the mass introductory classes and in greater detail
   to junior-level research methods classes in spring 1995. The goal in
   presenting this material to research methods students is to encourage
   critical thinking and informed skepticism about questionnaire design
   specifically, and data-generating procedures more generally In this
   paper we include some examples of experiments and describe how they were
   introduced and discussed in, research methods classes.

   factors, both national and international, that shape me possibilities of
   educational and social change occurring-and whether such change benefits
   the least privileged members of a society. A political sociology
   perspective necessarily involves an analysis of the role of the state
   and how conditioned capitalist development shapes education policy in

   adjustment policies recommend by the World Bank, the International

   have affected the governance, financing, and provision of education to
   various populations. Case studies of Nicaragua, Chile: Argentina, and

PD SUM 1996

AB This paper reviews the military sociology and popular literature on
   soldier isolation during force-projection operations and the
   (tele)communication resources available and used to lessen feelings of
   isolation. During World War II and the Cold War era (Korea and Viet Nam
   Wars), soldiers were isolated. Communication with significant others and
   the larger society was primarily one-way (e.g., via letter mail,
   Victory-mail, radio, movies, audio tapes, and tape delayed television).
   During the late-Cold War (e.g., invasion of Grenada, peacekeeping
   missions, and the invasion of Panama) and more recently during the
   post-Cold War era (e.g., the Persian Gulf War, Los Angeles riots, and
   the Somalia relief effort), the diffusion of one-way, and revolution in
   two-way communication media (e.g., telephones, video tapes, voice-mail,
   live television, and e-mail) resulted in a continued decrease in
   isolation for soldiers. Notwithstanding, there is a consistent and
   salient need among soldiers and families to continue to lessen isolation
   and separation. Although there has been a revolution in types of
   communication media (CM) available during force-projections, use across
   military operations has been evolutionary. In other words, high-tech has
   not displaced low-tech, but supplemented it. Recognizing that new and
   old CM are an ever-evolving and important element of the post-Cold War
   soldiers' experience, the authors stress the importance of social
   science research in ascertaining the social implications of regulating
   CM in military and other social institutions.

AB TO revisit the rural-urban contrast, we use data from nonmetropolitan

   whether, compared to personal networks in urban settings, personal
   networks in rural settings contain ties of greater intensity and role
   multiplexity, are based more on kinship and neighborhood solidarities
   rather than on friendship, are smaller, are denser, and have greater
   educational, race-ethnic, and religious homogeneity, but less age and
   gender homogeneity. Our results are generally consistent with these
   predictions. Mie then present evidence for rural diversity by comparing
   data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in southwestern
   Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing
   possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial
   communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network
   analysis to contribute to the resolution of these and other

   This view ignores his considerable achievements using the methodology of
   ''case-based'' historical analysis, most prominent among them, his
   lectures on the history of French education (The Evolution of
   Educational Thought). In this paper I first outline the intimate
   relationship that Durkheim envisioned between historical and
   sociological investigation. I then turn to his work on French education
   for substantive illustrations of his approach. Finally I explore certain
   points of intersection between Durkheim's approach to history and
   present-day concerns, especially in regard to the role of culture in
   history and the opposition between prospective and retrospective
   (''teleological'') strategies of historical analysis.

   explore the ways in which imagery shapes the rhetoric available for
   land-use debate and how this, in turn, affects changes in zoning. Of
   particular importance in this process are heritage narratives. These
   broad renditions of a community's history are a form of constitutive
   rhetoric. When successful, they create an audience to whom subsequent
   appeals can be made, and they set boundaries on the content and
   direction of public discourse. The analysis suggests that communication
   and rhetorical processes are central to ecological change and that to
   dismiss these phenomena in favor of macrostructural forces is to miss a
   significant aspect of the human dimensions of local change and of the
   processes through which places are stratified.

   Research which suggests that skills and their transmission are the

   information may be explicitly transmitted and acquired as part of the
   process of leaning a skill. Second-order studies of skill accept that
   skill acquisition occurs within a culture, but then go on to examine in
   detail which aspects of skills can be explicated and which cannot. Such
   a second-order study is presented here. Observations of veterinary
   surgery are used to identify a quasi-quantitative measure of skill
   acquisition - hardness. This measure is useful in understanding how task
   uncertainty is resolved in practice and how new skills are learnt.

   exchange or ''journal dialogue'' occurs, reducing the role distance
   between instructor and student. This article discusses the use of
   personal journals in the social psychology course, the benefits of this
   teaching technique, the specific challenges confronted by the students
   and the instructor, and ethical considerations. Survey questionnaires on
   the journal assignments were administerd to two social psychology
   classes. The results showed that students viewed the journals as a vital
   part of the course. The journals helped them to apply course material to
   everyday life, facilitated self-discovery created a bond between student
   and instructor, and made the course material more personally meaningful.

AB A course on deviant groups, taught since 1986, is described Most courses
   on deviance take an individual-level approach; groups are brought in
   only as an afterthought. This course, by contrast, focuses on deviant
   groups of different kinds (not only cults and communes), arguing that
   such groups are important sources of deviant behavior and are relatively
   neglected in deviance studies. Particular attention is given to
   ''deviance production groups''-groups that take in ''normal'' people and
   turn them into deviants, to some extent, such as the Branch Davidians,
   the Ku Klux Klan, and witches' covens. The course is also distinctive in
   its degree of emphasis on sociological concepts and theory, its
   complementing of other deviance courses, and its dependence on group
   discussions and presentations during class. Lectures are relatively
   infrequent; students are expected to use a study guide and to learn
   substantially from an instructor-prepared text on the deviant groups
   covered.

AB Rural Sociology faces increasing threats of marginalization from social
   and economic restructuring of academia and of the larger society in
   which it is embedded. Contrary to some recent analyses, the problem lies
   more in the inadequacies of data conceptualization, production, and
   collection than in the theoretical vitality of the discipline. The
   failure to match theoretical and conceptual advances with appropriate
   data leaves sociologists grappling with ''modern data to study a
   postmodern world.'' Research on the impact of restructuring on social
   and spatial divisions of labor and the contributions of feminist theory
   and research to the conceptualization of work and household illustrate
   the theoretical advances and the empirical deficiencies faced by the
   discipline. Disciplinary survival and development depend on meeting the
   challenge of matching theoretical progress with an appropriate empirical
   base.

AB The current decline of the developmentalist paradigm, and its view of
   the rural as increasingly residual, revitalizes rural sociology. The
   blossoming of studies of rurality and ecology is paralleled by the
   growing currency of globalization as an object of analysis. This is more
   than a coincidence-in fact, globalization crystallizes local diversity.
   The two phenomena go hand in hand. But each needs to be understood as an
   historical construct; that is, they need to be problematized. In
   problematizing ''globalization,'' I argue that it must be understood as
   a post-developmentalist construct. The postwar goal of national
   development, institutionalized in the international Bretton Woods
   regime, has run its course-dramatized by the assault on developmentalist
   states and institutions in the monetarist regime established under the
   auspices of the 1980s debt crisis. The nationally oriented institutions
   of the developmentalist era are now being replaced by globally oriented
   institutions under the legitimizing cloak of efficiency and financial
   credibility. Related to this trend, producing communities scramble to
   reposition themselves either through finding niches in a new global
   economy or through resistance to global pressures. Either way, there is
   a new emphasis on defining the local. This article explores the
   conjunction of global and local definition.

AB Rural sociologists have been disproportionately represented among the
   major contributors to environmental sociology. In part, this is because
   several areas of longstanding rural sociological interest (e.g.,
   sociology of resource management and outdoor recreation, studies of
   resource-dependent communities) essentially came to be redefined as
   environmental sociology during the 1970s. The most significant role of
   rural sociologists in building environmental sociology, however, has
   perhaps been the fact that the material and biophysical nature of the
   phenomena they have traditionally studied contributed to a general
   predisposition to recognize the ''materiality'' of social structure and
   social life. I assess the major strategies that have been developed for
   theorizing this materiality and then indicate some of the most critical
   lines of debate and dissension. I argue that if these debates are
   examined in their specifics-rather than as incompatible perspectives or
   ''paradigms''-some opportunities for synthesis become apparent. Some
   suggested avenues of synthesis are set forth.

AB Rural sociology is intrinsically concerned with the spatial dimensions
   of social life. However, this underlying research tradition,
   particularly the use of space as a research strategy, has been
   insufficiently addressed and its contributions to general sociology are
   little recognized. I outline how concern with space, uneven development,
   and the social relationships of peripheral settings have provided
   substantive boundary and conceptual meaning to rural sociology,
   propelled its evolution, and left it with a legacy of strengths,
   weaknesses, and challenges. A willingness to tackle the dimension of
   space and the thorny problems it raises often sets rural sociologists
   apart fr om other sociologists. This research tradition contrasted with
   general sociology's concern with developing generalization, aspatial
   covering laws, and proto-typical relationships of modern or Fordist
   development settings. Conceptual openings have left sociologists
   questioning their past agenda. Coupled with the ''creative marginality''
   inherent in the questions and contexts addressed by rural sociologists,
   this makes tile subfield central to contemporary sociology.

AB Collective violence is often social control: self-help by a group. It
   typically defines and responds to conduct as deviant. When unilateral
   and nongovernmental, it appears in four major forms-lynching, rioting,
   vigilantism, and terrorism-each distinguished by its system of liability
   (individual or collective) and degree of organization (higher or lower).
   Following Donald Black's paradigm of pure sociology, the central
   assumption is that collective violence varies with its location and
   direction in social space-the conflict structure. I offer ten
   propositions that predict and explain the likelihood and severity of
   collective violence in general and the four forms of collective violence
   in particular Conflict structures with a high degree of relational
   distance, cultural distance, functional independence, and inequality
   between the adversaries are associated with collective violence in
   general. Each of the four forms depends on the degree of social
   polarization between the parties as well as the continuity of the
   deviant behavior to which the violence responds.

AB Most sociological research designs assume that each person has one sex,
   one sexuality, and one gender, congruent with each other and fixed for
   life. Postmodern feminists and queer theorists have been interrogating
   bodies, desires, and genders, but sociology has not. Deconstructing sex,
   sexuality and gender reveals many possible categories embedded in social
   experiences and social practices. As researchers, as theorists, and as
   activists, sociologists have to go beyond paying lip service to the
   diversity of bodies, sexualities, genders. The sociologist's task should
   be to deconstruct the conventional categories of sex, sexuality, and
   gender and build new complex, cross-cubing constructs into research
   designs. There are revolutionary possibilities inherent in rethinking
   the categories of gender, sexuality and physiological sex. Sociological
   data that challenge conventional knowledge by reframing the questions
   could provide legitimacy for new ways of thinking. Data that undermine
   the supposed natural dichotomies on which the social orders of most
   modem societies are still based could radically alter political
   discourses that valorize biological causes, essential heterosexuality,
   and traditional gender roles in families and workplaces.

AB Although widely recognized as one of sociology's true classics, Max
   Weber's The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism has largely
   failed to influence the development of sociological theory in the United

   "role of ideas" in economic development, its diverse and multifaceted
   theoretical contributions generally have been neglected. This study
   explicitly calls attention to The Protestant Ethic as a theoretical
   treatise by examining this classic in reference to four major debates in
   postwar sociological theory in the United States. Moreover, it
   demarcates an array of major parameters in American theorizing. The
   conclusion speculates upon the reasons for the strong opposition to The
   Protestant Ethic's theoretical lessons and argues that a style of
   theorizing unique to sociology in the United States has erected firm
   barriers against this classic text.

   culture in light of their potential contribution to the sociology of
   religion. For Bourdieu, religion can be analyzed as a system of symbolic
   power with properties analogous to other cultural domains, such as art,
   philosophy, science, or consumer fashion. Bourdieu's approach to culture
   develops a political economy of symbolic practices that includes a
   theory of symbolic interests, a theory of cultural capital, and a theory
   of symbolic power. While Bourdieu draws upon a variety of intellectual
   influences, the materialism of Karl Marx and Max Weber's sociology of
   religion have been particularly influential. This essay will focus on
   how Bourdieu elaborates from Marx and Weber to develop an original
   analytical grid for the study of culture and religion as well.
   Particular attention will be given to Bourdieu's concept of ''field''
   since it is the most relevant of Bourdieu's concepts for both cultural
   and religious studies and currently the least well known in the
   sociology of religion.

AB The sociology of education offers three relevant lessons from ifs past
   to improve the use of international data on education by American
   policymakers. The first is that school-improvement research should be
   extended to include more routinely the wider organizational variation in
   schools cross-nationally. The second is that there are hidden
   organizational trade-offs in educational reform that are aimed solely at
   mechanically improving the achievement of students. The third is that
   the type of data that may be the most useful to policymakers is nor
   being adequately collected. These three points are discussed in relation
   to recent U.S. and international studies and statistics on education.

   nontraditional resources for leaching sociology, the pedagogical uses of
   science fiction have not been examined for 20 years. This essay first
   asserts the need for an update based on changes in society and in
   science fiction over the past two decades. The paper then focuses on the
   uses of SF to teach sociology and critical thinking by describing how SF
   can help students to ''make strange''(i.e., develop a skeptical,
   questioning stance), to ''make believe'' (i.e., develop critical and
   creative thinking), and to ''make real'' (i.e., use sociological
   concepts and theories). As illustration, the essay concludes with a
   detailed description of the use of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale
   in teaching introductory sociology.

   quantitative cross-national regression analysis to analyze the
   determinants of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) which originates in core
   (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) nations and is
   placed in noncore nations. Based on the theory of global capitalism,
   which contends that in a new stage of capitalism, First World
   manufacturing investment seeks Third World labor which is more docile
   and less costly than that in the older industrial regions, this study
   finds support for the hypotheses that labor control and, to a lesser
   degree, labor cost are determinants of FDI, net of level of development.

AB Christenson and Garkovich (1985) reported on trends in the first 50
   years of Rural Sociology; this note employs a similar analytic
   frame-work for the 292 articles and research commentaries published from
   1986 to 1995. While particular topics ebb and flow in terms of their
   importance, there continues to be a consistent focus on the substantive
   issues of traditional concern. Predictions in 1985 as to what the next
   retrospective would show proved to be fairly accurate. Applied empirical
   and quantitative studies continue to dominate the pages of the journal,
   but other types (e.g., qualitative and historical studies) now appear
   with greater frequency. The theoretical foundation of rural sociology
   has been enriched with conceptual frameworks from general sociology and
   other social sciences. New twists on the traditional concerns of
   agricultural constituencies and rural community leaders have broadened
   the range of topics addressed, reflecting the major social structures,
   processes, and issues currently affecting rural peoples and communities.
   The article concludes with an interpretation of recent trends and
   speculations on future directions.

AB The traditional positivist model is an inadequate foundation for
   sociology as a science. The phenomena of society differ from the
   phenomena assumed by positivism and existing in the world of nature in
   ways that prevent the successful use of that traditional approach.
   Agency, the ability to choose among alternatives where the choice makes
   an important difference, exists in social phenomena but has no
   counterpart in nature and cannot be dealt with adequately by positivism.
   A technological science perspective is suggested as an alternative for a
   science of sociology that can deal with the reality and importance of
   agency. Eight differences between the traditional perspective and the
   alternative are sketched. The alternative requires changes in the kind
   of generalized knowledge produced and the way it is produced,
   accumulated, and refined. The changes, though seemingly small, would
   produce a major reconstruction of much of sociology; such changes could
   result in important progress by the field of sociology.

AB Warner and England (1995) make a welcome argument for a technological
   science perspective for sociology based on a theory of humans as
   technological agents and an epistemology that includes ethical values.
   As with any sociological perspective, however, Warner and England's
   comments help to focus on and understand some aspects of social life and
   not others. This commentary provides a complementary focus by
   emphasizing the dialectical relationship between human agency and
   technological agency. Furthermore, I argue that a dialectical view is
   necessary for grounding Warner and England's theoretical argument and
   for acting on their ethical argument. Implications of a dialectical
   perspective for the meaning and politics of technology are explored. The
   paper concludes with a discussion of the suitability of ''science'' as a
   metaphor for sociology.

AB Bell's (1995) critique of our discussion of a technological science
   perspective for sociology is a helpful effort to maintain a balance
   between our emphasis on agency and creativity and on the constraining
   side of society. We emphasize agency as part of a dialectic between
   human effort and societal resistance for three reasons. First, it forces
   reconceptualization of the nature of the science of sociology by
   shifting from a positivist mode to one that is pragmatic. The meaning of
   scientific findings changes. Second, agency has been ignored
   historically while constraint has been overemphasized. We seek to
   establish a balance by reentering the notion of agency into sociological
   discourse. Third, agency is a mechanism for modifying constraints and
   solving the problems associated with social technologies. In the closing
   paragraphs of the reply, we suggest that the view under discussion be
   seen as an ethical pragmatism. Agency forces us to ethical questions and
   a pragmatic understanding of science.

AB Sociology of ''primitive societies'' has revised its earlier views about
   ''kinship,'' lineage, or lineage mode of production. It attempts now to
   show that lineage did not pervade African precolonial societies and that
   other relations, such as capitalist and class relations, were also
   present. This article seeks to reestablish, contrary to the revisionist
   view, the centrality of lineage in African precolonial societies to
   allow for a paradigmatic shift that repudiates evolutionism and brings
   precolonial societies back to the center of the African debate. Because
   in such a reoriented debate Africa ceases to be marginalized and on the
   fringes of other historical experiences, the shift allows,
   paradoxically, the integration of scholarship on Africa into universal
   social theory.

AB This paper offers an analysis of the continuing crisis in sociology that
   is different from those that have appeared in the literature. In
   contrast to the ideological and technical readings, it suggests that the
   origins of the crisis are to be found in the hermeneutic challenge that
   has resulted from the linguistic and multicultural turns. Both of these
   developments have given rise to new discourses within the academy that
   are competing with subfields such as the sociology of the arts and
   race/ethnic relations. The nature and impact of this new competition is
   examined in greater detail through the case of the sociology of race.
   The analysis reveals that these competitive challenges are hermeneutic
   in nature and not primarily technical or ideological. The paper
   concludes with some suggestions for crisis resolution.

AB The use of computer simulation experiments as a tool for working with
   theories is not as widespread in sociology as it is in most scientific
   disciplines. This brief articles explains how modeling is a distinctive
   activity from either ''theory'' or ''empirical analysis'' but how it
   informs both and connects them. Simulation models are artificial objects
   created to translate theoretical generalizations into specific scenarios
   involving states (variables and/or actors) and rates (the dynamic causal
   laws hypothesized to generate change over time in the states).
   Simulation models are analyzed to understand the full range of
   implications of theoretical statements as they apply to producing
   historical realizations under particular circumstances. Simulation
   analysis operates by a method of experimentation, unlike mathematical
   modeling and statistical modeling. The strengths and limitations of
   these three approaches to studying models are discussed and suggested to
   be complementary rather than competitive with each other. Last, this
   article briefly points out some of the unique features of the exemplars
   that compose the remainder of this special issue of Sociological

AB The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with the revival of the ''political culture
   concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly Habermas's account of the
   Western bourgeois public sphere has much in common with the original
   political culture concept associated with Parsonian modernization theory
   in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, the concept of political culture
   is used in a way that is neither political nov cultural. Explaining this
   peculiarity is the central problem addressed in this article and its
   companion piece, which appeared in Sociological Theory, volume 3, number
   2 (1995). I hypothesize that this is the case because the concept itself
   is embedded in an historically constituted political culture (here
   called a conceptual network)-a structured web of conceptual
   relationships that combine into Angle-American citizenship theory. The
   method of an historical sociology of concept formation is used to
   analyze historically and empirically the internal constraints and
   dynamics of this conceptual network. The method draws from new work in
   cultural history and sociology, social studies, and network, narrative,
   and institutional analysis. This research yields three empirical
   findings: this conceptual network has a narrative structure, here called
   the Angle-American citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an
   epistemology of social naturalism; and these elements combine in a
   metanarrative that continues to constrain empirical research in
   political sociology.

   behaviors: homosexual sex, IV drug use, heterosexual sex, or a blood
   transfusion. A questionnaire was used to gather data from a sample of
   college students. Results from a one-way analysis of variance indicated
   that of the four PWA conditions respondents attached the least stigma to
   the PWA in the blood transfusion condition and the greater stigma to the
   PWA in the heterosexual condition. The greatest, but similar, amount of
   stigma was attached to both the homosexual and the IV drug use
   conditions. Multiple regression analysis also revealed several
   significant findings. first, we found that stigma increased as
   homophobia increased in all four PWA conditions. Second, stigma
   increased as AIDS knowledge decreased in the IV drug use and blood
   transfusion conditions. Third, women attached less stigma than men in
   all but the heterosexual condition. Fourth, in the blood transfusion

AB The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between
   wilderness use encounters and degree of privacy achieved at three
   locations within a wilderness. The theoretical perspective of the
   research was grounded in environmental psychology, which emphasized the
   dynamic nature of person and situation fit, rather than the sociology of
   normative behavior. The study depicted privacy as a dependent measure
   and argued that privacy is not the opposite of perceived crowding. It
   also suggested that privacy may be a more appropriate dependent variable
   for encounter studies than those measures used in past recreation
   research. Privacy was operationalized as ''the level of desired privacy
   achieved,'' measured on a 10-point scale. It was then compared with
   level of actual, ideal, and maximum use encounters for 600 users of a
   South Carolina wilderness area. Results indicated that number of actual
   group encounters was inversely related to degree of desired privacy
   achieved, in the hypothesized inverse curve pattern anticipated but
   never proved for satisfaction research. Encounter-privacy curves for
   ideal and maximum encounter levels also resulted in predicted patterns.
   Finally, degree of privacy achieved was negatively affected when ideal
   and maximum encounters were exceeded by actual encounters, showing a
   high degree of congruency between theorized and empirical findings.

   distinctively sociological perspective to the debate. A classroom-based

AB Formal socialization of graduate students into the profession is not
   balanced. All departments offer formal training in research, but teacher
   training is often neglected. A study conducted in 1975 showed that only
   one-half of graduate sociology departments provided teach er training of
   any sort for graduate students. In the past 20 years, however, concern
   for teaching excellence has increased, as has evidence of the
   effectiveness of teacher training. This study examines survey responses
   from 218 U.S. and Canadian sociology departments on the nature of
   teacher training for today's graduate students. Only about half of the
   teaching assistants and graduate students teaching their own courses
   receive formal training, an indication of little change in the
   institutional profile of training programs. We argue that the lack of
   formal socialization into the teacher role, especially compared with
   comprehensive training offered in research methods, contributes to the
   devaluation of teaching among sociologists.

AB Many sociologists seek to develop students' ''sociological
   imaginations,'' especially in their introductory classes. This paper has
   two different but related purposes, one pedagogical and the other
   empirical. First, we try to create some unity about what sociologists
   mean by ''the sociological imagination,'' and how they implement this
   concept. We argue that sociologists, like academics in other
   disciplines, fry to speak in a certain ''voice'' which provides a unique
   analytical framework but is distinct from the jargon of the discipline.
   Our second, empirical goal is to assess why students do or do not learn
   the ''voice'' of sociology. We found that certain background
   characteristics df students hinder or help the development of this
   voice. In addition, contradictory, confusing, and competing
   pedagogies-both within sociology and across disciplines-impede the
   development of the sociological imagination.

   individualistic emphasis of our society; to limited exposure to other
   life situations and issues, especially beyond American political
   debates; and to limited background in theory and methods. These problems
   can be addressed with a course design that uses a collaborative
   problem-solving approach. Students grapple with the results of their own
   fieldwork, and that of their classmates, in an attempt to answer
   important questions about inequality They see the utility of theory as
   they attempt to synthesize and make sense of their answers. Such an
   approach requires a different style of instruction emphasizing

AB Academic reputation rests on publication. But unlike many fields,
   sociology recognizes both journal articles and books, thereby
   complicating the relation of publication to reputation. Drawing on the
   sociology of science and organization theory to analyze elite sociology
   journals and books nominated for a major prize, the authors show how
   genre structures scholarly fields and shapes the reception of texts.
   Method and evidence, not subject matter, distinguish articles from
   books. Private universities ''prefer'' books, while scholars trained at
   public universities are more likely to publish articles. Gender and rank
   are associated with choice of genre, while citation rates increase with
   authors' prior publication records. Books generate conversations across
   subfields and disciplines; articles serve as a currency of evaluation
   within sociology.

AB A meaningful interpretation of the dynamics of recent momentous
   historical changes - most notably the unexpected and surprising
   implosion of the Soviet empire in 1989-1990 - may be obtained by
   recombining aspects of the sociology of religion analyses of Weber and
   Durkheim. In particular, their complementary notions of 'charisma' and
   'collective effervescence' provide an understanding of how social actors
   in coercive secular states, confronted by a seeming monopoly of the use
   of physical force, are able, in certain exceptional circumstances, to
   mobilise and disarm the state. The assembling of the societal or
   national community is the background to Weber's discussion of
   charismatic leadership and the foreground to Durkheim. The 'velvet
   revolutions' of 1989 in various countries of Eastern Europe may be seen
   as manifestations of an historical moment of 'collective effervescence'
   in which the assembled collectivity itself, more than individual
   figures, manifested the empowerment of charisma.

PD FAL 1995
PY 1995
AB One of the most difficult environmental policy challenges facing the
   United States and other societies is that of finding ways to safely
   dispose of hazardous and toxic substances, including nuclear waste
   materials. Efforts to site such facilities have been uniformly
   unsuccessful, due largely to strong public opposition. Although
   supporters of such facilities often emphasize the potential for local
   economic development and other opportunities, opponents focus on a
   variety of threats involving potential risks associated with waste
   disposal. Survey data collected in rural areas of Nevada and Nebraska
   where nuclear waste disposal facilities have been proposed reveal that
   respondents' positions on issues of perceived health and safety risks,
   trust in responsible agencies, anticipated local economic effects, and
   concerns about environmental contamination are key variables predicting
   local response. Even in areas where there may be substantial local
   support for economic opportunities associated with the facilities,
   broad-based fears about nuclear materials and a legacy of distrust in
   the agencies responsible for managing nuclear wastes suggest that
   proposals for such facilities will almost inevitably continue to
   generate strong public opposition.

AB Sociological efforts to understand environment-society relationships
   fall primarily into four conceptual categories. The first three,
   involving analytical separation, analytical primacy, and balanced
   dualism, all draw distinctions between biophysical and social aspects of
   human experience, with subsequent analyses being based on these a priori
   distinctions. The fourth or constructivist approach questions this
   naturalized dichotomy, calling attention instead to mutual contingency
   or conjoint constitution: What we take to be ''physical facts'' are
   likely to be strongly shaped by social construction processes, and at
   the same time, what we take to be ''strictly social'' will often have
   been shaped in part by taken-for-granted realities of the physical
   world. Technology offers important opportunities for tracing these
   interconnections, being an embodiment of both the physical and the
   social. The point is illustrated with a long-term historical analysis of
   a specific physiographic feature-a mountain-that has undergone little
   overt physical change over the centuries, but has undergone repeated
   changes in its social meanings and uses. Few of the changes would have
   been possible in the absence of the mountain's physiographic
   characteristics; similarly, few would have occurred in the absence of
   changing sociocultural definitions and possibilities. The challenge for
   sociology is not just to recognize the importance of both the physical
   and the social factors, and certainly not to argue over the relative
   importance of the two, but to recognize the extent to which what we rake
   to be ''physical'' and ''social'' factors can be conjointly constituted.

AB What do we mean by progress and cumulation in the social and human
   sciences? Recent thinking in the philosophy and history of science has
   led to an abandonment of some versions of logical positivism and of
   verificationism that had a strong deductive and theory testing
   orientation. What is to replace them is less clear. This paper argues
   that progress and cumulation can be seen as a process of evaluation and
   retention within an epistemic community. Scholarly disciplines differ in
   their social structure and in their epistemic and normative commitments.
   Since sociology is a fragmented discipline, progress and cumulation
   differ within its multiple subdisciplines, which to varying extents
   represent epistemic communities. Brief sketches of progress (advance)
   and cumulation in several subdisciplines are offered.

   total number of citations, number of books written graduate institutions
   and year of doctoral degree. The productivity of authors is found to be
   consistent with the pattern first suggested by Lotka. Publication in top
   journals is a relatively open process with a large number of different
   authors publishing over a 20-year period and considerable circulation of
   top publishing authors in adjacent decades. Top publishers and ASA
   presidents appear to follow different career paths. ASA presidents tend
   to receive their doctorates from more elite institutions publish
   substantially more books, and place fewer articles in the major journals
   than do cohorts of top publishing authors.

   forces identity changes. To explicate how the body, identity, and self
   intersect in illness, one mode of living with impairment, adapting, is
   explicated in this article. Adapting means altering life and self to
   accommodate to bodily losses and limits and resolving the lost unity
   between body and self It means struggling with rather than against
   illness. The process of adapting consists of three major stages: (1)
   experiencing and defining impairment, (2) making bodily assessments and,
   subsequently, identity trade-offs, as ill people weigh their losses and
   gains and revise their identity goals, and (3) surrendering to the sick
   self by relinquishing control over illness and by flowing with the
   experience of it. Adapting seldom occurs only once. Rather chronically
   ill people are forced to adapt repeatedly as they experience new losses.
   The data consist of 115 interviews about experiencing chronic illness
   and 25 more focused interviews about the body in chronic illness. The
   strategies of grounded theory provided the methods for completing the
   analysis.

AB Previous studies of stratification in science have found a consistent
   positive correlation between the prestige of the departments where
   scientists received their degrees and the prestige of the departments
   where they obtained jobs, especially their first jobs. This correlation
   held regardless of previous research performance. Two limitations
   associated with these studies are (1) their almost exclusive focus on
   the hard sciences, and (2) their inability to inform a theoretical
   comparison between the hard and soft sciences. This study uses data on
   new sociology Ph.D.s who obtained their first job in Ph.D.-granting
   departments between 1985 and 1992 in order to assess whether the
   stratifying mechanisms in the hiring of sociologists are similar to
   those in the hard sciences. The results are generally consistent with
   previous findings for the hard sciences and suggest that job placement
   in sociology values academic origins over performance. The two strongest
   determinants of the prestige of a first job are the prestige of the
   Ph.D.-granting department and the selectivity of the undergraduate
   institution. In contrast, the effects of predoctorate single- or
   first-authored publications and of mentor's recognition are weak, though
   significant.

TI QUESTION OF CASTE IN MODERN SOCIETY - DURKHEIM CONTRADICTORY THEORIES OF

AB I explore a set of contradictions crucial to Durkheim's work, that
   revolve around the issue of whether modern society (i.e., industrial
   capitalism) is structured according to the principle of individual
   mobility or the principle of caste. Specifically, I analyze Durkheim's
   theories of race, class, and sex to determine if they describe modern
   society in terms of individuals or in terms of castes. I find that
   Durkheim has both a dominant and a subordinate theory for each category.
   I also find that his theories of race and class differ significantly
   from his theories of sex. Durkheim's dominant theories of race and class
   and his subordinate theory of sex are theories of individuals in modern
   society. Conversely, his dominant theory of sex and his subordinate
   theories of race and class are theories of castes in modern society. I
   view Durkheim's social theory as a quintessential construction of
   modernity, and I view Durkheim as a quintessential liberal ''of sorts.''
   I conclude that the contradictions at the heart of Durkheim's social
   theory are contradictions at the heart of modern society-and at the
   heart of liberal ideology.

AB In this paper we juxtapose assimilationist and diversity arguments found
   in recent metatheoretical discussions about a crisis in North American
   sociology. Each argument identifies a very different crisis, yet the
   remedies proposed appear similar in certain instances. We suggest that
   the assimilationist response to the crisis reproduces it, because this
   response requires exclusivity in sociological inquiry. Diversity
   reasoning acknowledges different forms of inquiry, largely as
   representing situated actors in different relations of domination. In
   doing so, diversity reasoning points towards how to transcend
   exclusivity because it implicitly focuses on issues related to the
   question ''sociology for whom?'' (Lee 1976). In the last part of this
   paper, we offer one possible way to elaborate further the potential for
   this transcendence: making social problems the explicit focus of
   sociological knowledge and incorporating nonacademic communities into
   sociological projects.

AB Persistent fiscal constraints in higher education pose special risks for
   sociology. The organization of academia gives all departments problems
   in self-governance. But these problems are intensified for sociology by
   features that can be sources of both strength and weakness (e.g., an
   affinity for students with agendas of reform and radical criticism) and
   that tend to attract critical attention from administrators and make it
   hard for sociologists to agree how to respond to external threats. The
   expansion of the American Sociological Association's activities beyond
   its original focus exacerbates the difficulties of dealing with
   disciplinary issues and reaching consensual strategies to confront them.

AB As interest in ethnics and their entrepreneurial activities has grown in
   recent years, sociologists have come to emphasize the importance of
   ethnic social structures as the source of actions propelling business
   growth. In a sign of convergence with the 'new economic sociology',
   recent literature suggests that embeddedness in ethnic networks and
   communities leads to cooperative, if not conformist, behaviour among
   ethnic economic actors. This article looks at the 'other side' of
   embeddedness, through a case-study of African-American, Caribbean,
   Korean and white construction contractors in New York City. I argue
   that, in construction, the embeddedness of economic behaviour in ongoing
   social relations among a myriad of social actors impedes access to
   outsiders. Embeddedness contributes to the liabilities of newness that
   all neophytes encounter, breeding a preference for established players
   with track records. However, the convergence of economic and ethnic ties
   has a further baneful effect, since outsiders also fall outside those
   networks that define the industrial community, While African-American,
   Caribbean and Korean outsiders all experience these barriers in similar
   ways, they differ in the adaptive strategies that they have pursued.
   African Americans appear to be most disadvantaged, in part because they
   have been the most exposed to the social closure that results from the
   mobilization of white ethnics' social capital. By contrast, Caribbeans
   and Koreans entered the labour market in societies where racial
   domination played little or no role in labour market outcomes - a
   considerable asset since construction skills are transferable from one
   society to another. The Koreans appear to be the most embedded in ethnic
   networks, through which they secure jobs and skilled labour, though
   class factors play a role here as well and even the Koreans must reach
   out beyond the ethnic community for a clientele. By contrast, ethnic
   solidarity operates less powerfully among the black contractors, who are
   tied to a community where intra-ethnic diversity and internal
   competition have grown as a result of immigration. In the absence of an
   ethnic market, black entrepreneurs turn to the state, whose requirements
   and dependence on union labour expose black builders to risks from which
   their Korean counterparts are sheltered.

AB In order to derive functionalism from Durkheim and Weber, Parsons had to
   openly break with some twenty of their theoretical assertions. Express
   rejections of classical themes lie at the foundation of functionalist
   sociology. This very foundation is what came unglued by Garfinkel's
   empirical studies of Parsonian social dynamics. In correcting the
   inadequacies of functionalism, many of the themes rejected by Parsons
   have been inadvertently resurrected and developed by
   ethnomethodologists, albeit in altered form. This is not to say that
   Garfinkel and classical theorists are saying the same things but rather
   to point out some historical continuities that have gone largely
   unrecognized. To recognize these thematic continuities is to gather an
   improved radical vision of society and social practices. Such
   perspective also provides new understanding of how and why functionalist
   theory would arise in the first place, namely as an instance of Weberian
   rationalization and Durkheimian anomie-prevention ritual.

AB The English translation of Habermas's The Structural Transformation of
   the Public Sphere converges with a recent trend toward the revival of
   the ''political culture concept'' in the social sciences. Surprisingly,
   Habermas's account of the Western bourgeois public sphere has much in
   common with the original political culture concept associated with
   Parsonian modernization theory in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases,
   the concept of political culture is used in a way that is neither
   political nor cultural. Explaining this peculiarity is the central
   problem addressed in this article and one to follow I hypothesize that
   this is the case because the concept itself is embedded in an
   historically constituted political culture (here called a conceptual
   network)-a structured web of conceptual relationships that combine into
   Anglo-American citizenship theory. The method of an historical sociology
   of concept formation is introduced to analyze historically and
   empirically the internal constraints and dynamics of this conceptual
   network. The method draws from new work in cultural history and
   sociology, social studies, and network, narrative, and institutional
   analysis. This research yields three empirical findings: this conceptual
   network has a narrative structure, here called the Anglo-American
   citizenship story; this narrative is grafted onto an epistemology of
   social naturalism; and these elements combine in a metanarrative that
   continues to constrain empirical research in political sociology.

AB The individual and departmental factors affecting graduate students'

   students in 16 graduate programs in sociology.  Using Rosenbaum's

   of social psychological integration, this study examines students'
   access to initial funding, resources in the department, indicators of
   prior ability, current professional activities, mentoring processes, and
   social psychological factors for their effects on socialization into the
   academic profession.  Access to initial funding and to mentoring have
   substantial effects on PhD students' professional socialization, but
   prove to be less than rational processes in the graduate program.  This
   socialization process is found to be based more on particularistic than
   on universalistic criteria in the allocation of departmental resources
   and mentoring.  Implications for graduate student mentoring, funding,

AB This paper examines the schorlary content of four widely adopted

   material to support their positions, we found substantial differences in
   the sources selected as noteworthy, including a heavy reliance on
   nonacademic sources such as newspapers and weekly magazines.  The use of
   popular sources was associated with the author's scholarly publication
   records:  stronger records coincided with a more scientifically grounded
   presentation of the discipline.  Despite the limitations of the standard
   introductory textbook, we view it as the best way to convey the content
   of sociology.  Also, because most students probably base their
   perceptions of sociology on the introductory course, the textbook plays
   a pivotal role:  how source materials are used to present sociology in
   introductory textbooks may affect students' perceptions about the
   utility of the discipline.

AB Sociology was founded in the nineteenth century as a discipline for the

   has been attacked by both liberals and conservatives.  The attacks have
   left the discipline vulnerable both inside and outside academia.  This
   paper argues that other sciences have faced similar problems.  By
   following their example and by teaching sociology courses as laboratory
   sciences, we are most likely to legitimate the knowledge of the
   discipline and overcome public and student skepticism.  Improvements in
   computer software offer a growing number of laboratory options for
   classroom use, including surveys of students, which permit scientific
   demonstrations of social facts.  Although such surveys are not new to
   the discipline, they should be used more frequently to overcome
   students' skepticism and to motivate students to pursue independent
   social investigations.

AB Transformations within religious institutions and traditions often occur
   via conflict and internal social movements.  Yet previous research on
   such phenomena has missed some important sociological insights because
   it has not incorporated methodological and theoretical resources from
   other sociological literatures dealing with social movements and
   organizational change and conflict.  This paper presents a comprehensive
   critical review of extant research on intradenominational conflict and
   identifies and describes five shortcomings in this literature.  As a
   corrective, we suggest that analysts focus on organizations and conflict
   events as units of analysis, pay more attention to ideal factors in
   conflict, examine relationships between internal and external variables,
   and compare conflicts across organizations and across time.  These
   alternative methodological recommendations are related to three new
   theoretical directions in other sociological subfields:  resource
   mobilization theory's focus on intermediate levels of social life, the
   ''new institutionalist'' emphasis on how organizational actors respond
   to their environments, and the recent work on the interplay of
   ''schemas'' and ''resources'' in social structure.  Such new directions
   address questions that were not accessible via earlier approaches.  They
   also begin to build important bridges between the sociology of religion
   and other sociological subfields.

   subfields of sociology - such as labor market sociology, stratification,
   and work and organizations - have been significantly influenced by
   economic theories; but sociology has had relatively little impact on
   economics. Communication between economics and sociology is hindered by
   intellectual barriers such as fundamentally different assumptions with
   regard to the roles of induction and deduction, as well as by
   institutional and professional obstacles. Opportunities are growing for
   integrating sociological and economic explanations, as the interests of
   sociologists and economists are converging and more work is now

AB This article maps out some interdependencies between political science
   and political sociology. It then details some lessons that political
   sociologists might take from four contemporary literatures in political
   science: (1) rational choice work on rational individual action in
   institutional context; (2) the ''nonlinear social systems'' literature
   on the contextual determination of intensely embedded social actions;
   (3) the game-theoretic literature on strategic interactions among large
   emergent class and state actors; and (4) a more qualitative inductive,
   and contextualized approach to the analysis of class and state action
   extending the tradition of Barrington Moore. The four literatures share
   a commitment to social action that is decreasingly common among
   sociologists. Yet they address questions of institutional constraint,
   contextual dynamics, and macrosocial history akin to those that are
   engaging their sociological contemporaries. This balance of attention
   between action and its constraints is the common element drawn from the
   several instructive political science literatures.

AB In the area of social psychology, sociologists have drawn more
   frequently from psychologists than the reverse. This is in part because
   sociologists more often assess the degree to which status
   characteristics, social relationships, and structural contexts influence
   individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, while psychologists more
   often explicate the mechanisms through which such social factors affect
   individuals. I illustrate these differences by discussing points of
   parallel theoretical development between the two disciplines,
   substantive divisions of labor, and selected topics of mutual inquiry.
   Although sociologists benefit substantially from psychologists' work,
   sociologists could offer their counterparts more pointed demonstrations
   that sociological mechanisms are crucial for explaining key
   psychological phenomena and that structural contexts constrain
   individuals' behaviors in ways often overlooked by psychologists.

   way of approaching, explaining, and interpreting general sociological
   problems. By situating social action and social structures in their
   historical contexts and by examining their historical unfoldings,
   historical sociologists exploit the temporality of social life to ask
   and answer questions of perennial importance to social theory. I draw on
   recent research and literature both in sociology and in history to argue
   that we should and can continue to deepen the discipline's ''historical
   turn'' by more thoroughly historicizing how we conduct research,
   understand and use basic analytic concepts, and develop and test general
   social theories.

AB We argue that sociology should be the integrative discipline for the
   scientific study of religion. Sociology has made considerable progress
   by incorporating specialized knowledge of religion from disciplines
   ranging from gerontology and community psychology to religious
   economics, church history, and even theology. Sociology has also
   generated insights in other disciplines concerned with the study of
   religion, at times shaping the types of questions asked, the concepts
   and research methods employed, and the conclusions reached in these
   fields. To elaborate our arguments, iue focus on two important
   substantive areas: (1) research on the relationships between religion,
   meaning systems, and personal well-being; and (2) research on religious
   behavior and religious markets. We underscore the integrative role of
   sociology, and identify several neglected opportunities for synthesis.
   In addition, briefly assess the effect of sociology on work in other
   disciplines and on the functioning of religious organizations.

AB This study explores contemporary regional variations in African American
   religious life. Building on a rich tradition of historical and
   ethnographic research on the Black church, we contrast the religious
   environments that have traditionally prevailed in the Black communities
   of the rural South and urban non-South. We emphasize regional variations
   in (1) the social role of religious institutions, (2) the availability
   of alternative lifestyles and secular opportunities for status and
   resources, and (3) the social norms and community expectations regarding
   church involvement A series of hypotheses regarding patterns and
   correlates of church participation are then tested, using data from the
   National Survey of Black Americans. Findings indicate that historical
   regional variations in African American religious life persist in the
   contemporary period. Moreover, our results suggest that the rural
   southern Black church retains ifs traditional ''semi-involuntary''
   character and we discuss the broader theoretical implications of this
   issue for future research in the sociology of religion.

   communications and better public relations.  The problem is that the

   and the public.  Many see us as rebels of the 1960s, political liberals,
   and impractical thinkers with a penchant for jargon.  Even our research
   is derided by some as a waste of money.  The solution consists of
   strategies for overcoming our poor public image.  Seven strategies for
   doing so are discussed:  (1) Write clearly.  (2) Write for a mass
   audience.  (3) Seek board positions.  (4) Strengthen our identity.  (5)
   Teach sociology in high school.  (6) Develop academic partnerships.  (7)
   Emphasize outcomes:  increase in tolerance and research skills.

AB Marriage and family life have played a prominent role in the development
   of religious movements and communities.  Previous research has linked
   the loss of control over marital and family ties to faltering member
   commitment and the failure of religious communities.  This paper
   investigates the inter-relationships among family structure,
   organizational change, and member commitment and involvement within the
   Hare Krishna movement.  The findings indicate that the ascendancy of the
   nuclear family brought with it a substantial reduction in the level of
   core-members' involvement in the movement, yet had little effect on
   individual commitment or religiosity.  Family life thus served as a
   structural barrier to movement involvement rather than a countervailing
   source of commitment.  The findings are tied to broader theoretical
   issues related to the declining scope of leader authority, the demise of
   the religious community, and secularization.

AB This paper argues that identity politics is a form of high-risk
   activism. We draw from collective identity approaches to social
   movements to describe how the Sociologists' Lesbian and Gay Caucus has
   used identity-based organizing, assimilationist politics, and
   personalized political strategies during the past two decades to
   challenge stigmatized representations of same-sex sexuality and promote
   equal treatment of gays and lesbians in sociology and the larger
   society. Using survey data collected in 1981 and 1992 from counts
   members, supplemented by intensive interviews, we assess the extent to
   which an increase in reported rates of discrimination and bias during
   the pad ten years is linked to variations in activist experience and
   political consciousness. We then present a qualitative analysis of five
   career consequences suffered by gay, lesbian, and bisexual sociologists
   who engage in various forms of personalized political resistance: 1)
   discrimination in hiring; 2) bias in tenure and promotion; 3) exclusion
   from serial and professional networks: 4) devaluation of scholarly work
   on gay and lesbian topics; and 5) harassment and intimidation. We
   conclude by examining the implications of our findings for the social
   movement literature that addresses the formation, use, and impact of
   identity politics.

AB The theory of demographic transition served as the principal descriptive
   tool for fertility change in developing nations for more than 30 years.
   Weaknesses of the theory as both a descriptive and an explanatory
   framework have led largely to its rejection. While a number of
   alternative frameworks have been suggested, none has received the
   widespread support once accorded transition theory. This analysis
   reviews transition theory and argues for the theoretical importance of
   institutional factors in fertility decline. Sub-Saharan Africa serves as
   the locus of the analysis because it remains the world region with the
   highest fertility and the one in which the transition is just beginning.
   The organization of agricultural production is hypothesized to be
   important for fertility behavior and is identified as one of three
   institutional areas in which rural sociology may be uniquely qualified
   to contribute.

   ideas and practices related to the use of seals and signet rings; and
   ekistics, that is, the scientific study of human settlements.  Among the
   subconcepts that are elaborated in service to these developments are
   home territorialization, boundaried communication, and the
   territorialization of the body politic.  Examples are drawn from

AB Schumpeter's writings on the transition from capitalism to socialism, on

   corporation have attracted muck attention among social scientists.
   Although Schumpeter's theoretical and sociological writings resemble the
   works of Marx, Durkheim and Weber in that they further our understanding
   of the rise and nature of modern society, his contribution to social
   theory has yet to be assessed systematically, Arguing that Schumpeter's
   perspective, if understood in social theoretical terms, provides a
   promising starting point for the sociological analysis of the changing
   relationship between economy and society, I concentrate on two elements
   of his work that are of value to theoretical sociology today: the
   distinction between creative action and rational action that is
   fundamental to his theory of the entrepreneur and his thesis that the
   success of the capitalist system leads to its demise.

   extending his theory of the conscious subject to the feminist concern
   with the issue of domination. We present a theoretical analysis of the
   subjective and intersubjective experiences of individuals relating to
   each other as dominant and subordinate; as our theoretical point of
   departure we use Schutz's concepts of the we-relation, the assumption of
   reciprocity of perspectives, typification, working,
   taken-for-grantedness, and relevance. Schutz's sociology of the
   conscious subject is striking in its lack of any extended consideration
   of power; perhaps one reason why support for his work has diminished
   since the mid-1970s. Our overlayering of feminist sociological theory's
   interest in domination with Schutz's concerns about subjectivity and
   intersubjectivity produces an elaboration and a critique of Schutz and
   expands feminist understanding of relationships of domination.

   Revised (DSM-III-R). Drawing an a social worlds perspective in the

   to conflict between feminists and the RPA as was portrayed in the
   popular press; nor, was it a natural result of scientific progress set
   within rational procedures of the revision process within the APA.
   Rather, I argue that as a result of sustained debate and conflict, the
   diagnosis of LLPDD assumed different forms and even became a different
   artifact: 1) In the ''health and mental health domain,'' LLPDD became
   the object of struggle for professional control over mental disorders
   among the various scientific, medical, and mental health fields; 2) in
   the ''woman domain, '' LLPDD was defined as a result of struggle for
   control over the definition of a normal and healthy woman; 3) in the
   ''science domain, '' LLPDD was a site in which the definition of the
   ''truth'' about PMS was debated publicly and the knowledge used in
   settling social and policy issues in powerful organizations like the

AB There is increasing sociological interest in formal models of action
   driven by a calculus of expected utility. We believe these efforts to
   extend microeconomic models to extraeconomic exchange can benefit from
   specification of societal constraints on individual choice. One type of
   constraint locates the actor in an evolving network of social ties that
   limit opportunities for exchange. Another approach assumes that choices
   are influenced by unintended outcomes that operate behind the backs of
   the actors. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years
   incorporating social structure and unintended consequences into formal
   models based on individual choice optimization. We critically examine
   leading contributions to network exchange theory (part 1) and
   evolutionary models of collective action (part 2), and assess how these
   and related developments may shape the future of rational choice theory
   and its place within sociology.

   familiar two-component model of a science, featuring a theoretical and
   an empirical side, to include a computational component. We show how the
   three components interrelate in a triangular system in which empirical
   data analysis, theoretical explanation and computer simulation link the

   narrative in various social contexts, including academic sociolegal
   scholarship. Narratives are social acts that depend for their production
   and cognition on norms of performance and content that specify when,
   what, how, and why stories are told. Because narratives are
   situationally produced and interpreted, they have no necessary political
   or epistemological valence but depend on the particular context and
   organization of their production for their political effect. The
   analysis specifies the variable conditions that produce hegemonic
   tales-stories that reproduce existing relations of power and
   inequity-and subversive stories-narratives that challenge the
   taken-for-granted hegemony by making visible and explicit the
   connections between particular lives and social organization.

   underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian
   approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for
   model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward
   through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can
   be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are
   presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It
   is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and
   standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy
   comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the
   evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory
   or a hypothesis about societal norms.

AB In this paper we consider statistical inference for datasets that are
   nor replicable. We call these datasets, which are common in sociology,
   apparent populations. We review how such data are usually analyzed by
   sociologists and then suggest that perhaps a Bayesian approach has merit
   as an alternative. We illustrate our views with an empirical example.

AB This article provides a general overview of the critical issues and
   problems concerning the current and future status of the profession of
   sociology. The statement of the problem is delineated within a
   futuristic perspective that serves as the introduction to the remaining
   articles in this special issue of Sociological Spectrum. Issues in
   several areas are highlighted, including needed research on the
   sociology of sociology, meeting the challenges of the changing
   workforce, the enhancement and elevation of teaching, and the role and
   development of sociological associations. The challenge and futuristic
   theme of the article is stated in the form of the ancient proverb that
   warns us that ''Where there is no vision, the people perish.''

AB This paper examines the present and future status of sociology
   departments in the United States. An assessment is provided of both
   positive developments and problems experienced by departments and the
   discipline in general. Issues examined include student enrollment and
   degree recipients over the last two decades, enrollment trends in other
   disciplines, recent trends in advertised sociology faculty positions,
   the status of women and minorities, and which departments have and have
   not been eliminated. Based upon this assessment and the growing
   literature in the field dealing with these issues, future prospects for
   departments are discussed, problem areas are identified, and
   recommendations are made concerning the strengthening of the profession.
   While recognizing the challenges faced by sociology, this appraisal
   suggests that negative perceptions within the discipline concerning
   these difficulties can become exaggerated. Attention is directed to
   several issues affecting the status of sociology, including the effects
   of a ''rhetoric of despair.''

AB One source of sociology's organizational and academic problems is a
   growing lack of intellectual self-definition. The frequent celebration
   of sociology as a multiparadigm discipline is both an effect and a
   source of this lack of self-definition. Some of the roots of the present
   crisis are traced to the acceptance of outside values, ideological and
   otherwise, as a means of specifying what is and is not sociologically
   appropriate. As this occurs, we become more and more an adjunct of other
   intellectual and policy-oriented projects, becoming less and less a
   distinctive and intellectually credible discipline that has much to
   offer on ifs own terms. Not being vital to ourselves, we cease to be
   vital to others.
