AB Affirmative action, a controversial topic about which students have many
   misconceptions, lends itself especially well to a sociological analysis.
   This paper describes an approach to teaching that: 1) informs students
   of different affirmative action programs; 2) gives them the opportunity
   to apply and integrate a variety of concepts and research findings
   covered in our sociology courses; 3) allows us to assess how well
   students understand affirmative action and to what degree they retain
   myths about the programs, and 4) covers an emotionally charged topic
   with enough depth to go beyond surface reactions. We find that this
   integrated approach dispels some of the most common myths, leads
   students to become more thoughtful and analytical, and gives them a good
   foundation from which to examine affirmative action in the future.

AB Jeffrey Alexander's recent book on cultural sociology argues that
   sociologists must grant the realm of ideas autonomy to determine
   behavior, unencumbered by interference from instrumental or material
   factors. He criticizes the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu as "weak" for
   failing to give autonomy to culture by reducing it to self-interested
   behavior that immediately reflects class position. However, Alexander's
   arguments seriously distort and misstate Bourdieu's theory, which
   provides for the relative autonomy of culture through the concepts of
   habitus and field. Because habitus is a set of durable dispositions
   conditioned by past structures, it may contradict the changed structures
   of the present. Further, the influence of the habitus is always mediated
   by the structure and strategies of the field of contest in which it is
   deployed, so that the same habitus may motivate different actions in
   different circumstances. However, Alexander is correct to argue that in
   Bourdieu's theory culture generally serves to reproduce, not contradict
   social structures. Yet Bourdieu addresses this and other problems in his
   later work, in which he argues for the existence of certain cultural
   universals transcending particular structures.

AB Two important human action selection processes are the choice by
   citizens of parties to support in elections and the choice by party
   leaders of policy ' packages' offered to citizens in order to attract
   this support. Having reviewed approaches analysing these choices and the
   reasons for doing this using the methodology of agent-based modelling,
   we extend a recent agent-based model of party competition to treat the
   number and identity of political parties as an output of, rather than an
   input to, the process of party competition. Party birth is modelled as
   an endogenous change of agent type from citizen to party leader, which
   requires describing citizen dissatisfaction with the history of the
   system. Endogenous birth and death of parties transforms into a dynamic
   system even in an environment where all agents have otherwise
   non-responsive adaptive rules. A key parameter is the survival
   threshold, with lower thresholds leaving citizens on average less
   dissatisfied. Paradoxically, the adaptive rule most successful for party
   leaders in winning votes makes citizens on average less happy than under
   other policy-selection rules.

AB Background
   The relative impact of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) on
   health-related quality of life (HRQL) compared to other chronic liver
   diseases has not been fully explored.
   Aim
   To compare the domain scores of the 29-item Chronic Liver Disease
   Questionnaire (CLDQ) for patients with NAFLD to those with chronic
   hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C.
   Methods
   A HRQL questionnaire, CLDQ, was routinely administered to patients
   attending a liver clinic. Additional clinical and laboratory data were
   obtained on patients with NAFLD, chronic hepatitis B, and chronic
   hepatitis C from our quality of life database. Scores for each of the
   six CLDQ domains were compared using one-way ANOVA and multiple
   regression.
   Results
   Complete data were available for 237 patients. NAFLD patients scored
   lowest on multiple CLDQ domains. Based on the bivariate data, NAFLD
   patients have the poorest HRQL, followed by chronic hepatitis C and
   chronic hepatitis B patients. Multivariate analysis showed that some
   specific domain score correlations remained significant for NAFLD
   diagnosis, cirrhosis, gender, and body mass index.
   Conclusion
   NAFLD patients had significantly lower quality of life scores compared
   with patients with hepatitis B or hepatitis C on multiple CLDQ domains,
   suggesting that HRQL was severely impaired in patients with NAFLD.

   that are not sufficiently well defined. We model cultural
   differentiation as a separation of groups whose members prefer similar
   neighbors, with a characteristic group size at which violence occurs.
   Application of this model to the area of the former Yugoslavia and to
   India accurately predicts the locations of reported conflict. This model
   also points to imposed mixing or boundary clarification as mechanisms

AB Background: Accidents (including motor vehicle injuries) are a leading
   cause of death among American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/AN). The
   purpose of this study was to examine geographic variation and the
   existence of a seat belt law on seat belt use among AI/AN and
   non-Hispanic whites (NHW).
   Methods: Self-reported seat belt behavior data from the 1997 and 2002
   Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed in 2006-2007
   and were restricted to AI/AN (n = 4310 for 2002, and n = 1758 for 1997)
   and NHW (n = 193,617 for 2002, and n = 108,551 for 1997) aged 18 years
   and older.
   Results: Seat belt non-use varied significantly across geographic
   regions for both AI/AN and NHW. For example, AI/AN living in the
   Northern Plains (odds ratio [OR] = 12.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]
   =6.5-23.7) and Alaska (OR = 10.3, 95%CI=5.3-19.9) had significantly
   higher seat belt non-use compared to AI/AN living in the West. In
   addition, compared to those residing in urban areas, those living in
   rural areas were 60% more likely in NHW and 2.6 times more likely in
   AI/AN not to wear a seat belt. Both AI/AN and NHW living in states
   without primary seat belt laws were approximately twice as likely to
   report seat belt non-use in 2002 as those living in states with primary
   laws. In states with primary laws enacted between 1997 and 2002, AI/AN
   experienced greater decline in seat belt non-use than NHW.
   Conclusions: Seat belt use among AI/AN and NHW varied significantly by
   region and urban-rural residency in 2002. Primary seat belt laws appear
   to help reduce regional and racial disparities in seat belt non-use.

AB Background: Health researchers rarely measure accumulated wealth to
   reflect socioeconomic status/ position (SES). In order to determine
   whether health research should more frequently include measures of
   wealth, this study assessed the relationship between wealth and health.
   Methods: Studies published between 1990 to 2006 were systematically
   reviewed. Included studies used wealth and at least one other SES
   measure as independent variables, and a health-related dependent
   variable.
   Results: Twenty-nine studies met inclusion criteria. Measures of wealth
   varied greatly. In most studies, greater wealth was associated with
   better health, even after adjusting for other SES measures. The findings
   appeared most consistent when using detailed wealth measures on specific
   assets and debts, rather than a single question. Adjusting for wealth
   generally decreased observed racial/ethnic disparities in health.
   Conclusions: Health studies should include wealth as an important SES
   indicator. Failure to measure wealth may result in under-estimating the
   contribution of SES to health, such as when studying the etiology of
   racial/ethnic disparities. Validation is needed for simpler approaches
   to measuring wealth that would be feasible in health studies.

   Design: Twelve pediatric practices were randomly assigned to receive
   access to collaborative consultative services or to a control group.
   Setting: Community-based pediatric offices. Participants: Fifty-two
   pediatricians and their 377 patients with
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD).
   Intervention: A collaborative consultative service promoting the use of
   titration trials and periodic monitoring during medication maintenance.
   Main Outcome Measure: Physician practice behaviors and child ADHD
   symptomatology.
   Results: Using self-report of pediatricians, the collaborative
   consultative service increased the use of evidencebased practices by
   pediatricians, but no difference in children's ADHD symptomatology was
   observed between the groups. However, many pediatricians did not fully
   use the collaborative consultative services. Those children who actually
   received collaborative consultative services showed significant
   behavioral improvement compared with children not receiving these
   services.
   Conclusions: When actually implemented by pediatricians, the
   collaborative consultative service appears to be an effective method for
   facilitating evidence-based treatment procedures for ADHD and use of
   these procedures appear to improve children's outcomes. Barriers to
   implementation of collaborative consultative service in pediatric
   practice need to be further understood.

AB Objective: To assess the association between exposure to movie smoking
   and established adolescent smoking.
   Design: Longitudinal survey of a representative US adolescent sample.
   Setting: Adolescents were surveyed by telephone in their homes.
   Participants: Sixty-five hundred twenty-two US adolescents aged 10 to 14
   years at baseline, resurveyed at 8 months (8M) (n= 5503), 16 months
   (16M) (n= 5019), and 24 months (24M) (n= 4575).
   Main Exposure: Exposure to smoking in 532 box-office hits released in
   the 5 years prior to the baseline survey.
   Outcome Measure: Established smoking (having smoked more than 100
   cigarettes during lifetime).
   Results: Of 108 incident established smokers with data at the 24M
   survey, 85% were current (30-day smokers) and 83% endorsed at least 1
   addiction symptom. Established smoking incidence was 7.4, 15.8, and 19.7
   per 1000 person-years of observation for the baseline-to-8M, 8Mto16M,
   and 16M-to-24M observation periods, respectively. In a multivariate
   survival model, risk of established smoking was predicted by baseline
   exposure to smoking in movies with an adjusted overall hazard ratio of
   2.04 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-4.12) for teens in the 95th
   percentile of movie-smoking exposure compared with the 5th percentile.
   This effect was independent of age; parent, sibling, or friend smoking;
   and sensation seeking. Teens low on sensation seeking were more
   responsive to themovie-smoking effect (hazard ratio, 12.7; 95%
   confidence interval, 2.0-80.6) compared with teens who were high on
   sensation seeking (hazard ratio, 1.01; 95% confidence interval,
   0.4-2.6).
   Conclusion: In this national US adolescent sample, exposure to smoking
   in movies predicted risk of becoming an established smoker, an outcome
   linked with adult dependent smoking and its associated morbidity and
   mortality.

   Participants: Eight-to 15-year-old children (N= 3082) in the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
   Main Outcome Measures: The Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children
   (caregiver module) was used to ascertain the presence of ADHD in the
   past year based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
   (Fourth Edition) (DSM-IV) criteria. Prior diagnosis of ADHD by a health
   professional and ADHD medication use were assessed by caregiver report.
   Results: Of the children, 8.7% met DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The poorest
   children (lowest quintile) were more likely than the wealthiest (highest
   quintile) to fulfill criteria for ADHD(adjusted odds ratio [ AOR], 2.3;
   95% confidence interval [ CI], 1.4-3.9). Among children meeting DSM-IV
   ADHD criteria, 47.9% had a prior diagnosis of ADHD and 32.0% were
   treated consistently with ADHD medications during the past year. Girls
   were less likely than boys to have their disorder identified (AOR, 0.3;

   Conclusions: Of US children aged 8 to 15 years, 8.7%, an estimated 2.4
   million, meetDSM-IVcriteria forADHD. Less than half of children
   meetingDSM-IVcriteria report receiving either a diagnosis ofADHDor

AB Objective: To determine the effect of a school-based intervention to
   promote healthful nutrition and physical activity on disordered
   weight-control behaviors (self-induced vomiting or use of laxatives or
   diet pills to control weight) in early adolescent girls and boys.
   Design: Using a group-randomized, controlled-trial design, we randomly
   assigned middle schools to an intervention or control condition.
   Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to assess the effect
   of the intervention on the odds of reporting a new case of disordered
   weight-control behaviors at follow-up, adjusting for sex, school-level
   prevalence of disordered weight-control behaviors at baseline, and
   school clusters. Students reporting these behaviors at baseline were
   excluded from the analyses.
   Setting: Thirteen middle schools.
   Participants: At baseline, 749 girls and 702 boys in grades 6 and 7.
   Intervention: The 5-2-1 Go! intervention (Planet Health obesity
   prevention curriculum plus School Health Index for Physical Activity and
   Healthy Eating: A Self-Assessment and Planning Guide, Middle/High School
   Version) was implemented during 2 school years, from November 2002
   through May 2004.
   Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported disordered weight-control behaviors
   in last 30 days at follow-up.
   Results: At follow-up in girls, 3.6% (15 of 422) in control schools
   compared with 1.2% (4 of 327) in intervention schools reported engaging
   in disordered weightcontrol behaviors (P=. 04). Multivariate analyses
   indicated that the odds of these behaviors in girls in intervention
   schools were reduced by two thirds compared with girls in control
   schools (odds ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.97). No
   intervention effect was observed in boys.
   Conclusions: Results add compelling support for the effectiveness of an
   interdisciplinary, school-based obesity prevention intervention to
   prevent disordered weightcontrol behaviors in early adolescent girls.

   resources among patients 20 years and younger and to explore the effects
   of certain sociodemographic and health care system-related factors and
   injury severity on use of hospital resources and lengths of stay (LOSs)
   in the United States.
   Design: Data from the 2003 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids'
   Inpatient Database were used.
   Setting: Pediatric inpatient care in 3438 hospitals in 36 US states.
   Patients: Patients 20 years and younger hospitalized with MVC-related
   injuries.
   Main Outcome Measures: National estimates of MVCassociated
   hospitalizations, rates, resource use, Injury Severity Scores, and
   demographics were calculated. Potentially significant covariate
   associations were studied using hospital charges and LOS.
   Results: Sixty-two thousand eight hundred eighty MVC-related
   hospitalizations occurred among patients 20 years and younger in the
   United States in 2003, resulting in more than $ 2.0 billion (SD=$ 1.2
   million) in inpatient charges and 304 196 days (SD= 55 113 days) of
   hospitalization. Mean (SD) hospital charges and LOS were $ 33 440 ($ 55
   113) and 4.8 (7.7) days, respectively. The mean (SD) Injury Severity
   Score was 10.3 (11.4). Adolescents aged 18 through 20 years had the
   highest hospitalization rates (197 cases per 100 000 children). Older
   age, being male, urban hospital location, mortality during
   hospitalization, higher injury severity, and longer LOS were
   significantly associated with higher total charges. Longer LOS was
   significantly associated with older age, urban hospital location, higher
   injury severity, and mortality.
   Conclusion: Motor vehicle crash-related injuries among children burden
   health care resources, with nationwide charges exceeding $ 2 billion

AB We assess the potential benefits from innovative forecasts of the stream
   flows that replenish reservoirs in the semi-arid state of Ceara, Brazil.
   Such forecasts have many potential applications. In Ceara, they matter
   for both water-allocation and participatory-governance issues that echo
   global debates. Our qualitative analysis, based upon extensive fieldwork
   with farmers, agencies, politicians and other key actors in the water
   sector, stresses that forecast value changes as a society shifts. In the
   case of Ceara, current constraints on the use of these forecasts are
   likely to be reduced by shifts in water demand, water allocation in the
   agricultural Jaguaribe Valley, participatory processes for water
   allocation between this valley and the capital city of Fortaleza, and
   risk perception. Such changes in the water sector can also have major
   distributional impacts.

AB The causes of stillbirth were investigated in two case series drawn from
   distinct communities within the same geographic region in New Jersey,
   one characterized by affluence (Hackensack Medical Center, Bergen
   County) and one by poverty (University Hospital,, Essex County). The
   data was obtained over 4 years (1998-2001) from a stillbirth autopsy
   service available to all. obstetrics-gynecology clinicians in the
   northern New Jersey area. A total of 52 stillbirths from University
   Hospital in Newark (Essex County) and 55 from Hackensack Medical Center
   (Bergen County) were examined by this same autopsy service. Cause(s)
   were identified for 70% of stillbirth cases. Whereas population-based
   data revealed that the rate of stillbirths was higher in Essex and
   mothers of stillbirths in Essex were of younger age, greater parity, and
   gravidity and had higher rates of smoking, single marital status, and
   very low birth weight infants, the only significant difference between
   the two case series was infection, detected in 35% of stillbirths from
   University Hospital versus 14% from Hackensack. Also no difference in
   the incidence of stillbirth due to unknown cause was found between the
   case series.

AB Developmental theory suggests that a well-developed ethnic identity
   serves as a secure position which allows people to be more open and
   accepting to people from other ethnic groups. To examine this
   prediction, two studies were carried out. In Study 1, 713 college
   freshmen from four ethnic groups were surveyed regarding positive
   attitudes toward other groups and were assigned to ethnic identity
   statuses on the basis of scores on the Multigroup Ethnic Identity
   Measure (Phinney, 1992). The results showed that Asian American and
   Latino students with an achieved ethnic identity reported significantly
   more positive attitudes toward other groups than did those in ethnic
   identity diffusion. Study 2 used qualitative methods with 124
   adolescents from five ethnic groups. Ethnic identity and intergroup
   attitudes were assessed with open-ended questions regarding views of
   one's own ethnicity and experiences with other ethnic groups. Results
   showed that ethnic identity achieved adolescents, compared to diffuse
   adolescents, gave responses indicating greater awareness and
   understanding of intergroup relations. Overall, the results provide
   evidence that a secure ethnic identity is associated with positive
   intergroup attitudes and mature intercultural thinking.

AB This study characterizes several aspects of emerging ethnic identity in
   childhood and its associations with interethnic group social
   preferences. Understanding these processes is important, as early
   interethnic group social practices may form a foundation for later
   interethnic group attitudes and behaviors in adolescence. Children of
   Cambodian, Dominican, and Portuguese heritage (aged 6-12 years)
   consistently and accurately identified with labels of their family's
   nationality of origin across the three study years, and reported strong
   ethnic pride. In support of existing developmental models of ethnic
   identity in adolescence, older children demonstrated greater ethnic
   identity exploration than younger children. Importantly, for
   second-generation children, a positive sense of ethnic identity was not
   only associated with ingroup social preferences, but also ethnic
   outgroup social preferences. Findings are discussed with regard to
   existing models of ethnic identity development.

AB Bangladesh society is profoundly gender stratified, and yet male roles

   This study examines the association between men's reproductive health
   knowledge, attitude and behaviour and their wives' subsequent
   reproductive behaviour using longitudinal data from the International
   Centre for Diarrhoea] Disease Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). A total of
   4969 matched husband-and-wife data from a 1998 survey and women's
   contraceptive use history data following this survey are used. Results
   show a significant association between husbands' fertility preferences
   and current use of any family planning method. When wives' background
   characteristics, and husbands' background and socioeconomic
   characteristics are controlled for, the predicted probability of using a
   method of contraception among non-educated wives whose husbands want
   more children is 0.49 compared with 0.64 for those whose husbands do not
   want more children. However, the net effect of husbands' preference for
   additional children diminishes as wives' level of education increases.
   Among wives who had completed high school, the predicted probability of
   using a method of contraception is 0.70 for those whose husbands want
   more children compared with 0.69 for those whose husbands do not want
   more children.

AB Cotext: Studies documenting racial/ethnic disparities in health care
   frequently implicate physicians' unconscious biases. No study to date
   has measured physicians' unconscious racial bias to test whether this
   predicts physicians' clinical decisions.
   Objective: To test whether physicians show implicit race bias and
   whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations
   for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes.
   Design, Setting, and participants: An internet-based tool comprising a
   clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department
   with an acute coronary syndrome, followed by a questionnaire and three
   Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were e-mailed to
   all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic
   medical centers in Atlanta and Boston; 287 completed the study, met
   inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white
   vignette patient.
   Main outcome measurements: IAT scores (normal continuous variable)
   measuring physicians' implicit race preference and perceptions of
   cooperativeness. Physicians' attribution of symptoms to coronary artery
   disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race, and their
   decisions about thrombolysis. Assessment of physicians' explicit racial
   biases by questionnaire.
   Results: Physicians reported no explicit preference for white versus
   black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast,
   IATs revealed implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT
   score=0.36, P <.001, one-sample t test) and implicit stereotypes of
   black Americans as less cooperative with medical procedures (mean IAT
   score 0.22, Pe <.001), and less cooperative generally (mean IAT score
   0.30, P <.001). As physicians' prowhite implicit bias increased, so did
   their likelihood of treating white patients and not treating black
   patients with thrombolysis (P=.009).
   Conclusions: This study represents the first evidence of unconscious
   (implicit) race bias among physicians, its dissociation from conscious
   (explicit) bias, and its predictive validity. Results suggest that
   physicians' unconscious biases may contribute to racial/ethnic
   disparities in use of medical procedures such as thrombolysis for
   myocardial infarction.

   Objective: To determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in

   Design: Retrospective cohort study of female Medicare patients.
   Setting: Entire states of Illinois, New York, and Florida.
   Participants: Female Medicare recipients aged 65-89 years old with hip
   fractures between January 2001 and June 2003.
   Measuremens: Differences in bone density testing by race/ethnicity and
   zip-code level socioeconomic characteristics during the 2-year period
   preceding and the 6-month period following a hip fracture.
   Results: Among all 35,681 women with hip fractures, 20.7% underwent bone
   mineral density testing in the 2 years prior to fracture and another
   6.2% underwent testing in the 6 months after fracture. In a logistic
   regression model adjusted for age, state, and comorbidity, women of
   black race were about half as likely (RR 0.52 [0.43, 0.62]) and Hispanic
   women about 2/3 as likely (RR 0.66 [0.54, 0.80]) as white women to
   undergo testing before their fracture. They remained less likely (RR
   0.66 [0.50, 0.88] and 0.58 [0.39, 0.87], respectively) to undergo
   testing after fracture. In contrast, women residing in zip codes in the
   lowest tertile of income and education were less likely than those in
   higher-income and educational tertiles to undergo testing before
   fracture, but were no less likely to undergo testing in the 6 months
   after fracture.
   Conclusions: Racial, but not socioeconomic, differences in osteoporosis
   evaluation continued to occur even after Medicare patients had
   demonstrated their propensity to fracture. Future interventions may need
   to target racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities differently.

AB Socioeconomic status (SES) is frequently implicated as a contributor to
   the disparate health observed among racial/ ethnic minorities, women and
   elderly populations. Findings from studies that examine the role of SES
   and health disparities, however, have provided inconsistent results.
   This is due in part to the: 1) lack of precision and reliability of
   measures; 2) difficulty with the collection of individual SES data; 3)
   the dynamic nature of SES over a lifetime; 4) the classification of
   women, children, retired and unemployed persons; 5) lack of or poor
   correlation between individual SES measures; and 6) and inaccurate or
   misleading interpretation of study results. Choosing the best variable
   or approach for measuring SES is dependent in part on its relevance to
   the population and outcomes under study. Many of the commonly used
   compositional and contextual SES measures are limited in terms of their
   usefulness for examining the effect of SES on outcomes in analyses of
   data that include population subgroups known to experience health
   disparities. This article describes SES measures, strengths and
   limitations of specific approaches and methodological issues related to
   the analysis and interpretation of studies that examine SES and health

AB Both satisfaction with the physician and how time is spent in the

   African-American and Caucasian patients. This study uses structural
   equation modeling to examine racial differences in the association
   between time use during the outpatient visit and patient satisfaction.
   This cross-sectional study employed direct observation of outpatient
   visits and surveys of 2,502 adult African-American and Caucasian
   outpatients visiting 138 primary care physicians in 84 family practices
   in Northeast Ohio. Patient satisfaction was measured using the Medical
   Outcome Study (MOS) nine-item Visit Rating Scale. Time use was assessed
   with the Davis Observation Code, which was used to classify every 20
   seconds of a visit into 20 behavioral categories.
   No difference was found between African-American and Caucasian patients
   in the association between patient satisfaction with a physician and the
   time the physician spent chatting, planning treatment, providing health
   education, structuring the interaction, assessing health knowledge or
   answering patient questions. Patients were generally satisfied with
   their physicians, and no racial differences between Caucasians and
   African Americans were observed.
   Despite racial differences in how physicians spend time in the
   outpatient visit encounter, these differences are not associated with
   racial differences in patient satisfaction. Efforts to understand
   disparities in satisfaction should address areas other than how
   physicians allocate time in the physician-patient encounter.

AB Background Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for late effects of
   disease and treatment that may be attributed to multiple causes. This
   study describes health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in childhood
   cancer survivors and identifies factors related to poor quality of life
   outcomes.
   Procedure. Patients age 8-18 years, who attended the long-term
   information, follow-up, and evaluation (LIFE) clinic at Childrens
   Hospital Los Angeles during a 1-year time-period were eligible for the
   study. Eighty-six survivors (mean time off-treatment = 7.8 years)
   completed the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core
   Scales, a LIFE Clinic Intake Questionnaire and rated their fatigue using
   a 10-point scale. Oncology nurses independently rated subjects' late
   effects using a 3-point severity scale. Linear regression procedures
   were used to evaluate the association between demographic and medical
   factors and HRQOL.
   Results. Fatigue and more severe late effects were associated with
   poorer physical functioning (fatigue, P < 0.02; late effects, P < 0.01).
   Fatigue, ethnic minority status, and a brain tumor diagnosis were
   associated with poorer psychosocial functioning (fatigue, P < 0.0001;
   minority status, P < 0.04; brain tumor, P < 0.01). Fatigue was the only
   factor related to both poor physical and psychosocial HRQOL.
   Conclusions. Long-term follow-up clinics for childhood cancer survivors
   are in a unique position to monitor HRQOL over time. Factors associated
   with poorer HRQOL include fatigue, ethnic minority status, a brain tumor
   diagnosis, and more severe late effects. Future studies need to clarify
   relationships between ethnicity, socioeconomic status (SES), and HRQOL
   in cancer survivors.

   will attempt to show that the logic of turning-point arguments does not
   disprove historical causality but, on the contrary, depends on belief in
   causality. Sometimes, this is only an implicit belief in the cliches of
   folk historiography; occasionally, a serious sociology is explicitly
   invoked. In either case, there is a tendency to misperceive how
   historical causality works through broadly-based processes that are not

AB Travis Hirschi's control or social bonding theory argues that those
   persons who have strong and abiding attachments to conventional society
   (in the form of attachments, involvement, investment, and belief) are
   less likely to deviate than persons who have weak or shallow bonds.
   Later, Gottfredson and Hirschi moved away from the social bond as the
   primary factor in deviance, and toward an emphasis on self-control. In
   short, low self-control is associated with higher levels of deviance and
   criminality irrespective of the strength or weakness of one's social
   bonds. In this article I argue that Talcott Parsons' AGIL schema easily
   incorporates Hirschi's social bond into its broader analytical
   framework. Furthermore, from within the logical framework of Parsons'
   system, Hirschi's move from an emphasis on social bonds to an emphasis
   on self-control is wholly compatible with, and even anticipated by, the
   AGIL schema. The article illustrates, and argues for, the continuing
   importance of theoretical subsumption in sociology and criminology.
   Lastly, a set of testable hypotheses is generated based upon this
   theoretical reformulation.

AB Here we assess the limitations of "social physics" methods for making
   predictions of future social conditions in order to contribute to the
   development of an alternative model of scientific sociology. First, we
   discuss the complexities inherent in causal analyses of social
   phenomena, where social organizing principles change historically and
   causal forces interact to generate outcomes. Second, we analyze the
   assumptions that underlie prediction in the social sciences by using the
   population projections of demographers as an illustrative example.
   Demographers typically make projections assuming the future will be the
   same as the (recent) past. This approach neglects the possibility of
   abrupt historical change, contingent events, and emergent social
   structures. Third, we argue that historical contingency is an essential
   and necessary consideration in any analysis of the world. A historical
   materialist approach provides the basis for better formulating
   nomothetic and idiographic modes of explanation and appreciates the
   important connections between the two. Sociological inquiry should be an
   attempt to distinguish between truly nomothetic processes and emergent
   historical background conditions that only appear nomothetic in a
   specific historical era. We close with an argument for the importance of
   developing a sociological science that runs parallel to nonmechanistic
   approaches in the biological sciences.

AB Although the philosophy of pragmatism influenced American sociology,
   specifically that of symbolic interactionism, its use as a tool for
   explanation of everyday life has been underutilized throughout
   sociology. In this article, pragmatism, specifically the ideas of George
   Herbert Mead and John Dewey provide a framework for the understanding of
   grieving, specifically as it relates to people with mental retardation.
   Both Mead and Dewey's use and inclusion of physics into their
   philosophies proved paramount in their assertions regarding Cartesian or
   ontological dualism. They then demonstrated through the inclusion of
   quantum physics how to avoid positivism, thereby creating the necessary
   link of science with human perception and human action. Mead's use of
   the Theory of Relativity, as well as Sociality; and Dewey's
   incorporation of the Uncertainty Principle, and addressing the sum of
   possibilities, provides a context where the grieving process of people
   with mental retardation will be much more pronounced. People with mental
   retardation, by definition, through their neural networks have an
   inability to perceive existence in a manner that is functionally the
   same as the rest of the population. Their abilities influence how people
   with mental retardation relate to themselves or environment, thereby
   creating either fewer realities or systems from which to interact, or
   creating ones that are functionally dissimilar from the typical
   population, hence the label "mental retardation;" therefore, the loss of
   someone or something creates a greater hole or emptiness for people with
   mental retardation than the rest of society.

AB Successful social interaction requires that participants continually
   adjust their responses and expectations about others' responses to
   interactional contingencies. This article extends the analysis of
   expectations to include not just the anticipation of single responsive
   actions but also patterns of action that constitute what Schutz referred
   to as completed acts. Here, I suggest that when events render the future
   of the interaction problematic, individuals' expectations of the future
   take on a narrative form. These expectancy narratives provide a script
   for the formation of actions, which may be revised frequently over the
   course of the interaction in response to the actions of others. Analysis
   of responses to an unfolding vignette shows that both the content and
   structural form of such narratives vary in numerous ways in response to
   interactional contingencies and according to the gender of respondents.

AB Habitat structure is defined as the composition and arrangement of
   physical matter at a location. Although habitat structure is the
   physical template underlying ecological patterns and processes, the
   concept is relatively unappreciated and underdeveloped in ecology.
   However, it provides a fundamental concept for urban ecology because
   human activities in urban ecosystems are often targeted toward
   management of habitat structure. In addition, the concept emphasizes the
   fine-scale, on-the-ground perspective needed in the study of urban soil
   ecology. To illustrate this, urban soil ecology research is summarized
   from the perspective of habitat structure effects. Among the key
   conclusions emerging from the literature review are: (1) habitat
   structure provides a unifying theme for multivariate research about
   urban soil ecology; (2) heterogeneous urban habitat structures influence
   soil ecological variables in different ways; (3) more research is needed
   to understand relationships among sociological variables, habitat
   structure patterns and urban soil ecology. To stimulate urban soil
   ecology research, a conceptual framework is presented to show the direct
   and indirect relationships among habitat structure and ecological
   variables. Because habitat structure serves as a physical link between
   sociocultural and ecological systems, it can be used as a focus for
   interdisciplinary and applied research (e.g., pest management) about the
   multiple, interactive effects of urbanization on the ecology of soils.

   urban ecology research: a bibliometric review 1975-2004 (Young and Wolf,
   Urban Ecosystems, 9:179-193, 2006). We identify our critics' concerns as
   rooted in a project of deconstruction of scientific inquiry and a
   redefinition of the boundaries separating academic disciplines from each
   other and science from society. While we identify important differences
   with our critics, we largely support this critical project, as evidenced
   by our previously published empirical research. In exploring the
   relationship between critical and positivist approaches to urban ecology
   research and how we might work toward an integration of nature and
   society in thought and action, we defend pragmatic approaches to
   empirical research as well as disciplinary projects as legitimate and
   essential elements of urban ecology research. We argue in favor of
   theoretical and methodological pluralism. Rather than define urban
   ecology through exclusionary projects that would limit the scope and
   significance of urban ecology research, we reaffirm our call for diverse
   sets of actors inside and outside university settings to engage and
   support each other in order to develop and strengthen analysis and
   pursuit of sustainability.

AB Study Design. Combined analysis of 2 prospective clinical studies.
   Objective. To identify socioeconomic characteristics associated with
   workers' compensation in patients with an intervertebral disc herniation
   (IDH) or spinal stenosis (SpS). Summary of Background Data. Few studies
   have compared socioeconomic differences between those receiving or not
   receiving workers' compensation with the same underlying clinical
   conditions. Methods. Patients were identified from the Spine Patient
   Outcomes Research Trial ( SPORT) and the National Spine Network (NSN)
   practice-based outcomes study. Patients with IDH and SpS within NSN were
   identified satisfying SPORT eligibility criteria. Information on
   disability and work status at baseline evaluation was used to categorize
   patients into 3 groups: workers' compensation, other disability
   compensation, or work-eligible controls. Enrollment rates of patients
   with disability in a clinical efficacy trial ( SPORT) and practice-based
   network ( NSN) were compared. Independent socioeconomic predictors of
   baseline workers' compensation status were identified in multivariate
   logistic regression models controlling for clinical condition, study
   cohort, and initial treatment designation. Results. Among 3759 eligible
   patients ( 1480 in SPORT and 2279 in NSN), 564 (15%) were receiving
   workers' compensation, 317 (8%) were receiving other disability
   compensation, and 2878 (77%) were controls. Patients receiving workers'
   compensation were less common in SPORT than NSN (9.2% vs. 18.8%, P <
   0.001), but patients receiving other disability compensation were
   similarly represented (8.9% vs. 7.7%, P = 0.19). In univariate analyses,
   many socioeconomic characteristics significantly differed according to
   baseline workers' compensation status. In multiple logistic regression
   analyses, gender, educational level, work characteristics, legal action,
   and expectations about ability to work without surgery were
   independently associated with receiving workers' compensation.
   Conclusion. Clinical trials involving conditions commonly seen in
   patients with workers' compensation may need special efforts to ensure
   adequate representation. Socioeconomic characteristics markedly differed
   between patients receiving and not receiving workers' compensation.
   Identifying the independent effects of workers' compensation on outcomes
   will require controlling for these baseline characteristics and other
   clinical features associated with disability status.

   Similarly, programs targeted to schools in high-risk areas (defined by
   low socioeconomic status or high crime rates) are delivered to all
   children in a grade or school in those high-risk areas. During
   2004-2006, the Task Force on Community Preventive Services (Task Force)
   conducted a systematic review of published scientific evidence
   concerning the effectiveness of these programs. The results of this
   review provide strong evidence that universal school-based programs
   decrease rates of violence and aggressive behavior among school-aged
   children. Program effects were demonstrated at all grade levels. An
   independent meta-analysis of school-based programs confirmed and
   supplemented these findings. On the basis of strong evidence of
   effectiveness, the Task Force recommends the use of universal

   I present certain Japanese arbitrageurs' reflections on the difference
   between arbitrage and speculation and examine the interplay of belief
   and doubt underlying arbitrage operations. I argue that the resulting
   ambivalence towards the category of arbitrage is a marker of
   arbitrageurs' particular epistemological stance, identity and ethical

   ambiguity for the dominant trope of speculation in the critical study of
   financial markets more broadly.

   toward genomic competencies, their awareness of efforts in the health
   promotion field to promote/incorporate genomics, and their basic &
   applied genomic knowledge. Methods: A total of 1607 public health
   educators, nationwide, responded to a web-based survey. Results: The
   sample comprised predominantly white (76.8%) female (83.9%)
   participants, with an average age of 40.1 years and 11.2 years of
   practice in public health education/promotion. Generally, participants
   had negative attitudes toward genomic competencies, low awareness, and
   deficient genomic knowledge. Although various socioeconomic
   characteristics (e.g., ethnicity, gender, and educational level)
   correlated with participants' attitudes, awareness, and genomic
   knowledge, training in genetics/genomics or public health genomics also
   exhibited a positive association. After we controlled for socioeconomic
   factors, awareness, training, and genomic knowledge remained
   significantly associated with respondents' attitudes toward genomic
   competencies. Conclusion: Although this sample of public health
   educators had unfavorable attitudes and limited genomic knowledge,
   training seems to affect these variables. Thus, relevant training for
   this group of health professionals should be developed and advocated.
   Continuing education tools, focusing on public health genomics content,
   might be a venue for delivery of information and the development of
   favorable professional attitudes.

AB Because the HIV/AIDS crisis in Kenya is causing the death and
   disablement of so many prime-aged adults, households are increasingly
   being headed by adolescents and the elderly. The purpose of this paper
   is to examine the health status of one of the most vulnerable groups in
   Kenyan society - adolescent women - and to explore how the type of
   household head impacts on their health status. Using data from the 2003
   Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS), an indicator of illness
   signs was used as the dependent variable for health status. Significant
   differences were found in the health status of adolescent women in
   households headed by adolescents, prime-aged adults, and the elderly.
   Even when controlling for demographic factors, residing in an adolescent
   headed household increased the odds that an adolescent woman would have
   recently experienced some signs of illness. Other factors which also
   increased the odds of illness were being married and being in the older
   age group (20-24). Wealth barely had any impact on illness. Service
   providers need to pay special attention to the needs of adolescents in
   non-adult headed households.

AB Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by correlated

   fundamental aspect of auditory information processing (AIP) that is
   dependent on social experience and critical to early language
   development: the ability to compartmentalize close-sounding speech
   sounds into singular phonemes. We examined this ability by assessing
   whether close-sounding non-native language phonemes were more likely to
   be perceived as disparate sounds by school-aged children with
   high-functioning ASD (n = 27), than by unaffected control subjects (n =
   35). No significant group differences were observed. Although earlier in
   autistic development there may exist qualitative deficits in this
   specific aspect of AIP, they are not an enduring characteristic of
   verbal school-aged children with ASD.

   and mental health. The aim of this study was to determine whether
   associations with health variables are primarily attributable to
   explicitly religious aspects of spiritual well-being (SWB) or to
   "existential" aspects that primarily reflect a sense of satisfaction or
   purpose in life. Three hundred forty-five pairs of twins from the
   Vietnam Era Twin Registry completed a diagnostic interview and
   questionnaires containing the 2-factor SWB Scale and general health
   items. Observed associations between SWB and health outcomes were
   uniquely explained by the SWB subscale of existential well-being, with
   much less of a unique explanatory contribution from religious well-being
   or "spiritual involvement." We concluded that studies of SWB and health
   should continue to distinguish between explicitly religious variables
   and others that more closely approximate the psychological construct of
   personal well-being.

   mechanisms by which spirituality might relate to depressive symptoms.
   The current study aimed to elucidate potential psychosocial mechanisms
   that link these 2 variables. Data were drawn from a community-dwelling
   stratified sample of 630 racially diverse adults in rural North
   Carolina. Spirituality was assessed by 6 items of the Daily Spiritual
   Experiences Scale. Depressive symptoms were measured using 4 subscales
   from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression. Hypothesized
   mediators were optimism, volunteering, and perceived social support.
   Structural equation modeling was used to test whether proposed mediators
   explain a link between spirituality and depressive symptoms. The model
   demonstrated a satisfactory fit. Spirituality was indirectly related to
   depressive symptoms. More specifically, spirituality was significantly
   associated with optimism and volunteering but not with social support,
   and optimism, volunteering and perceived social support were
   significantly associated with depressive symptoms. The link between
   spirituality and depressive symptoms is indirect. The relationship is
   mediated by optimism, volunteering, and social support. Findings present
   research and practice implications.

AB Cortical Lewy body disease as a cause of dementia has been recognized
   for more than 40 years. Only in the past 15 to 20 years, however, has
   the true frequency of this entity come to be appreciated, primarily
   because of the advent of sensitive and specific immunohistochemical
   diagnostic techniques. We now know that there is frequent and extensive
   overlap, both clinically and pathologically, between Lewy body and
   Alzheimer diseases. Although some of this overlap may be attributable to
   common genetic and environmental risk factors, it is also now apparent
   that the 2 diseases share common neuroinflammatory mechanisms involving
   activation of microglia, overexpression of interleukin-1 and other
   inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory toxicity to neurons. Activated
   microglia are found in association with a-synuclein-containing neurons
   and glia in Parkinson disease, in dementia with Lewy bodies, and in
   multiple system atrophy, and these associations are reminiscent of
   microglial associations with neurofibrillary tangle-containing neurons
   in Alzheimer disease. In vitro and in vivo experimental work has shown
   reciprocal induction between alpha-synuclein and injured neurons on one
   hand and activated microglia and cytokine overexpression on the other.
   These neuroinflammatory processes may be a common link driving
   progression in both diseases and explaining the frequent overlap between
   the 2 diseases.

AB 'This paper provides an overview of aspects of the history of British
   sociology. In particular, it tries to answer critical historical work by
   among others, Perry Anderson and Philip Abrams, which sought to explain
   the supposed indigenous 'failure' to develop academic sociology in
   Britain before the 1960s. It is argued that a narrowly academic reading
   of the history of sociology cannot do justice to its role in the service
   of social administration and public enlightenment and may exaggerate the
   degree to which sociology from its foundations was conceived as a purely
   intellectual discipline. The paper points to a thriving sociological
   culture in Britain in the generation before the First World War, though
   it was one in which many contributions came from philosophers, natural
   scientists and political economists rather then self-proclaimed
   'sociologists'. It ends with a brief review of Patrick Geddes and Victor
   Branford, a founder of the Sociological Society and editor of the
   Sociological Review, whose biographies and eclectic social and
   international interests tell us something about the personalities and
   political interests of early British sociological pioneers.'

AB ackground: The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over
   the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature
   and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible
   factor contributing to the obesity epidemic.
   Methods: We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067
   people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham
   Heart Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used
   longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one
   person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings,
   spouse, and neighbors.
   Results: Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the
   weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters],
   greater/equal 30) were present in the network at all time points, and
   the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did
   not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of
   social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese
   increased by 57% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she
   had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult
   siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would
   become obese increased by 40% (95% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became
   obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased
   by 37% (95% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in
   the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had
   relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite
   sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of
   obesity in the network.
   Conclusions: Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and
   behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through
   social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public
   health interventions.

AB People all over the world use their hands to communicate expressively.
   Autonomous gestures, also known as emblems, are highly social in nature,
   and convey conventionalized meaning without accompanying speech. To
   study the neural bases of cross-cultural social communication, we used
   single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to measure
   corticospinal excitability (CSE) during observation of culture-specific
   emblems. Foreign Nicaraguan and familiar American emblems as well as
   meaningless control gestures were performed by both a Euro-American and
   a Nicaraguan actor. Euro-American participants demonstrated higher CSE
   during observation of the American compared to the Nicaraguan actor.
   This motor resonance phenomenon may reflect ethnic and cultural ingroup
   familiarity effects. However, participants also demonstrated a nearly
   significant (p = 0.053) actor by emblem interaction whereby both
   Nicaraguan and American emblems performed by the American actor elicited
   similar CSE, whereas Nicaraguan emblems performed by the Nicaraguan
   actor yielded higher CSE than American emblems. The latter result cannot
   be interpreted simply as an effect of ethnic ingroup familiarity. Thus,
   a likely explanation of these findings is that motor resonance is
   modulated by interacting biological and cultural factors.

AB Objective: To assess the effects of spinal cord injury (SCI) on
   perceived health-related quality of life (QOL). Background: SCI is
   physically disabling, socially handicapping, and romantically limiting.
   Nevertheless, little is known about post-SCI neurocognitive and
   psychosocial life. Better understanding of the cognitive and emotional
   worlds of SCI patients is essential to better address and meet their
   needs and expectations. Methods: Twenty subjects with high-cord (T6 and
   above) complete (American Spinal Injury Association [ASIA] A) SCI (High
   SCI) were compared with 10 subjects with low-cord (T7 and below) ASIA A
   SCI (Low SCI) and with 11 Able-Bodied control subjects. Satisfaction
   with Life and Short Form-36 instruments were used to assess physical and
   emotional aspects of QOL. Analyses of variance were used to assess
   potential differences across groups. Results: Overall, satisfaction with
   life was the same among the groups. Expectedly, High SCI and Low SCI
   subjects reported lower physical functioning than Able-Bodied subjects
   (p < 0.0001). But, oddly, there were no differences in perceived
   physical role, physical health, or social functioning. Furthermore, High
   SCI subjects reported better perceived mental health than Able-Bodied
   control subjects (p = 0.004) and a trend over Low SCI subjects (p =
   0.06), better perceived emotional role in society (p = 0.02), and
   greater vitality (p = 0.01) than Low SCI subjects and Able-Bodied
   subjects. Conclusions: Despite severe physical impairment and disability
   and frequent medical complications, subjects with complete spinal cord
   injury at high anatomic levels report better than average quality of
   life, being overall content. Reasons for these findings are unclear.
   Psychological adaptive reactions are likely, but the possible role of
   physiologic and neurocognitive changes needs further exploration.

AB An implicit assumption underpins basic models of the evolution of
   cooperation, mutualism and altruism: The benefits (or payoffs) of
   cooperation and defection are defined by the current frequency or
   distribution of cooperators. In social dilemmas involving durable public
   goods (group resources that can persist in the environment-ubiquitous
   from microbes to humans) this assumption is violated. Here, we examine
   the consequences of relaxing this assumption, allowing pay-offs to
   depend on both current and past numbers of cooperators. We explicitly
   trace the dynamic of a public good created by cooperators, and define
   pay-offs in terms of the current public good. By raising the importance
   of cooperative history in determining the current fate of cooperators,
   durable public goods cause novel dynamics (e. g., transient increases in
   cooperation in Prisoner's Dilemmas, oscillations in Snowdrift Games, or
   shifts in invasion thresholds in Stag-hunt Games), while changes in
   durability can transform one game into another, by moving invasion
   thresholds for cooperation or conditions for coexistence with defectors.
   This enlarged view challenges our understanding of social cheats. For
   instance, groups of cooperators can do worse than groups of defectors,
   if they inherit fewer public goods, while a rise in defectors no longer
   entails a loss of social benefits, at least not in the present moment
   (as highlighted by concerns over environmental lags). Wherever durable
   public goods have yet to reach a steady state (for instance due to
   external perturbations), the history of cooperation will define the
   ongoing dynamics of cooperators.

AB Background: Underage youth often obtain alcohol from adults who
   illegally provide the alcohol. One method for obtaining alcohol from
   adults is shoulder tapping, where youth approach an adult outside an
   alcohol establishment and ask the adult to purchase alcohol for them.
   The goal of this study was to assess what percentage of the general and
   youth-targeted adult population approached outside of a
   convenience/liquor store will agree to purchase and then provide alcohol
   to individuals who appear under age 21.
   Methods: We conducted 2 waves of pseudo-underage shoulder tap request
   attempts, using requesters who were age 21 or older but appeared 18 to
   20 years old. In both waves, requests were conducted at randomly
   selected liquor and convenience stores, requesters explained that the
   reason they were asking the adult was because they did not have their
   identification with them, and requesters asked the adults to purchase a
   6-pack of beer. During wave 1, we conducted 102 attempts, with the
   requester approaching the first adult entering the store alone. During
   wave 2, we conducted 102 attempts where the requester approached the
   first casually dressed male entering the store alone who appeared to be
   21 to 30 years old. Results: During wave 1, 8% of the general sample of
   approached adults provided alcohol to the pseudo-underage requesters.
   The odds of adults providing alcohol in urban areas were 9.4 times
   greater than in suburban areas. During wave 2, 19% of the approached
   young men provided alcohol to the requesters. No requester, request
   attempt, establishment, or community characteristics were associated
   with request attempt outcomes during wave 2.
   Conclusions: A small percentage of the general population of adults will
   agree to provide alcohol to underage youth when approached outside an
   alcohol establishment. The likelihood of underage youth obtaining
   alcohol through shoulder tapping increases substantially if the youth
   approach young men.

AB Culture and human behavior are recognized today as major forces acting
   on human biological variation around the world. Studies of the
   relationships between biology and processes, such as modernization,
   urbanization, and social stratification, are prominent in our journals
   and meetings. An ongoing study of the interrelationships between
   toxicant exposure (organochlorines, lead, and mercury), health, and
   culture among youth of the Mohawk Nation at Akwesasne is located within
   this context and is used to analyze the strengths and challenges of a
   partnership approach to biocultural research. To assist in modeling the
   complex relationships between health, behavior, and culture, we have
   employed concepts from contemporary social theory, integrated
   qualitative and quantitative research, and implemented community-based
   research principles to develop a partnership approach to research in
   human biology. The community is directly involved in identifying
   research goals, developing research protocols appropriate for local
   cultural sensitivities and complexities, implementing the protocols in
   the field, and collaborating in the analysis and publication of results.
   We show the utility of this approach for understanding the relationships
   of toxicants to behavior and biological outcomes (adolescent growth,
   sexual maturation, and endocrine system alteration); as well as how it
   facilitates the agency of participants and communities involved in
   research, and brings greater social engagement to the development of the
   new human biology.

AB Objectives. We examined the racial/ethnic and geographic variation in
   distrust of physicians in the United States.
   Methods. We obtained data from the Community Tracking Study, analyzing
   20 sites where at least 5% of the population was Hispanic and 5% was
   Black.
   Results. In univariate analyses, Blacks and Hispanics reported higher
   levels of physician distrust than did Whites. Multivariate analyses,
   however, suggested a complex interaction among sociodemographic
   variables, city of residence, race/ethnicity, and distrust of physician.
   In general, lower socioeconomic status (defined as lower income, lower
   education, and no health insurance) was associated with higher levels of
   distrust, with men generally reporting more distrust than women. But the
   strength of these effects was modified by race/ethnicity. We present
   examples of individual cities in which Blacks reported consistently
   higher mean levels of distrust than did Whites, consistently lower mean
   levels of distrust than did Whites, or a mixed relationship dependent on
   socioeconomic status. In the same cities, Hispanics reported either
   consistently higher mean levels of distrust relative to Whites or a
   mixed relationship.
   Conclusions. Racial/ethnic differences in physician distrust are less
   uniform than previously hypothesized, with substantial geographic and
   individual variation present.

   indicators.
   Methods. We used data on adults aged 40 years and older (n = 4206) from
   the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (1999-2002) to
   compare blood pressure, metabolic, and inflammatory risk profiles for
   Whites, Blacks, US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, and Hispanics of
   Mexican origin. We controlled for age, gender, and socioeconomic status.
   Results. Hispanics have more risk factors above clinical risk levels
   than do Whites but fewer than Blacks. Differences between Hispanics and
   Whites disappeared after we controlled for socioeconomic status, but
   results differed by nativity. After we controlled for socioeconomic
   status, the differences between foreign-born Hispanics and Whites were
   eliminated, but US-born Mexican Americans still had higher biological
   risk scores than did both Whites and foreign-born Mexican Americans.
   Conclusions. There is no Hispanic paradox in biological risk profiles.
   However, our finding that foreign-born Hispanics and Whites had similar
   biological risk profiles, but US-born Mexican Americans had higher risk,
   was consistent with hypothesized effects of migrant health selectivity
   (healthy people in-migrating and unhealthy people out-migrating) as well
   as some differences in health behaviors between US-born and foreign-born

AB Recently, there has been a proliferation of measures responding to
   demands for accountability and transparency. Using the example of media
   rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological
   concept of reactivity-the idea that people change their behavior in
   reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured-offers a useful lens
   for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed
   for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of
   public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms,
   self-fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and
   then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This
   approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures
   change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is
   important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more
   systematically.

AB Organization theorists have long recognized that organizations take on
   elements from their environments in the course of being founded. This
   observation, articulated by Stinchcombe in 1965 and known today as the
   "organizational imprinting hypothesis," is frequently cited but remains
   little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship
   studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws
   on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in
   selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may
   remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the
   organization in question. The founding of the Paris Opera under Louis
   XIV serves as the basis for theorizing organizational imprinting at
   founding as an outcome of cultural entrepreneurship.

AB Previous research indicates that both males and females eat less in the
   presence of a stranger of the opposite sex than in the presence of a
   same sex. Another literature shows that people tend to model or matching
   the amount eaten by others. The extent to which people are eager to
   inhibit their food consumption or match other's intake is likely to vary
   as a function of the characteristics of the co-eater. The present study
   examines how males and females adjust their level of eating as a
   function of their familiarity with and the gender of their eating
   companion, using a free-eating paradigm. Findings indicated that both
   the familiarity between co-eaters and the participants' gender predicted
   food consumption. Although unfamiliarity suppressed both men's and
   women's food intakes, the matching effect operated only when a female
   co-eater was involved. We conclude that the overarching motive (i.e.,
   producing a positive impression) does not necessarily vary substantially
   across the various gender-familiarity combinations, but that the means
   or strategies (eating lightly and or matching of intake) by which the
   person accomplishes it and the strength of the motive vary as a function
   of the audience. In other words, in some social contexts self-enhancing
   motives can be served by restricting intake as well as through
   ingratiatory strategies such as attitudinal or behavioral conformity.

AB This study aimed to understand how poverty-associated food deprivation
   in childhood contributes to the well-known relationship between low
   socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood and obesity in the adult years.
   Thirty low-income, rural women with at least one child were followed for
   over three years with annual semi-structured interviews collecting
   quantitative and qualitative data. For the quantitative portion, the
   measures of interest were body mass index (BMI), food insecurity, eating
   patterns, and SES. For the qualitative portion, text from the interviews
   was analyzed using the constant comparative method. Growing up in a poor
   household was associated with increased risk of overweight and obesity
   in adulthood. Experiences of poverty-associated food deprivation in
   childhood appeared to super-motivate some women to actively avoid food
   insecurity in adulthood. It also influenced the women's current food
   preferences. Tremendous excitement accompanied the availability of food
   after periods of deprivation in both the women and their children. Some
   women had used food to meet emotional needs in childhood and overeating
   had become a generalized response to negative emotional states in the
   adult years. Food deprivation in childhood and associated attitudes and
   behaviors towards food are one possible mechanism for explaining the
   association between childhood poverty and adult obesity. (c) 2007

AB Sociological explanations of the Salem witch trials, and of witch-hunts
   in the West more generally, have focused on economic transition,
   political instability, and the functional aspects of witchcraft belief.
   A more interpretive approach to the explanation of Salem is proposed: an
   analysis of the intersection of the gendered symbolization of witchcraft
   in colonial Massachusetts and the larger tensions within Puritan culture
   at the close of the 17th century. A broad theoretical implication of
   this interpretive shift is also proposed: that a cultural-sociological
   approach to witch-hunting as symbolic action can bring together feminist
   theorizations of witch-hunting as an exercise in patriarchal power with
   the social history of the broad, structural causes of witch-hunting in
   pre-modern Europe and New England.

AB This study presents an ecological analysis of the relationship between
   infant mortality and economic status by race in metropolitan Ohio, using
   census data on mother's residence and economic status determined by the
   percentage of low-income families living in each area. The analysis
   updates previous studies as white-non-white comparisons for total infant
   mortality are examined for the US censuses of 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and
   2000; and more detailed period- and broad cause-specific rates are
   presented for 2000. A pronounced inverse association is consistently
   found between income status and infant mortality for whites, while for
   non-whites this pattern first emerges in 1979-81, disappears during the
   1980s and then returns more strongly during the 1990s. Similarly, the
   2000 data reveal a consistent inverse pattern between income status and
   infant mortality for white and non-white neonatal and postneonatal death
   rates, as well as exogenous cause-specific death rates. It is concluded
   that low-income whites and non-whites have infant mortality rates
   substantially higher than the overall rate for the population. Policy
   implications are discussed.

   health, basic activities of daily living difficulties, instrumental
   activities of daily living difficulties, and physical activity
   difficulties. The adjusted prevalent odds ratios of higher allostatic

   >= 5 criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
   Disorders. Using community advertising, we recruited 15-85-year-old
   Caucasians (n = 225) and African (American/other minorities (n = 87),
   who had gambled more than 5 times lifetime), for 2 interviews, held I
   week apart, about gambling and associated behaviors. Results indicate
   substantial to almost-perfect DSM-IV PGD reliability for Caucasians (K =
   0.82) and African Americans/other minorities (K = 0.68). Reliability for
   symptoms and for game-specific disorders was fair to almost perfect (K =
   0.37-0.90). After adjusting results for confounding variables and
   multiple comparisons, racial/ethnic variation in PGD and game-specific
   reliability failed to persist. Implications exist for increased
   attention to screening and prevention efforts critical to reducing
   racial/ethnic disparities in PGD prevalence.

   from 4 New York City psychiatric hospitals and after 3 months in
   community care (N = 264, mean age of 37 years, 61% male, 56% black).
   Linear regression equations predicted white and black SQL from
   educational attainment and control variables (ethnicity, age,
   functioning level, symptom severity). Educational accomplishment
   predicted lower SQL (F = 3.53, df = 4,227, p < 0.01), especially among
   whites (F = 5.87, df = 4,92, p < 0.001). However, the association was
   statistically insignificant in blacks who had SQL peaks and valleys with
   more years of school. Findings suggest that psychiatric care and
   research should account for educational and cultural variation in
   assessing and promoting SQL.

AB Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) document and
   describe all outdoor alcohol advertisements surrounding schools and (2)
   examine the association between exposure to alcohol advertising in sixth
   grade and youth alcohol use, intentions, norms, and attitudes in eighth
   grade. Method: All outdoor alcohol advertisements within 1,500 feet of
   63 Chicago school sites were documented and coded for content and theme.
   Longitudinal mixed-effects regression analysis was used to determine the
   association between number of alcohol advertisements around a school in
   sixth grade and student alcohol behaviors, intentions, norms, and
   attitudes at the end of eighth grade, 2 years later. Participants
   included 2,586 sixth-grade students in the 2002-2003 school year. The
   sample was 37% black, 33% Hispanic, and 15% white. Gender was evenly
   distributed, and the average age was 12.2 at the end of sixth grade.
   Results: A total of 931 alcohol advertisements were found within 1,500
   feet of the 63 school sites. Exposure to alcohol advertising around
   schools at the end of sixth grade was found to predict alcohol
   intentions at the end of eighth grade. This finding held true even for
   those students who were nonusers of alcohol in sixth grade. Conclusions:
   Exposure to outdoor alcohol advertising around schools is associated
   with subsequent youth intentions to use alcohol. The association between
   exposure to alcohol advertising and youth alcohol-use intentions was
   found even among sixth-grade nonusers of alcohol, suggesting that even
   those who have not used alcohol are still influenced by alcohol
   advertising. These findings suggest that restrictions in alcohol
   advertising near schools may be warranted.

AB During 2005, a risk assessment tool based on the Gail model was used to
   calculate the five-year risk of developing breast cancer for 445 women
   who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged urban communities in western
   Pennsylvania and who attended health fairs and other community-sponsored
   activities. This tool allowed us to evaluate each woman and advise her
   of her risks in a process lasting 15-20 minutes. Of the 445 women, 71.7%
   were black and 21.6% had a higher than average risk. The proportion of
   white women at high risk was significantly greater than the proportion
   of black women at high risk (33.3% vs. 16.9%; P<0.01). The Gail model
   assessment tool for use in low-income and minority populations holds
   promise because it is noninvasive, is easy to use and provides immediate
   data about risk. This risk communication may help encourage minority and
   low-income women to receive screening mammography. It has the potential
   to improve breast cancer screening rates.

AB Background. C-reactive protein, homocysteine, cholesterol, and
   fibrinogen are known to vary by socioeconomic status (SES). Using a
   nationally representative study, we examined whether these factors vary
   independently of all other known risk factors, such as diet, exercise,
   and genetic predisposition.
   Methods. We analyzed the 1999-2002 National Health Examination and
   Nutrition Survey using logistic regression models.
   Results. We found that high-density lipoprotein cholesterol blood levels
   increase with income and educational attainment after controlling all
   known risk factors for elevated cholesterol (e.g., diet, exercise, and
   family history). Blood levels of C-reactive protein are inversely
   associated with income and education. Homocysteine blood levels are
   inversely associated with income even after controlling for blood folate
   level. A nonsignificant inverse relationship between homocysteine levels
   and educational attainment was also observed. Blood levels of
   low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibrinogen were not
   significantly associated with income or education.
   Conclusions. Levels of "good" (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol
   increase with income and education even after controlling for factors
   known to place people at risk of high cholesterol. Stress differences by
   social class may play a role. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   introductory sociology setting, students compare their perceptions of
   the size of minority populations with counts from the U.S. Census. In a
   series of debriefing sessions, students analyze both their perceptions
   and Census counts as social constructions of the moral phenomena we call
   race. In the process, students are introduced to Census data and the
   Census web site as well as to historical and theoretical literature on
   the social construction of race. Students are then asked to reflect
   critically about the scientific practices in which race is constructed
   as a social fact, and in particular, to consider their own roles in
   these practices as users and subjects of race categories. The larger
   goal is to help students to develop a critical sociological imagination

AB Mirroring increased cultural and disciplinary attention to sexuality,
   many introductory sociology textbooks have begun to include coverage of

   sexuality in a sample of 38 introductory textbooks published after 2000.
   Secondly, we focus on 14 textbooks with a sexuality chapter and/or
   textbooks with more than the average textual coverage of sexuality. We
   find that the emergent "core" of the sociology of sexuality centers on
   sex research, historical and cross-cultural trends in sexuality, media
   representations, gender and sexuality, homosexuality and society, and
   sexual violence. These textbooks vary widely in their attention to the
   intersection of race, class and sexuality and theoretical applications.
   We find lingering heteronormativity, homogenization of homosexuality,
   and problematic representations of non-normative sexuality within the
   chapters. We conclude with comments on the relevance of these findings
   and offer some suggestions to ensure that coverage of sexuality better
   reflects scholarship and discourse within the discipline.

AB Civil societies function because people pay taxes and make charitable
   contributions to provide public goods. One possible motive for
   charitable contributions, called "pure altruism," is satisfied by
   increases in the public good no matter the source or intent. Another
   possible motive, " warm glow," is only fulfilled by an individual's own
   voluntary donations. Consistent with pure altruism, we find that even
   mandatory, tax-like transfers to a charity elicit neural activity in
   areas linked to reward processing. Moreover, neural responses to the
   charity's financial gains predict voluntary giving. However, consistent
   with warm glow, neural activity further increases when people make
   transfers voluntarily. Both pure altruism and warm-glow motives appear
   to determine the hedonic consequences of financial transfers to the
   public good.

AB Aims This paper summarizes several theoretical perspectives that serve
   to explain observed associations between concentrations of alcohol
   outlets and alcohol-related problems. A critique of each perspective
   discusses how each addresses the social etiology of these problems; that
   is, how, where and why these problems arise in association with alcohol
   outlets? Methods This theoretical work is based upon mathematical and
   computational models of the ecology of alcohol-related problems
   developed in the 'Ecosystems Modeling Project', an advanced research
   project of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism,
   United States. Results Associations between outlets and problems are
   thought to arise from the concentration of individuals in drinking
   places ('flow models'), the attraction of some places for people at risk
   for problems ('gravity models'), or because outlets are located in
   high-risk neighborhoods and have negative social normative effects
   ('social contextual models'). None of these approaches explain how some
   outlets come to have more problems than others (e.g. violent outlets).
   An alternative social ecological model is introduced which asserts that
   the complementary processes of niche marketing and assortative drinking
   form the social dynamic that explains these relationships. Alcohol
   sellers 'niche market' to select social strata, drinkers return to
   establishments at which they find people like themselves, and consequent
   social stratification of the market-place increases the levels of
   related problems in some outlets. Conclusions The proposed mechanism is
   very general, and suggests that over-concentrations of outlets will lead
   to stratification of drinking groups and intensification of problems
   related to those outlets.

AB Comprehensive intervention for homeless, street living youth that

   youth aged 14-22 were recruited from a drop-in center and randomly
   assigned to the Community Reinforcement Approach (CRA) or treatment as
   usual (TAU) through a drop-in center. Findings showed that youth
   assigned to CRA, compared to TAU, reported significantly reduced
   substance use (37% vs. 17% reduction), depression (40% vs. 23%) and
   increased social stability (58% vs. 13%). Youth in both conditions
   improved in many other behavioral domains including substance use,
   internalizing and externalizing problems, and emotion and task oriented
   coping. This study indicates that homeless youth can be engaged into
   treatment and respond favorably to intervention efforts. However, more
   treatment development research is needed to address the barriers
   associated with serving these youth. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB John Steinbeck's 1939 novel can be given a reading that links events and
   the mentality of characters to mainstream schools of liberal and
   neo-liberal political theory: libertarianism, egalitarianism, and
   utilitarianism. Each of these schools is sketched in outline and applied
   to topics in rural political culture. While it is likely that Steinbeck
   himself would have identified with an egalitarian or utilitarian view,
   he resists the temptation to deny his Okie characters an authentic voice
   that matches none of these schools so well as it articulates an agrarian
   mentality once associated with Thomas Jefferson and today articulated by
   Wendell Berry. This reading of The Grapes of Wrath, in turn, can be
   interpreted as both a rebuke to contemporary social theorists who
   continue to impose an ill-fitting left-right dichotomy on working class
   political culture in rural America and as a roadmap suggesting ways that
   philosophy and rural sociology might engage one another more directly
   and productively with respect to contemporary rural development and
   environmental quality issues.

AB Anthropometric and household data (size, composition, economic activity)
   were collected from a population of Ribeirinhos living in a rural
   setting in the eastern Amazon. Data are compared to international
   reference standards and to other Amazonian populations with the goals of
   increasing our understanding of the Amazon's largest ethnic group and
   identifying the relationship between changes in subsistence strategies
   and nutritional status. Data on height, weight, skinfolds, and
   circumferences were collected from 471 adults and sub-adults. The
   population showed a high degree of stunting with an average HAZ below
   -2.0 for all age groups over 3 years, and 60% of adult men and 70% of
   adult women were stunted. Wasting was rare. Average skinfold thicknesses
   and upper-arm muscle area were near or below average but within the
   normal range compared to the reference standard, indicating adequate
   energy and protein stores. Thirty-one percent of males and 29% of
   females were overweight/obese, and the highest average BMIs were found
   among men and women in their 40s. Adult males who participated in wage
   labor had higher weights, BMIs, and UMA values, and were more likely to
   be overweight and obese compared with those who did not work in
   wage-labor jobs. Children of fathers who worked in wage labor had higher
   BMI and UMA values, but there was no significant effect on the
   nutritional status of other adults in these same households. Signs of
   the nutrition transition were most noticeable among adult males involved
   in wage labor because of changes in their diet and activity patterns.

AB Background: Although religiosity has often been shown to have a
   deterrent effect on teen drug use, noteworthy theoretic gaps and
   contradictory findings have left important questions unanswered.
   Methods: Conceptualizing religion as a measure of social capital and
   using cross-sectional data from Monitoring the Future (1996), a
   nationally representative sample of American high school seniors
   collected annually, this study is designed to shed new light on the
   relationship between religiosity and drug use among American youth.
   Levels of teen drug use for three different components of faith-based
   social capital-exposure to and internalization of religious norms,
   integration within religious networks, and trust in religious
   phenomenaare explored with respect to high school seniors' use of
   alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drugs during the year prior to the
   survey. In addition, drug use associated with faith-based and secular
   forms of civic engagement among teens (e.g., participation in religious
   youth groups vs secular organizations such as sports and school clubs,
   theistic trust vs secular trust) are compared.
   Results: Among religiosity variables, integration within congregational
   networks (i.e., worship service attendance) exhibits the most consistent
   negative association with youth drug use. Theistic trust is not
   associated with teen drug use, but secular trust and civic participation
   in secular organizations are associated with less drug use.
   Conclusions: Elements of both religious and secular social capital are
   associated with lower reported drug use, thereby suggesting that
   multiple avenues for the prevention of teen drug use might be pursued.
   Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB "Social capital" has been critiqued as distracting attention from
   inequalities and policies that produce ill health. We support this
   critique insofar as social capital refers to the degree of trust and
   consensus in a locality, but find value in another dimension often
   included in the concept of social capital-social network ties and their
   associated communication patterns. We present a case study of Bushwick,
   a community of 100,000 people in Brooklyn NY, to suggest that the
   network aspect of "social capital" is useful to understand the active,
   on-the-ground processes by which residents of some neighborhoods beset
   by poverty, racial/ethnic subordination, and internal divisions (that
   themselves arise from inequalities and state policies) work out ways to
   defend their own and others' safety and health. We use a combination of
   population-representative survey data for young adults; sexual network
   survey data; and ethnography to show that Bushwick residents (including
   drug users and dealers) have used social network ties, communication,
   and normative pressures to reduce the extent to which they are put at
   risk by the drug trade and by drug-use-related HIV/AIDS in spite of
   conflicting interests, disparate values, and widespread distrust both of
   other community members and of dominant social institutions. This was
   done by "intravention" health communications, development of protective
   norms, informal negotiations, and other forms of adjustments within and
   among various groups-but it occured in the absence of trust or consensus
   in this community. We conclude both (1) that social network
   interpretations of "social capital" might be better conceptualized in
   dialectic terms as collective action to survive in a harsh social order,
   and (2) that the social capital theory emphasis on trust and consensus
   as important causal factors for lowering drug-related risks at the
   community level may be a romanticized and erroneous perspective.

AB Evidence about the relationship between contextual variables and
   substance use is conflicting. Relationships between neighborhood income
   and income distribution and the prevalence and frequency of substance
   use in 59 NcwYork City (NYC) neighborhoods were assessed while
   accounting for individual income and other socio-demographic variables.
   Measures of current substance use (in the 30 days prior to the survey)
   were obtained from a random-digit-dial phone survey of adult residents
   of NYC and data from the 2000 U.S. Census to calculate median
   neighborhood income and income distribution (assessed using the Gini
   coefficient). Among 1355 respondents analyzed (female=56.2%, mean
   age=40.4), 23.9% reported cigarette, 40.0% alcohol, and 5.4% marijuana
   use in the previous 30 days. In ecologic assessment, neighborhoods with
   both the highest income and the highest income maldistribution had the
   highest prevalence of drinking alcohol (69.0%) and of smoking marijuana
   (10.5%) but not of cigarette use; there was no clear ecologic
   association between neighborhood income, income distribution, and
   cigarette use. In multilevel multivariable models adjusting for
   individual income, age, race, sex, and education, high neighborhood
   median income and maldistributed neighborhood income were both
   significantly associated with a greater likelihood of alcohol and
   marijuana use but not of cigarette use. Both high neighborhood income
   and maldistributed income also were associated with greater frequency of
   alcohol use among current alcohol drinkers. These observations suggest
   that neighborhood income and income distribution may play more important
   roles in determining population use of alcohol and marijuana than
   individual income, and that determinants of substance use may vary by
   potential for drug dependence. Further research should investigate
   specific pathways that may explain the relationship between neighborhood
   characteristics and use of different substances.

AB Background: Questions regarding the nature of the association between
   drug use and risk of homelessness remain unresolved and have important
   policy implications.
   Methods: To address this issue, data are presented from a 2001 community
   survey in Chicago, Illinois that collected information regarding
   histories of drug use behaviors and homeless experiences from 627 adults
   aged 18 to 40. Using covariance structure analyses, two alternative
   models of the association between drug use and homelessness were
   evaluated: social selection versus social adaptation processes.
   Results: These findings provide evidence consistent with the social
   adaptation perspective, as early homeless experiences were predictive of
   subsequent drug use behavior in this community sample. Social selection
   processes were observed in bivariate, but not in multivariate, analyses.
   Conclusions: The role of homelessness as a risk factor for drug use
   initiation should be further explored. Efforts to prevent homelessness
   may also contribute to the prevention of drug abuse.

AB Background: On a macrosocial level, neighborhood characteristics have
   been found to be associated with the prevalence of HIV and other
   bloodborne and sexually transmitted infections. The current study used
   structural equation modeling to examine the relationship between
   neighborhood social and physical disorder and high-risk sexual partners.
   Methods: A cohort (N=838) recruited for an HIV prevention study of drug
   users (2002-2004) in Baltimore, Maryland, was interviewed about their
   neighborhood characteristics, drug use, depressive symptoms (using the
   Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), and HIV/sexually
   transmitted infection risk behaviors of exchanging sex for money or
   drugs, having multiple sexual partners, and having partners who injected
   drugs or smoked crack cocaine. Data were analyzed in February 2005.
   Results: Model fit statistics from Mplus (Muthen & Muthen, Los Angeles
   CA, 2004) indicated statistically significant direct associations
   between neighborhood disorder and psychologic distress, neighborhood
   disorder and sexual risk behaviors, and neighborhood disorder and drug
   use. There were also significant indirect associations of neighborhood
   disorder on sexual risk behaviors.
   Conclusions: These results highlight the importance of viewing drug use,
   chronic stress, depression and hopelessness, and infectious diseases
   such as HIV and hepatitis C as interlinked epidemics that are fostered
   by neighborhood social and physical disorder. Neighborhood, network, and
   community level interventions are needed to address these intertwined
   public health issues.

AB Background: Around the year 1990, the reputation of cocaine use changed
   from glamorous to undesirable, and at the same time, a socioeconomic
   disparity in cocaine use emerged. This study examined (1) whether the
   socioeconomic disparity was created by differential incidence,
   differential cessation, or both, (2) whether a socioeconomic disparity
   also developed in marijuana use, and (3) whether disparities formed
   across race, Hispanic ethnicity, and/or gender.
   Methods: The analyses center on 6544 respondents aged 14-21 in 1979 in
   the National Longitudinal Survey of 1979 that provided information on
   past-year use of powder cocaine and marijuana use before and after
   1990-specifically, in 1984, 1988, 1992, 1994, and 1998.
   Results: Both differential incidence and differential cessation across
   education contributed to the formation of the socioeconomic disparity in
   cocaine use, although differential cessation played a more influential
   role in this cohort. A socioeconomic disparity in marijuana use also
   came about around the same time. No emerging disparities by race,
   Hispanic ethnicity, or gender were observed.
   Conclusions: This case study suggests that the redefinition of a health
   behavior as unhealthy will result in a socioeconomic disparity in the
   behavior across socioeconomic strata as a result of both differential
   incidence and cessation, but disparities will not necessarily form by
   race, ethnicity, or gender.

AB Background: HIV risk-reduction efforts have traditionally focused on the
   individual. The need for including the role of the social context and
   community is being recognized. Social capital provides social
   relationships and potential resources that may hinder or trigger risk or
   protective health behaviors, especially for individuals with limited
   economic means.
   Methods: Sixty-five adult inner-city female drug users, who were
   included in a woman-focused HIV risk-reduction intervention trial,
   participated in in-depth interviews in Atlanta, Georgia, between 2002
   and 2004. The interviews focused on the women's individual behavioral
   changes during the 6 months since completion of the intervention as well
   as on the impact of community conditions. Topics discussed were sexual
   and drug use behaviors, social relationships, social capital, and
   community physical and social infrastructure. The data were analyzed
   using the constant comparison methods.
   Results: The respondents indicated that poor physical and social
   infrastructure led to alienation and negatively affected their
   behavioral change efforts. Social capital and social support mediated
   these negative influences. Drug-related violence was especially
   debilitating in their efforts to reduce HIV risk associated with crack
   cocaine or injection drug use and associated sexual behavior.
   Environmental conditions and opportunity structures played salient roles
   in the women's success.
   Conclusions: Individual actions and community context must be considered
   simultaneously when facilitating and assessing behavioral interventions.

AB Background: Drug abuse is a significant public health problem because of
   its association with numerous negative health and social consequences.
   Examining the social context of drug use represents a burgeoning avenue
   of research in drug abuse. This study investigates the effects of
   neighborhood disadvantage and network factors on current heroin and
   cocaine use among a predominantly African-American adult sample residing
   in Baltimore City.
   Methods: This study employs a cross-sectional, multilevel design using
   data from two sources: the SHIELD Study, a network-oriented HIV
   intervention in Baltimore City and the 1990 U.S. Decennial Census. The
   sample consisted of 1305 adults from 249 neighborhoods (census block
   groups) across Baltimore City. Multilevel logistic regression analysis
   was performed to examine personal network and neighborhood effects on
   current heroin and cocaine use.
   Results: Neighborhood poverty was significantly associated with current
   heroin and cocaine use (odds ratio [OR]=1.51, confidence interval
   [Cl]=1.06-2.15). Social support (OR=0.80, CI=0.69-0.92) and having ties
   to employed people (OR=0.47, CI=0.24-0.92) were protective of current
   drug use, but did not buffer negative effects of neighborhood poverty in
   the face of negative drug influences in the network (OR=8.62,
   CI=5.81-12.79).
   Conclusions: The contexts of neighborhoods and networks represent key
   determinants in understanding the social epidemiology of drug abuse.
   Network attributes have strong influences on drug use, and neighborhood
   poverty may increase odds of use. Further research is warranted to
   determine other aspects of neighborhood environments that may put
   individuals at risk for drug use and abuse.

AB Eggs and sperm are parallel bodily goods in that each contributes half
   of the reproductive material needed to create life. Yet these cells are
   produced by differently sexed bodies, allowing for a comparative
   analysis of how the social process of bodily commodification varies
   based on sex and gender Drawing on interview and observational data from
   two egg agencies and two sperm banks in the United States, this article
   compares how staff recruit, screen, market, and compensate women and men
   donors. Results show how gendered norms inspire more altruistic rhetoric
   in egg donation than in sperm donation, producing different regimes of
   bodily commodification for women and men. I conclude by discussing the
   implications of these findings for debates in sociology of gender about
   biological differences among women and men and the cultural norms
   attributed to these differences; debates in economic sociology about how
   social factors shape the expansion of the market; and debates in medical
   sociology about the intersection of the market and medical practice.

   reverse-scored items with questionable utility. Here, using samples of
   undergraduates and a sample of clients with social anxiety disorder, we
   extend previous work that opened the question of whether the
   reverse-scored items belong on the scale. First, we successfully
   confirmed the factor structure obtained in previous samples. Second, we
   found the reverse-scored items to show consistently weaker relationships
   with a variety of comparison measures. Third, we demonstrated that
   removing the reverse-scored questions generally helps rather than
   hinders the psychometric performance of the SIAS total score. Fourth, we
   found that the reverse-scored items show a strong relationship with the
   normal personality characteristic of extraversion, suggesting that the
   reverse-scored items may primarily assess extraversion. Given the above
   results, we suggest investigators consider performing data analyses

   that most cultural ideas are not acquired by one form of learning or the
   other, but from a hybrid of both. Second, I discuss how individual
   learning can interact with niche construction. I argue that these
   processes collectively provide a non-social route for learned ideas to
   be inherited and cumulatively modified. I conclude that human culture is
   not inherited by social learning alone; the capacities to learn from and
   modify our environments also play a significant role.

   in the Rampur valley, one of the Important Bird Areas of Nepal, during
   2004. Among respondents, 38% were female, 62% male, 28% illiterate and
   72% literate. Households belonged to three ethno-religious groups (Hindu
   castes, ethnic groups and Muslim) and 96% of households had some parcels
   of registered land to farm. About 90% of households reared one or more
   types of livestock while the mean Livestock Size Unit was 3.32 per
   household. Livestock diseases and ailments were common and usually
   treated with diclofenac. Livestock carcass disposal practices were
   favourable to vultures because 60% of households dumped carcasses in
   open fields. Diclofenac is lethal to vultures; 3% of
   diclofenac-contaminated carcasses were available annually. The majority
   (78%) of respondents had favourable attitudes towards the concept of
   vulture conservation. Diclofenac contamination and the destruction of
   nesting habitat were two major threats to vultures. Ensuring healthy
   food through economic incentives, inculcating new values through
   environmental education and soliciting popular participation for habitat
   conservation are recommended.

AB The concept of "employee flexibility," and its implementation, have
   taken a central place in industrial sociology and human resources
   management during the last several decades. The two types of flexibility
   most often adopted in the workplace are functional and numerical.
   Employees and their labour unions approve of functional flexibility more
   often than numerical flexibility, which is usually rejected. This study
   is designed to examine the associations between functional and numerical
   flexibility with job rewards. Using 2002 General Social Survey (GSS) and
   Current Population Survey (CPS) data, the findings reveal significantly
   higher rewards for functionally flexible jobs while rewards associated
   with numerically flexible jobs vary significantly between and within two
   major categories - standard and nonstandard jobs. Among those with
   nonstandard jobs, independent contractors have significantly better
   opportunity for job rewards than other groups, such as regular part-time
   or on-call workers. The paper ends with a discussion on the theoretical
   significance of the findings and their policy implications.

AB Background: School-based smoking prevention programs sometimes fail in
   unexpected ways. This study tests the hypotheses that both
   social/cultural contexts and individual dispositional characteristics
   may interact with program content to produce effects that are variable
   in potentially predictable ways.
   Methods: Students in 24 culturally heterogeneous or primarily
   Hispanic/Latino middle schools (N = 3,157 6th graders) received a
   multicultural collectivist-framed social influences (SI) program, an
   individualist-framed SI program, or a control condition. Three-way
   linear and nonlinear interactions, program frame x social context x
   dispositional phenotype, were tested.
   Results: Three-way interactions were found for the dispositional
   phenotypes of depression and hostility with social context and program
   content/frame. In predominantly Hispanic/Latino schools, larger program
   effects were observed for high depressed and high hostile youth in both
   the collectivist and individualist framed programs. In culturally mixed
   schools, prevention effects were greatest for low depressed and low
   hostile youth, especially in the individualist framed program. In
   culturally mixed schools, there may have been a negative treatment
   effect for both programs among adolescents scoring high on depression
   and hostility.
   Discussion: Prevention program effects can vary by combination of
   program content, social setting, and individual dispositional
   characteristics. The results suggest that prevention program design and
   implementation should be sensitive to population characteristics at both
   the individual and sociocultural levels.

PD JUN 2007
PY 2007
AB Interdisciplinary environmental research has been deemed essential to
   addressing the dynamics of coupled social-biophysical systems. Although
   decades of scholarship in science and technology studies (STS) take the
   analysis of interdisciplinarity out of the realm of anecdote, there is
   almost no overlap between this literature and discussions of
   interdisciplinarity in ecology-oriented journals. The goals of
   researchers in these areas are quite different, and thus far, their
   analyses of interdisciplinarity have been incommensurate with each
   other's purposes. To introduce an STS perspective into how environmental
   scientists think about interdisciplinarity, I argue that biophysical and
   social scientists are not just bringing information and different
   understandings of biophysical and social systems to the intellectual
   table. Those knowledge claims have differential power associated with
   them: within the sciences, between social and biophysical science, and
   between science and society. Power can manifest in many ways, e.g.,
   individual scientific status, the most accepted account of an
   environmental problem, inclusion or exclusion of researchers, or
   perceived relevance of research to policy decisions. I propose four
   possible scenarios: conflict, tolerant ambivalence, mutual
   identification, cooperation, and fundamental transformation for how an
   interdisciplinary undertaking might unfold. Then, to constructively
   confront the relationship between power and knowledge, I outline a three
   stage process to enhance the transparent development of
   interdisciplinary research. First, there is differentiation of the
   analytical elements of the research, then clarification of purposes, and
   finally, the steps toward intellectual synthesis. As core differences
   are encountered, e.g., "subjectivity" vs. "objectivity," active
   engagement with these issues will be essential to successful
   communication, collaboration, and innovation.

   trade-off poses dilemmas for the governance of unofficial roads.
   Unofficial road building in frontier areas of the Brazilian Amazon
   illustrates the challenges of 'road governance.' Both state-based and
   community-based governance models exhibit important liabilities for
   governing unofficial roads. Whereas state-based governance has
   experienced difficulties in adapting to specific local contexts and
   interacting effectively with local peoples, community-based governance
   has a mixed record owing to social inequalities and conflicts among
   local interest groups. A state-community hybrid model may offer more
   effiective governance of unofficial road building by combining the
   oversight capacity of the state with locally-grounded community
   management via participatory decision-making.

AB Objective: To identify African American cultural characteristics that
   may be used to modify clinical trial designs and behavioral programs
   aimed at losing weight and maintaining weight loss.
   Design: Focus group discussions.
   Setting: University-affiliated biomedical research center.
   Participants: Thirty-one African American men and women who completed
   the screening process, but were ineligible for the Weight Loss
   Maintenance (WLM) trial, participated in one of five focus group
   sessions. WLM is a randomized controlled trial that compares two
   lifestyle interventions for preventing weight regain in individuals who
   have successfully lost weight in a group-based behavioral weight loss
   program.
   Results: Nine themes emerged as cultural characteristics specific to
   African Americans seeking participation in a lifestyle change program:
   1) religion is a powerful force; 2) family structure; 3) integration
   dismantled the African American family; 4) general mistrust of
   Caucasians; 5) African Americans are undervalued and not respected as a
   people; 6) limited resources equal limited ability to make lifestyle
   changes; 7) preservation of an explicit ethnic identity; 8) education is
   the key to success as an African American; and 9) communication skills
   are vital.
   Conclusions: Identifying cultural characteristics specific to African
   Americans may help investigators design clinical trials that will
   enhance outcomes and improve the generalizability of results in ethnic
   minority populations.

   The PrimeMD Patient Health Questionnaire was used to identify whether
   the women had subthreshold or major depressive syndrome. The analyses
   using the composite variable better account for the findings than the
   analyses using race as a separate variable. Researchers should strive to

AB Moral evolution theories have emphasized kinship, reciprocity, group

   sexually attractive. Darwin suggested that sexual attractiveness may
   explain many aspects of human morality. This paper updates his argument
   by integrating recent research on mate choice, person perception,
   individual differences, costly signaling, and virtue ethics. Many human
   virtues may have evolved in both sexes through mutual mate choice to
   advertise good genetic quality, parenting abilities, and/or partner
   traits. Such virtues may include kindness, fidelity, magnanimity, and
   heroism, as well as quasi-moral traits like conscientiousness,
   agreeableness, mental health, and intelligence. This theory leads to
   many testable predictions about the phenotypic features, genetic bases,
   and social-cognitive responses to human moral virtues.

   non-acceptance is a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium for rational
   egoists. Contrastingly, experiments with human subjects show willingness
   to accept such goods under a variety of conditions. Acceptance of the
   hot potato is positively related to payoff size and to the length of the
   remaining chain, but negatively related to the number of potential
   exchange partners. We find that subjects' behaviors are consistent with
   collectively oriented behavior, in contrast with their personal
   accounts. Implications for rational choice theory and economic sociology

AB Patterns of postsecondary attendance in the United States continue to be
   stratified by socioeconomic background and race/ethnicity. We suggest
   that inequalities in knowledge of the costs of going to college
   contribute to persistent patterns of stratification. We hypothesize that
   disadvantaged parents who believe their child will attend college are
   less certain of the costs of college attendance than more advantaged
   parents. As a result, they are less able or willing to provide an
   estimate of the costs of college attendance, more likely to
   over-estimate those costs if they do provide an estimate, and more
   likely to make larger errors in estimation than comparable middle-class
   or white parents. Using nationally representative data, we find mixed
   support for these hypotheses. Socioeconomically disadvantaged parents
   and minority parents are less likely to provide estimates of college
   tuition and, when they provide estimates, tend to make larger errors. On
   average, though, parents provide upwardly biased estimates of cost that
   are uniform across race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. We discuss
   implications of these findings for sociological theory and for
   inequality in postsecondary education. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights

AB This paper examines social pattern analysis, the yet-unarticulated
   research strategy that guides formal sociologists in their efforts to
   distill generic social patterns from their specific cultural,
   situational, and historical contexts. Following in the implicit
   methodological footsteps of Georg Simmel, social pattern analysts view
   specific sociohistorical configurations as mere instantiations of such
   patterns, thereby deliberately disregarding various idiosyncrasies of
   the particular communities, events, and social situations they examine.
   Analytically focused, they thus draw their evidence from multiple social
   contexts, thereby making their essentially decontextualized findings
   more generalizable. Furthermore, in sharp contrast to historians and
   ethnographers, they try to highlight universality rather than
   singularity, thereby focusing their attention on the common formal
   features of any given pattern across those contexts while deliberately
   ignoring differences among its various specific manifestations. The
   outcome of such transcultural, transsituational, and transhistorical
   (that is, transcontextual) mode of inquiry is an empirically grounded
   "social geometry."

   the novel point to certain key weaknesses in his broader social theory,
   and (2) to use a parallel reading of the same novel both to demonstrate
   said weaknesses and to embark on a discussion of the future
   possibilities of the sociology of literature, arguing that though we
   should not simply engage in Bourdieuian readings of literary texts, a
   consideration of the late sociologist's work could inspire a renewed,

AB Why has Christianity as a religious tradition survived for two
   millennia? What makes Christianity "work"? Many social scientific
   answers to related questions focus on structural forces shaping religion
   and on factors that explain variance across belief and practice. This
   article takes a different approach, seeking to explain the ongoing
   existence of the phenomenon itself before analyzing variance within it.
   The idea is to address basic causes of what exists as distinct frorn
   more superficial causes of variation within it. To do so, I take a
   phenomenological approach that focuses particularly on emotions, seeking
   to explicate the recurrent, characteristic, and subjective experiences
   of many Christians that help to explain their ongoing commitment to and
   involvement in the faith. I also reflect the subjective focus on
   emotions in the tone of the article, which introduces a strong sense of
   subjective experience and affect. By complementing typical sociological
   analyses of religious variance with this kind of causal analysis of its
   existence, this article seeks to expand our range of explanation and
   understanding in the sociology of religion.

AB In this article, Jean-Paul Sartre's relationship to the negritude
   movement and black intellectuals in Paris between the 1940s and the
   1960s is examined in sociological and historical context. Sartre's
   version of negritude, developed in his 1948 treatise "Orphee noir"
   prefacing Leopold Senghor's collection of African and Malagasy poetry,
   is analyzed in terms of its role in shaping the discourses and debates
   surrounding negritude and the relationship of black intellectuals to the
   rest of French society. Sartre's phenomenological theories of race,
   juxtaposing dominant and subaltern ideologies, are contrasted with his
   dialectic of negritude. The antinegritude movement of the late 1960s is
   also considered with reference to Sartre's theories and inspiration.
   During this period, the relationship that Sartre established with
   Martinican intellectual and revolutionary Frantz Fanon helped to place
   Sartre into prominence as an activist and a theorist of decolonization
   and Third World politics. Sartre's theories of race, self, and society
   were integral to both his early and later works and warrant review as
   approaches to the sociology of culture and sources of reflection for
   contemporary postcolonial studies.

PY 2007
AB This paper, which examines the work of journalists in one field, argues
   for the value of including journalists' own understandings and practices
   in analyses of the role of the media. Moreover it suggests that, in this
   field, there may be more commonalities between the practices of
   journalism and social science than is commonly supposed.
   The paper is based upon a set of interviews with scientific and
   financial journalists, covering their interpretations of
   nanotechnologies and their development. Whereas much of the social
   scientific work to date in this area has been concerned with the public
   understanding of science, and the role that journalism plays in relation
   to this, our study addresses the parallel issue of how, in a field
   characterised by high levels of commercialisation, potential investors
   get information and make judgments about particular applications, and
   the extent to which journalism plays a key role in this process. Here,
   we focus not primarily on the ways in which the media frame
   understandings of a complex technology, important though they may be,
   but on the practical epistemological strategies that journalists employ
   to make sense of it.
   We argue that journalists can be seen to be engaged in epistemological
   strategies that are analogous to those of sociologists, and that this
   dimension is too easily missed by approaches that, for example,
   recommend that the correct unit of analysis should always be journalism
   rather than journalists. We conclude by suggesting that, whilst the
   general applicability of our argument to other fields of journalism is
   necessarily an empirical question, our approach may have more general
   significance for debates about the critical role of social science.

AB Historically, the disease course of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been
   generally characterized by steady progression, with unpredictable
   relapses possibly resulting in remission. There has always been the
   threat of incomplete recovery during this period. Therefore, each
   relapse is a powerful reminder of the chronic nature of the disease,
   with a profound effect on the social sphere of the individual with MS.
   MS in general, and relapses in particular, strain the coping mechanisms
   of the individual and his or her family, friends, and vocational
   network. Recent evidence has shown that disease-modifying therapy
   reduces the frequency and severity of MS relapses, an important goal of
   MS management. Nevertheless, it is important for clinicians to be
   familiar with the widespread psychosocial impact of MS in terms of their
   patients' social involvement, partnership and family roles, and

AB This paper briefly summarizes a laboratory study investigating
   strategies designed to improve the ability of our most vulnerable
   drivers, the elderly, to safely negotiate the most dangerous and
   demanding of all traffic situations - intersections - through increased
   use of modern roundabouts. Compared to conventional intersections,
   roundabouts have demonstrated the potential to significantly reduce the
   most injurious (angle) type of crashes and slow the operating speed of
   all vehicles, while maintaining a high capacity for moving traffic
   through an intersection, This research sought to develop and evaluate
   countermeasures with the potential to improve the perceived comfort,
   confidence, and/or safety of seniors in using roundabouts. Research
   methods included focus groups and structured interviews utilizing
   photographs, which had been edited to include novel traffic control
   devices. The results suggest that design elements that improve the path
   guidance for older drivers are necessary to encourage roundabout use by
   this group. Recommendations for improved practice related to advance
   warning signs, guide signs, yield treatments, directional signs, and
   exit treatments are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Context: Coverage and enforcement provisions of safety belt use laws
   vary by state. Most laws cover drivers and passengers age 16 and above.
   "Primary" enforcement laws allow police to stop and ticket a motorist
   for a safety belt law violation. With "secondary" enforcement laws,
   ticketing can only occur in the presence of another traffic infraction.
   Given the lower rates of restraint use among teen drivers and their
   passengers, the effect of primary enforcement laws on the restraint use
   of young teen passengers is of particular interest.
   Objective: To compare restraint use by 13-15 year olds passengers in
   motor vehicle crashes in states with primary versus secondary
   enforcement safety belt laws.
   Methods: Cross-sectional study of 3953 crashes involving 5372 children,
   representing 54,226 children aged 13-15 years in 41,198 crashes of
   insured vehicles in 16 states and Washington, DC between December 1,
   1998 and December 31, 2004, with data collected via insurance claims
   records and a telephone survey.
   Results: Non-use of restraints by 13-15 year olds was 7.2% (95% CI
   4.3-10. 1 %) greater in secondary enforcement states (10.8%) as compared
   to states with primary enforcement laws (3.6%). After controlling for
   driver's age and restraint status and the seating row of the occupant, a
   13-15 year olds was over twice as likely to be unrestrained in a
   secondary enforcement state as compared to a primary enforcement state
   (adjusted RR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3. 1).
   Conclusions: States considering primary enforcement provisions to their
   restraint laws should consider the potential benefits these laws may
   have to all occupants in the vehicle, particularly young adolescents who
   are nearing driving age. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB A revised attachment system for child restraint systems (CRS), Lower
   Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH), was introduced to address
   issues of misuse of attachment of the CRS to the vehicle. This study
   provides the first real-world experience of this new restraint system.
   Relevant cases were selected from the partners for child passenger
   safety (PCPS) child-specific crash surveillance system based in the
   United States. Vehicles qualifying for the PCPS study were those model
   year 1990 or newer involved in a crash with at least one passenger >= 15
   years of age. A subset of seven cases in which LATCH lower anchors were
   used was chosen for in-depth crash investigation and interview. Review
   of these data found misuse remained a frequent occurrence (5/7 cases).
   The presence of a loose harness in several cases demonstrated that the
   focus of LATCH on the attachment of the CRS to the vehicle did not
   remove one of the most common CRS misuses. Further, significant injuries
   still do occur although LATCH lower anchor performance was not
   necessarily a contributing factor to any of these injuries. This subset
   of cases demonstrates that consumers are using the LATCH technology, at
   times with significant misuse and that significant injury still may
   occur, despite use of LATCH. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The Tuskegee Institute opened a polio center in 1941, funded by the
   March of Dimes. The center's founding was the result of a new visibility
   of Black polio survivors and the growing political embarrassment around
   the policy of the Georgia Warm Springs polio rehabilitation center,
   which Franklin Roosevelt had founded in the 1920s before he became
   president and which had maintained a Whites-only policy of admission.
   This policy, reflecting the ubiquitous norm of race-segregated health
   facilities of the era, was also sustained by a persuasive scientific
   argument about polio itself: that Blacks were not susceptible to the
   disease.
   After a decade of civil rights activism, this notion of polio as a White
   disease was challenged, and Black health professionals, emboldened by a
   new integrationist epidemiology, demanded that in polio, as in American
   medicine at large, health care should be provided regardless of race,
   color, or creed.

AB Objectives. We examined correlates of eviction and homelessness among
   current and former welfare recipients from 1997 to 2003 in an urban
   Michigan community.
   Methods. Longitudinal cohort data were drawn from the Women's Employment
   Study, a representative panel study of mothers who were receiving cash
   welfare in February 1997. We used logistic regression analysis to
   identify risk factors for both eviction and homelessness over the survey
   period.
   Results. Twenty percent (95% confidence interval [CI] = 16%, 23%) of
   respondents were evicted and 12% (95% CI = 10%, 15%) experienced
   homelessness at least once between fall 1997 and fall 2003. Multivariate
   analyses indicated 2 consistent risk factors: having less than a high
   school education and having used illicit drugs other than marijuana.
   Mental and physical health problems were significantly associated with
   homelessness but not evictions. A multivariate screening algorithm
   achieved 750% sensitivity and 67% specificity in identifying individuals
   at risk for homelessness. A corresponding algorithm for eviction
   achieved 75% sensitivity and 50% specificity.
   Conclusions. The high prevalence of housing instability among our
   respondents suggests the need to better target housing assistance and
   other social services to current and former welfare recipients with
   identifiable personal problems.

AB Objectives. We sought to determine whether the association between
   neighborhood characteristics and health differs for people with and
   without a chronic condition.
   Methods. We analyzed data from 2536 adults from the Los Angeles Family
   and Neighborhood Survey and evaluated the relationship between the
   presence of a chronic condition at the individual level, neighborhood
   socioeconomic status (SES), and self-rated health. We constructed
   multilevel models to evaluate the relationship between the neighborhood
   SES index and self-rated health for people with and without chronic
   conditions, after adjustment for other individual characteristics.
   Results. Having a chronic condition was associated with substantially
   poorer self-rated health among participants in a deprived area than
   among those in a more advantaged area.
   Conclusions. Residence in a disadvantaged neighborhood may be associated
   with barriers to the management of a chronic condition. Further work is
   needed to identify the specific characteristics of disadvantaged areas
   associated with poorer self-rated health for adults with chronic
   conditions.

AB Within a second of seeing an emotional facial expression, people
   typically match that expression. These rapid facial reactions (RFRs),
   often termed mimicry, are implicated in emotional contagion, social
   perception, and embodied affect, yet ambiguity remains regarding the
   mechanism(s) involved. Two studies evaluated whether RFRs to faces are
   solely nonaffective motor responses or whether emotional processes are
   involved. Brow (corrugator, related to anger) and forehead (frontalis,
   related to fear) activity were recorded using facial electromyography
   (EMG) while undergraduates in two conditions (fear induction vs.
   neutral) viewed fear, anger, and neutral facial expressions. As
   predicted, fear induction increased fear expressions to angry faces
   within 1000 Pits of exposure, demonstrating an emotional component of
   RFRs. This did not merely reflect increased fear from the induction,
   because responses to neutral faces were unaffected. Considering RFRs to
   be merely nonaffective automatic reactions is inaccurate. RFRs are not
   purely motor mimicry; emotion influences early facial responses to
   faces. The relevance of these data to emotional contagion, autism, and
   the mirror system-based perspectives on imitation is discussed.

   relationship (parents' marital satisfaction and parent conflict styles),
   the mother child relationship (maternal involvement and warmth) and
   maternal emotional functioning (depression, anxiety and self-esteem)
   relate to children's cortisol levels. Parents of 63 children (32
   kindergarten-aged children, 31 adolescents) completed questionnaires
   regarding family and individual functioning, and children's salivary
   cortisol samples were collected on two consecutive weekdays at home
   immediately upon waking and at bedtime, such that wakeup, bedtime and
   average levels and the slope of their diurnal cortisol rhythms could be
   estimated. Higher marital functioning was significantly and
   independently associated with lower child cortisol levels (average
   levels and wakeup levels), while maternal parenting quality and
   emotional functioning were not significant when included in the same
   regression model. Associations between parents' marital functioning and
   children's bedtime cortisol levels and diurnal slopes were moderated by
   child age, with higher parent marital functioning being associated with
   a significantly greater lowering of bedtime levels and steeper diurnal
   slopes for kindergarten-aged children as compared to adolescents. Higher
   maternal parenting quality was found to be significantly related to
   steeper diurnal cortisol rhythms.

AB Children's agentic and communal goals were examined in hypothetical
   conflict, group entry, victimization, and positive situations (N = 310,
   11-13 years). Multilevel modeling was used to separate the variation in
   goals to the between- and within- (i.e., situation-specific) individual
   levels. About half of the variation in goals was due to individual
   differences. Boys endorsed more agentic goals than girls. A positive
   perception of self was associated with more agentic goals, whereas a
   positive perception of peers was associated with high degrees of
   communal goals. In addition, agentic goals were associated with
   rejection, whereas communal goals were related to peer acceptance.
   Children aimed for closeness with peers most often when no stressful
   interaction pattern was imposed (positive situation), endorsing fewer
   affiliation aims when involved in a conflict, and having the least of
   these aims when victimized by peers. Agentic goals, in turn, were most
   common in the victimization situation, the next typical in conflict and
   positive situations, and least likely in the group entry situation.
   Finally, the way children adjusted their goals in response to the
   victimization situation varied between children, and was related to

AB This study examined the role of low social preference in relation to
   subsequent depressive symptoms, with particular attention to prior
   depressive symptoms, prior and concurrent aggression, mutual
   friendships, and peer victimization. Italian children (N = 288) were
   followed from grade 6 through grade 8, and American children (N = 585)
   were followed from kindergarten through grade 12. Analyses demonstrate
   that low social preference contributes to later depressive symptoms. The
   effects are not accounted for by depressive symptoms or aggression
   experienced prior to low social preference but are mostly accounted for
   by the co-occurrence of depressive symptoms with concurrent aggressive
   behavior; gender, mutual friendships, and peer victimization generally
   did not moderate these associations. We conclude that peer relationship
   problems do predict later depressive symptoms, and a possible mechanism
   through which this effect occurs is through the effect of poor peer
   relationships on increasing aggressive behavior, which is associated
   with depressive symptoms.

AB Objective: The present study examines the relationships among reasons
   for drinking, alcohol consumption, and alcohol-related consequences in
   two college-aged samples. Personal motivators such as mood enhancement
   and coping (tension reduction) have consistently been shown to predict
   problematic alcohol use, but because of the salient nature of social
   drinking in college, we hypothesized that social reasons for drinking
   would be most frequently endorsed and, in turn, predict negative
   consequences. Method: Two distinct samples-19 coed adjudicated students
   sanctioned by the university for violating campus alcohol policy and 106
   co-ed volunteer students-completed measures assessing alcohol
   consumption, reasons for drinking, and consequences. Differential
   effects between genders were examined. Results: Social camaraderie (SC)
   was the most frequently endorsed reason for drinking. Regression
   analyses controlling for previous drinking revealed that social reasons
   for drinking predicted alcohol-related problems among female students in
   both samples. Additionally, SC was significantly correlated with every
   drinking measure and problem measure at 1 month for females in both the
   adjudicated and the volunteer groups. Total drinks, drinking days, and
   heavy episodic drinking events correlated with SC for males in the
   adjudicated sample. Conclusions: For females, these results suggest a
   relationship between social reasons for drinking and alcohol-related
   consequences, which previous research has not identified. More research
   is needed to explore females' reasons for drinking, accompanying
   problems, and the underlying psychosocial traits associated with these
   reasons.

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
VL 68
IS 3
BP 410
EP 418
PD MAY 2007
PY 2007
AB Objective: Previous research has consistently demonstrated that
   religiosity and personal importance of religion are associated with
   lower levels of alcohol use among both adolescents and college students.
   Although a number of different mechanisms have been proposed to account
   for this, few studies have empirically examined potential mediators of
   this relationship. Given the extensive literature on the impact of
   social norms on the drinking behavior of college students, the present
   study evaluates the role of perceived drinking norms as a mediator of
   the relationship between the importance of religion and alcohol use.
   Specifically, we examined both personal attitudes and perceived
   injunctive norms with regard to reference groups that vary in their
   proximity to students (i.e., close friends and typical college
   students). Method: Participants were 1,400 undergraduate students (60.6%
   women) who were assessed using self-report measures of alcohol
   consumption, importance of religion, attitudes, and perceived norms.
   Results: Results indicated that, consistent with the hypotheses,
   personal attitudes were the strongest mediator of the relationship
   between importance of religion and alcohol use, followed by the approval
   of close friends, and, to a lesser extent, the approval of typical
   college students. Conclusions: These findings suggest that importance of
   religion may have an indirect effect on alcohol use via personal
   attitudes and the perceived approval or disapproval of important others,
   and this relationship varies as a function of reference group.
   Implications for interventions that incorporate information on social
   norms are discussed.

EP 436
PD MAY 2007
PY 2007
AB Objective: Studies have shown that individuals with substance-use
   problems frequently receive pressure to enter treatment. Pressure can
   come from institutions (e.g., criminal justice or welfare) or
   relationships (e.g., family or friends). Research has also shown that
   pressure can facilitate treatment entry. However, few studies have
   assessed how pressure from different sources varies. Method: Six hundred
   ninety-eight individuals entering residential or outpatient treatment
   for alcohol or drug problems completed face-to-face interviews soon
   after admission. Pressure was assessed by asking participants if others
   had suggested they enter treatment, including family, friends, and
   professionals within institutions. Additional assessments included the
   Addiction Severity Index and readiness to change. Results: Most of the
   participants (73%) reported some type of pressure: 29% from personal
   relationships, 30% from institutions, and 14% from both. The remaining
   27% reported no pressure to enter treatment. Multinomial logistic
   regression of baseline data showed being on parole or probation, not
   being employed full time, and having more severe legal problems
   predicted pressure from institutions. In contrast, relationship pressure
   at baseline was predicted by severity of alcohol problems. Compared with
   participants receiving only relationship pressure, those receiving only
   institutional pressure had lower alcohol, drug, family, psychiatric, and
   medical severity. In addition, institutional pressure was associated
   with lower motivation at baseline, whereas relationship pressure was not
   related to motivation at all. When controlling for problem severity,
   baseline pressure was not associated with 12-month outcome. Conclusions:
   Correlates of pressure from institutions for individuals to enter
   treatment differ from those associated with pressure from personal
   relationships to enter treatment. Implications of these findings for
   public policy, treatment, and further research are discussed.

TI Upward pressures on drinking: Exposure and reactivity in adulthood

EP 445
PD MAY 2007
PY 2007
AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the situations most
   commonly linked with increased drinking for different life periods and
   for nonproblem and problem drinkers. Method: A community sample of older
   adults (average age 69 years; 42% women), consisting of 480 nonproblem
   and 351 problem drinkers, provided information about their life history
   of drinking. For each of three life periods (early adulthood, early
   middle age, and late middle age), respondents indicated whether they
   experienced particular situations (exposure) and, if so, whether they
   increased their alcohol consumption in response to these situations
   (reactivity). These situations included social influences and stressors.
   Results: Exposure to social influences and to stressors varied across
   life periods, as did drinking reactivity. Overall, the social influences
   of having peers or a partner who drank and the stressors of family
   interpersonal problems and emotional distress were common experiences
   and also were among the most likely to be linked with increased alcohol
   consumption. Compared with nonproblem drinkers, problem drinkers
   reported significantly higher levels of exposure to social influences
   and to stressors and also were much more reactive to them. Conclusions:
   Prevention and treatment of alcohol use disorders can be tailored to
   take into account variations in exposure and reactivity to situations
   that may place upward pressure on drinking.

AB African-American men bear a greater, burden of type-2 diabetes and its
   associated complications. The purpose of this analysis was to explore in
   greater depth themes that emerged. in illness narratives of a small
   sample of African-American men living with type-2 diabetes. The primary
   theme that is the focus of this article is the lived experience of black
   manhood-and masculinity and its intersection with the challenges of
   diabetes self-management. In-depth interviews with 16 African-American
   men who had established type-2 diabetes yielded thematic analyses of
   four questions: 1) What do you fear most about having diabetes? 2) In
   what ways have people in your life treated you differently after
   learning you have diabetes? 3) In what ways has knowing you have
   diabetes affected the way you see yourself? and 4) What are some
   reactions when you tell people you have diabetes?. This preliminary
   study suggests that the requirements of diabetes self-management often
   run counter to the traditional sex roles and learned behaviors of
   African-American men, and this can contribute to nonadherence to
   medications and poor glycemic control. Gender identity is a key cultural
   factor that influences health-related behaviors, including how men with
   type-2 diabetes engage with the healthcare system and manage their
   diabetes, Understanding African-American men's gender identity is an
   important component of cultural competency for physicians and can be
   consequential in patient outcomes.

AB OBJECTIVES. Studies suggest that having a child with autism has a
   negative impact on maternal psychological functioning, but no
   large-scale, population-based studies are available. The objectives of
   this study were to (1) describe the psychological functioning, physical
   and mental health, family communication, and parenting support of
   mothers of a child with autism compared with other mothers on a
   population basis and (2) assess the independent relationship between
   having a child with autism and these outcomes, controlling for the
   child's social skills and demographic background.
   METHODS. Mothers of 61 772 children who were 4 to 17 years of age were
   surveyed by the National Survey of Children's Health, 2003. Autism was
   measured from an affirmative maternal response to the question, "Has a
   doctor or health professional ever told you your child has autism?"
   There were 364 children with autism in the sample.
   RESULTS. Mothers of a child with autism were highly stressed and more
   likely to report poor or fair mental health than mothers in the general
   population, even after adjustment for the child's social skills and
   demographic background. However, mothers of a child with autism were
   more likely to report a close relationship and better coping with
   parenting tasks and less likely to report being angry with their child
   after adjustment for the child's social skills and demographic
   background. Having a child with autism was not associated with lower
   social support for parenting, an altered manner in which serious
   disagreements were discussed in the household, or increased violence in
   the household.
   CONCLUSION. Mothers of children with autism showed remarkable strengths
   in the parent-child relationship, social support, and stability of the
   household in the context of high stress and poorer mental health.

AB Objective. Little is known about the types of physical activity (PA) in
   which adolescent girls participate. Understanding this, along with
   examining specific psychosocial correlates of PA, may help guide the
   development of effective interventions to prevent the decline in PA in
   female youth.
   Methods. 2791 sixth grade girls participating in the Trial of Activity
   for Adolescent Girls from six geographical locations completed surveys
   assessing participation in sports teams and activity classes/lessons in
   and out of school, self-efficacy for PA, PA enjoyment, physical
   education (PE) enjoyment, and perceived school climate for girls' PA
   (data collection: January-May 2003). Correlates of girls' participation
   in structured PA and sociodemographic differences were explored.
   Results. 89.5% of girls participated in structured PA: 39% at school and
   86% outside of school. Across race/ethnicity, most reported activities
   were basketball (44%), cheerleading/dance (41%), and swimming (39%).
   Controlling for socioeconomic status, geographical location, and race/
   ethnicity, girls with a higher self-efficacy (OR=3.44, CI= 1.72-6.92)
   and higher enjoyment of PE class (OR= 1.97, CI= 1.25-3.120) were more
   likely to participate in structured PA. PA enjoyment and perceived
   school climate for girls' PA were not associated with participation in
   structured PA.
   Conclusion. Interventions that increase self-efficacy and enjoyment of
   PE could result in greater participation in structured PA and higher
   overall PA levels among adolescent girls. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All

AB This article presents a theory of norm enforcement. Dominant accounts
   explain norms by referring to their consequences. On this view, norms
   are enforced when doing so increases the welfare of group members. While
   useful, such approaches do not explain much of what we observe. The
   theory developed here argues that while sanctioning consequences are
   part of the explanation, characteristics of social relations - in
   particular, interdependence - have significant effects. Hypotheses are
   tested using unique data that include quantitative behavioral measures
   of norm and metanorm enforcement. The results show that the effects of
   sanctioning benefits and costs vary depending on the level of
   interdependence between group members. Further, concern with social
   relations, not sanctioning benefits and costs, explains metanorm
   enforcement. The research therefore suggests that explanations that
   focus on the direct consequences of sanctioning, and that fail to
   incorporate characteristics of social relations, may produce inaccurate
   predictions. Accordingly, understanding the role of social relations is
   essential for explaining norm enforcement.

AB Mental retardation, a condition characterized by significantly lower
   than average intellectual ability and adaptive behavior deficits,
   currently affects between 2% and 3% of the population. Individuals with
   mental retardation experience many difficulties throughout their lives,
   with one such difficulty being that they have few opportunities for
   community involvement and often have few social relationships. To
   deten-nine if increased community involvement and increased
   socialization are among the most common desires expressed by individuals
   with mental retardation, we conducted a study examining pre-existing
   data of 1348 individuals. The study focused on specific desires
   expressed by individuals with mental retardationincluding, but not
   limited to, increased community involvement and increased socialization.
   Although these individuals expressed a wide variety of desires, they
   expressed a desire for increased community involvement most frequently.
   Individuals also frequently expressed a desire for increased
   socialization, change of residence, work-related changes, increased
   personal belongings, and increased personal activities. We discuss the
   importance of community involvement and socialization, the link between
   the two, interactions that could potentially exist among other expressed
   desires, and ways of increasing community involvement while addressing
   other desires that individuals with mental retardation expressed. (c)

AB People with schizophrenia frequently have significant problems in
   community functioning. Progress in developing effective interventions to
   ameliorate these problems has been slowed by the absence of reliable and
   valid measures that are suitable for use in clinical trials. The
   National Institute of Mental Health convened a workgroup in September
   2005 to examine this issue and make recommendations to the field that
   would foster research in this area. This article reports on issues
   raised at the meeting. Many instruments have been developed to assess
   community functioning, but overall insufficient attention has been paid
   to psychometric issues and many instruments are not suitable for use in
   clinical trials. Consumer self-report, informant report, ratings by
   clinicians and trained raters, and behavioral assessment all can provide
   useful and valid information in some circumstances and may he practical
   for use in clinical trials. However, insufficient attention has been
   paid to when and how different forms of assessment and sources of
   information are useful or how to understand inconsistencies. A major
   limiting factor in development of reliable and valid instruments is
   failure to develop a suitable model of functioning and its primary
   mediators and moderators. Several examples that can guide thinking are
   presented. Finally, the field is limited by the absence of an objective
   gold standard of community functioning. Hence, outcomes must be
   evaluated in part by "clinical significance." This criterion is
   problematic because different observers and constituencies often have
   different opinions about what types of change are clinically important
   and how much change is significant.

AB While modernization theory has been largely abandoned in the social
   sciences, its influence is evident in environmental Kuznets curves,
   ecological modernization, and forest transition theory. These
   environmental social theories have consequently undergone criticism and
   varying degrees of reformulation that moved them away from modernization
   trappings, and in the process opened them to greater influence from
   theoretical perspectives in other social science disciplines, as well as
   the biophysical sciences. This is not unique to modernization-based
   environmental social theories, and raises questions about theoretical
   reformulations with cross-disciplinary contributions as a means of
   moving toward an interdisciplinary environmental science. Challenges to
   such efforts arise due to theoretical disputes and misunderstandings,
   which in turn hinder cross-disciplinary critiques of environmental
   social theories. While these challenges can be addressed via more
   transparent dialogue, reformulations should be viewed as provisional and
   incomplete. Whether theoretical reformulations and interdisciplinarity
   will suffice to address time-sensitive environmental questions remains
   to be seen.

AB Most studies examining the relation between residential environment and
   health have used census-derived measures of neighborhood socioeconomic
   position (SEP). There is a need to identify specific features of
   neighborhoods relevant to disease risk, but few measures of these
   features exist, and their measurement properties are understudied. In
   this paper, the authors 1) develop measures (scales) of neighborhood
   environment that are important in cardiovascular disease risk, 2) assess
   the psychometric and ecometric properties of these measures, and 3)
   examine individual- and neighborhood-level predictors of these measures.
   In 2004, data on neighborhood conditions were collected from a telephone
   survey of 5,988 residents at three US study sites (Baltimore, Maryland;
   Forsyth County, North Carolina; and New York, New York). Information
   collected covered seven dimensions of neighborhood environment
   (aesthetic quality, walking environment, availability of healthy foods,
   safety, violence, social cohesion, and activities with neighbors).
   Neighborhoods were defined as census tracts or census clusters.
   Cronbach's alpha coefficient ranged from 0.73 to 0.83, with test-retest
   reliabilities of 0.60-0.88. Intraneighborhood correlations were
   0.28-0.51, and neighborhood reliabilities were 0.64-0.78 for census
   tracts for most scales. The neighborhood scales were strongly associated
   with neighborhood SEP but also provided information distinct from
   neighborhood SEP. These results illustrate a methodological approach for
   assessing the measurement properties of neighborhood-level constructs
   and show that these constructs can be measured reliably.

AB The influence of childhood socioeconomic status (SES) on incidence of
   type 2 diabetes mellitus has not previously been studied. The authors
   prospectively examined the association of childhood SES (father's
   occupation) with incidence of diabetes in 100,330 US women who were
   followed from 1980 to 2002. In 55,115 of those women, 10-year follow-up
   data (1992-2002) were also available on adult SES (spouse's education).
   In all, 6,916 new cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. Compared
   with women from white-collar occupational backgrounds, the
   multivariate-adjusted risks of diabetes were 1.08 (95% confidence
   interval (CI): 0.95,1.23) among women whose fathers were laborers and
   1.10 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.16) among women whose fathers were blue-collar or
   lower white-collar workers. Lower adult SES was associated with risk of
   diabetes independently of childhood SES. Compared with women whose
   spouses had graduate degrees, women whose spouses were high school
   graduates had a 1.16 times higher risk of incident diabetes (95% CI:
   1.04, 1.29), while women whose spouses had college degrees were at 1.14
   times the risk (95% CI: 1.01, 1.29). Compared with women with stable
   high SES from childhood to adulthood, women with declining SES had a
   1.18 times higher risk of incident diabetes (95% CI: 1.06, 1.32). Higher
   body mass index among women with lower SES accounted for much of these
   rather modest associations between childhood and adult SES and risk of
   diabetes.

AB Objective. To assess peer relationships of adolescents with juvenile
   primary fibromyalgia syndrome (JPFS) compared with matched classroom
   comparison peers (MCCPs) without a chronic illness. JPFS is
   characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain, sleep disturbance,
   fatigue, and difficulty with daily functioning. Adolescents with JPFS
   often report problems with school and participating in peer activities,
   placing them at risk for social isolation from their peers and
   psychosocial adjustment problems.
   Methods. Participants were 55 adolescents with JPFS (ages 12-18 years)
   from a pediatric outpatient rheumatology clinic and 55 MCCPs. Data on
   peer reputation and peer acceptance were collected from teachers, peers,
   and self report in a classroom setting with no focus on JPFS.
   Results. Adolescents with JPFS were perceived (by peer and self reports)
   as being more isolated and withdrawn and less popular. Adolescents with
   JPFS were less well liked, were selected less often as a best friend,
   and had fewer reciprocated friendships.
   Conclusion. Our findings suggest that adolescents with JPFS are
   experiencing problems with peer relationships. Given the central role
   that peer relationships play in psychological development of children,
   and because peer rejection and isolation have been associated with
   subsequent adjustment problems, these findings are concerning.
   Longitudinal studies of adolescents with JPFS are needed to ascertain
   whether these patients are at long-term risk and will provide a
   foundation for the need for early interventions. Results are discussed
   within the context of earlier findings for other adolescents with
   chronic illness and rheumatic conditions, such as juvenile idiopathic
   arthritis, who demonstrated no social problems.

AB Synovial fluid is a semidilute hyaluronate (HA) polymer solution, the
   rheology of which depends on HA-protein interactions, and lubricin is a
   HA-binding protein found in synovial fluid and at cartilage surfaces,
   where it contributes to boundary lubrication under load. Individuals
   with genetic deficiency of lubricin develop precocious joint failure.
   The role of lubricin in synovial fluid rheology is not known. We used a
   multiple-particle-tracking microrheology technique to study the
   molecular interactions between lubricin and HA in synovial fluid.
   Particles (200 nm mean diameter) embedded in normal and
   lubricin-cleficient synovial fluid samples were tracked separately by
   using multiple-particle-tracking microrheology. The time-dependent
   ensemble-averaged mean-squared displacements of all of the particles
   were measured over a range of physiologically relevant frequencies. The
   mean-squared displacement correlation with time lag had slopes with
   values of unity for simple HA solutions and for synovial fluid from an
   individual who genetically lacked lubricin, in contrast to slopes with
   values less than unity (alpha approximate to 0.6) for normal synovial
   fluid. These data correlated with bulk rheology studies of the same
   samples. We found that the subdiffusive and elastic behavior of synovial
   fluid, at physiological shear rates, was absent in fluid from a patient
   who lacks lubricin. We conclude that lubricin provides synovial fluid
   with an ability to dissipate strain energy induced by mammalian
   locomotion, which is a chondroprotective feature that is distinct from
   boundary lubrication.

   were asked to estimate how often patients mention R/S issues, how much
   R/S influences health, and in what ways the influence is manifested.
   Results: The response rate was 63%. Most physicians (56%) believed that
   R/S had much or very much influence on health, but few (6%) believed
   that R/S often changed "hard" medical outcomes. Rather, most physicians
   believed that R/S (1) often helps patients to cope (76%), (2) gives
   patients a positive state of mind (75%), and (3) provides emotional and
   practical support via the religious community (55%). Compared with those
   with low religiosity, physicians with high religiosity are substantially
   more likely to (1) report that patients often mention R/S issues (36% vs
   11%) (P<.001); (2) believe that R/S strongly influences health (82% vs;
   16%) (P<.001); and (3) interpret the influence of R/S in positive rather
   than negative ways.
   Conclusion: Patients are likely to encounter quite different opinions
   about the relationship between their R/S and their health, depending on
   the religious characteristics of their physicians.

AB Worldwide, societal shifts and behavioural patterns exacerbated by
   unique developmental vulnerabilities create a confluence of factors that
   place today's adolescents at heightened risks for poor health outcomes.
   Country-level data show that continued investment in effective
   prevention and treatment strategies is essential to protect adolescents'
   sexual and reproductive health. Whereas strategies must be tailored to
   the developmental needs of this age group and their social contexts,
   effective approaches are multifaceted. All adolescents need access to
   quality youth-friendly services provided by clinicians trained to work
   with this population. Sex education programmes should offer accurate,
   comprehensive information while building skills for negotiating sexual
   behaviours. Girls and boys also need equal access to youth development
   programmes that connect them with supportive adults and with educational
   and economic opportunities. Although progress has been made since the
   1994 International Conference on Population and Development, adolescents
   continue to be disproportionately burdened by threats to their sexual
   and reproductive health.

   1-year and 2-year follow-ups (N= 1459) from the control group of a
   longitudinal smoking prevention trial participated. We focused on the
   main effects, as well as, interaction effects between psychosocial
   protective factors and various risk factors, including perceived norms
   of friends, peers and adults to use drugs. Significant effects were
   identified for intensity of poly-drug use and future smoking. The
   analysis of the poly-drug use outcome indicated that refusal
   assertiveness undermined perceived friends' drug use and siblings'
   smoking, and that low risk-taking undermined perceived friends' drug
   use. There was a main effect for low psychological wellness. The
   significant interactions between perceived friends' drug use with
   refusal assertiveness and decision-making skills were observed for
   future smoking. Moreover, perceived peer smoking norms, siblings'
   smoking, and high risk-taking also showed significant main effects for
   increasing future smoking. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   reports that women and people with mental health problems have
   difficulty in obtaining employment. The current study examined gender
   differences in mental health and employment barriers in a sample of drug

   test the hypothesis that differences in employment barriers among
   drug-abusing males and females are mediated by differences in mental
   health problems. Women were found to have more mental health problems
   and employment barriers, and support for the mediation hypothesis was
   found. Implications for drug treatment providers are discussed.

AB The purpose of this article is to analyze the relation between
   scientific knowledge in the form of theories and the world that such
   theories are about. The focus is on market theories. I argue that
   everyday knowledge, conceptualized using the notion of "lifeworld," is
   the bedrock of scientific knowledge. I also make two distinctions, one
   between types of markets and one between principles of order in markets.
   There are two different types of markets, fixed-role markets and
   switch-role markets, and no existing theory can be used to explain both
   of them. In fixed-role markets, such as a producer market of garments,
   actors are identified as either sellers or buyers. In switch-role
   markets, such as the stock exchange market or currency market, actors
   are not identified with one role. The other distinction is between
   standard and status markets. In a status market, order is maintained
   because the identities of actors on both sides of the market are ranked
   according to status, which is a more entrenched social construction than
   the commodity traded in the market. In a market characterized by
   standards, the situation is reversed: the commodity is a more entrenched
   social construction than the social status of actors in the market.
   These distinctions are the backdrop of my analysis of the idea that
   markets are performed. It is concluded that the performativity approach
   is useful today for analyzing switch-role markets. A further conclusion
   is that neoclassical economic theory can be used in understanding
   switch-role markets, but not fixed-role markets.

AB Objectives. We examined the relation between median housing value and
   hypertension risk among US Black women.
   Methods. We gathered data from the Black Women's Health Study, a
   prospective follow-up of 59000 Black women aged 21 to 69 years in 1995.
   Median housing value from US census data was used to measure
   neighborhood socioeconomic status. Cases of hypertension were identified
   through postal questionnaires mailed in 1997, 1999, and 2001. Clustered
   survival regression models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios.
   Results. During 180294 person-years of observation, 3780 cases of
   hypertension were reported. A significant inverse, graded association
   was found between median housing value and hypertension. The incidence
   rate ratio for women living in low median housing value neighborhoods
   relative to high was 1.29 (95% confidence interval = 1.14, 1.45) after
   adjustment for individual risk factors. The association was evident even
   at higher individual levels of income and education.
   Conclusions. Median housing value is inversely associated with
   hypertension in Black women, independent of individual risk factors.
   Lowering hypertension risk in Black women will require a greater
   understanding of the underlying social inequalities that adversely
   affect health.

AB Objective: To compare the early social-communicative development of
   younger siblings of children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) with
   that of younger siblings of children with typical development, using
   parental report and child-based measures.
   Design: Group comparison.
   Setting: Vanderbilt University, between July 1, 2003, and July 31, 2006.
   Participants: Younger siblings of children with ASD (n=64) and younger
   siblings of children with typical development (n=42) between the ages of
   12 and 23 months ( mean, 16 months).
   Main Exposure: Having a sibling with an ASD.
   Outcome Measures: Child-based measures included a cognitive assessment;
   an interactive screening tool assessing play, imitation, and
   communication; and a rating of autism symptoms. Parental report measures
   were an interview of social-communicative interactions and a
   questionnaire assessing language and communication skills.
   Results: Younger siblings of children with ASD demonstrated weaker
   performance in nonverbal problem solving (mean difference [MD], 5.91;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 2.48-9.34), directing attention (MD, 0.52;
   95% CI, 0.07-0.97), understanding words (MD, 33.30; 95% CI, 3.11-63.48),
   understanding phrases (MD, 4.56; 95% CI, 1.85-7.27), gesture use (MD,
   1.49; 95% CI, 0.51-2.47), and social-communicative interactions with
   parents (MD, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.27-2.37), and had increased autism symptoms
   (MD, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.05-4.03), relative to control siblings. A
   substantial minority of the ASD sibling group exhibited lower
   performance relative to controls. Significant correlations between
   child-based measures and parental reports assessing similar constructs
   were found (r=-0.74 to 0.53; P range,.000-.002).
   Conclusion: The weaker performance found for children in the ASD sibling
   group may represent early-emerging features of the broader autism
   phenotype, thus highlighting the importance of developmental
   surveillance for younger siblings.

AB in an effort to prioritize conservation efforts, scientists have
   developed the concept of biodiversity hotspots. Since most hotspots
   occur in countries where poverty is widespread, the success of
   conservation efforts depends upon the recognition that poverty can be a
   significant constraint on conservation, and at the same time
   conservation is an important component to the alleviation of long-term
   poverty. In this paper we present five key socioeconomic poverty
   indicators (access to water, undernourishment, potential population
   pressure, number living below poverty line and debt service) and
   integrate them with an ecologically based hotspots analysis in order to
   illustrate magnitude of the overlap between biological conservation and
   poverty. The analysis here suggests that the overlap between severe,
   multifaceted poverty and key areas of global biodiversity is great and
   needs to be acknowledged. Understanding the magnitude of overlap and
   interactions among poverty, conservation and macroeconomic processes is
   crucial for identifying illusive, yet possible, win-win solutions. (c)

   suggests that the potential risks of going public with feminist
   sociological research are more pervasive and serious than proponents of
   public sociologies have previously acknowledged. At the same time, the
   promise of public sociologies for furthering feminist goals has been
   largely untapped. Here, the authors recount their own experience with
   widely publicized research that, while neither unique nor typical,
   serves to highlight potential risks of making feminist sociological
   research public. Feminist scholars must be made aware of these risks as
   feminist research, which challenges existing gender inequalities and
   arrangements, is especially likely to encounter negative public
   reaction. The authors recommend collective and conscientious attention
   to both the medium and the message. The perspective on public
   sociologies presented here can help further the goals of public
   sociology and holds special promise for feminist sociologists who seek
   effective ways to promote social change.

AB BACKGROUND: Homeless persons face many barriers to health care, have few
   resources, and experience high death rates. They live lives of
   disenfranchisement and neglect. Few studies have explored their
   experiences and attitudes toward death and dying. Unfortunately, studies
   done in other populations may not apply to homeless persons. Exploring
   these experiences and attitudes may provide insight into life, health
   care, and end-of-life (EOL) concerns of this population.
   OBJECTIVE: To explore the experiences and attitudes toward death and
   dying among homeless persons.
   DESIGN: Qualitative study utilizing focus groups.
   PARTICIPATIONS: Fifty-three homeless persons recruited from homeless
   service agencies.
   MEASUREMENTS: In-depth interviews, which were audiotaped and
   transcribed.
   RESULTS: We present seven themes, some of which are previously
   unreported. Homeless persons described many significant experiences with
   death and dying, and many participants suffered losses while very young.
   These encounters influenced participants' attitudes toward risks and
   risky behavior: e.g., for some, these experiences provided justification
   for high-risk behaviors and influenced their behaviors while living on
   the streets. For others, they may be associated with their homelessness.
   Finally, these experiences informed their attitudes toward death and
   dying as well as EOL care; homeless persons believe that care will be
   poor at the EOL.
   CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study have implications for addressing
   social services, health promotion, prevention, and EOL care for homeless
   persons, as well as for others who are poor and disenfranchised.

AB BACKGROUND: There is little understanding about the experiences and
   preferences at the end of life (EOL) for people from unique cultural and
   socioeconomic backgrounds. Homeless individuals are extreme examples of
   these overlooked populations; they have the greatest risk of death,
   encounter barriers to health care, and lack the resources and
   relationships assumed necessary for appropriate EOL care. Exploring
   their desires and concerns will provide insight for the care of this
   vulnerable and disenfranchised population, as well as others who are
   underserved.
   OBJECTIVE: Explore the concerns and desires for EOL care among homeless
   persons.
   DESIGN: Qualitative study utilizing focus groups.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-three homeless persons recruited from agencies
   providing homeless services.
   MEASUREMENTS: In-depth interviews, which were audiotaped and
   transcribed.
   RESULTS: We present 3 domains encompassing 11 themes arising from our
   investigation, some of which are previously unreported. Homeless persons
   worried about dying and EOL care; had frequent encounters with death;
   voiced many unique fears, such as dying anonymously and undiscovered;
   favored EOL documentation, such as advance directives; and demonstrated
   ambivalence towards contacting family. They also spoke of barriers to
   EOL care and shared interventions to improve dying among the very poor
   and estranged.
   CONCLUSIONS: Homeless persons have significant personal experience and
   feelings about death, dying, and EOL care, much of which is different
   from those previously described in the EOL literature about other
   populations. These findings have implications not only for homeless
   persons, but for others who are poor and disenfranchised.

   majority (N=438) were female and single. More than 50% reported trying
   cigarettes in their lifetime and reported smoking a whole cigarette at
   age 15.5 years. Only 7.5% of the sample were lifetime smokers. The
   likelihood that a student would smoke was 15 times greater if their
   friends smoked and almost seven times greater if they were not members
   of a Greek organization compared to other students. Males associated
   smoking with self-confidence, endorsed the emotional benefits and

   should focus on preventing the initiation of smoking as well as
   cessation efforts for students at HBCUs Campus clubs and organizations
   can play a vital role in long-term changes in smoking behaviors for

PD APR 2007
PY 2007
AB This study examined whether the relationship between high poverty and
   infant mortality rates (IMRs) varied across race and ethnic-specific
   populations in large urban areas. Data were drawn from 1990 Census and
   1992-1994 Vital Statistics for selected U.S. metropolitan areas.
   High-poverty areas were defined as neighborhoods in which >= 40% of the
   families had incomes below the federal poverty threshold. Bivariate
   models showed that high poverty was a significant predictor of IMR for
   each group; however, multivariate analyses demonstrate that maternal
   health and regional factors explained most of the variance in the
   group-specific models of IMR. Additional analysis revealed that high
   poverty was significantly associated with minority-white IMR
   disparities, and country of origin is an important consideration for
   ethnic birth outcomes. Findings from this study provide a glimpse into

AB Objective. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been associated with smoking
   among adolescents, but it is not known which attributes of SES are
   responsible for the added risk, or whether these associations are
   consistent in ethnically diverse samples. Methods. This study
   investigated the associations between SES variables and smoking behavior
   among an ethnically diverse sample of 1847 8th grade adolescents in
   Southern California in 2002. Several aspects of SES were examined: an
   objective composite measure of family and neighborhood SES, the
   adolescent's spending money, and the adolescent's perception of SES
   (family's ability to afford basic necessities, wealth relative to
   others, and wealth relative to last year). Results. After controlling
   for demographic characteristics, smoking behavior of parents and
   friends, and parental monitoring, low scores on the objective SES index
   and large amounts of pocket money were associated with an increased risk
   of smoking. The subjective measures of perceived SES were not associated
   with smoking. Conclusions. Results indicate that increased smoking
   prevention efforts are needed in low-SES areas, and that limiting
   adolescents' pocket money may be an effective strategy for preventing
   smoking. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB This article discusses the role of 'artworks' produced by women with
   breast cancer in the context of breast cancer activism. We argue that
   such works play a key role in making visible and collective the
   ideological issues surrounding this disease. They do this through their
   potential for anchoring social practices relating to its treatment and
   what might be done about it (Klawiter 2004, Swidler 2001). The article
   focuses upon the work of two women artists diagnosed with breast cancer
   - the British photographer Jo Spence, and Martha Hall, an American who
   made artist's books. We examine specific works from these collections,
   and the context of their production. In this way we show how and why
   artworks are important in establishing visual and discursive space
   related to social practices associated with disease regimes, and how
   they provide emancipatory potential for women living with breast cancer.
   We argue that artworks work through and on bodies to enable a redemptive
   and emancipatory potential. As mediators of representations of illness,
   they deserve attention from sociologists researching social movements,
   the sharing of illness experience and strategies for survival.

   to others, those among related ideas or skills, to students' lives,
   across courses, and to the discipline. In addition, students were at
   different points on three overlapping pathways of learning: level of
   success in the major, use of surface-deep approaches, and degree of
   novice-expert learning. L also offer implications and suggestions for

AB This paper describes a service-learning project designed for an
   upper-level sociology course in Policy and Social Change. The project,
   Breaking Ground, had two main goals: to change students' perceptions
   about persons who are homeless and to increase students' sense of
   efficacy for engaging in social advocacy. Through Breaking Ground,
   students formed a partnership with advocates and homeless clients to
   raise public awareness about homelessness and to organize advocacy and
   fund-raising events for the agency partner. The research element of the
   project used pre-tests and post-tests to assess changes in students'
   beliefs about social justice, self-efficacy, and perceptions of
   homelessness. When compared to students who took the class, but did not
   participate in the described service-learning project, Breaking Ground
   students experienced significant changes in a positive direction in
   their perceptions of individuals who are homeless. There were also some
   small changes in student feelings of self-efficacy and opinions on
   social justice. I explain these results and provide suggestions for
   implementation of similar projects.

AB 'Good gene' mate selection theory proposes that all individuals share
   evolved mental mechanisms that identify specific parts of a woman's body
   as indicators of fertility and health. Depiction of feminine beauty,
   across time and culture, should therefore emphasize the physical traits
   indicative of health and fertility. Abdominal obesity, as measured by
   waist size, is reliably linked to decreased oestrogen, reduced fecundity
   and increased risk for major diseases. Systematic searches of British
   literature across the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
   reveal that a narrow waist is consistently described as beautiful. Works
   in ancient Indian and Chinese literature similarly associate feminine
   attractiveness with a narrow waist. Even without the benefit of modern
   medical knowledge, both British and Asian writers knew intuitively the
   biological link between health and beauty.

   water. Local perception of the irrigation project and decisions
   regarding water use also are examined. The irrigation projects have
   improved knowledge sharing of irrigation technology and helped to
   introduce the sharing of agricultural machinery. The projects also seem
   to have shifted the tribal hierarchy toward peer relationships. While
   positive changes are observed in irrigated villages, there remain
   socioeconomic problems that need to be addressed, such as water user

AB Objective. To determine the relative contributions of genetic, clinical,
   serologic, sociodemographic, and behavioral/ psychological variables to
   early pulmonary involvement in the Genetics versus Environment in
   Scleroderma Outcome Study cohort.
   Methods. At the baseline visit (V0), 203 patients with systemic
   sclerosis (SSc) were examined (104 whites, 39 African Americans, and 60
   Hispanics). We obtained sociodemographic, behavioral/psychological
   (illness behavior, social support, learned helplessness, smoking,
   drinking), clinical, serologic (autoantibodies), and genetic (HLA class
   II and FBN1 genotypes) factors; pulmonary function test results;
   electrocardiograms; and chest radiographs. Data analysis included
   Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, Student's t-test, analysis of
   variance, and stepwise linear and logistic regression methods.
   Results. Significant pulmonary involvement was seen in 25% of patients
   within 2.8 years of SSc diagnosis. At V0, pulmonary fibrosis was
   significantly higher in African Americans compared with whites or
   Hispanics. African Americans had significantly lower percent predicted
   forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second
   (FEV1) compared with whites and significantly lower percent predicted
   diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLco) compared with whites and
   Hispanics. Significant, independent associations impacting early
   pulmonary involvement included African American ethnicity, skin score,
   serum creatinine and creatine phosphokinase values, hypothyroidism, and
   cardiac involvement. Anticentromere antibody seropositivity was a
   significant, independent, protective factor for restrictive lung disease
   and FVC or DLco values. African Americans had significantly increased
   frequencies of antitopoisomerase I, fibrillarin, and RNP autoantibodies
   compared with whites. African Americans scored significantly lower on
   the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List and significantly higher on
   the Illness Behavior Questionnaire.
   Conclusion. Early pulmonary involvement in SSc appears to be influenced
   by several factors delineated by ethnicity, including racial,
   socioeconomic, behavioral, and serologic determinants.

AB On July 1, 1995 the state of New Mexico lifted its ban on Sunday
   packaged alcohol sales. Legislation lifting the ban included a local
   option allowing individual communities within the state to hold an
   election to reinstitute the ban on Sunday packaged alcohol sales.
   Previous research has shown a clear statewide increase in
   alcohol-related crash and crash fatality rates after the ban was lifted.
   The goal of this study is to measure county-level variability in changes
   in alcohol-related crash rates while adjusting for county
   socio-demographic characteristics, spatial patterns in crash rates and
   temporal trends in alcohol-related crash rates. Bayesian hierarchical
   binomial regression models were fit to the observed quarterly crash
   counts for all counties between July 1, 1990 and June 30, 2000. Results
   show marked variability in the impact of legalized Sunday packaged
   alcohol sales on alcohol-related crash rates. Relative risks of an
   alcohol-related crash for the post-repeal versus pre-repeal period vary
   across counties from 1.04 to 1.90. Counties with older population
   suffered a greater negative impact of legalized Sunday packaged alcohol
   sales. Counties with communities that quickly passed the local option to
   re-ban packaged sales on Sundays were able to mitigate most of the
   deleterious impact of increased alcohol availability that was observed
   across the state. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Multivariate logistic regression models were built with pedestrian

   more likely to be black, not married, unemployed, binge drinkers,

   Black race, unemployment of I year or more, never licensed, lapsed
   license, revoked license and BAC > 200 mg/dl showed statistical
   significance in the multiple logistic regression. Pedestrians represent
   a sub-population with a low socioeconomic status and high incidence of

AB A conventional assumption within sociology of markets is that social
   ties are crucial in economic life, but that too strong relationships
   between sellers and buyers can create role conflicts and restrict
   business. Using qualitative interviews with Norwegian exporters and
   Danish importers, this article examines transactions in the
   international fish trade. We find that the assumed episodic and highly
   competitive commodity trade is rooted in dyadic networks and personal
   trust; inspired by the work of Goffman, we analyse transaction patterns
   as 'interaction order'. The transaction pattern is dependent on a
   particular organization of social interaction, interaction in which
   business dealings are divided into delimited spheres of the 'formal',
   'personal' and 'private'. This division reflects a differentiation of
   the social roles, one in which traders avoid the role conflicts inherent
   in close relationships. We conclude by stating that economic sociology
   should probably be less preoccupied with formal network configurations
   and instead be focused more on how actors actually use social ties in
   the marketplace to conduct business, and on how these ties are linked to
   price mechanisms.

AB When it comes to issues of equality and redistribution, sociologists are
   particularly prone to think in anti-cultural terms. External, objective,
   and material forces are conceived as determining unequal distributions
   without reference to the wills of actors via hegemony, domination,
   subordination. But if inequality is imposed by material and coercive
   force, then it can be remedied only by accumulating power and
   counterforce, and by exercising them in an instrumental and potentially
   coercive way. What is missing from this account is meaning, the
   recognition of its relative autonomy. The imposition of inequality, and
   struggles over justice, inclusion, and distribution, are mediated by
   cultural structures. Inequalities are nested inside the discourse of
   civil society, and so are demands for equality. Vis-a-vis the binary
   codes of civil society, protest movements pollute hegemonic forces and
   purify subordinate groups in its name.

AB This article looks at the value of genealogical analysis for doing

   of genealogy. The point is to resuscitate a method that has often been
   rejected by sociologists, and demonstrate its value for analyzing forms
   of culture that have become tacit or unarticulated over time. To make
   the case for the method, the article follows a historical example: the
   use of indigenous hydraulics with Roman provenance on the Canal du Midi
   in 17th-century France. Women labourers brought hydraulics techniques
   derived from Roman principles to the canal, but their work was not
   considered classical. Ironically, the Canal du Midi was promoted in
   propaganda campaigns, defining France as the New Rome, but the peasant
   women who actually carried Roman culture in their eyes and hands were
   not socially elevated enough to be New Romans, so they were written out

   diseases by person, place, and time to identify risk factors for
   disease. The field has grown to include many subfields recognizing the
   contributions of multiple factors to disease susceptibility.
   Recent findings This review will focus on articles published October
   2005 November 2006 relevant to genetic epidemiology,
   pharmacoepidemiology, and social determinants of health and health
   disparities.
   Summary Genetic epidemiology is the study of genetic contributions to
   disease occurrence, and of population-based genetic risks for disease.
   Genetics influences not only susceptibility to disease, but also the
   phenotype and severity of disease. Pharmacoepidemiology examines the
   outcomes of medication use, including clinical benefits and adverse
   effects. Gene-environment interactions are also included in this area.
   Typical topics in pharmacoepidemiology include studies of medication
   use, risks, benefits and genetic factors influencing the metabolism of
   medications. Social epidemiology is the study of social determinants of
   health, including psychosocial behaviors, socioeconomic status,
   interactions of individuals, the collective health of the community in
   which a person lives, and the position of the individual within society.
   Social epidemiology is directly relevant to studies of socioeconomic and
   ethnic disparities.

   highlighting the current problems with the field. There are, however,
   few solutions put forth. Revisiting the pragmatist roots in social

   field as well as the seeming stagnation in theory and research. The
   utility of pragmatism in studying deviance is discussed and specific
   applications of pragmatism to the sociology of deviance are suggested.

EP 337
PD SPR 2007
PY 2007
AB Purpose: To describe surface and deep structure dimensions of a
   culturally sensitive smoking cessation intervention developed with
   southeastern US public housing neighborhoods.
   Procedures: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods were
   used to develop this culturally sensitive smoking cessation intervention
   by the following research partners: academicians, neighborhood
   residents, community health workers, and community advisory board. This
   CBPR involved a cyclical process with the following phases: assembling a
   research team; identifying smoking cessation as the health need of
   interest; developing the research method; establishing evaluation,
   feedback, and dissemination mechanisms; implementing the initial "Sister
   to Sister" community trial; analyzing and interpreting the data;
   disseminating the results; revising the intervention; and, establishing
   mechanisms to sustain outcomes. Culturally sensitive dimensions emerged
   during this process and were categorized as surface structure and deep
   structure.
   Findings: Surface structure dimensions included written materials,
   incentives and food, and protocol delivery strategies. Deep structure
   dimensions included kinships, collectivism, storytelling, and spiritual
   expressions. Community health workers and the advisory board contributed
   to the identification and integration of both surface and deep structure
   dimensions. The six-month continuous smoking abstinence outcomes from
   the initial community trial were 27.5% vs 5.77% for the intervention and
   comparison groups, respectively.
   Conclusions: Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods
   facilitate processes in which culturally sensitive dimensions can be
   effectively identified and integrated into health promotion
   interventions for marginalized populations. The incorporation of surface
   structure dimensions increases acceptance and feasibility, while deep
   structure improves overall impact and efficacy of the intervention.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine relationships
   between acculturation, body mass index (BMI), and depressive symptoms
   with the Interleukin 1-mediated inflammatory response marker IL-1RA in
   pregnant Hispanic women at 22-24 weeks gestation.
   Design: An observational, prospective design with data collected at
   22-24 weeks gestation.
   Setting: Public prenatal health clinics and private physician practices
   in central and south Texas serving low-income women.
   Main Outcome Measures: Body mass index (BMI), depression scores on the
   Center for Epidemiological Studies of Depression (CES-D), years in the
   United States, the Language Proficiency Scale (LPS), and Interleukin 1
   receptor antagonist levels (IL-1 RA)
   Results: The longer the Hispanic women were in the United States, the
   higher the IL-1RA levels in plasma (F=4.55; P=.002). IL-1RA plasma
   levels were significantly different between low and normal BMI vs
   overweight and obese categories of BMI (F=8.54; P <.001). IL-1 RA levels
   were significantly higher between those women who had high scores for
   depressive symptoms on the CES-D (using a cut off of 20) and those who
   had scores less than 20 (t-value=-2.41; P=.018). In structural equation
   modeling, years in the United States significantly positively predicted
   increase depressive symptoms, increased BMI, and increased IL-1 RA
   levels with a good model fit.
   Conclusions: We found that increasing years of residency in the United
   States is associated with the elevated inflammatory marker IL-1 RA, and
   increased BMI. increased depressive symptoms also predict IL-IRA levels
   among Hispanic women at 22-24 weeks of pregnancy. The significance of
   these findings is discussed in relationship to the development and
   course of disease.

PD SPR 2007

AB Purpose: Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) use
   standardized patients (SPs) to teach and evaluate medical students '
   skills. Few studies describe using OSCEs for cultural competence
   education, now a Liaison Committee on Medical Education accreditation
   standard for medical schools. We designed an OSCE station emphasizing
   cross-cultural communication skills (ccOSCE) and interviewed students to
   better understand and improve upon this tool.
   Method: Two investigators conducted semi-structured interviews with 22
   second-year Harvard medical students who completed the ccOSCE. Three
   investigators coded and analyzed the interview transcripts by using
   qualitative methods to explore students ' perspectives on the station
   and its focus on cultural competence.
   Results: Themes that emerged pertinent to design and implementation of
   the station were grouped into four categories: learning goals,
   logistical issues, faculty feedback, and SPs. Students were positive
   about the overall experience. They appreciated the practical focus on
   nonadherence. Some found the learning goals complex, and others felt the
   format promoted stereotypes. Logistical issues included concerns about
   marginalizing cross-cultural care by creating a separate station.
   Faculty feedback was helpful when specific about sociocultural issues
   students did or did not explore well. Students found SPs realistic but
   inconsistent in how easily they revealed information.
   Conclusion: Designing a ccOSCE experience is challenging but feasible.
   Students ' perspectives highlight a tension between presenting cultural
   competence in a dedicated station (potentially marginalizing the topic
   and promoting stereotypes) and spreading it across stations (limiting
   opportunity for focused teaching). Learning goals should be clear,
   concise, and effectively communicated to faculty and SPs so their
   feedback can be standardized and specific.

PD SPR 2007
PY 2007
AB Objective: To conduct a review of published studies that have addressed
   the effectiveness of weight-loss interventions for Hispanic individuals
   in the United States, identify key components of effective interventions
   for this population, and provide a set of recommendations for the
   development of effective treatment programs.
   Data Source: Online bibliographic databases were searched from 1980 to
   September 2006.
   Study Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: Two key search dimensions ("Latino"
   or "Mexican-American" or "Hispanic" or "Spanish-speaker"; and
   "weight-loss" or "weight-reduction" or "obesity treatment" or "diet
   intervention") were used to search for articles.
   Data Extraction: The methods and findings of all retrieved articles were
   evaluated, and summary outcome data were taken from published results.
   Data Synthesis: The limited number of published articles found, and the
   lack of identifying information on key variables (eg, manner in which
   subjects were determined to be "Hispanic," level of acculturation,
   socioeconomic status [SES], number of years living in the United States,
   country of origin, etc) precluded conducting a formal meta-analysis on
   the available outcome data.
   Results: The review identified only three controlled intervention
   studies specifically targeting Hispanic populations for weight-loss;
   most of the available studies were not randomized and did not assess key
   variables, such as acculturation, type of community of origin, level of
   education, etc. Most available "culturally sensitive" health-related
   interventions targeting Hispanic populations do not specify what made
   the interventions "culturally sensitive" beyond the translation of the
   materials into Spanish.
   Conclusions: Traditional weight-loss interventions developed for use on
   Anglo-American subjects do not appear to have been effective for
   Hispanic individuals. There is an urgent need to both develop effective
   interventions and to improve the methodologic thoroughness in the
   design, implementation, and reporting of such interventions for this
   population.

AB The dopamine transporter gene (DAT1) codes for a dopamine transporter
   protein, which limits the level and duration of dopamine receptor
   activation. The DAT1 gene is a strong candidate gene for reward-seeking
   behavior. This article reports compelling evidence for the association
   between the 40 bp variable number of tandem repeats in the DAT1 gene and
   the self-reported number of sexual partners among young adults in the
   United States using the sibling subsample of more than 2500 individuals
   who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
   Health. We performed tests of genotype gender interaction as well as
   analyses stratified by gender. Among the males, possessing one or two
   alleles of the 10 repeat is associated with an 80-100% increase (P <
   0.0001, 2df) in the number of sexual partners as compared with the
   homozygotes for the 9 repeat. The association holds in
   race/ethnicity-stratified analyses, in Allison's procedure that tests
   population stratification, and in within-family fixed-effects models.
   Covariate adjustment for a standard set of socioeconomic factors
   including religiosity, family structure, parental education, marital and
   cohabitation history, and neighborhood poverty did not attenuate these
   associations. Discussion is provided why this finding is absent among
   females.

   teachers to draw connections and parallels between entertaining movie
   science and exciting real world science. This article illustrates how

   teach important ideas such as how genes control animal development and

   positive RS and negative RS scales were also evaluated. Method: Data
   were collected from a multiethnic subsample of early-starting antisocial
   (n = 20) and successful (n = 20) urban adolescents and their families,
   using direct observations of parent-adolescent interactions, 5-minute
   speech samples, and questionnaires. Results: The negative RS and
   positive RS scales were internally consistent, correlated reliably with
   critical and positive dimensions of 5-minute speech samples expressed
   emotion and with observed parent-adolescent interactions, and
   discriminated between antisocial and successful adolescents. Negative RS
   accounted for unique variance in adolescent antisocial behavior when
   controlling for previous problem behavior and observed coercion. A
   significant interaction was also found between negative RS and observed
   parent-adolescent dynamics when escalations in adolescent problem
   behavior were added to the model. Conclusions: RS narratives provided
   unique information in the prediction of adolescent antisocial behavior.
   FSs should be considered in the assessment of family dynamics and the

AB A wealth of research suggests a direct association between minority
   group size and government social control, such as arrest or imprisonment
   rates. Prior work in this vein, however, gives scant attention to (1)
   types of law that explicitly address intergroup conflict and (2)
   regional variation in the salience of minority group threat. At the same
   time, research on organizational responses to law indicates that
   institutional linkages to legal environments dictate policy innovation
   and compliance, yet the relevance of such linkages for law enforcement
   agencies is less clear. The present research investigates these themes
   by focusing on law enforcement responses to hate crime in the United
   States. Data from a sample of large municipal and county policing
   agencies and their degree of compliance with the federal Hate Crimes
   Statistics Act are analyzed. Main effects models show that compliance
   with federal hate crime law is less likely in places with larger black
   populations, an intriguing finding in light of extant work suggesting
   that both formal social control and race-based hate crime offending are
   typically more prevalent where more blacks reside. This effect of black
   population size on compliance with hate crime law, however, is
   contingent on region. A positive correlation in the Northeast contrasts
   with an inverse association in the South. The findings also suggest that
   organizational facets of law enforcement agencies, notably their
   engagement in community policing, are associated with compliance. The
   results elaborate and qualify group threat explanations of government
   social control and contribute to a burgeoning literature on the utility
   of organizational theory in the realm of law enforcement.

AB Rural sociologists figure prominently in the move towards public
   sociology. The paper takes up Michael Burawoy's call for public
   sociology and discusses what rural sociologists have to offer to publics
   and how we stand to gain as a discipline in working with publics. The
   paper argues that rural sociologists' ability to adopt a cosmopolitan
   view while negotiating the complexities of global/local processes
   provides a useful theoretical stance for doing public sociology.
   Methodologically, both feminist methods and various approaches to
   networks can guide us as we do public sociology. Then, the paper
   provides two examples of recent efforts to do public sociology with a
   women's community group in Sri Lanka in response to the tsunami and with
   the Pennsylvania Women's Agricultural Network to illustrate the
   possibilities and limitations of working with networks. In conclusion,
   the paper addresses opportunities for doing public sociology, the
   challenges we face as we go public, and future work that is needed to
   develop theoretically and methodologically strong public rural
   sociology.

AB What is the relationship between the official teachings of religious
   bodies and the beliefs of individual adherents in the United States
   today? At first glance, this question appears rather straightforward.
   One simply needs to identify religious bodies, specify their teachings
   and empirically establish the connection between those teachings and
   adherents' beliefs. But establishing ally of these elements is anything
   but simple. To begin to untangle this knotty subject, the author first
   uses a restrictive definition of religious bodies, teachings, and
   beliefs, focusing on the core doctrinal teachings of clearly
   identifiable religious denominations. He then steps back and takes a
   broader view of the situation using a less restrictive definition,
   exploring the influence of affiliation with religious "families" on
   individuals' moral beliefs. The author concludes with some thoughts
   about how both religion and the sociology of religion in America are
   moving beyond beliefs.

AB This research examines the individual-level and contextual correlates of
   punitive attitudes in the United States. Prior research suggests that
   the demographic composition and economic conditions of geographic areas
   influence public support for punitive policies. Yet, these findings rest
   on assumptions about individual perceptions of minority groups as
   threatening. This work builds on the threat framework by measuring the
   concept of "perceived threat" and examining the association between
   aggregate social conditions, perceived threat and punitive sentiments.
   Analysis of newly collected data suggests that individual perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to economic resources is a strong
   predictor of punitive attitudes. In addition, respondents residing in
   areas with higher unemployment rates and places that experienced a
   recent increase in the size of the African American population are more
   punitive. The latter effect is largely mediated by perceptions of
   African Americans as threatening to material resources for white
   respondents. The results agree with racial threat perspectives on social
   control, but we go beyond extant research by unpacking the micro-level
   processes that are central to the threat hypothesis.

AB The purpose of this paper is to identify and explain a rather large
   impediment to the use of mixed method research designs that begin with
   survey data. Although supplementing quantitative survey analyses with
   insights derived from qualitative work is increasingly popular, there is
   also heightened concern about ethical issues in research, particularly
   the confidentiality of human research subjects. Surprisingly, there has
   been little discussion about how these two trends intersect, and the
   extent to which they are compatible. In this paper I argue that because
   of the important obligation to protect human research subjects'
   identities (and, to a lesser extent, the proliferation of publicly
   available datasets), few researchers are actually in a position to
   implement this type of mixed methodology. Despite their noted advantages
   over mono-method designs, mixed method designs that start with
   quantitative data and subsequently supplement it with qualitative
   insights may not achieve the dominance that many have supposed and
   desired. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Critical literacy is akin to a sociological imagination as it involves
   the ability to distinguish between private troubles and public issues
   and the competency to use such distinctions to facilitate and engage in
   social change. This article is a case study of low-income rural Whites'
   personal interpretations of health and income inequalities with a
   concern for understanding the potential effectiveness of a community
   action program (CAP) designed to enhance their critical literacy.
   Findings reveal that low-income rural Whites predominantly use
   ideologies of individualism to interpret the inequalities experienced by
   others, they employ a pseudostructural level analysis tempered by
   individualism to interpret their experience of health and income
   inequalities, and they respond collectively along racial and national
   lines when considering overall inequalities. Based on these findings, I
   provide suggestions on how CAPs can more effectively elevate the
   critical literacy of low-income rural Whites.

AB This paper is an exercise in the applied sociology of religion. And yet
   it is not quite what the phrase implies. It does not offer advice to
   help religious organizations increase their members or fine-tune their
   services, nor is it quite in the spirit of Kemal Attaturk's reliance on
   Emile Durkheim's work in secularizing his nation and pushing through
   some of the most thorough and most enduring cultural changes of any
   country in the 20th century. In fact, the one similarity between
   Attaturk and the case at issue here is that both involve turkeys. With
   all due respect to our nation's leader, what follows includes an array
   of such jibes but there is no humor in its conclusions. As a
   hypothetical letter of response to a hypothetical request, it falls into
   the literary category of a conceit, and it illustrates how even
   sophomoric attempts at humor can be a palliative for despair. Apologies
   are certainly in order to those it may offend. The paper reviews both
   domestic and foreign religious issues implicated during President George
   W. Bush's administration. Domestically, these range across his public
   pronouncements on issues such as gay marriage, stem-cell research, and
   intelligent design, his faith-based initiatives, and the religious
   strategy behind his two Presidential campaigns. In foreign affairs, they
   include his wars on terrorism, Iraq, and Islam, as well as his policies
   concerning Israel.

AB Globalizing processes have rendered as analytically insufficient
   accounts of authority in the Muslim world that rely exclusively on the
   interaction between text, discursive method and personified knowledge.
   The construction and negotiation of globalized authority in Islam, it is
   argued, can only be understood by reference to a set of pluralizing
   processes that intensify and in some instances radicalize a tendency
   towards authoritative pluralism that has long been present in Islam.
   This can be understood in terms of (1) functionalization, or changes in
   terms of how individual Muslims understand the social purpose and ends
   of knowledge seeking; (2) respatialization; and (3) mediatization or
   interrelated changes in terms of how far away and in what kinds of
   spaces and media one seeks authority or authorization. Collectively,
   such pluralizing processes combine to construct global Islamic authority
   in diverse forms that transcend or challenge conventional understandings
   of religious knowledge, its location and mode of articulation. Reference
   is made throughout to illustrative ethnographic examples, social
   movements and practices.

AB Background: Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in the
   United States, but the rate of screening remains low. Since 2001,
   Medicare has provided coverage of colonoscopy for colorectal cancer
   screening in individuals at average risk, but little is known about the
   effect of this coverage on screening or disparities in screening
   practices.
   Methods: We examined the Medicare physician/supplier billing claims file
   for New York, Florida, and Illinois for the years 2002 and 2003. Using a
   previously employed algorithm, we identified the rates of colorectal
   screening tests in individuals at average risk. We performed
   multivariate logistic regression analysis to calculate the effects of
   sex, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic characteristics on screening. We
   also looked for interactions between socioeconomic and demographic
   variables.
   Results: A total of 596 470 Medicare beneficiaries were included in the
   study. Approximately 18.3% of the population had undergone a screening
   colon test during the study period. Nonwhite persons were less likely to
   be screened for colorectal cancer than were white persons (relative risk
   [RR], 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50-0.53). The lowest RR of
   screening colonoscopy in women compared with men was in the oldest age
   group and the highest income tertile (RR for whites, 0.64; 95% CI,
   0.59-0.70). Higher income level was associated with screening
   colonoscopy in white patients (men: RR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.25; women:
   RR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.05-1.15) but not in nonwhite patients (men: RR,
   0.97; 95% CI, 0.78-1.22; women: RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.78-1.14).
   Conclusion: Despite the expansion of Medicare coverage for colorectal
   cancer screening, there still remain significant disparities between sex
   and racial/ethnic groups in screening practices.

AB Background. Patients of low socioeconomic status (SES) have higher
   mortality after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Little is known about
   the underlying mechanisms or the relationship between SES and
   rehospitalization after AM].
   Methods We analyzed data from the PREMIER observational study, which
   included 2142 patients hospitalized with AMI from 18 US hospitals.
   Socioeconomic status was measured by self-reported household income and
   education level. Sequential multivariable modeling assessed the
   relationship of socioeconomic factors with 1-year all-cause mortality
   and all-cause rehospitalization after adjustment for demographics,
   clinical factors, and quality-of-care measures.
   Results Both household income and education level were associated with
   higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio 2.80, 95% CI 1.37-5.72, lowest to
   highest income group) and rehospitalization after AMI (hazard ratio
   1.55, 95% CI 1.17-2.05). Patients with low SES had worse clinical status
   at admission and received poorer quality of care. V multivariable
   modeling, the relationship between household income and mortality was
   attenuated by adjustment for demographic and clinical factors (hazard
   ratio 1.19, 95% CI 0.54-2.62), with a further small decrement in the
   hazard ratio after adjustment for quality of care. The relationship
   between income and rehospitalization was only partly attenuated by
   demographic and clinical factors (hazard ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.01-1.89)
   and was not influenced by adjustment for quality of care.
   Conclusions Patients' baseline clinical status largely explained the
   relationship between SES and mortality, but not rehospitalization, among
   patients with AMI.

AB Background: Faith-based interventions using a community-based
   participatory approach hold promise for eliminating ethnic health
   disparities. This study evaluated the effects of a volunteer-led
   statewide program to increase physical activity among members of
   African-American churches.
   Methods: African Methodist Episcopal churches within six regions
   (Conferences) were randomly assigned to receive training in the program
   immediately or 1 year later. A cohort of 20 randomly selected churches
   and 571 members within them took part in telephone surveys at baseline
   (May-September 2003) and 1 year (May August 2004) and 2 years later
   (June-September 2005). Primary outcomes were physical activity
   participation, meeting physical activity recommendations, and stage of
   readiness for physical activity change. Statistical analyses were
   completed in April 2006.
   Results: Volunteers (N = 889) from 303 churches were trained. Among
   survey respondents, physical activity did not increase significantly
   over time, although 67% were aware of the program. Program awareness was
   significantly related to all three physical activity outcomes and to
   fruit and vegetable consumption. Pastoral support was significantly
   associated with physical activity.
   Conclusions: Although this intervention reached a large number of
   churches and created awareness of intervention components, no effects on
   physical activity behaviors were found. Potential reasons for the lack
   of significant effects are discussed.

AB Objectives. We investigated preventive health behaviors (bicycle helmet,
   seat belt, and sunscreen use), physical activity, television viewing or
   video game playing, and nutrition (fruit, vegetable, milk, and soda
   consumption) among Asian and Latino adolescents living in the United
   States; assessed trends across generations (first-, second-, and
   third-generation immigrants or later); and compared each generation with
   White adolescents.
   Methods. We used data from 5801 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years in the
   representative 2001 California Health Interview Survey.
   Results. In multivariate analysis, first-generation Asians measured
   worse than Whites for preventive health behaviors (lower participation),
   physical activity (less activity), and television viewing or video game
   playing (more hours), but improved across generations. For these same
   behaviors, Latinos were similar to or worse than Whites, and generally
   showed no improvement across generations. First-generation Asians and
   Latinos had healthier diets than. Whites (higher fruit and vegetable
   consumption, lower soda consumption). With succeeding generations,
   Asians' fruit, vegetable, and soda consumption remained stable, but
   Latinos' fruit and vegetable consumption decreased and their soda
   consumption increased, so that by the third generation Latinos'
   nutrition was poorer than Whites'.
   Conclusions. For the health behaviors we examined, Asian adolescents'
   health behaviors either improved with each generation or remained better
   than that of Whites. Latino adolescents demonstrated generally worse
   preventive health behaviors than did Whites and, in the case of
   nutrition, a worsening across generations. Targeted interventions may be
   needed to address behavioral disparities.

AB PURPOSE: Past research suggests that Americans arm themselves when they
   do not trust one another. We reexamine the relationship between social
   trust and firearm prevalence with improved data and methods. We also
   control for conditions, including area homicide rates, that other
   research showed to be related to both social trust and firearm
   prevalence.
   METHODS: We use structural equation models to assess reciprocal effects
   of social trust, firearm prevalence, and homicide rates for a nationally
   representative sample of counties and county clusters (n = 99).
   RESULTS: We found no direct relationship between social trust and
   firearm prevalence. Social trust is related to firearm prevalence
   indirectly through its influence on homicide rates. Areas with low
   levels of social trust have high homicide rates, which, in turn,
   increase firearm prevalence.
   CONCLUSIONS: Americans arm themselves in response to high levels of
   firearm violence. Because greater social trust is related to lower
   homicide rates, public health researchers should be concerned with the
   community conditions that promote social trust.

   Exposure to racism may influence the way people view their ongoing

   burden. A multiethnic sample of 113 adults completed a diary page every
   30 min for one day. The diary inquired about moods and perceptions of

   mixed models regression analyses indicated that baseline measures of
   ethnic discrimination (assessed with the Perceived Ethnic Discrimination

   years old, were obtained from NHANES I (1972), III (1991), and
   1999-2002. Differences in the edentulism prevalence between high and low
   socio-economic positions (SEP) were compared. Differences in edentulism
   prevalence remained stable over approximately three decades (p = 0.480),
   being 10.6 percentage points in 1972, 12.1 percentage points in 1991,
   and 11.3 percentage points in 2001. Exploratory subgroup analyses
   suggested that disparities decreased for those individuals reporting a
   dental visit in the prior year and those reporting never having smoked.
   In conclusion, the absolute prevalence difference in edentulism between
   low and high socio-economic positions has remained unchanged over the

AB Objectives: Previous studies have demonstrated that informed healthcare
   providers could increase patient willingness to donate. We assessed
   medical students' knowledge and attitudes to determine their
   preparedness to encourage organ donation.
   Methods: 500 first- and second-year students attending one of three Ohio
   medical schools completed the 41-item questionnaire (93% cooperation
   rate). The questions evaluated students' donation knowledge, training,
   exposure and perceived barriers as well as their willingness to donate.
   Results: On univariate analysis, Asians (OR: 0.5, 95% Cl: 0.2-0.9) and
   blacks (OR: 0.1, 95% Cl: 0.1-0.2) were less willing than whites to
   donate. On multivariate analysis, race was no longer significantly
   associated with Willingness to donate. Three factors were associated
   with a decreased donation willingness: wanting burial with organs intact
   (OR: 0.1, 95% Cl: 0.1-0.2), having personal conflicts with donation (OR:
   0.2, 95% Cl: 0.1-0.6), and concern that carrying a donor card will lead
   to insufficient medical care (OR: 0.2,95% Cl: 0.1-0.4). Of note,
   knowledge was not associated with willingness to donate.
   Conclusion: In this medical student cohort, minorities were less willing
   to donate. Three factors were associated with a decreased willingness to
   donate regardless of student race: Addressing these barriers may
   increase student donation willingness, and physicians should encourage
   donation discussions with their patients.

AB OBJECTIVES. This study tests a model of intergenerational influences on
   childhood self-esteem that proposes paths from grandmothers' drug
   problems to grandchildren's self-esteem via parents' drug problems and
   parental adaptive child rearing and from grandmothers' maternal
   acceptance to grandchildren's self-esteem via parents' unconventionality
   and adaptive child rearing.
   METHODS. This longitudinal study uses data obtained from interviews with
   a New York City sample of black and Puerto Rican children (N = 149) and
   1 of their parents and from mailed questionnaires or comparable
   interviews with those parents' mothers. Structural equation modeling was
   used to test the proposed model.
   RESULTS. The LISREL analysis found that, with 3 exceptions, all of the
   hypothesized paths were significant. The total effects analysis
   indicated that parents' adaptive child rearing was the strongest latent
   construct, a finding that was consistent with this construct's proximal
   position in the model.
   CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that mothers' drug problems are not
   just near-term risks for their children, but also pose long-term risks
   for their children's future functioning as parents and thereby for their
   grandchildren. The relative strength of parents' adaptive child rearing
   in this intergenerational model indicates that this area should be the
   focus of therapeutic intervention efforts, but addressing future
   grandmothers' drug problems may have positive effects on multiple
   generations.

AB Objective. Our goals were to estimate the prevalence of reported violent
   disagreements in the homes of US children and to assess prevalence
   differences by race/ethnicity, residence, and reported parenting stress.
   Patients and methods. Data were drawn from the 2003 National Survey of
   Children's Health. Case subjects with unknown gender, race/ ethnicity,
   or residence were excluded, yielding 99 660 observations. Disagreements
   were classified on the basis of how the family deals with serious
   disagreement. If disagreements involved hitting or throwing, even
   rarely, the household was categorized as having violent disagreements.
   Households reporting heated argument and shouting were classified as
   having heated disagreement.
   Results. Nationally, 10.3% of children lived in homes with reported
   violent disagreements. Violent disagreements were most prevalent among
   black households (15.1%), followed by "other" (12.1%), Hispanic (11.3%),
   and white (8.6%) households. Urban areas had higher prevalence (10.7%)
   than did small through large rural counties (8.3%-9.9%). In multinomial
   logistic analysis, parents living in rural counties were less likely to
   report violent disagreements compared with those in urban. Black
   children were more likely to be exposed to both violent and heated
   disagreements than were white children. Parents reporting high parenting
   stress had higher odds of violent and heated disagreement than parents
   reporting less stress.
   Conclusions. A substantial number of children are exposed to violent
   disagreement. Although demographic and cultural factors may also
   influence disagreement style, parental stress seems instrumental in the
   development of violent disagreements. Parents who experience difficulty
   with parenting constitute a high-risk population. Helping parents
   understand and address child behavior may reduce such stress.

   suggest four possible relationships between the amount of scholarly
   production and the degree of consensus. These relationships are tested
   with data on the content of 50 sub-debates in the field of bioethics
   from 1973 to 1995. I find support for the conclusion that increased
   consensus leads to increased scholarly production. I conclude by
   discussing the implications of these findings for the humanities in
   general and bioethics in particular. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Fiercely competing identity narratives provide the foundation for what
   often appear to be intractable ethnic conflicts. This article considers
   how an ethnically mixed group from the region of Istria, a site of
   violence between Italians and Slavs in the first half of the 1900s, has
   overcome persisting conflict through changes in their original identity
   narratives. I employ the network representation of life-stories to
   examine the relations among abstract elements located within the
   conceptual boundary between the narratives of Italian and Yugoslav
   Istrians who meet in New York. With their countervailing ties, boundary
   elements act as bridges to otherwise unconnected narratives. Their
   bridging ties transform the meaning of boundary elements, while their
   multiple ties to their original narratives open up opportunities for
   importing new meaning into existing narrative structures. (c) 2006

AB Objective: To determine if psychosocial status influences treatment
   satisfaction, a quality-of-care indicator, of patients who were
   hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods:
   Psychosocial variables (social support, dispositional optimism, and
   depression) were assessed in 1847 AMI patients who completed a 1-month
   assessment in Prospective Registry Evaluating Myocardial Infarction:
   Events and Recovery (PREMIER), a multicenter, prospective cohort study.
   Patients' treatment satisfaction was determined using the Treatment
   Satisfaction scale of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire. The association
   between psychosocial variables and treatment satisfaction-adjusted for
   site, sociodemographics, medical history, clinical presentation, and
   treatment procedures-was evaluated using a censored normal model.
   Results: Study participants were primarily white (77.6%) and male
   (68.8%), with a mean age of 60.6 +/- 12.7 (SD) years. Satisfaction with
   posthospitalization treatment following AMI increased as social support
   (Wald chi(2) = 35.02,p <.001) and dispositional optimism (beta = 1.42;
   95% CI 0.24, 2.60) increased. Participants with mild (-3.10, 95% CI
   -5.77, -0.44), moderate (-4.77, 95% Cl -8.16, -1.38), moderately severe
   (-8.49, 95% Cl -13.47, -3.52), and severe (- 11.65, 95% Cl - 18.77,
   -4.53) depression had significantly worse treatment satisfaction
   compared with the nondepressed participants. Conclusion: Assessing
   psychosocial variables, such as social support, dispositional optimism,
   and depression severity before hospital discharge, may indicate who is
   likely to be more satisfied with posthospitalization cardiac care I
   month following AMI. Without controlling for psychosocial status,
   treatment satisfaction may be a biased indicator of quality. Future
   studies should evaluate whether psychosocial intervention after AMI can
   improve satisfaction.

AB Theories of metropolitan development in the United States explain that
   higher status populations tend to occupy newer housing while lower
   status groups tend to be restricted to older housing. The housing system
   thus reflects the broader stratification structure and likely changes in
   response to important shifts like the steep rise of income inequality at
   the end of the twentieth century. Indeed, a striking trend of
   increasingly large houses with many amenities emerged in U.S.
   metropolitan areas during this period, indicating that new construction
   may have become ever more exclusive and targeted to the affluent as
   inequality rose. In this article, I investigate whether the stratifying
   impact of new house construction intensified along with growing
   inequality and changing house structures using a variety of U.S. Census
   Bureau sources, examining both trends in the income level of new house
   buyers and the relationship of housing growth to affluent residential
   segregation. I find striking evidence that new housing did become much
   more dominated by the affluent, and was increasingly stratifying and
   segregating at the end of the twentieth century. These changes may
   exacerbate inequality in the future through opportunity structures
   linked to place of residence, including access to education and the
   accumulation of housing equity.

AB R. W. Connell's path-breaking notion of multiple masculinities (Connell,
   1995) and hegemonic masculinity (Connell, 1987, 1995) have been taken up
   as central constructs in the sociology of gender. Although there has
   been a great deal of empirical research and theory published that has
   built upon and utilized Connell's concepts, an adequate
   conceptualization of hegemonic femininity and multiple femininities has
   not yet been developed. To redress this, the author presents a
   theoretical framework that builds upon the insights of Connell and
   others, offers a definition of hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic
   femininity that allows for multiple configurations within each, and that
   can be used empirically across settings and groups. The author also
   outlines how hegemonic masculinity and hegemonic femininity are
   implicated in and intersect with other systems of inequality such as
   class, race, and ethnicity.

AB This study assesses three explanations for cross-national differences in
   unionization: Western's (1997) institutional model, economic
   explanations based on the business cycle or globalization, and Hechter's
   (2004) solidaristic theory. This study features a multilevel analysis of
   employed workers with the late 1990s World Values surveys of 18 affluent
   democracies. The analyses generally support the institutional model.
   Left parties and ghent systems remain influential, though ghent is less
   robust. Neo-corporatism and wage coordination are insignificant whereas
   workplace access is the more salient indicator of centralization. Beyond
   Western's model, right cabinet significantly weakens unionization.
   Refuting economic explanations, inflation, unemployment, and economic
   growth, as well as international trade and investment, do not influence
   unionization. Consistent with Hechter's claims, the welfare state
   reduces unionization but, contradicting his claims, immigration does not
   undermine unions. Ultimately, this study supports a revised
   institutional model that supplements Western's model with right cabinet
   and the welfare state.

AB Behavioral studies show that women's stage of readiness to adopt
   mammography screening affects their screening rates and that beliefs
   about breast cancer and screening affect stages of screening. The
   purposes of this study were to determine, first, the relationship
   between particular health and cultural beliefs and stage of mammography
   screening adoption in urban African American women, and second, whether
   demographic and experiential characteristics differed by stage. Data
   were analyzed from 344 low-income African American women nonadherent to
   mammography screening who participated in a 21-month trial to increase
   screening. At baseline, these women were randomized into 1 of 3 groups:
   tailored interactive computer instruction, targeted video, or usual
   care. Participants were categorized by stage of mammography screening
   adoption at 6 months as precontemplators (not planning to have a
   mammogram), contemplators (planning to have a mammogram), or actors (had
   received a mammogram). Although demographic and experiential variables
   did not differentiate stages of screening adoption at 6 months
   postintervention, some health and cultural beliefs were significantly
   different among groups. Actors were more preventive-health-oriented than
   precontemplators and had fewer barriers to screening than did
   contemplators. Precontemplators had more barriers, less self-efficacy,
   and greater discomfort with the mammography screening environment than
   did contemplators or actors. These results will be useful, not to change
   cultural beliefs, but to guide the design of health education messages
   appropriate to an individual's culture and health belief system.

AB Many barriers, including being uninsured or having less than
   comprehensive health insurance coverage, reduce access to palliative and
   end-of-life care by inner city minorities. Medicaid or Medicare coverage
   alone can limit options for pain and symptom management, especially when
   late referrals make it more difficult to achieve symptom control.
   Patient affiliation with a religion could offset perceived difficulties
   with pain medication as well as negative pain and symptom attitudes.
   Data were analyzed from the most recent assessments of 146 African
   Americans and Latinos enrolled in an outpatient palliative care unit of
   an inner city hospital. Fifty-seven percent were receiving palliative
   care for cancer. Compared with other patients, patients with a religious
   affiliation did not differ regarding pain medication stress. Uninsured
   patients with a religious affiliation reported. More hopeful pain and
   symptom attitudes, while patients with a religious affiliation covered
   only by Medicaid reported less hopeful pain and symptom attitudes. More
   hopeful pain and symptom attitudes by religious-affiliated, uninsured
   patients may reveal adequate coping, yet also conceal problem domains.
   Conversely, less hopeful attitudes by religious-affiliated patients
   covered only by Medicaid serve as clues to coping difficulties and
   problem domains. Palliative care programs should carefully consider how
   to integrate religious support networks as pipelines for program
   referrals and potential partners for care.

   explore the combined, interactive effects of land use/land cover, human
   population demography, and stream habitat quality on an index of
   biological integrity (IBI) of fish communities. Applied to a
   substantially urbanized region in northeast OH, USA, the analysis
   demonstrated the interactive nature of urbanization effects. Urban land
   use and stream habitat quality were significant predictors of IBI, but
   were no better than and, in some cases, poorer predictors than other
   gradients and interactions among gradients. High integrity sites were
   characterized by low forest cover and high grassland cover at
   sub-catchment scale, but high forest cover within a 500 m radius local
   zone of the sample point, conditions often found in protected parklands
   in the region. The analysis also indicated that variability in stream
   habitat quality was unrelated to landscape or demographic features, a
   result we attribute to the interaction between the geological and
   urbanization histories of the region. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Background: Increasing the racial and ethnic diversity of the physician
   workforce is a national priority. However, insight into the professional
   experiences of minority physicians is limited. This knowledge is
   fundamental to developing effective strategies to recruit, retain, and
   support a diverse physician workforce.
   Objective: To characterize how physicians of African descent experience
   race in the workplace.
   Design: Qualitative study based on in-person and in-depth racially
   concordant interviews using a standard discussion guide.
   Setting: The 6 New England states in the United States.
   Participants: 25 practicing physicians of African descent representing a
   diverse range of primary practice settings, specialties, and ages.
   Measurements: Professional experiences of physicians of African descent.
   Results: 1) Awareness of race permeates the experience of physicians of
   African descent in the health care workplace; 2) race-related
   experiences shape interpersonal interactions and define the
   institutional climate; 3) responses to perceived racism at work vary
   along a spectrum from minimization to confrontation; 4) the health care
   workplace is often silent on issues of race; and 5) collective
   race-related experiences can result in "racial fatigue," with personal
   and professional consequences for physicians.
   Limitations: The study was restricted to New England and may not reflect
   the experiences of physicians in other geographic regions. The findings
   are meant to be hypothesis-generating and require additional follow-up
   studies.
   Conclusions: The issue of race remains a pervasive influence in the work
   lives of physicians of African descent. Without sufficient attention to
   the specific ways in which race shapes physicians' work experiences,
   health care organizations are unlikely to create environments that
   successfully foster and sustain a diverse physician workforce.

   conducted in 1995 and 2000. The analyses include 406 White, 232 Black,
   and 387 Hispanic couples interviewed in 2000. Male-to-female sexual
   aggression rates ranged from 11% to 23 % and female-to-male aggression
   rates ranged from 5.5% to 13.5%. Insisting on having sex without use of
   physical force and having sex without a condom are the two most
   frequently reported types of sexual aggression across all ethnic groups.
   Male and female perpetrated sexual aggression rates among Black couples
   were over 2 times the rate of White couples. Male perpetrated severe
   psychological aggression is a significant predictor of male sexual
   aggression. Female perpetrated severe psychological aggression predicted
   female sexual aggression. The study findings underscore the importance
   of addressing alcohol use and the presence of psychological abuse in the
   light of preventing other forms of violence including sexual aggression
   among couples.

   variables and substance use on aggressive crime in a large national
   sample of male arrestees ( N 20,602) drawn from 24 U. S. urban areas.
   The findings support our hypothesis that individual social attachments
   to marriage and the labor force ( education and employment) are the
   principal individual- level pathway mediating the substance abuse=
   aggression nexus. In the random intercept model, 3.17% of the variation
   not explained by the individuallevel predictor variables is attributable
   to community- level variation in urban area female- headed households
   and households receiving welfare. This confirms our hypothesis that
   social structural conditions of an urban environment differentially
   expose persons to conditions that predict being arrested for an
   aggressive crime. Our findings tend to counter the cultural theorists
   who argue for an indigenous culture of violence in inner- city ghettos

AB The Samnites are an Iron Age protohistoric people from the central

   6th through 5th centuries B.C. Macchiarelli et al. (Antropologia
   Contemporanea 4 (1981) 239-243) were the first to report on cranial
   trauma for this population, presenting four cases with extreme injuries.
   We re-examined this well documented skeletal population for additional
   examples of trauma. Previously unexamined remains from Alfedena,
   excavated at the turn of the 20th century, are also included in our
   analysis (Mariani. 1901. "Aufidena", ricerche archeologiche a storiche
   del Sannio settentrionale. Roma: Acc Naz Dei Lincei). Of the 209 adult
   crania examined, 12.9% of them exhibited trauma. Analysis of location
   and frequency of cranial trauma revealed that cranial injuries to the
   head appear to originate from all directions. The high rate of cranial
   trauma underscores the violent circumstances experienced during the Iron
   Age protohistoric period of central Italy. Males are much more likely to
   exhibit cranial injury than females (P = 0.009). We conclude that the
   injuries received by Samnite male farmer-warriors occurred while
   defending pastoral-agricultural resources. Trauma rates are similar for
   some Iron Age populations and not for others. Behavior associated with
   violence during the Iron Age period can not be generalized for all
   populations found in Italy.

AB The Zapatistas and Sandinistas both invoked historical figures in their
   rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is
   explained by a model of path-dependent memory work that is sensitive to
   how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of
   historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct
   reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of
   different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational
   trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic
   possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing
   contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the
   opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories
   condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the
   collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics
   literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take
   seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.

AB Background: Social relationships are reliably related to rates of
   morbidity and mortality. One pathway by which social relationships may
   influence health is via the impact of relationship quality on
   cardiovascular reactivity during social interactions. Purpose and
   Method: This study examined the effects of the quality of a friendship
   on cardiovascular reactivity when speaking about positive or negative
   life events with an ambivalent or supportive friend. To examine this,
   107 healthy male and female adults (and their same-sex friend) were
   recruited. Results: Results revealed that participants exhibited the
   greatest levels of systolic blood pressure reactivity when discussing a
   negative event with an ambivalent friend compared to a supportive
   friend. We also found higher resting levels of heart rate and lower
   respiratory sinus arrhythmia among those who brought in ambivalent
   friends than those who brought in supportive friends. Conclusion:
   Individuals may not be able to fully relax in the presence of ambivalent
   friends and may not benefit from support during stress. This research
   may help clarify the health-related consequences of differing types of
   social relationships.

AB Objective: This study considers statures of 19th century male Chinese
   immigrant to the American West and assesses how their personal
   characteristics were related with stature variation.
   Subjects: The subjects were 1423 male Chinese prisoners received between
   1850 and 1920 in the Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico,
   Oregon, Utah and Washington state prisons.
   Method: The study compares 19th century Chinese inmate statures with
   other studies and employs stature regression models on time,
   socio-economic status and residence within the USA to account for
   biological variation.
   Results: Between 1830 and 1870, Chinese youth male stature declined by
   over 2 cm. Between 1820 and 1860, Chinese adult male stature also
   declined by over 2 cm. Chinese stature did not vary with socio-economic
   status or residence.
   Conclusions: Nineteenth century Chinese emigrant statures were
   influenced more by political and economic events than socio-economic
   status, and male emigrants' biological conditions may have deteriorated
   throughout the 19th century.

AB This article considers the legacies of Jacques Derrida in and for
   Anglo-American sociocultural anthropology. It begins with a survey of
   Derrida's own engagement with themes that have historically been
   foundational to the field: (a) the critique of sign theory and, with it,
   the questions of language and law in Levi-Straussian structuralism; (b)
   the question of the unconscious; (c) the critique of the performative
   and its consequences for the idea of ritual; (d) the rereading of Marcel
   Mauss's concept of the gift, and of economy more generally; and (e) the
   analysis of the metaphysical basis of law, in both religious and
   ostensibly secular formations. It then considers the state of the field
   at the time when it was being infused with different forms of
   poststructuralism and explores the competing claims made by these
   discourses in relation to deconstruction. Finally, after tracing the
   convergences and divergences between Derridean deconstruction and theory
   in sociocultural anthropology, it treats two main examples of works
   produced against and under the influence of Derrida's thought,
   respectively.

AB This article addresses the relationship between socioeconomic status
   (SES), family processes, and human development. The topic is framed as
   part of the general issue of health disparities, which involves the
   oft-observed positive relationship between SES and the cognitive,
   social, emotional, and physical well-being of adults and children. A
   review of recent research and theory identifies three general
   theoretical approaches that provide possible explanations for the
   association between SES and individual development: the social
   causation, social selection, and interactionist perspectives. Empirical
   evidence demonstrates support for the social causation view that SES
   affects families and the development of children in terms of both family
   stress processes (the family stress model) and family investments in
   children (the family investment model). However, there also is empirical
   support for the social selection argument that individual
   characteristics lead to differences in SES. Especially important, recent
   research is consistent with an interactionist approach, which proposes a
   dynamic relationship between SES and developmental change over time.
   Drawing on the combined set of research findings, the article concludes
   with the description of an interactionist model that serves as a
   heuristic for future studies of the links among SES, parenting
   behaviors, and child development.

AB Persistent and vexing health disadvantages accrue to African Americans
   despite decades of work to erase the effects of race discrimination in
   this country. Participating in these efforts, psychologists and other
   social scientists have hypothesized that African Americans' continuing
   experiences with racism and discrimination may lie at the root of the
   many well-documented race-based physical health disparities that affect
   this population. With newly emerging methodologies in both measurement
   of contextual factors and functional neuroscience, an opportunity
   now,exists to cleave together a comprehensive understanding of the ways
   in which discrimination has harmful effects on health. In this article;
   we review emerging work that locates the cause of race-based health
   disparities in the external effects of the contextual social space on
   the internal world of brain functioning and physiologic response. These
   approaches reflect the growing interdisciplinary nature of psychology in
   general, and the field of race relations in particular.

   self-conscious emotions (guilt, shame, pride, social anxiety, and
   embarrassment), with an emphasis on how these motivational and emotional
   aspects of the self might be related. Specifically, these motives and
   emotions appear to function to protect people's social well-being. The
   motives to self-enhance, self-verify, and self-expand are partly rooted
   in people's concerns with social approval and acceptance, and
   self-conscious emotions arise in response to events that have real or
   imagined implications for others' judgments of the individual. Thus,
   these motives and emotions do not operate to maintain certain states of

   ostracism, social exclusion, and rejection: Being ignored; excluded,

   episodes result in sadness and anger and threaten fundamental needs.
   Individuals then act to fortify or replenish their thwarted need or
   needs. Behavioral consequences appear to be split into two general
   categories: attempts to fortify relational needs (belonging,
   self-esteem, shared understanding, and trust), which lead generally to
   prosocial thoughts and behaviors, or attempts to fortify efficacy/
   existence needs of control and recognition that may be dealt with most
   efficiently through antisocial thoughts and behaviors. Available
   research on chronic exposure to "ostracism appears to deplete coping
   resources, resulting in depression and helplessness.

   strategies and messages for diverse groups and denominations. A
   collaborative partnership approach utilizing principles of

AB This article traces the transatlantic diffusion of Pierre Bourdieu's
   ideas into American sociology. We find that rather than being received
   as abstract theory, Bourdieu has been actively put to use to generate
   new empirical research. In addition, American sociologists have used
   their findings to problematize and extend his theory. Bourdieu's
   sociology, in other words, has inspired a progressive research program
   in the United States. We trace this process in the two main forums for
   presenting research: journal articles and books. Content analysis of
   articles published in four major sociology journals reveals that, far
   from a recent fad, Bourdieu's ideas steadily diffused into American
   sociology between 1980 and 2004. Case studies of four influential books
   in turn illustrate how researchers have used Bourdieu's key concepts
   (capital, field, habitus, and symbolic power) to inform debates in four
   core subfields (political, economic, cultural, and urban sociology).

AB For several decades, the concept of the niche has enriched sociological
   theory. The niche represents the position or function of an entity, such
   as an organization or population of organizations, within a larger
   community environment. Using the concept of the niche allows researchers
   to go beyond classifying entities to understanding (a) their life
   chances under different and changing environmental conditions and (b)
   how they interact under the competitive conditions induced by a finite
   environment. We briefly review the intellectual history of the niche
   concept as it came from bioecology to sociology. The bulk of the article
   reviews the two major streams of sociological research that use the
   niche concept: the population ecology of organizations and McPherson's
   ecology of affiliation. Finally, we survey commonalities between these
   approaches and highlight new directions, including applications that
   take the niche concept well beyond its origins in organizational
   studies.

AB Sociologists use negative feedback loop systems to explain identity
   processes, interpersonal behavior, crowd behavior, organizational
   behavior, social relationships, and the behavior of political systems.
   Control system models help us to understand how actors enact social
   roles with enough stability to preserve institutional arrangements,
   while still demonstrating remarkable creativity in unusual
   circumstances. These theories take us away from an oversocialized view
   of the actor, without relegating us to exclusive reliance on grounded
   theory. They provide a foundation for several generative theories of
   adaptive, goal-seeking behavior on the part of social actors and
   institutions. This chapter begins by tracing the history of control
   theorizing in sociology, then-describes several contemporary theoties
   that rely on control imagery, reviews the empirical support for these
   theories, describes some of their significant points of overlap and
   departure, and examines some of the key tested-and untested-implications
   of a control system approach in sociology.

   Data Sources: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Educational Resources
   Information Center, Cochrane Collaboration, the Physical Education
   Index, and Sociology: A SAGE Full-Text Collection were searched for the
   terms bullying and bully.
   Study Selection: We found 2090 article citations and reviewed the
   references of relevant articles. Two reviewers critically evaluated 56
   articles and found 26 studies that met the inclusion criteria.
   Interventions: The types of interventions could be categorized as
   curriculum ( 10 studies), multidisciplinary or "whole-school"
   interventions ( 10 studies), social skills groups ( 4 studies),
   mentoring ( 1 study), and social worker support ( 1 study).
   Main Outcome Measures: Data were extracted regarding direct outcome
   measures of bullying ( bullying, victimization, aggressive behavior, and
   school responses to violence) and outcomes indirectly related to
   bullying ( school achievement, perceived school safety, self-esteem, and
   knowledge or attitudes toward bullying).
   Results: Only 4 of the 10 curriculum studies showed decreased bullying,
   but 3 of those 4 also showed no improvement in some populations. Of the
   10 studies evaluating the whole-school approach, 7 revealed decreased
   bullying, with younger children having fewer positive effects. Three of
   the social skills training studies showed no clear bullying reduction.
   The mentoring study found decreased bullying for mentored children. The
   study of increased school social workers found decreased bullying,
   truancy, theft, and drug use.
   Conclusions: Many school-based interventions directly reduce bullying,
   with better results for interventions that involve multiple disciplines.
   Curricular changes less often affect bullying behaviors. Outcomes
   indirectly related to bullying are not consistently improved by these
   interventions.

AB Background: Associations between childhood and adult socioeconomic
   status (SES) and adult levels of inflammatory markers (C-reactive
   protein [CRP], fibrinogen, white blood cell count [WBC], and von
   Willebrand factor [vWF]) were examined in the Atherosclerosis Risk in
   Communities (ARIC) Study cohort. Methods: A total of 12,681 white and
   African-American participants provided information on SES (via education
   and social class) and place of residence in childhood and adulthood.
   Residences were linked to census data for neighborhood SES information.
   Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Hierarchical and
   linear regression were used to estimate the effects of SES and possible
   mediation by adult cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Findings:
   Low childhood social class and education were associated with elevated
   levels of CRP, fibrinogen, WBC, and vWF (increments of 17%, 2%, 4% and
   3% for lowest versus highest education in childhood, respectively) among
   whites. Findings were less consistent among African-Americans. Adult SES
   was more strongly associated with inflammation than childhood SES.
   Individual-level SES measures were more consistently associated with
   inflammation than neighborhood-level measures. Fibrinogen and WBC showed
   the most consistent associations with SES; the largest changes in
   inflammation by SES were observed for CRP. Covariate adjustment strongly
   attenuated these associations. Mediation of the SES-inflammation
   associations by BMI, smoking and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) are suggested
   by these data. Conclusion: Low individual- and neighborhood-level SES in
   childhood and adulthood are associated with modest increments in adult
   inflammatory burden. These associations may operate through the
   influence of low SES on traditional CVD risk factors, especially BMI,
   smoking and HDL-C.

AB The Neolithic period of the southern Levant was an era of tremendous
   change. Over the course of the Neolithic, the gradual transition from
   foraging to agriculture involved not merely economic innovations, but
   also profound shifts in population size, social organization, and
   technology. This represents possibly the earliest, and certainly one of
   the earliest, instances of the transition to agriculture. The advent of
   farming altered human demography, health, and diversity; it shaped the
   spread of the world's dominant cultures, genes, and languages.' 2 It
   recast humans' relationship with the natural world, increasing
   modification of the environment. It both enabled and required the
   development of new social structures as humans learned how to live in
   increasingly large and densely packed groups.
   These transformations were not easily achieved. This paper traces the
   development of the southern Levantine Neolithic through two thousand
   years of socioeconomic elaboration and expansion; a major social
   recalibration in the middle Neolithic; and a final millennium-and-a-half
   of smaller-scale and materially simpler adaptations..

AB Biodiversity and ecosystem functions are discounted in most
   environmental decisions and market transactions. The ongoing pervasive
   losses of aquatic biodiversity reflect unsustainable uses of the
   biosphere but society is profoundly ignorant and apathetic regarding
   this degradation. Conserving aquatic biodiversity will require
   fundamental changes in the human economy, which fish biologists can help
   catalyze by re-configuring their role in conservation. Biologists
   concerned about biodiversity loss could become more engaged in assessing
   sustainability, in understanding relations among biodiversity, ecosystem
   function, and sustainability, and in promoting sustainable uses of
   ecosystems. Fish biologists can most effectively help build ecological
   sustainability by educating policymakers and publics about how
   biodiversity loss diminishes the quality of human lives. Via education,
   fish biologists should seek to influence people's values and ecological
   behavior, especially consumption patterns. The societal literacy needed
   for sustainability includes understanding how humans affect biota,
   dispelling the misconception that quality-of-life depends on
   consumption, and recognizing how intact ecosystems contribute to
   aesthetic, emotional, intellectual, physical, social, and spiritual
   dimensions of human lives. I advocate a more proactive,
   interdisciplinary commitment to conservation that elevates conservation
   education to equal importance with scientific research in the collective
   activities of fish biologists. These shifts will be difficult and
   require serious dialogue to reach consensus regarding fish biologists'
   role in building ecological sustainability.

   adaptive expertise and the implicit information gleaned from how he
   lived his life and collaborated with people around the world. By
   describing Giyoo Hatano's own qualities as an intercultural adaptive

AB This paper synthesizes two perspectives on essentialism: cognitive and
   social. The cognitive essentialist perspective argues that our bias to
   appeal to the psychological belief that categories have innate essences
   enables us to make inferences about social categories such as race,
   caste, and gender. The social essentialist perspective argues that
   essentialist thinking serves the needs of those in power to justify
   existing social and economic hierarchies. Examining the relationship
   between essentialism and power, this paper expands the framework for
   folk sociology, incorporating cognitive and social essentialist accounts
   to examine folk theories of social differences between caste, race,
   gender, and class, with a particular emphasis on social marginality and
   cultural narratives. Further, this paper discusses the relevance of the
   folk sociology perspective to the study of children's emerging

AB The secure-base phenomenon is central to the Bowlby/Ainsworth theory of
   attachment and is also central to the assessment of attachment across
   the lifespan. The present study tested whether mothers' knowledge about
   the secure-base phenomenon, as assessed using a recently designed
   word-list prompt measure for eliciting attachment-relevant stories,
   would predict their children's secure-base behavior, as assessed by
   observers in the home and summarized with the Attachment Q-set (AQS). In
   each of three sociocultural groups (from Colombia, Portugal, and the
   US), scores characterizing the quality of maternal secure-base
   narratives elicited using the word-list prompt procedure were internally
   consistent, as indicated by tests of cross-story reliability, and they
   were positively and significantly associated with the child's security
   score from the AQS for each subsample. The correlation in the combined
   sample was r(129) = .33, p < .001. Subsequent analyses with the combined
   sample evaluated the AQS item-correlates of the secure-base script
   score. These analyses showed that mothers whose stories indicate that
   they have access to and use a positive secure-base script in their story
   production have children who treat them as a "secure base" at home.
   These results suggest that a core feature of adult attachment models, in
   each of the three sociocultural groups studied, is access to a
   secure-base script. Additional results from the study indicate that
   cross-language translations of the maternal narratives can receive
   valid, reliable scores even when evaluated by non-native speakers.

AB Objective: The present study examines the relation between acculturation
   and body shape concern in Fiji society undergoing rapid social change.
   Method: Data were from two cohorts of ethnic Fijian girls and women
   collected in 1998 (n = 115). A factor analysis was performed to identify
   dimensions of acculturation. The association of these with body shape
   concern was examined with linear regression.
   Results: Three dimensions of acculturation were identified. Multiple
   linear regression models demonstrated that each of these dimensions of
   acculturation had a unique relation to body shape concern. The adjusted
   R-2 for the fully adjusted model relating acculturation to body concern
   was 0.63, indicating a substantial degree of shared variation between
   measures of body shape concern and measures of acculturation.
   Conclusion: Acculturation may have a strong impact on body shape concern
   in Fiji. However, acculturation is a multidimensional construct and does
   not likely have a monolithic relation to body shape concern. (c) 2006 by

   Coastal Symposium), 93 - 98. Gold Coast, Australia, ISSN 0749.0208
   Sandshed management links the well-known concept of watershed management
   with a regional approach to shoreline management that emphasises the
   maintenance of a sandy beach to provide hazard protection while
   preserving recreational, ecological and economic benefits. Sandshed
   management planning is described as a three step inventory, analysis,
   and implementation process. The inventory is comprised of a collection
   of cultural characteristics such as economic, social and environmental
   assets, jurisdictional boundaries, shoreline uses and activities as well
   as the physical processes that operate across a range of time and space
   scales to affect shoreline stability. Delineation of the sediment
   budget, the balance between sources and sinks within a sandshed, is a
   key part of the physical inventory. The analysis step includes both an
   assessment of the cause and extent of inundation and erosion-related
   hazards, and an evaluation of a range of potentially applicable
   management measures. Describing the positive and negative impacts
   associated with potential management measures in a way that accounts for
   community values and priorities is a key part of the analysis process.
   Once a preferred alternative or suite of alternatives has been
   identified, a range of implementation mechanisms need to be established.
   These may include memoranda of understanding or letters of agreement
   between agencies and organisations or more formal measures such as the
   adoption of planning and/or zoning code provisions. The comprehensive,
   regional approach embodied in the concept of sandshed management has
   significant implications to the management of our coasts worldwide.

AB The question of what structures of relations between actors emerge in
   the evolution of social networks is of fundamental sociological
   interest. The present research proposes that processes of network
   evolution can be usefully conceptualized in terms of a network of
   networks, or "metanetwork," wherein networks that are one link
   manipulation away from one another are connected. Moreover, the
   geography of metanetworks has real effects on the course of network
   evolution. Specifically, both equilibrium and non-equilibrium networks
   located in more desirable regions of the metanetwork are found to be
   more probable. These effects of metanetwork geography are illustrated by
   two dynamic network models: one in which actors pursue access to unique
   information through "structural holes," and the other in which actors
   pursue access to valid information by minimizing path length. Finally, I
   discuss future directions for modeling network dynamics in terms of
   metanetworks.

AB This paper examines the relationship of risk and power through a
   critical analysis of Crew Endurance Management, an initiative directed
   at enhancing maritime safety and efficiency. The paper argues that the
   initiative applies rhetorics of choice and self-discipline to unite
   morality with risk, thus casting merchant mariners as risk objects in
   the shipping industry. This objectification relies on differentials in
   power rooted in differentially-valued discourses that delegitimize some
   kinds of expertise. At the same time, deploying alternative rhetorics
   keyed to the anxieties of other levels of society allows risk objects to
   resist their objectification by shifting the relevant social scale for
   considering risk. The paper concludes by suggesting that imperatives for
   both productivity and safety will expand the workspace by expanding,
   through emphasis on personal choices, the environment in which workers
   must be concerned about risk reduction.

AB Survivorship of children is dependent Upon numerous variables, including
   the role that preferential treatment may play in biasing the birth and
   Survival of sons and daughters across Cultures. This Study draws upon an
   evolutionary approach by examining a theory referred to as the
   "Trivers-Willard hypothesis" concerning condition-dependent sex
   allocation and differential parental investment. Previous research on
   humans concerning this hypothesis tends to be restricted to one Cultural
   group and thereby limited in sample size. For this study, nationally
   representative household Survey data collected by the Demographic and
   Health Surveys (DHS+) program across 35 countries was used to test
   biological, resource-oriented, and behavioral aspects affecting maternal
   condition, sex allocation, and parental investment in humans. The units
   of analysis for this Study were the mothers and their lastborn child (N
   = 128,039 woman-child pairs). A series of hierarchical regressions were
   executed to empirically investigate the TW hypothesis in humans. Scales
   were developed for maternal socioeconomic resources (MSR), maternal
   biological condition (MBC), prenatal care for the lastborn child (PCL),
   and health-seeking for the lastborn child (HSL). MSR was measured by
   relative household economic status, woman's and partner's education, and
   residence in an urban/rural setting. MBC was defined by body mass index,
   pregnancy status and duration, and breast-feeding status. PCL was an
   index for type of prenatal care received, number of prenatal visits, and
   assistance during delivery of the lastborn child. Lastly, HSL measured
   indicators of treatment for diarrhea and immunizations received by the
   lastborn child. Across the 35 Countries, the analyses did not Support
   the Trivers-Willard hypothesis. However, there is evidence of regional
   and Country level differences.

AB Previous HIV/AIDS assessments in Kenya have focused on the sexual risk

   childbearing age. No data are available for Kenyan university Students.
   Baseline surveillance data were obtained from a representative sample of
   1917 university Students at Moi University in Eldoret, Kenya. Both
   qualitative (focus group discussions) and quantitative
   (self-administered questionnaire) data were collected. Students were
   asked about their HIV knowledge, perceptions, and sexual risk behaviors.
   Seventy-one % of males and 47.6% of females reported having had sex.
   Only 49% Of university Students reported any HIV/AIDS education. Of
   those who reported having ever had sex, 76% reported ever using a
   condom: only 18% of males and 14% of females reported Using a condom
   every time they had sex in the last month. Eighty-nine% of students
   reported thinking they were at risk for HIV infection, but only 28% Of
   Subjects had been tested for HIV. Qualitative data suggest the issue of
   HIV testing remains very controversial among students, in large part
   because of societal stigma. The results of this study emphasize the
   Vulnerability of university students to HIV infection. Most university
   students have not had access to accurate HIV/AIDS information. Sexual
   activity on campus is high and many students consider themselves at
   risk. Conversely, consistent condom use and rates of voluntary
   counseling and testing are low.

AB Purpose - To construct, from Bateson's social ideas ranging from Naven
   to the 1979 Mind and Nature, a Batesonian sociocybernetics.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper considers Bateson's ideas about
   the delineation of systems by the observer, as they were taught to his
   classes in the 1970s and as they were expressed in the so-called first,
   1936 Epilogue to Naven, and shows how these ideas led Bateson to a
   skeptical, anti-reificationist social cybernetics.
   Findings - Bateson de-emphasized system boundaries, instead seeing
   systems as creations of the observer and as arbitrary cuttings of a
   continuous web of cybernetic processes.
   Research limitations/implications - Bateson's argument in Naven, a work
   originally published in 1936 and partially based in a sociological
   tradition which also forms some of the roots of Luhmann's thought, is
   surprisingly relevant to contemporary issues in second-order cybernetics
   and sociocybernetics.
   Practical implications - Bateson's skepticism about reification, and
   emphasis on the observer's role in the construction of system
   boundaries, can point a way for sociocybernetics to address those
   cybernetic systems which do not fit Luhmann's or Maturana's strict
   criteria for autopoiesis.
   Originality/value - This paper attempts to show the sophistication and
   relevance of Bateson's social thinking to the field of sociocybernetics.

AB In life course studies five principles guide social science researchers:
   (1) the principle of human development and aging, (2) the principle of
   human agency, (3) the principle of historical time and space, (4) the
   principle of timing, and (5) the principle of linked lives. We propose a
   sixth principle: life course tempo explicitly depends on other life
   course principles especially the external principles of (2), (3), and
   (5). Tempo changes may have sociological and psychological consequences.
   To demonstrate the sixth principle at work, we analyze a sample of the
   peasant letters both to and from America in Thomas and Znaniecki's The
   Polish Peasant in Europe and America, the pioneer life history study of
   Polish immigrants in early 20(th) century. Two types of tempo change in
   transition into first marriage are evident in the letters,
   waiting/postponement and haste, which resulted from changed historical
   time and space and reorganized human agency of the immigrants. Thus,
   this research is inspired by Thomas and Znaniecki's work on the Polish
   peasant and Znaniecki's methodology and in turn uses the Polish peasant
   letters as data.

AB While Florian Znaniecki's work is best known through his joint work with
   William I. Thomas on The Polish Peasant in Europe and America, his most
   important work deals with the methodology and substance of sociology of
   culture, based on three origins: systems theory, the identification of
   cultural science along the Vico-Axiom (his culturalism), and his
   cultural realism. Of the major sources of specific sociology of culture,
   he analyses in The Method of Sociology (1934) as a system approach,
   types of cultural and sociological data, existing methodological
   tendencies and the development of analytic induction which means a
   conglomerate of logic principles and a principle based on exception
   rather than the rule of insight. His final work Cultural Sciences (1952)
   is an attempt to include data and their interpretation from a set of
   cultural sciences, whereby the functionality of sociology as a cultural
   specialty is increasing the sociologists specialize in the comparative
   studies of other cultural sciences.

AB Objective. To identify factors associated with age of smoking initiation
   and distinguish vulnerable periods for initiation according to those
   factors. Method. Discrete time hazards analysis was used to model
   smoking initiation as a function of age (5-23), demographic and familial
   influence variables (measured at age 13), and their interactions in a
   cohort of 6255 youths who completed six assessments over a 10-year
   period from age 13 to 23 years. Results. Half of the sample had
   initiated smoking by age 13, and the hazard for initiation was greatest
   between ages 13 and 15. In addition to differences associated with
   race/ethnicity, protective factors for smoking initiation included high
   parental education and having an intact family of origin. Having an
   older sibling and participant's exposure to smoking by an important
   adult were both risk factors, with the latter having a stronger effect
   for females and Blacks. For all effects, the strength of the association
   differed across the age range. Conclusions. The impact of demographic
   and family influence factors on smoking initiation varies over time.
   However, the maximum risk for initiation is during the early teen years,
   and the range of considerable vulnerability is during middle school and
   high school. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Objective. This paper reports the findings of annual Synar inspections
   to assess compliance with federal and state legislation to limit minors'
   access to tobacco products in Hawaii. We also report on factors
   associated with selling tobacco to minors for the most recent year of
   inspections (2003).
   Methods. Annual, random, unannounced inspections were conducted by
   minors (ages 14-17 years) over an 8-year period (1996-2003). Stores were
   randomly selected from a list of stores that sell tobacco products ill
   Hawaii.
   Results. There was a significant decrease in the percent of successful
   purchases made over the period from 1996 (44.5%) to 2003 (6.2%). Based
   on multivariate analyses, only two variables were associated with
   whether a successful purchase was made in 2003: whether the minor's
   identification or age was requested.
   Conclusion. Findings suggest that surveillance, education, and
   enforcement efforts in Hawaii have been successful at making substantial
   reductions in noncompliance rates. Even with the current low rate of
   sales to minors, failing to request the minor's identification or age
   was associated with making a successful purchase, while characteristics
   of the minor and retail environment were not. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All

   higher levels of foreign capital penetration in the primary sector use a
   greater amount of pesticides per hectare of arable and permanent
   cropland. Findings for the ordinary least squares regression (OLS) and
   robust regression analyses of 40 less-developed countries confirm the
   hypothesis, and underscore the need for social scientists to assess the

AB This article asks how the heirloom tomato emerged as a cultural object
   in the late twentieth century, from something grown by individual
   seedsaving gardeners into a status symbol available for $7 a pound at
   speciality markets. This article finds that a combination of structural
   changes (increasing industrial farming on the one hand, and the turn to
   organic, local and 'authentic' food experiences on the other) as well as
   the activities of individual activist chefs and seedsavers has led to
   the tomatoes' emergence in a broader arena of consumption. But the
   article also reveals a significant spatial dimension to this apparent
   change in meaning. The heirloom tomato certainly emerges as a symbol of
   elite status in the pages of popular magazines and newspapers by the
   early twenty-first century - but the act of 'distinction' and the
   marketplace in which it happens are spatially demarcated and do not
   interfere with the access of non-elites to the object. Thus I offer an
   explanation of how this cultural object is created over time, but at the
   same time emphasise the importance of attending to location and
   spatiality in the study of taste, distinction and culture.

AB A common problem in sociology, psychology, biology, geography, and
   management science is the comparison of dyadic relational structures
   (i.e., graphs). Where these structures are formed on a common set of
   elements, a natural question that arises is whether there is a tendency
   for elements that are strongly connected in one set of structures to be
   more-or less-strongly connected within another set. We may ask,for
   instance, whether there is a correspondence between golf games and
   business deals, trade and warfare, or spatial proximity and genetic
   similarity. In each case, the data for such comparisons may be
   continuous or discrete, and multiple relations may be involved
   simultaneously (e.g., when comparing multiple measures of international
   trade volume with multiple types of political interactions). We propose
   here an exponential family of permutation models that is suitable for
   inferring the direction and strength of association among dyadic
   relational structures. A linear-time algorithm is shown for MCMC
   simulation of model draws, as is the use of simulated draws for maximum
   likelihood estimation (MCMC-MLE) and/or estimation of Monte Carlo
   standard errors. We also provide an easily performed maximum
   pseudo-likelihood estimation procedure for the permutation model family,
   which provides a reasonable means of generating seed models for the
   MCMC-MLE procedure. Use of the modeling framework is demonstrated via an
   application involving relationships among managers in a high-tech firm.

   stranger)"-has less to do with what went on inside the prison and more
   with the global prison yard. Strange is how we, global spectators of the
   prison abuses, continue to stand on shaky cardboard boxes of rising and
   falling empires with hoods of amnesia and evasion put on our minds, and
   sophisticated media wires of true or false fears manipulating our
   emotions. To escape from prison, a mystic once said, one must first
   realize one is in prison. The inquiry is used as grounds for advancing a
   discourse on Newtonian and quantal sociological imaginations in favor of
   a Sociology of Self-knowledge.

   circulating in American culture over a long period of time. Nor has the
   question of change in the meaning of nature resulting from the rise of
   modern environmentalism in the 1960s been addressed sufficiently. To
   address both issues, general audience magazines were examined to uncover
   trends in the meanings of nature from 1945 through 1980. A qualitative
   and semiotic approach was used to examine the data. The analysis
   revealed a predominance of appreciative meanings and little qualitative
   change despite the rise of environmental struggle midway through the
   study period. Implications and the relationship of this finding to other
   relevant cultural research in environmental sociology were discussed.

   regarding infant feeding, family dynamics, work environment, social

   and company's Habits of the Heart ( 1996), more attention has been
   directed toward moral sociology while Putnam's Bowling Alone ( 2000) has
   stimulated discussions about social networks and social capital. This

   This study draws heavily upon the classical work of W. E. B. Du Bois (
   Du Bois and Dill 1914) on morals, manners, and social uplift, the more
   contemporary work of Stark ( 2004) and Greeley ( 1989) on the perception

   different paths of impact and recovery taken by New Orleans and the rest
   of the disaster-stricken region. Specifically, this disaster has
   produced a series of secondary traumas that continue to thwart recovery
   efforts. Understanding these secondary traumas can lead to amelioration
   of their effects and development of responses to diminish their

AB Some commentators have suggested that the embrace of "identity politics"
   has gone too far and that we are now in a putative postidentity moment.
   Within the academy this argument has been articulated from two divergent
   positions. The first derides identity politics as a move away from
   materialist concerns. The second, more conservative, position argues
   that identity politics is at fault for being over-political, for reading
   politics into every aspect of knowledge production. I argue that
   identity is in fact a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition
   for any effective oppositional politics. I further suggest that these
   arguments are themselves evidence of the articulation of (white, male,
   and heterosexual) institutional power within the academic field of
   (sport) sociology. As an alternative, I argue for the renewal of a
   critical public sport sociology that draws upon and extends the cultural
   studies tradition of committed and engaged scholarship.

AB Even in its formative stages the scholarship of teaching and learning
   (SoTL) is drawing the attention and interest of scholars across academic
   disciplines and across types of educational institutions. Many
   sociologists are reflecting on how to shape scholarly efforts on
   teaching and learning within our discipline. This paper recounts the
   guidance that Hans Mauksch, a legendary figure in the teaching movement
   in sociology, extended to medical sociology as that area of
   specialization was developing, and seeks to apply his ideas to the
   development of SoTL in sociology today. I make three specific
   recommendations: (1) maintaining the independence of SoTL as a separate
   area of interest and scholarship while enthusiastically working with and
   drawing upon the work of others within and outside sociology, (2)
   broadening the content of SoTL investigations to address teaching and
   learning from additional perspectives, and (3) utilizing an increasingly
   diverse set of research methods to assist in exploring the many
   dimensions of teaching and learning.

PY 2007
AB Academic sociologists have recently increased their focus on improving
   high school sociology. Reform efforts include networking between
   teachers and universities, improving curriculum, and enhancing teacher
   training. I propose that this list be expanded to include setting
   curricular standards. Current trends in educational reform center on
   standards-based education, and although many social science disciplines
   have adapted to this trend, sociology's focus on standards is limited to
   undergraduate education. I analyze the existing state sociology
   standards by measuring them against the American Sociological
   Association's (ASA) Advanced Placement Sociology course, the National
   Council for Social Studies standards, and the sample learning goals from
   Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major Updated (McKinney et al. 2005).
   The results indicate that there are some substantial differences in the
   learning goals set forth by the ASA and those set forth by the states. I
   suggest that since the academic sociological community is in an ideal
   position to address high school social studies content in a variety of
   disciplines, we should expand our efforts in this area.

AB In this article I examine how the sociology major is structured at

   analysis of college catalogs from 100 institutions to examine the
   sociology major at top institutions among regional and national
   universities and liberal arts colleges. I first examine the basic
   structure of sociology programs and then evaluate implementation of the
   recommendations from Liberal Learning and the Sociology Major (Eberts et
   al. 1990). In 1990 the Council of the American Sociological Association
   voted to "encourage departments to consider and implement the
   recommendations" for the undergraduate curriculum found in Liberal
   Learning. These recommendations suggest a cumulative curriculum,
   including a four-level sequence and a capstone course. I assess the
   extent to which these recommendations had been adopted a decade after
   the report (by the year 2000), and conclude with suggestions for
   expanding the implementation of recommendations for study in depth in
   sociology.

PD JAN 2007
PY 2007
AB Decades of research have documented the positive impacts of cooperative
   learning on student success: increased learning, retention through
   graduation, improved critical thinking, and intrinsic motivation. One
   cooperative teaching technique, however, has received relatively little
   attention. In the two-stage cooperative, group, or "pyramid" exam
   students first take an exam individually-as in traditional testing-and
   then take the same exam together with their learning group, with the
   exam grade being a weighted combination of their individual and group
   scores. This approach uses the exam itself not only for evaluation, but
   also as a learning tool. Although some researchers have studied group
   exams, they have not isolated the impact of group tests from individual
   achievernent-an important omission. Using data from a mass lecture
   introductory sociology course, I found that holding individual
   achievement constant the group exam process significantly increased
   learning both for students who knew the material initially and for those
   who did not. This suggests that cooperative exams not only enhance
   learning but also allow for the process and form of testing to become
   more closely linked to the process and form of teaching and learning.

AB Visual academies were unique social formations in the ancien rigime, so
   distinctive that they are best studied as prototype professions. Alone
   among academies, they were responsible for offering instruction. Alone
   among educational institutions, they linked liberal instruction to
   occupational practice. Alone among 'learned' occupations, they
   accommodated an irreducible manual component. The visual Academie in
   Paris in particular established literally the first 'graduate school' in
   any field of activity and admitted students on the basis of anonymously
   scored student competitions. Equivalent activities will not begin to
   emerge in medicine or law until the mid-19th century. Our historical
   case, in short, calls into question the received orthodoxy regarding the
   time and place of the first professionalism projects. Instead of
   focusing on 19th-century Britain, we are now considering
   mid-17th-century France and thereby preparing the way for a new start in
   the sociology of professions.

AB OBJECTIVES To ascertain if there are specific sociocultural and
   behavioural practices associated with the exposure to saliva, semen and
   vaginal fluids, particularly through child-rearing practices and the use
   of traditional medicine in Lusaka, Zambia.
   METHODS We conducted 11 focus group discussions with men and women from
   diverse ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds (n = 105) in Lusaka, Zambia
   in March 2004. We also conducted a brief sociodemographic survey of all
   focus group participants.
   RESULTS Discussions indicated that saliva was used while engaging in
   home health care practices associated with childcare and the use of
   traditional medicine. Additionally, semen and vaginal fluids may be used
   in rituals associated with childcare and health care for children. Our
   survey indicated that the use of traditional medicine is associated with
   lower socioeconomic status.
   CONCLUSIONS Population-based studies are needed to evaluate the
   relationship between traditional behavioural and sociocultural
   practices, which involve exchange of saliva and other bodily fluids and
   risk of infectious disease.

   Layered-task time is similar to polychronic time (P-time) in the
   inclusion of simultaneous, multiple tasks but includes additional
   dimensions of fragmentation, contamination and constraint. The chapter
   links the development of this new time and its resultant time-sense to
   variation in the degree to which organizations are hierarchical and
   centralized and develops propositions about these relationships. The
   chapter contributes to the growing literature on workplace temporalities

AB The ceramic value index is a powerful empirical tool used in historical
   archaeology to assess the required economic access necessary for a
   family or individual to accumulate specific household goods. The focus
   of this method is primarily on the status of the artifact assemblage
   itself, however, and not the people who acquired the objects. Since this
   measure of socioeconomic status is quantified only through the pottery
   used by the site occupants, it may not take into account the various
   perspectives of the occupants have towards their domestic vessels, nor
   does it consider the wider social context of the study area. Although
   the formula has been used extensively in historic archaeology, this has
   been done without significant critique. Sites from 19(th)-century
   Indiana are used here as examples of the potential successes and
   failures of a formula built on the assumption that consumers utilize
   archaeological objects for all the same reasons.

   rapidly rising health care costs are affecting specific groups of
   patients.
   Objective To estimate the number and characteristics of individuals in
   the United States faced with very high financial burdens for health
   care.
   Design, Setting, and Population Data from a nationally representative
   sample of civilian, noninstitutionalized US individuals younger than 65
   years from the Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were used to calculate
   2 measures of financial burden as a function of tax-adjusted family
   income. Total burden included all out-of-pocket expenditures for health
   care services, including premiums. Health care services burden excluded
   premiums and, when applied to the insured population, was used to
   identify the underinsured. We defined the underinsured as insured
   persons with health care service burdens in excess of 10% of
   tax-adjusted family income.
   Main Outcome Measures Total and health care services burdens exceeding
   10% and 20% of family income in 1996 and 2003.
   Results In 2003, there were 48.8 million individuals (19.2%) living in
   families spending more than 10% of family income on health care, an
   increase of 11.7 million persons since 1996. Of these individuals, about
   18.7 million (7.3%) were spending more than 20% of family income. In
   2003, individuals with higher-than-average risk of incurring high total
   burdens included poor and low-income persons and those with non-group
   coverage, aged 55 to 64 years, living in a non - metropolitan
   statistical area, in fair or poor health, having any type of limitation,
   or having a chronic medical condition. Applying our definition of
   underinsured to the insured population, an estimated 17.1 million
   persons younger than 65 years were underinsured in 2003, including 9.3
   million persons with private employment-related insurance, 1.3 million
   persons with private nongroup policies, and 6.6 million persons with
   public coverage.
   Conclusions Our analysis identifies patients at greatest risk of
   health-related financial burdens that may adversely affect their access
   and adherence to recommended treatments. Our study also highlights the
   high costs associated with nongroup health insurance policies.

   Participants generated responses to the question, "How does being a
   Black/White woman affect your weight?" The African American groups
   generated 48 unique ideas, including unhealthy food preparation, poor
   food selection habits, lack of exercise, stress, increased risk of
   chronic diseases, and associated medical costs; the Caucasian groups
   produced 32 responses, including distorted expectations of perfect body
   type, success depended on thinness and beauty, social pressures, media,
   and men's preferences. Results suggest that the African American women
   focused on food choices and health consequences while the Caucasian
   women emphasized body size and aesthetics. The observed differences
   support a need for culturally specific interventions that promote good
   eating patterns and healthy body shapes.

AB Objective. We examined whether the influence of neighborhood-level
   socioeconomic status (SES) on mortality differed by individual-level
   SES.
   Methods. We used a population-based, mortality follow-up study of 4476
   women and 3721 men, who were predominately non-HIspanic White and aged
   25-74 years at baseline, from 82 neighborhoods in 4 California cities.
   Participants were surveyed between 1979 and 1990, and were followed
   until December 31, 2002 (1148 deaths; mean follow-up time 17.4 years).
   Neighborhood SES was defined by 5 census variables and was divided into
   3 levels. Individual SES was defined by a composite of educational level
   and household income and was divided into tertiles.
   Results. Death rates among women of low SES were highest in high-SES
   neighborhoods (1907/100000 person-years), lower in moderate-SES
   neighborhoods (1323), and lowest in low-SES neighborhoods (1128).
   Similar to women, rates among men of low SES were 1928, 1646, and 1590
   in high-, moderate-, and low-SES neighborhoods, respectively.
   Differences were not explained by individual-level baseline risk
   factors.
   Conclusion. The disparities in mortality by neighborhood of residence
   among women and men of low SES demonstrate that they do not benefit from
   the higher quality of resources and knowledge generally associated with
   neighborhoods that have higher SES.

AB Objectives. Previous research has generally found that racial/ethnic
   differences in breast cancer stage at diagnosis attenuate when measures
   of socioeconomic status are included in the analysis, although most
   previous research measured socioeconomic status at the contextual level.
   This study investigated the relation between race/ethnicity, individual
   socioeconomic status, and breast cancer stage at diagnosis.
   Methods. Women with stage 0 to III breast cancer were identified from
   population-based data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results tumor registries in the Detroit and Los Angeles metropolitan
   areas. These data were combined with data from a mailed survey in a
   sample of White, Black, and Hispanic women (n=1700). Logistic regression
   identified factors associated with early-stage diagnosis.
   Results. Black and Hispanic women were less likely to be diagnosed with
   early-stage breast cancer than were White women (P <.001). After control
   for study site, age, and individual socioeconomic factors, the odds of
   early detection were still significantly less for Hispanic women (odds
   ratio [OR]=0.45) and Black women (OR=0.72) than for White women. After
   control for the method of disease detection, the White/Black disparity
   attenuated to insignificance; the decreased likelihood of early
   detection among Hispanic women remained significant (OR=0.59).
   Conclusion. The way in which racial/ethnic minority status and
   socioeconomic characteristics produce disparities in women's experiences
   with breast cancer deserves further research and policy attention.

AB Objectives. We examined whether Medicaid beneficiaries are more likely
   to be diagnosed with late-stage cervical cancer than women not enrolled
   in Medicaid.
   Methods. Using the California Cancer Registry-Medicaid linked file, we
   identified 4682 women diagnosed during 1996-1999 with invasive cervical
   cancer. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the
   association between late-stage diagnosis and prediagnosis Medicaid
   status.
   Results. Late-stage disease was diagnosed in 51% of Medicaid and 42% of
   non-Medicaid women. Relative to women without Medicaid coverage,
   adjusted odds ratios for late-stage diagnosis were 2.8 times higher
   among women enrolled in Medicaid at the time of their diagnosis and 1.3
   times higher among those intermittently enrolled before being diagnosed.
   Vietnamese women were less likely than White women to have advanced
   disease; the adjusted odds for women in other racial/ethnic groups did
   not differ from those among Whites. Women of low socioeconomic status
   and older women were at increased risk.
   Conclusions. Women intermittently enrolled in Medicaid or not enrolled
   until their diagnosis were at greatest risk of a late-stage diagnosis,
   suggesting that more outreach to at-risk women is needed to ensure
   access to screening services.

AB Objectives. We assessed whether the few findings to date suggesting weak
   relationships between education and health-related variables among
   Hispanics are indicative of a more widespread pattern.
   Methods. We used logistic regression models to examine education
   differentials (i.e., education gradients) in health behaviors and
   outcomes among White and Mexican-origin adults, adolescents, and
   infants. We gathered information from 3 data sets: the Los Angeles
   Family and Neighborhood Survey, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
   Study, and the National Health Interview Survey.
   Results. In contrast with patterns for Whites, education was weakly
   associated or not associated with numerous health-related variables
   among the US Mexican-origin population. Among adults, Mexican immigrants
   were especially likely to have weaker education gradients than Whites.
   Conclusions. The weak relationships between education and health
   observed among individuals of Mexican origin may have been the result of
   several complex mechanisms: social gradients in health in Mexico that
   differ from those in the United States, selective immigration according
   to health and socioeconomic status, and particular patterns of
   integration of Mexican immigrants into US society.

AB Objectives. We investigated whether oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer
   (OPC) incidence and mortality statistics among Hispanics in New York
   State differed from those among Hispanics in the United States as a
   whole.
   Methods. OPC incidence and mortality statistics for 1996-2002 were
   obtained from the New York State Cancer Registry and compared with
   national statistics released by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End
   Results (SEER) program for the same period.
   Results. Among Hispanic men, OPC incidence rates were approximately 75%
   and 89% higher in New York State and New York City, respectively, than
   national rates reported by the SEER program. No notable differences were
   identified among Hispanic women. Incidence rates among New York State
   Hispanic men were 16% higher than those of their non-Hispanic White
   counterparts. The difference was twice as high (32%) among Hispanic men
   in New York City. Mortality rates among both men and women exhibited
   patterns similar to the incidence patterns.
   Conclusions. Ethnoregional differences exist in the incidence and
   mortality rates of OPC in the United States. New York State Hispanic men
   exhibit much higher incidence and mortality rates than US Hispanics as
   reported by the SEER program.

AB Objectives. We determined the size and correlates of underascertainment
   of Hispanic ethnicity on California death certificates.
   Methods. We used 1999 to 2000 vital registration data. We compared
   Hispanic ethnicity reported on the death certificate to Hispanic
   ethnicity derived from birthplace for the foreign-born and an algorithm
   that used first and last name and percentage of Hispanics in the county
   of residence for the US-born. We validated death certificate nativity by
   comparing data with that in linked Social Security Administration
   records.
   Results. Ethnicity and birthplace information was concordant for
   foreign-born Hispanics, who have mortality rates that are 25% to 30%
   lower than those of non-Hispanic Whites. Death certificates likely
   underascertain deaths of US-born Hispanics, particularly at older ages,
   for persons with more education, and in census tracts with lower
   percentages of Hispanics. Conservative correction for underascertainment
   eliminates the Hispanic mortality advantage for US-born men.
   Conclusions. Hispanic ethnicity is accurately ascertained on the
   California death certificate for immigrants. Immigrant Hispanics have
   lower age-adjusted mortality rates than do non-Hispanic Whites. For
   US-born Hispanics, the mortality advantage compared with non-Hispanic
   Whites is smaller and may be explained by underreporting of Hispanic
   ethnicity on the death certificate.

AB Objectives. We examined the correlates of having ever had sexual
   intercourse among American Indians aged 13 to 18 years in Minnesota.
   Methods. To assess key environmental, social, and individual correlates
   of sexual experience, we analyzed data from 4135 American Indian youths
   who participated in the 1998 and 2001 Minnesota Student Surveys.
   Results. Forty-two percent of those aged 13 to 15 years and 69% of those
   aged 16 to 18 years reported that they had ever had sexual intercourse.
   Correlates of sexual experience varied by age and gender. School
   connections had the strongest negative associations with sexual
   experience in young girls, and living with a father had negative
   associations with sexual experience for younger, but not older, youths.
   Sexual experience was most strongly and positively associated with risk
   behaviors such as substance use, violence exposure, and violence
   perpetuation.
   Conclusions. The strongest correlates of sexual experience for American
   Indian youths were high-risk behaviors and exposure to violence. Future
   work is needed to develop and employ measures that reflect youth assets
   and that specifically reflect the experiences of American Indian youths.

AB Ritualized behavior, intuitively recognizable by its stereotypy,
   rigidity, repetition, and apparent lack of rational motivation, is found
   in a variety of life conditions, customs, and everyday practices: in
   cultural rituals, whether religious or non-religious; in many children's
   complicated routines; in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorders
   (OCD); in normal adults around certain stages of the life-cycle,
   birthing in particular. Combining evidence from evolutionary
   anthropology, neuropsychology and neuroirnaging, we propose an
   explanation of ritualized behavior in terms of an evolved Precaution
   System geared to the detection of and reaction to inferred threats to
   fitness. This system, distinct from fear-systems geared to respond to
   manifest danger, includes a repertoire of clues for potential danger as
   well as a repertoire of species-typical precautions. In OCD pathology,
   this system does not supply a negative feedback to the appraisal of
   potential threats, resulting in doubts about the proper performance of
   precautions, and repetition of action. Also, anxiety levels focus the
   attention on low-level gestural units of behavior rather than oil the
   goal-related higher-level units normally used in parsing the
   action-flow. Normally automatized actions are submitted to cognitive
   control. This "swamps" working memory, an effect of which is a temporary
   relief from intrusions but also their long-term strengthening. Normal
   activation of this Precaution System explains intrusions and ritual
   behaviors in normal adults. Gradual calibration of the system occurs
   through childhood rituals. Cultural mimicry of this system's normal
   input makes cultural rituals attention-grabbing and compelling. A number
   of empirical predictions follow from this synthetic model.

AB This paper examines how global interdependencies and the consolidation
   of a human rights discourse are transforming national sovereignty.
   Social researchers frequently address the supremacy of state sovereignty
   and the absoluteness of human rights as mutually exclusive categories.
   However, rather than presupposing that a universal rights discourse is
   necessarily leading to the demise of sovereignty, we suggest that an
   increasingly de-nationalized conception of legitimacy is contributing to
   a reconfiguration of sovereignty itself. Through the analytic prism of
   historical memories - which refers to shared understandings specific
   pasts carry for present concerns of a political community - we provide
   an explanatory factor for the salience of human rights norms as a
   globally available repertoire of legitimate claim making. While states
   retain most of their sovereign functions, their legitimacy is no longer
   exclusively conditioned by a contract with the nation, but also by their
   adherence to a set of nation-transcending human rights ideals.
   Legitimacy is mediated by how willing states are to engage with
   'judicial memories' of human rights abuses and their articulation in
   cosmopolitan legal frames. Empirically, we focus on war crime trials and
   how legal inscriptions of memories of human rights abuses are recasting
   the jurisdiction of International Law. The readiness of states to engage
   with rights abuses is becoming politically and culturally consequential,
   as adherence to global human rights norms confers legitimacy.

AB Investigated early development of temperament across three cultures:
   People's Republic of China (PRC), United States of America (US), and
   Spain, utilizing a longitudinal design (assessments at 3, 6, and 9
   months of age). Selection of these countries presented an opportunity to
   conduct Eastern-Western/Individualistic-Collectivistic comparisons. The
   greatest number of significant differences (i.e., involving more
   temperament dimensions) was anticipated for the US
   (Western/Individualistic) and PRC (Eastern/Collectivistic) comparisons.
   The US sample included 66, the PRC group 69, and the Spanish sample, 60
   mothers, all of whom completed the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ) 3
   times, when their infants were 3, 6, and 9 months of age. Results
   related to mean group differences were generally consistent with our
   hypotheses, demonstrating a greater number of significant differences
   for US versus PRC, with fewer differences observed for US and Spain.
   Analyses addressing developmental changes in temperament indicated
   patterns consistent with a priori expectations and cross-cultural
   differences.

   a surprisingly consistent result is that a collection of measures

   on race socialization within Black families. Race socialization is
   defined as specific verbal and non-verbal messages transmitted to
   younger generations for the development of values, attitudes, behaviors,
   and beliefs regarding the meaning and significance of race and racial
   stratification, intergroup and intragroup interactions, and personal and
   group identity. Reviewed are published articles that address either
   analytical or theoretical approaches to understanding Black families'
   race socialization practices. First, theoretical perspectives of the
   race socialization process are reviewed. Second, this review defines
   race socialization in Black families. It then describes modes of message
   transmittal. Next, it focuses on three domains of research on race
   socialization: (a) prevalence, (b) content, and (c) race socialization
   as a predictor of child and adult outcomes. It concludes by outlining
   important challenges and issues in the literature to encourage the

AB Infant temperament is theorized to have a strong genetic basis. Yet,
   studies of the stability of temperament and molecular genetics research
   on temperament have revealed inconsistent findings. One reason may be
   because research has not taken into account the influence of early
   social experiences. We review research on aspects of infant emotionality
   presumed to be temperamental in origin, emotion reactivity and emotion
   regulation, and integrate research addressing parenting influences on
   physiology and genetics of infant emotionality with traditional research
   on behavioral expression of emotionality. Empirical research supports
   the theory that sensitive and appropriately responsive parenting in
   infancy is related to more optimal patterns of behavioral and
   physiological reactivity and regulation. Molecular genetics research
   with both animal and human populations has produced consistent results
   when environmental experiences are taken into account. Findings suggest
   that the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene and the long
   allele of the DRD4 dopamine receptor gene may be related to distinct
   patterns of infant emotionality and to later problems with depression,
   impulse control problems, and externalizing/ antisocial behaviors,
   primarily when paired with insensitive parenting, abuse or neglect, or
   other adverse family environments. Future directions and limitations in
   the field are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB An effective protected area system is essential for the long-term

   attitudes of 2915 residents in 97 communities around three protected
   areas (PAs) in upper Myanmar: Alaungdaw Kathapa National Park in the
   western mountains, Htamanthi Wildlife Sanctuary in the hills bordering
   the Chindwin and Uru rivers, and Chatthin Wildlife Sanctuary in the
   central dry zone. Logistic regression indicated a positive attitude
   toward the PAs was most highly correlated with a perception of
   conservation benefits and benefits resulting from management of the
   areas. Attitude was also significantly correlated with a perception of
   extraction benefits, conflicts with PA staff and crop damage by
   wildlife. Socioeconomic variables were less powerful than perceptions in
   predicting attitude and, unlike perceptions, their effects varied among
   the areas. The much greater effect of perceptions, especially positive
   ones, on people's attitudes indicates that understanding perceptions is
   important to improving the relationship between local residents and
   these PAs. This finding underscores the fact that a focus on conflicts
   to understand people's attitudes toward PAs may undervalue or miss
   critical positive perceptions that people hold. Understanding local
   residents' perceptions of PAs makes possible the creation of strategic,
   place-based management strategies that build on people's positive
   perceptions and mitigate their negative perceptions.

AB Little is known about the association between acculturation and fruit
   and vegetable (FV) Consumption among older Mexican-American (MA) women.
   Environmental and lifestyles changes experienced by immigrants to the
   United States may markedly affect their diet and health and increase
   their risk for chronic diseases. Our objectives were to: 1) describe FV
   consumption by ethnicity, accumulation, and sociodemographic
   characteristics, and 2) compare effects of acculturation and
   sociodemographic variables on FV intake in a population of older MA and
   non-Hispanic White (NHW) women from the Well-integrated Screening and
   Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) Study. This report
   examines baseline FV intake of 346 underinsured women aged 50-76 years,
   assessed through 24-hour dietary recalls. Acculturation was measured
   with a five-item Likert-type scale. Twenty percent of more acculturated
   MA women, 24% of less acculturated MA women, and 36% of White women
   consumed 5 servings of FV servings per clay. Fruit and vegetable (FV)
   intake was associated with acculturation, education, and smoking status.
   Being more acculturated was associated with lower consumption of FVs
   among MAs, while having a higher education and no smoking was associated
   with higher intakes of FV servings among NHWs. Public health efforts to
   improve the intake of FVs among MA wornen should be sensitive to their
   acculturation status.

   identified mental health care as an area of need, a community-research
   partnership was formed that resulted in the adaptation of an
   intervention for children who have trauma-related symptoms from violence
   exposure. This participatory research partnership includes St. Thomas
   the Apostle School and Church community; QueensCare Health and Faith
   Partnership, an organization that provides health services and outreach
   to faith communities; and mental health researchers from UCLA. During
   the planning phase of this project, parent focus groups were conclucted,
   and an evidence-based intervention for traumatized students was adapted
   for this community. Focus group participants described significant
   concerns about community violence and multiple ways in which this
   ongoing violence has affected their children's functioning and
   child-parent relationships. The partnership has collaborated on each
   aspect of the research study, from design and adaptation, implementation
   data analyses, and identification of areas for future research. This

AB The Licensed Acupuncture Collaborative Study, a job analysis of licensed
   acupuncturists in California, provides a model for building
   community-research partnerships between university researchers and
   communities of non-physician clinicians. The study design used a
   project-management approach based on the core principles of
   community-based participatory research: 1) mobilizing shared expertise
   and resources to address issues of concern; 2) sharing power in the
   decision-making process; and 3) promoting mutual ownerships of resources
   and products derived from the collaboration. A project infrastructure
   involving the sharing of study responsibilities across university
   researchers, individual acupuncturists, and state community
   organizations was developed and cultivated over a three-year project
   period. Essential factors in the success of this project included shared
   objectives, addressing the concerns about collaboration among academic
   and community partners, inclusion of nontraditional viewpoints about
   healthcare policy, and participation by the acupuncturist community in
   performing the research. These activities helped to overcome mistrust
   and perceived power differences between researchers and the
   acupuncturist community.

AB Objectives: This study describes the perceptions of racism, passive and
   active responses to this psychosocial stressor, and it examines
   socioeconomic correlates of perceived racism in an economically diverse
   population of Black women.
   Methods: The Telephone-Administered Perceived Racism Scale was
   administered to 476 Black women, aged 36 to 53 years, who were randomly
   selected from a large health plan.
   Results: The percentage of respondents who reported personally
   experiencing racism in the past five years ranged from 66% to 93%,
   depending on the specific item asked. When respondents were asked about
   racism toward Blacks as a group, perceptions of racism were even higher.
   For example, 68% "agreed" or "strongly agreed" that. they had personally
   experienced being followed or watched while shopping because of their
   race, and 93%, reported that Blacks in general experience this form of
   discrimination. Strong emotional responses to racism were often
   reported, and though more respondents (41%) reported experiencing very
   strong active emotions including anger, a substantial group (16%)
   reported experiencing very strong passive emotions such as
   powerlessness. Higher education was associated with higher perceived
   racism, while growing up in a middle-income or well-off family was
   associated with lower perceived racism and reduced likelihood of passive
   responses to racism.
   Conclusions: The high prevalence of perceived racism ill this Study
   population warrants further examination of this stressor as a potential
   determinant of racial health disparities. Higher education and income do
   not appear to protect women from experiencing racism and feeling
   hopeless or powerless in response.

AB Objectives: The goal of this study was to develop systems interventions
   in a public school district using community-based participatory research
   (CBPR) methods to improve the social and academic functioning of
   children from racial and ethnic minority populations.
   Design: The study used qualitative methods in the process of problem
   definition and intervention planning, including in-depth qualitative
   interviews and stakeholder dialogue groups. The study was conducted at
   three levels-the school system as a whole, two individual schools, and a
   multiple-stakeholder participatory group.
   Setting: The study took place in a public school system in an urban city
   with a population of 101,355 and in two public schools located in this
   city.
   Participants: The CBPR team included two researchers, a
   researcher/consulting psychiatrist in the schools, the director of the
   special education office, her management team, four teachers, and two
   school-based administrators.
   Interventions: The CBPR group engaged in a process of problem definition
   and intervention planning at all three levels of the system. In
   addition, both schools initiated systems interventions to target the
   needs of their school environments.
   Results: The project led to system interventions at both schools,
   clarity about the policy constraints to effective collaboration, and
   increased awareness regarding the behavioral and academic needs of
   minority children in the schools. The process produced a series of
   questions to use as a framework in CBPR partnership development.
   Conclusions: The CBPR approach can expand the scope of mental-health
   services research, particularly related to services for racial and
   ethnic minorities.

AB Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to examine the ability
   of Black racial identity to mediate cardiovascular reactivity to racism.
   The Multidimensional Model of Racial Identity (MMRI), which consists Of
   four dimensions, salience, centrality, regard, and ideology was used to
   define Black racial identity. The subdimensions of ideology are
   oppressed minority, nationalist, humanist, and assimilationist racial
   identities.
   Design and Methods: Heart rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, and blood
   pressure were measured in 72 African-American men as they viewed a
   videotaped scene depicting racial profiling and a neutral scene. We
   hypothesized that individuals with high levels of Black-oriented
   identities (centrality, public regard, private regard, oppressed
   minority, and nationalist) would be less stressed by the racial
   profiling scenes than those low in these identities. In addition, we
   predicted that individuals with high levels of non-Black-oriented
   identities (assimilationist, humanist) would be more stressed by the
   racial profiling scenes than those with low levels of these identities.
   Results: Private regard, humanist, and assimilationist racial identities
   were significantly associated with increased cardiovascular reactivity
   to the scenes. Specifically, private regard significantly predicted
   cardiac output and stroke volume responses to the scenes. In addition,
   assimilationist and humanist racial identities were associated with
   greater blood output and faster heart rates in response to the scenes.
   Conclusions: Although private regard (Black oriented) and
   assimilationist and humanist (non-Black oriented) racial identities
   showed elevated cardiovascular reactivity to the scenes, the underlying
   mechanisms of these associations may differ.

AB Recommendations for reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health and
   health care suggest that clinical researchers try community-based
   participatory research (CBPR). While the body of literature discussing
   the ethics of CBPR continues to grow, we are not aware of a specific
   attempt to provide a structure for analyzing the ethics of clinical
   research using a CBPR approach. We adapt a framework developed by
   Emanuel, Wendler, and Grady articulating seven requirements for ethical
   clinical research to clinical research using a CBPR approach. We
   incorporate findings from the literature on CBPR and identify some of
   the ethical and practical challenges from our experiences working in
   CBPR as academics and community members.
   We find Emanuel et al's framework easily adaptable for CBPR. Six of the
   requirements are flexible enough to accommodate the needs of CBPR; they
   are: social or scientific value, scientific validity, fair subject
   selection, favorable risk-benefit ratio, independent review, and
   informed consent; We suggest that the seventh requirement, respect for
   potential and enrolled participants, be amended to respect for potential
   and enrolled participants, community, and research partners to
   acknowledge that separate attention should be paid to relationships on
   these three levels.
   This adapted framework can guide community-academic partnerships as they
   evaluate whether to proceed with potential clinical research studies and
   as they work to enhance the ethics of clinical research studies using a
   CBPR approach.

AB This paper describes a study currently underway that uses a
   collaborative approach to assess organizational capacity to form
   partnerships around mental health and substance abuse care. Employing
   many of the principles of community-based participatory research, the
   study's primary objective is to collaboratively develop a conceptual
   understanding and generalizable, practical measures of organizational
   capacity. The intent of this collaborative approach is to increase the
   rigor and relevance of the assessment framework while strengthening the
   ability of health partnerships and stakeholders to understand and track
   community organizational capacity. The study investigators developed an
   initial model of community dissemination based on the research
   literatures on organizations and the diffusion of innovations. Through
   the collaborative process, the specific goals of the project shifted
   substantially to match the partnership interests and concerns of
   community agencies. One of the benefits of a collaborative approach has
   been to use researchers' academic knowledge to catalogue potential
   factors and the wealth of community co-investigators' experiential
   knowledge of interagency dynamics to identify specific relevant
   dimensions of capacity. This initial exploratory study represents a
   first step toward developing a general approach to conceptualizing and
   tracking the organizational capacity of communities. The model and
   measurement framework may have wider applicability to capacities to
   partner around and implement a variety of health-related interventions
   within communities.

AB Women of minority race/ethnicity have been underrepresented in United

   between 1966 and 2004 were done with priority given to recent reports
   (1996-2004), and references from bibliographies of relevant articles.
   Large chemoprevention trials have reported significant breast cancer
   risk reduction and increased risk of serious adverse events in
   tamoxifen-treated, high-risk women, which illustrates the need to
   carefully assess the risk/benefits of this therapy. The mathematical
   model used for this purpose in the United States-based trials has
   resulted in the inclusion of very few women of minority racial/ethnic
   backgrounds. The continued use of this risk assessment that has not been
   adequately validated for its usefulness in non-Caucasian populations,
   should be reviewed, especially given that adequate alternative
   nonmathematical models exist. Current and future chemoprevention trials
   should also use nonmathematical selection criteria to ensure that
   eligible underrepresented minorities are adequately included in these
   trials.

   and Native-American women.
   Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted by Surveying
   Hispanic and Native-American women. The survey was developed with the
   constructs Of the Preventive Health Model and was designed to assess
   background characteristics, representation factors, social influence
   factors, and program factors among Hispanic and Native-American females.
   Participants: Hispanic (n = 48) and Native-American (n = 68) women aged
   18 to 89 years.
   Setting: The Surveys were distributed in several community health event
   sites throughout the Kansas City Metropolitan Area.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary response (dependant) variables
   include knowledge, cervical screening intentions, and perceptions
   regarding the use of the Pap test.
   Results: Most of the women surveyed (97%) had heard about Pap testing
   and reported having had a Pap test. Abnormal Pap test results were
   reported by 36% of the respondents. Acculturation and less income were
   significant factors in whether respondents could afford a Pap test, had
   health insurance, had a regular healthcare provider, and worried that a
   Pap test would uncover cervical cancer. Income was additionally related
   to having a doctor recommend Pap testing, the ability to get to the
   doctors' office during office hours, and fear of a cervical cancer
   diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Acculturation (or language) and income were determinants of
   Pap screening behavior among Native-American and Hispanic women.

AB Purpose: This study's primary objective was to describe colorectal
   cancer (CRC) screening disparities using a guideline-derived definition
   of CRC screening adherence while controlling for confounding factors
   associated with CRC screening.
   Methods: This secondary data analysis of the 2000 National Health
   Interview Survey (NHIS) included 12,677 individuals age 50 years. The
   primary outcome assessed was adherence to CRC screening guidelines,
   defined as a sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy within the last five years,
   colonoscopy within the last 10 years, or home fecal occult blood test
   within the last 12 months. Age, race/ethnicity, gender, physical
   disability, household income, insurance status, education level,
   marriage status, rural or urban geographic area, and family history of
   CRC were analyzed as covariates in a logistic regression model. We
   assessed the association between these sociodemographic variables and
   receipt of physician recommendation for CRC screening among those
   respondents not adherent to CRC screening recommendations.
   Results: in the multivariate model, the odds for being adherent with
   current. CRC screening recommendations were lower for Hispanics (odds
   ratio [OR] 0.71, 95%, confidence interval [Cl] 0.59-0.86) and African
   Americans (OR 0.82, 95% Cl 0.71-0.95) than for Whites. Residents Of
   urban areas had higher odds (OR 1.19, 95% Cl 1.06-1.34) of being
   up-to-date than rural residents. Among subjects who were not up-to-date
   with CRC screening, similar disparities were noted in receipt of
   physician recommendation for CRC screening.
   Conclusions: Certain groups are at increased risk of not receiving CRC
   screening or recommendations for screening from their physicians.
   Interventions to reduce these disparities should be an integral part of
   overall efforts to improve CRC prevention and control.

AB Since 1984, when Cole and Zuckerman referred to gender differences in
   productivity among academic scientists as a puzzle, sociologists have
   sought to explain these differences by incorporating primarily
   institutional-level factors. In addition to these factors, the author
   contends that an undertheorized and heretofore unmeasured concept-the
   extent of research specialization-can also help explain the process by
   which gender affects research productivity. Although some researchers
   have examined areas of specialization, the extent of research
   specialization has been completely neglected in studies of academic
   careers. Using a probability sample of academics in two disciplines
   (sociology and linguistics), primary data collection, and simultaneous
   equation modeling, the author finds that the extent of research
   specialization is a critical intervening variable: Women specialize less
   than men and thereby lose out on an important means of increasing their
   productivity.

   literature would be observed in a sample of youth athletes, and (b) to
   examine potential achievement goal orientation profile differences on
   perceptions of the motivational climate, perceptions of peer
   relationships, and motivation-related responses. Male soccer players (n
   = 223) aged 9 - 12 years (mean 10.9, s 0.6) completed a multi-section
   questionnaire containing assessments of dispositional goal (task, ego)
   orientations, the perceived task- and ego-involving features of the
   motivational climate, perceived peer acceptance and friendship quality
   (positive friendship quality, conflict), perceived ability, soccer
   enjoyment, and satisfaction with one's performance and the team. Four
   profiles were observed that closely matched those observed by Hodge and
   Petlichkoff (2000), though in the present study a lower proportion of
   participants exhibited achievement goal profiles consisting of
   relatively high ego orientation. Achievement goal profile differences
   were found for all variables except positive friendship quality, with a
   general trend for those reporting relatively lower task goal orientation
   to exhibit less adaptive responses. Overall, the findings support
   achievement goal frameworks (e.g. Nicholls, 1989) and suggest that
   further examination of dispositional achievement goals may afford a
   deeper understanding of social relationships and motivational processes
   in youth sport.

AB Society faces a growing challenge in the management of zoonotic wildlife
   diseases. Unique attributes of zoonotic diseases and the shifting
   sociocultural contexts within which diseases are experienced create
   serious challenges for managers. We address 2 critical questions: how do
   uncertainty and severity associated with a zoonotic disease relate to
   public management attitudes and preferences, and do immigrant attitudes
   and preferences differ from those of long-term residents in rural areas
   of the Intermountain West? We addressed these questions using a
   personally administered questionnaire in Teton County, Idaho, USA. Based
   on 2 hypothetical zoonotic wildlife diseases, one less severe and more
   known (type A) and one more severe and less known (type B), we asked
   respondents to indicate their agreement with 13 statements regarding
   their perception of the disease and management preferences. We also
   asked respondents to indicate their support for different groups
   controlling management. Our compliance rate was 95% (n = 416, sampling
   error +/- 4.8%). Respondents considered type B a greater risk to human
   and livestock health, and supported using lethal control methods, except
   hunting, to control it. Disease type, however, had less impact on public
   support for management options involving fencing and supplemental
   feeding. With only 2 exceptions, longer-term residents (LTR) supported
   lethal management options more than newer residents (NR). Further, NR
   hunted less than LTR, thereby restricting lethal management options.
   Respondents indicated some level of support for all management control
   options except giving authority to local civic leaders. Newer residents
   showed higher support for wildlife scientists and federal agencies
   making management decisions, whereas LTR preferred state livestock
   agencies. Demographic change in rural areas may lead to higher levels of
   support for federal and scientific control over zoonotic disease
   management but lower support for lethal management and ability to enact
   lethal management. Our results suggest 2 critical management needs:
   solicitation and consideration of public input for type A zoonotic
   disease management and promotion of hunting or developing a viable
   lethal management alternative.

   discipline, low parental communication, and low parental praise and
   encouragement. These associations remained significant when parental
   gender, offspring gender, and co-occurring parental disorders were
   controlled statistically. Parental anxiety disorders were independently
   associated with parental possessiveness. Parents with personality
   disorders were substantially more likely than parents without
   personality disorders to report engaging in multiple problematic child
   rearing behaviors. This association was not moderated by co-occurring
   parental disorders. These findings suggest that the presence of a
   parental personality disorder may be associated with an elevated
   likelihood of problematic parenting behavior during the child rearing
   years.

AB Routes to economic development attract considerable attention in
   community and rural sociology. Social scientists draw increasingly on
   studies of social capital and environmental surroundings as they examine
   the factors that facilitate and inhibit economic development. However,
   few empirical analyses exist that analyze the impact of the combination
   of social infrastructure and natural capital on different forms of
   economic development such as on industrial recruitment and
   self-development. Using data collected from six communities in
   Washington State, the interaction of a community's social infrastructure
   and natural capital on industrial recruitment and self-development
   efforts is examined. Results suggest that while natural capital
   positively impacts a community's successful recruitment of outside
   industries, it is not significant for a community's level of
   self-development. However, a community's social infrastructure, measured
   by the existence of active civic organizations, local businesses that
   support local community projects, community-wide fund-raising capacity,
   and extra-local linkages to nearby communities, state, and national
   agencies, positively affects both industrial recruitment and
   self-development. These findings illustrate the need for communities and
   local activists to carefully weigh their advantages and potential
   shortcomings when deciding on an economic development strategy.

AB Research on quality of life in sociology is largely focused on a narrow
   range of dimensions including affect, happiness and satisfaction. It
   largely avoids a concern with the meanings that provide people with the
   purpose, significance, validity and coherence that are a basis of social
   relationships and social integration. Evidence is presented that people
   experience lowered affect in some challenging and stressful situations
   that simultaneously generate meanings that enhance the quality of their
   lives, and that experiences of high affect along with impoverished
   meanings produce low quality of life. This strongly suggests that
   meaning may be a more fundamental dimension of life quality than is
   affect. Meanings may also enhance the quality of life by motivating
   people's involvement in activities that promote social integration and
   the quality of social relationships. Sociologists should work to further
   develop the theoretical and empirical basis of quality of life so that
   it more fully includes dimensions that reflect the meanings that provide
   purpose and significance in people's lives.

AB This article uses the puzzle of diverging trajectories of immigrant
   citizenship in the United States and Canada to build a new approach to
   the study of citizenship and political incorporation. I consider three
   existing models of citizenship: an approach that considers citizenship
   adoption as the product of cost/benefit calculations; an approach that
   understands individuals and groups to be differentially endowed with the
   skills, resources and interests necessary to acquire citizenship; and an
   approach that believes countries adopt citizenship regimes which either
   include or shut out immigrants. I then offer an alternative model of
   structured mobilization which views political incorporation as a social
   process of mobilization by friends, family, community organizations and
   local leaders that is embedded in an institutional context shaped by
   government policies of diversity and newcomer settlement. The material
   and symbolic resources provided by government shape the ability and
   interest of "social helpers" to assist with and mobilize around
   citizenship. The article concludes by considering the implications of
   structured mobilization for various debates in immigration and political
   sociology.

AB Each workplace operates within a cultural context in which local
   features of interaction influence how employees conceptualize their
   workplace self. Building on small-group research, I argue that
   understanding these idiocultures as action arenas helps to specify how
   group knowledge, practices, and beliefs are expressed and affect
   occupational identity. To demonstrate the power of microcultures, I
   analyzed local offices of the National Weather Service (NWS) through
   ethnographic methods. I focused on the Chicago office, demonstrating how
   its culture, which emphasizes autonomy and resistance to authority,
   shapes the staff's images of scientific practice and the contours of
   being a scientist. The culture is revealed in their joking relations as
   well as in other office traditions. I then compared this culture with
   that of Flowerland, a spin-up office established in the 1990s. These two
   offices use their cultures to differentiate themselves, creating
   distinct work practices. As all work groups have local cultures, giving
   greater attention to small-group dynamics helps us understand how
   workers define themselves, how cultures differ, and how the effects of
   these differences shape the experience of work.

AB This article examines historical transformations of Japanese collective
   memory of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by utilizing a theoretical
   framework that combines a model of reiterated problem solving and a
   theory of cultural trauma. I illustrate how the event of the nuclear
   fallout in March 1954 allowed actors to consolidate previously
   fragmented commemorative practices into a master frame to define the
   postwar Japanese identity in terms of transnational commemoration of
   "Hiroshima." I also show that nationalization of trauma of "Hiroshima"
   involved a shift from pity to sympathy in structures of feeling about
   the event. This historical study suggests that a reiterated
   problem-solving approach can be efficacious in analyzing how
   construction of national memory of a traumatic event connects with the
   recurrent reworking of national identity, on the one hand, and how a
   theory of cultural trauma can be helpful in exploring a synthesis of
   psychological and sociological approaches to commemoration of a
   traumatic event, on the other.

   psychiatrist Dr. Diane McLean, uses photography and video interviews to
   explore the lived experiences of people affected with genetic
   conditions. Positive Exposure challenges pervasive social biases and
   stereotypes about genetic variation and strives to broaden and enrich
   societal perceptions of human beauty and spirit. Presented here are the
   open-ended personal reflections completed by four individuals with
   craniofacial differences recruited from a support group, Inner Faces.
   These four case studies aim to relay the professional photo-shoot
   experiences of people who maybe challenged by the stigma associated with
   craniofacial differences. Questions addressed issues of perceived
   self-esteem, stigma, hopefulness, and photography experiences. These
   personal reflections were gathered 1 year following participation in a
   Positive Exposure photo-shoot. Participants described the ways in which
   the photo-shoot has been a lasting and life-promoting experience. In
   addition, these individuals emphasize the integral and enduring role the
   photographer, Rick Guidotti, played in their personal awakening.
   Positive Exposure provided these individuals with renewed identification
   of both inner and outer sources of beauty. These four case studies
   suggest that Positive Exposure may serve as a sustainable intervention
   to bolster self-esteem and self-image. Published 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB The National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 requires U.S. National
   Forests to develop Forest Plans every 15 years to guide their actions on
   the forest. The 1982 NFMA implementation regulations require the Forest
   Plans to provide for "species viability." Throughout the 1980s, plans
   were written to meet this charge. In the Pacific Northwest, many plans
   were subsequently challenged on their ability to provide for species
   viability; ad hoc science groups were then commissioned to assess the
   plans relative to the viability standard. The ad hoc groups universally
   concluded that the plans provided inadequate species protection, and
   recommended major management changes based primarily on decreases in
   timber production. The Northwest Forest Plan and the Interior Columbia
   Basin Ecosystem Management Plan were both developed, in part, from ad
   hoc science teams' recommendations. Through interviews and an
   examination of numerous Forest Plans, we explore how two such divergent
   outcomes could result from the same set of planning regulations. Four
   propositions are discussed: (1) The planners and ad hoc science groups
   characterized risk differently. (2) The ad hoc science groups raised the
   bar relative to what was needed to ensure protection. (3) The agency was
   not able to introduce change into its own organization. (4) Changing
   social values and increased appeals to the court system forced a change
   in the agency's priorities. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

   with first-hand experience with certification, i.e., forest management
   certificate holders, report that certification does not operate as a

AB The absence of individual-level socioeconomic information in most US

   measures (ABSMs) to monitor health inequalities. Using the 1989-1991
   birth weight data from Massachusetts, the authors compared estimates of
   health disparities detected with census tract- and block group-level
   ABSMs pertaining to poverty and education, as well as parental
   education, both independently and together. In separate models, adjusted
   for infant's sex, mother's age, and parents' race/ethnicity, worst-off
   categories of census tract ABSMs and parental education had a comparable
   birth weight deficit of similar to 70 g. Similar results were observed
   for low birth weight (< 2,500 g), with worst-off categories of census
   tract ABSMs and parental education having an odds ratio of similar to
   1.37 (p < 0.001). In mutually adjusted models for birth weight and low
   birth weight, census tract ABSMs still detected an effect estimate
   nearly 50% of that detected by parental education. Additionally, census
   tract ABSMs detected socioeconomic gradients in birth weight among
   births to mothers aged less than 25 years, an age group in which
   educational attainment is unlikely to be completed. These results
   suggest that aptly chosen ABSMs can be used to monitor socioeconomic
   inequalities in health. The risk, if any, in the absence of
   individual-level socioeconomic information is a conservative estimate of
   socioeconomic inequalities in health.

   Hispanic patients, in a population of medical students at a historically
   black medical college.
   Study design: The modified clinical culture competency questionnaire
   tapped demographic, self-perceived knowledge, skills,
   encounter-situations, attitudes, education, and training of medical
   students. The survey was administered on a course management system. The
   Hispanic health knowledge questionnaire measured student knowledge of
   Hispanic culture.
   Results: The response rate was 51%. No significant gender or racial
   differences were noted. First-year medical students were more skilled in
   managing sociocultural issues (40.07 vs 33.70; P = .0089) and less
   skilled in education and training (1.35 vs 0.57; P = .0222) than
   second-year students. All students scored below the 60th percentile on

   Conclusion: These data point to the importance of cultural competency
   training in Hispanic health and may be used to develop an educational

   data were collected from three Late Chachapoya samples (Laguna
   Huayabamba, Kuelap, and Laguna de los Condores), in order to understand
   the genetic relationships between the groups and facilitate our
   understanding of Late Chachapoya population structure. Genetic
   differentiation among these series ranged from 0.047 (heritability =
   1.0) to 0.090 (heritability = 0.55). The Relethford-Blangero residuals
   indicate that the Laguna Huayabamba and Laguna de los Condores
   populations were receiving greater than average external gene flow,
   while Kuelap was receiving less than average external gene flow. The
   correspondence between biological and archaeological data in the

AB Background The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
   Organizations is proposing that hospitals measure culture beginning in
   2007. However, a reliable and widely used measurement tool for the
   operating room (OR) setting does not currently exist.
   Methods: OR personnel in 60 US hospitals were surveyed using the Safety
   Attitudes Questionnaire. The teamwork climate domain of the survey uses
   six items about difficulty speaking up, conflict resolution,
   physician-nurse collaboration, feeling supported by others, asking
   questions, and heeding nurse input. To justify grouping individual-level
   responses to a single score at each hospital OR level, the authors used
   a multilevel confirmatory factor analysis, intraclass correlations,
   within-group interrater reliability, and Cronbach's alpha. To detect
   differences at the hospital OR level and by caregiver type, the authors
   used multivariate analysis of variance (items) and analysis of variance
   (scale).
   Results: The response rate was 77.1%. There was robust evidence for
   grouping individual-level respondents to the hospital OR level using the
   diverse set of statistical tests, e.g., Comparative Fit Index = 0.99,
   root mean squared error of approximation = 0.05, and acceptable

AB Context: Exploratory studies that generate testable models of how risk
   factors for childhood mental health problems work together over time are
   critical for developing effective prevention and treatment strategies.
   Objective: To build models addressing the following 2 questions: (1) How
   early can we identify children at risk for mental health problems in
   third grade? (2) How do the risk factors work together over time?
   Design and Participants: We assessed a Wisconsin community sample 8
   times, beginning during pregnancy. Three hundred seventy-nine families
   completed multi-informant reports (mothers, teachers, and children) of
   children's mental health symptoms in third grade.
   Main Outcome Measures: Symptom severity and directionality
   (externalizing vs internalizing).
   Results: The hypothesis was generated that family socioeconomic status
   (SES) defined different pathways to symptom severity. In low/middle SES
   families, children were at risk if their mothers were distressed during
   the infancy period, which was then associated with more generalized
   maternal and child distress and dysregulation during the preschool
   period. In high SES families, the picture was more complex, beginning
   with parental histories of depression and family psychopathology, which
   then led to greater family stress in the infancy period and maternal and
   child distress and dysregulation during the preschool period. For all
   children, social and academic impairment during the school transition
   was an important mediator. Two pathways to later symptom directionality
   consisted of one beginning with child sex and the other with child
   temperament.
   Conclusions: Most risk factors predicted symptom severity and not
   directionality. The risk factors for internalizing and externalizing
   problems may be much the same, and the same preventive interventions
   might be effective for both classes of problems. Furthermore, at risk
   children from high SES families might be identifiable as early as
   infancy, whereas those from lower SES families may be identifiable only
   as preschoolers.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship between residential change and a
   woman's subsequent risk of intimate partner violence (IPV), whether by a
   past or a new offender, a relationship that has not been prospectively
   examined to date.
   Design: A dynamic cohort of women who recently changed residence
   (movers) was compared with those who did not (non-movers) for 12-month
   risk of IPV by a past offender and of IPV by a new offender.
   Participants and methods: Secondary analysis of a linked, longitudinal
   National Crime Victimization Survey dataset including 10 754 recent
   movers and 10 236 non-movers among women aged 18-44 years.
   Results: The risk of IPV by either a past or a new offender was almost
   double for women who had recently moved compared with those who had not
   moved. This increased risk proved to be robust, as it persisted when the
   data were weighted and unweighted, and when the main effect was adjusted
   by measured covariates.
   Conclusions: The apparent increase in IPV risk after residential change
   may be a marker of a pre-existing problem or a precursor of subsequent
   problems. Unlike past research that has considered residential change
   after abuse or as a simultaneous exposure, this study focused solely on
   empirically measuring the risk of IPV after a recent move. This decision
   has important public health ramifications: determination of IPV exposure
   is not always possible, whereas soliciting a woman's history of
   residence may be more feasible. If transience puts a woman at greater
   risk for victimisation by an intimate partner, increased awareness may
   have a vital role in protecting women who move.

   as darker than White faces, so in the current experiments, an adjustment
   methodology was used to test the degree to which expectations about the
   relative skin tone associated with faces of varying races affect the
   perceived lightness of those faces. White faces were consistently judged
   to be relatively lighter than Black faces, even for racially ambiguous
   faces that were disambiguated by labels. Accordingly, relatively
   abstract expectations about the relative reflectance of objects can
   affect their perceived lightness.

AB This study examined the effects of leaving home and going to college on
   changes in the frequency of alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and
   marijuana use shortly after leaving high school. We also examined how
   protective factors in late adolescence predict post-high school
   substance use and moderate the effects of leaving home and going to
   college. Method: Data came from subjects (N = 319; 53% male) interviewed
   at the end of 12th grade and again approximately 6 months later, as part
   of the Raising Healthy Children project. Results: Leaving home and going
   to college were significantly related to increases in the frequency of
   alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking from high school to emerging
   adulthood but not to changes in marijuana use. Having fewer friends who
   used each substance protected against increases in the frequency of
   alcohol use, heavy episodic drinking, and marijuana use. Higher
   religiosity protected against increases in alcohol- and marijuana-use
   frequency. Higher parental monitoring protected against increases in
   heavy episodic drinking and moderated the effect of going to college on
   marijuana use. Lower sensation seeking lessened the effect of going to
   college on increases in alcohol use and heavy episodic drinking.
   Conclusions: To prevent increases in substance use in emerging
   adulthood, interventions should concentrate on strengthening prosocial
   involvement and parental monitoring during high school. In addition,
   youths with high sensation seeking might be targeted for added
   intervention.

PD NOV 2006

AB Objective: An 18-site randomized trial was conducted to determine the
   effectiveness of social norms marketing (SNM) campaigns in reducing
   college student drinking. The SNM campaigns are intended to correct
   misperceptions of subjective drinking norms and thereby drive down
   alcohol consumption. Method: Institutions of higher education were
   randomly assigned to treatment and control groups. At the treatment
   group institutions, SNM campaigns delivered school-specific, data-driven
   messages through a mix of campus media venues. Cross-sectional student
   surveys were conducted by mail at baseline (n = 2,771) and at posttest 3
   years later (n = 2,939). Hierarchical linear modeling was applied to
   examine multiple drinking outcomes, taking intraclass correlation into
   account. Results: Controlling for other predictors, having an SNM
   campaign was significantly associated with lower perceptions of student
   drinking levels and lower alcohol consumption, as measured by a
   composite drinking scale, recent maximum consumption, blood alcohol
   concentration for recent maximum consumption, drinks consumed when
   partying, and drinks consumed per week. A moderate mediating effect of
   normative perceptions on student drinking was demonstrated by an
   attenuation of the Experimental Group x Time interaction, ranging from
   16.4% to 39.5% across measures. Additional models that took into account
   the intensity of SNM campaign activity at the treatment institutions
   suggested that there was a dose-response relationship. Conclusions: This
   study is the most rigorous evaluation of SNM campaigns conducted to
   date. Analysis revealed that students attending institutions that
   implemented an SNM campaign had a lower relative risk of alcohol
   consumption than students attending control group institutions.

   being waged for reasons obscure to many of its potential victims. The
   term "NBCs" was coined in reference to terrorist weapons of mass
   destruction, i.e., nuclear, biological and chemical. The currently
   accepted acronym is "CBRNE" which includes Chemical, Biological,
   Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive weapons. Non-nuclear explosives are
   the most common terrorist weapon now in use. Nuclear and radiological
   weapons are beyond the scope of this publication, which focuses on the
   "CBEs", i.e. chemical, biological and explosive weapons.
   Although neurologists will not be the first responders to CBEs, they
   must know about the neurological effects in order to provide diagnosis
   and treatment to survivors. Neurological complications of chemical,
   biological and explosive weapons which have or may be used by terrorists
   are reviewed by international experts in this publication. Management
   and treatment profiles are outlined. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier B.V.

   depicted 40 years ago, I seek to highlight the changes the Internet has
   brought to our everyday lives. I argue that the spread of the Internet
   has altered the conditions of interpersonal contact, as well as the
   realms of the lifeworld in which we live. Specifically, the Internet has
   created a new spatiotemporal zone-the zone of the "there and now," a new
   mode of communication-the electronic text chat, and a new social
   gathering place-the online public domain. These creations have in turn
   contributed to the rise of the realm of "consociated contemporaries,"
   the formation of a new matrix of social contact, the maintenance of the
   subjective reality through text chat, and the involvement of the online
   world in the socialization process. In light of such changes, I join
   those who call for a revision of the existing sociological stance on
   human interaction.

AB In this work I argue that the study of deviance as distinct from crime
   is no longer a productive specialty in sociology. I attribute the cause
   of the demise of the field to its over reliance on the assumption of
   cultural relativity. In contrast to the relativist position, I argue
   that behavior that causes harm will be more likely to be condemned by
   public opinion and that there will be less variation in attitudes toward
   behaviors that cause more harm. Using data from the General Social
   Survey, I find support for the hypothesis that a "deviant" sexual
   behavior that can have a victim, extramarital sex, will be more
   consensually condemned than "deviant" sexual behaviors that do not have
   victims, premarital sex and homosexual sex. I recommend that future
   research focus on the study of values, as the validity of cultural
   relativity can be empirically evaluated.

AB We measured timber harvesting attitudes (THA) of the American public and
   explored the social bases of these THA by conducting a national random
   digit dial telephone survey over 2 years (2003 and 2004). We developed
   three reliable subscales to measure timber harvesting attitudes. Results
   of this study indicate that, in general, the public is not opposed to
   timber harvesting, particularly for economic and utilitarian reasons and
   as a management tool. Analyses of the social bases of THA revealed that
   the effects of individual demographic characteristics on timber
   harvesting attitudes varied with motivations for the harvest. While
   support for harvesting for present benefits differed across categories
   of income, education, and between republicans and democrats, support for
   timber harvesting for economic reasons differed across income classes.
   Support for harvesting as a management tool differed between those who
   are religious and those who are not. Congruent with previous research,
   attitudes of the general public do not differ from those of forestland
   owners. This research provides key findings regarding the public's THA
   and offers a novel framework through which public attitudes toward
   timber harvesting may be assessed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB The emergence and abundance of cooperation in nature poses a tenacious
   and challenging puzzle to evolutionary biology. Cooperative behaviour
   seems to contradict Darwinian evolution because altruistic individuals
   increase the fitness of other members of the population at a cost to
   themselves. Thus, in the absence of supporting mechanisms, cooperation
   should decrease and vanish, as predicted by classical models for
   cooperation in evolutionary game theory, such as the Prisoner's Dilemma
   and public goods games. Traditional approaches to studying the problem
   of cooperation assume constant population sizes and thus neglect the
   ecology of the interacting individuals. Here, we incorporate ecological
   dynamics into evolutionary games and reveal a new mechanism for
   maintaining cooperation. In public goods games, cooperation can gain a
   foothold if the population density depends on the average population
   payoff. Decreasing population densities, due to defection leading to
   small payoffs, results in smaller interaction group sizes in which
   cooperation can be favoured. This feedback between ecological dynamics
   and game dynamics can generate stable coexistence of cooperators and
   defectors in public goods games. However, this mechanism fails for
   pairwise Prisoner's Dilemma interactions and the population is driven to
   extinction. Our model represents natural extension of replicator
   dynamics to populations of varying densities.

AB According to Beck's cognitive theory of depression, autonomy (high
   achievement concerns) and sociotropy (high interpersonal concerns) are
   vulnerability factors for depression when achievement or interpersonal
   stressors, respectively, are experienced. This hypothesis was tested
   among men and women attempting to quit smoking, an achievement stressor
   that can provoke depressive symptoms. Smokers recruited from the
   community (N=210) provided information about their quit attempt through
   mailed questionnaires. For the 48-h period following the quit,
   relationships among autonomy, sociotropy, coping, depressive symptoms
   and lapsing were assessed. Structural equation models supported the
   trait-congruence hypothesis because greater autonomy, but not
   sociotropy, was associated with elevated depressive symptoms among both
   men and women smokers. However, results were stronger for men (beta=.47,
   p=.0001) than for women (beta=.20, p=.05). After accounting for
   autonomy's relationship with depressive symptoms, greater autonomy was
   inversely associated with lapsing among men (beta=-.35,p=.01), but not
   women. Results point to the potential usefulness of a theoretical
   approach to understanding relationships between depressive symptoms and
   smoking cessation, and indicate that autonomous personality may be an
   important factor in smoking cessation in men. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

AB Background: A good understanding of the association between obesity and
   socioeconomic status (SES) has many important public health and policies
   implications, particularly for the prevention and management of obesity.
   Objective: ne objective was to examine secular trends in the relations
   between overweight (body mass index >= 95th percentile) and SES.
   Design: We examined secular trends in the relation between over-weight
   and SES using nationally representative data collected in the National
   Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) between 1971 and 2002
   for 30417 US children aged 2-18 y. Poverty income ratio tertiles at each
   survey were used to indicate low, middle, and high SES.
   Results: Considerable race, sex, and age differences were observed in
   the association between overweight and SES. A reverse association only
   existed in white girls; African American children with a high SES were
   at increased risk. Socioeconomic disparities in overweight have changed
   over time, with an overall trend of weakening. Compared with the
   medium-SES group, the adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs were 0.79 (0.47,
   1.33), 1.08 (0.73, 1.61), 1.24 (0.73, 2.09), and 1.04 (0.82. 1.33) in
   NHANES I, II, and III and in the 1999-2002 NHANES for the low-SES group
   and 0.66 (0.43, 1.00), 0.60 (0.35, 1.03), 0.42 (0.23, 0.76), and 0.99
   (0.68, 1.43) for the high-SES group, respectively. Between 1988-1994 and
   1999-2002, the ratio in the prevalence of overweight between adolescent
   boys with a low or high SES decreased from 2.5 to 1.1 and from 3.1 to
   1.6 in girls.
   Consistently across almost all SES groups, the prevalence of overweight
   was much higher in blacks than in whites. Conclusions: Complex patterns
   in the association between SES and overweight exist. Efforts solely
   targeting reductions in income disparities probably cannot effectively
   reduce racial disparities in obesity.

AB Objective. We assessed the association between intimate partner violence
   (IPV) perpetration and sexual risk behaviors and fatherhood (having
   fathered children) among young men.
   Methods. Sexually active men aged 18 to 35 years who visited an urban
   community health center and who reported having sexual intercourse with
   a steady female partner during the past 3 months (N = 283) completed a
   brief selfadministered survey about sexual risk behaviors, IPV
   perpetration, and demographics. We conducted logistic regression
   analyses adjusted for demographics to assess associations between IPV
   and sexual risk behaviors and fatherhood.
   Results. Participants were predominantly Hispanic (74.9%) and Black
   (21.9%). Participants who reported IPV perpetration during the past year
   (41.3%) were significantly more likely to report (1) inconsistent or no
   condom use during vaginal and anal sexual intercourse, (2) forcing
   sexual intercourse without a condom, (3) having sexual intercourse with
   other women, and (4) having fathered 3 or more children.
   Conclusion. IPV perpetration was common among our sample and was
   associated with increased sexual risk behaviors. Urban community health
   centers may offer an important venue for reaching this at-risk
   population.

TI Movements and memory: The making of the Stonewall myth
SO AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW

IS 5
BP 724
EP 751
PD OCT 2006
PY 2006
AB This article examines why the Stonewall riots became central to gay
   collective memory while other events did not. It does so through a
   comparative-historical analysis of Stonewall and four events similar to
   it that occurred in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York in the
   1960s. The Stonewall riots were remembered because they were the first
   to meet two conditions: activists considered the event commemorable and
   had the mnemonic capacity to create a commemorative vehicle. That this
   conjuncture occurred in New York in 1969, and not earlier or elsewhere,
   was a result of complex political developments that converged in this
   time and place. The success of the national commemorative ritual planned
   by New York activists depended on its resonance, not only in New York
   but also in other US. cities. Gay community members found Stonewall
   commemorable and the proposed parade an appealing form for
   commemoration. The parade was amenable to institutionalization, leading
   it to survive over time and spread around the world. The Stonewall story
   is thus an achievement of gay liberation rather than an account of its
   origins.

AB Background Evaluation of individuals at high genetic risk of
   schizophrenia is a powerful method for identifying precursors of the
   illness.
   Aims To identify aspects of personality, psychopathology and social
   development that differentiate high-risk and control individuals.
   Method Adolescent and young-adult first-degree relatives (n=35) of
   people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and a control
   group (n=55) were compared on 36 measures at baseline of a longitudinal
   study Measures differentiating high-risk and control participants were
   related to four genetic loading indices.
   Results High-risk participants older than 17 years showed more physical
   anhedonia, less positive involvement with peers and more problems with
   peers, siblings and the opposite gender. Older high-risk individuals
   also were less cooperative, less self-directed and less
   reward-dependent. Problems with peers and the opposite gender, as well
   as reward dependence, were related linearly to genetic loading.
   Conclusions Alterations in personality traits and social development are
   present in high-risk individuals, and may be markers for genetic
   liability toward the illness.

AB Purpose: Emerging genetic information and the availability of genetic
   testing has the potential to increase understanding of the disease and
   improve clinical management of some types of epilepsy. However, genetic
   testing is also likely to raise significant ethical, legal, and social
   issues for people with epilepsy, their family members, and their health
   care providers. We review the genetic and social dimensions of epilepsy
   relevant to understanding the complex questions raised by epilepsy
   genetics.
   Methods: We reviewed two literatures: (a) research on the genetics of
   epilepsy, and (b) social science research on the social experience and
   social consequences of epilepsy. For each, we note key empiric findings
   and discuss their implications with regard to the consequences of
   emerging genetic information about epilepsy. We also briefly review
   available principles and guidelines from professional and advocacy
   groups that might help to direct efforts to ascertain and address the
   ethical, legal, and social dimensions of genetic testing for epilepsy.
   Results: Genetic information about epilepsy may pose significant
   challenges for people with epilepsy and their family members. Although
   some general resources are available for navigating this complex new
   terrain, no guidelines specific to epilepsy have yet been developed to
   assist people with epilepsy, their family members, or their health care
   providers.
   Conclusions: Research is needed on the ethical, legal, and social
   concerns raised by genetic research on epilepsy and the advent of
   genetic testing. This research should include the perspectives of people
   with epilepsy and their family members, as well as those of health care
   professionals, policymakers, and bioethicists.

AB The American Fisheries Society sponsored a survey to examine the career
   development choices of men and women and how they might differ by
   gender. A random sample of 700 men and 700 women was selected from the
   AFS membership database. The survey was mailed out in October 2004 and
   991 questionnaires were returned for an adjusted response rate of 71%.
   Some differences exist between men and women in the areas of interest
   development, education, and employment, but the substantive differences
   occur in lifestyle choices. Women with a fisheries career are less
   likely to be married than men, even when age is controlled for, and
   women who are married are more likely to have dual-career considerations
   than their male counterparts. Among respondents without dependents in
   their home during their professional career, twice as many women as men
   think having children will adversely affect their career. For those with
   dependents, more than twice as many women as men said they had to put
   their career "on hold" because of their dependents. While AFS members do
   not represent all members of the fisheries profession, their experiences
   shed substantial light on the lifestyle choices likely faced by most
   members of the profession.

PY 2006
AB Objective: Our objective was to study factors related to eating
   patterns, specifically whether certain food cravings were associated
   with frequency of meals eaten away from home.
   Methods: Data were collected from 277 patients from a family medicine
   residency office in Arizona. The survey questionnaire included
   information about the respondents' demographics, socioeconomic status,
   food cravings, as well as, number of meals eaten away from home. The
   food craving inventory included foods in four categories identified by
   factor analysis: fast foods, carbohydrates, sweets and snacks. Data on
   food cravings were factor analyzed and scale scores were derived.
   Results: Being a Hispanic adult, working outside the home, and cravings
   for individual food items were related to eating more meals away from
   home. If the mother was working outside the home, the youngest child ate
   an average of two additional meals away from home each week. In general
   respondent's cravings for some specific food items were also related to
   higher numbers of meals their child ate away from home. Cravings for
   both fast food and snacks were positively correlated with adult eating
   out. None of the respondents' scale scores were related to child's
   eating away from home. Adults with Arizona Health Care Cost Containment
   System insurance (AHCCCS-a form of Medicaid) and older adults were less
   likely to eat away from home compared to patients with other types of
   insurance.
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and food cravings are
   related to adult and child patterns of eating meals away from home.

AB Heart disease is a leading cause of death across all populations in the
   United States. In 1985, the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority
   Health recognized the existence of widespread health disparities for
   heart disease and related risk factors among minorities in America.
   Inequalities in heart health and healthcare continue to exist. This
   review compares measures of heart disease and healthcare for white,
   African-American, Asian/Pacific Islander, American-Indian/Alaska-Native
   and Hispanic/Latino populations. Lack of healthcare data for minorities
   continues to be a barrier to understanding the nature and extent of
   heart disease and related risk factors for these groups. In combination
   with programs that address preventive measures to reduce risk factors
   for heart disease, the integration of quality improvement measures has
   developed as an important strategy for reducing cardiovascular health
   disparities. Improved data collection and reporting, enhanced use of
   information technology, and promotion of cultural competency hold
   potential for improving the quality of cardiac care and reducing health
   disease for all Americans.

AB BACKGROUND. The relationship between media exposure and school
   performance has not been studied extensively in adolescents.
   OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this work was to test the relative effects of
   television, movie, and video game screen time and content on adolescent
   school performance.
   METHODS. We conducted a population-based cross-sectional survey of
   middle school students (grades 5-8) in the Northeastern United States.
   We looked at weekday television and video game screen time, weekend
   television and video game screen time, cable movie channel availability,
   parental R-rated movie restriction, and television content restriction.
   The main outcome was self-report of school performance (excellent, good,
   average, or below average). We used ordinal logistic-regression analysis
   to test the independent effects of each variable, adjusting for
   demographics, child personality, and parenting style.
   RESULTS. There were 4508 students who participated in the study; gender
   was equally represented, and 95% were white. In multivariate analyses,
   after adjusting for other covariates, the odds of poorer school
   performance increased with increasing weekday television screen time and
   cable movie channel availability and decreased with parental restriction
   of television content restriction. As compared with children whose
   parents never allowed them to watch R-rated movies, children who watched
   R-rated movies once in a while, sometimes, or all of the time had
   significantly increased cumulative odds of poorer school performance.
   Weekend screen time and video game use were not associated with school
   performance.
   CONCLUSIONS. We found that both content exposure and screen time had
   independent detrimental associations with school performance. These
   findings support parental enforcement of American Academy of Pediatrics
   guidelines for media time (particularly weekdays) and content limits to
   enhance school success.

AB Background: It is important to describe and understand the underlying
   patterns and dynamics that govern sex work in societies undergoing rapid
   political and social changes, its heterogeneity across populations, and
   its evolution through time in order to inform future research, sound
   policy formation, and programme delivery.
   Objectives: To describe the socioeconomic and cultural determinants,
   organisational structure, distinct categories, and spatial patterning of
   sex work in Tallinn, Estonia, and identify recent temporal changes in
   sex work patterns.
   Methods: In-depth interviews with key informants; naturalistic
   observations of sex work and drug use venues, geo-mapping of sex work
   sites, review of media, public policy, and commissioned reports, and
   analyses of existing data.
   Results: Sex work takes place in a hierarchy of locations in Tallinn
   ranging from elite brothels and "love flats'' to truck stops. These
   sites vary in terms of their public health importance and social
   organisation. There are full time, part time, and intermittent male and
   female sex workers. Among others, the taxi driver, madam and the
   bartender are central roles in the organisation of sex work in Tallinn.
   Cell phone and internet technology enable sex work to be highly
   dispersed and spatially mobile.
   Conclusion: Future research and programmatic service delivery or
   outreach efforts should respond to the changing profile of sex work in
   Tallinn and its implications for STD/HIV epidemiology.

   these two activities is counterproductive to sociology as well as other
   disciplines. Content analysis of job listings in the American

   decades suggests that although teaching and research increasingly
   blended near the end of the twentieth century, significant differences
   remain between type of institution and the relative emphasis upon

AB Background Reliable evidence of the frequency and severity of human
   rights abuses in Haiti after the departure of the elected president in
   2004 was scarce. We assessed data from a random survey of households in
   the greater Port-au-Prince area.
   Methods Using random Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinate
   sampling, 1260 households (5720 individuals) were sampled. They were
   interviewed with a structured questionnaire by trained interviewers
   about their experiences after the departure of President Jean-Bertrand
   Aristide. The response rate was 90.7%. Information on demographic
   characteristics, crime, and human rights violations was obtained.
   Findings Our findings suggested that 8000 individuals were murdered in
   the greater Port-au-Prince area during the 22-month period assessed.
   Almost half of the identified perpetrators were government forces or
   outside political actors. Sexual assault of women and girls was common,
   with findings suggesting that 3 5 000 women were victimised in the area;
   more than half of all female victims were younger than 18 years.
   Criminals were the most identified perpetrators, but officers from the
   Haitian National Police accounted for 13.8% and armed anti-Lavalas
   groups accounted for 10.6% of identified perpetrators of sexual assault.
   Kidnappings and extrajudicial detentions, physical assaults, death
   threats, physical threats, and threats of sexual violence were also
   common.
   Interpretation Our results indicate that crime and systematic abuse of
   human rights were common in Port-au-Prince. Although criminals were the
   most identified perpetrators of violations, political actors and UN
   soldiers were also frequently identified. These findings suggest the
   need for a systematic response from the newly elected Haitian
   government, the UN, and social service organisations to address the
   legal, medical, psychological, and economic consequences of widespread
   human rights abuses and crime.

AB Objective: To test the hypothesis that the level of healthcare trust

   Design: Cross-sectional telephone-based survey.
   Methods: This study recruited low-income residents of Miami-Dade and
   Duval counties in Florida by using random-digit dialing (RDD). One
   thousand and five residents participated; however, analyses were limited
   to Black (n=550) or White (n=374) respondents. Trained interviewers used
   a structured questionnaire to obtain information about respondent
   demographics, trust in health care, perception of racism, and access to
   care.
   Results: Black respondents included fewer males (P=.0146) and younger
   subjects (P <= .05); otherwise, they were similar to White respondents.
   Compared to Duval County respondents, Miami-Dade respondents were
   younger (<=.05), richer (<=.05), and mostly males (P=.0355). Blacks
   perceived more racism than did Whites (P <.0001). Healthcare trust
   differed by race and respondents' county (P <.0001). The proportion of
   variance in healthcare trust explained (R(2)) by race was 2%.
   Introducing perception of racism into the model eliminated differences
   in trust between White and Black respondents. overall, the model
   explaining healthcare trust accounted for 21.2% of the variance in
   trust; the model adjusted for respondents' county, demographics, access
   to care, and liking treatment during routine appointment.
   Conclusion: This study observed that perception of racism accounted for
   the residual differences in healthcare trust between Whites and Blacks;
   therefore, healthcare distrust may not be an attribute of Blacks.
   Respondents' experience with the healthcare system accounted for most of
   the difference in trust.

AB Objectives: To examine the relationship between racial/ethnic
   neighborhood concentration and self-reported health before and after
   adjustment of individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics and to
   determine whether this association varies by race/ethnicity and
   perception of neighborhood.
   Design: The data are derived from the 1999 and 2002 New York City Social
   Indicator Survey, a cross-sectional survey. Logistic regression was used
   to assess the strength of the association between racial/ethnic
   neighborhood concentration and self-reported health before and after
   controlling for other covariates.
   Setting: The survey was conducted in New York City in 1999 and 2002.
   Participants: A final sample of 2,845 individuals who self-identified as
   White, Black, Hispanic, or Asian was linked by zip code to the 2000 US
   Census.
   Main Outcome Measure: Self-reported health was used as a dichotomous
   variable, good health status (including responses of excellent, very
   good, pretty good, or good) and poor health status (including the
   responses fair or poor).
   Results: Overall, 21.8% of respondents rated their health as poor, and
   those who live in neighborhoods with a high concentration of Blacks
   reported poorer health (27.2%) than those who live in neighborhoods with
   a low concentration of Blacks (17.3%, P < .001). Our findings suggest
   that individuals living in the most concentrated neighborhoods were
   almost two times more likely (odds ratio 1.77, 95% confidence interval
   1.12-2.79) to perceive their health as poor compared to their
   counterparts living in less concentrated neighborhoods.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates that poor self-reported health
   varies with patterns of concentration of Blacks in a neighborhood, after
   adjusting for individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics and
   perception of neighborhood. The results underscore the need for
   elucidating the pathways by which racial/ethnic neighborhood
   concentration affects health.

PY 2006
AB Purpose: Few studies have reported on the validity of physical activity
   measures in African Americans. The present study was designed to
   determine the validity of a self-administered physical activity
   questionnaire (PAQ) that was used in a large prospective study of
   African American women in the United States against an accelerometer
   (actigraph), an objective assessment of movement, and a seven-day
   activity diary.
   Methods: The study was conducted among 101 women enrolled in the Black
   Women's Health Study (BWHS) cohort who resided in the Washington, DC,
   metropolitan area, representing 11.2% (101/900) of this sample. Physical
   activity levels were obtained from the parent BWHS PAQ (eg, 1997 and
   1999) and repeated in the present study. This information entailed hours
   per week of participation in walking for exercise, hours per week of
   moderate activity (eg, housework, gardening, and bowling), and hours per
   week of strenuous activity (eg, basketball, swimming, running, and
   aerobics) during the previous year. The participants were required to
   wear actigraphs for seven days and then record their physical activities
   in their diaries (seven-day physical activity diary) during this time.
   The diaries were used to record the amount and pattern of daily energy
   expenditure.
   Results: Significant positive correlations were seen between the BWHS
   PAQ and the actigraph for total activity, r=.28; walking, r=.26; and
   vigorous activity, r=.40, P <.001. For the seven-day physical activity
   diary, the BWHS PAQ also demonstrated significant correlations for total
   (r=0.42, P <.01); moderate (r=.26, P <.05); and vigorous activities
   (r=.41, P <.01).
   Conclusions: The BWHS PAQ is a useful measure of physical activity in
   the BWHS cohort and thus has utility in prospective epidemiologic
   research.

AB The social facilitation scale of the Alcohol Expectancy
   Questionnaire-Adolescent version predicts subsequent drinking behavior
   and covaries with other important constructs. An examination of the
   interval-level measurement properties and potential biases of items
   could help improve the scale. Responses in a large sample (N=518) of
   undergraduates confirmed that the items fit a Rasch model for a
   single-factor, interval scale. Two items were biased when comparing
   non-drinkers, social drinkers and extreme drinkers. Four additional
   items showed gender bias. Removal of these items shortened the scale
   without decreasing correlations with two measures associated with
   drinking, while the strength with one measure was slightly decreased.
   This short form of the questionnaire should prove useful in the study of
   alcohol expectancies for social facilitation without drinking- or
   gender-related bias. These results also support the utility of Rasch
   modeling. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The present study extends our previous work on characterizing the
   profile of social behavior abnormalities in boys with Fragile X (FraX)
   and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using clinically oriented behavioral
   rating scales and standardized instruments. The goal was to further
   distinguish behavioral parameters contributing to the diagnostic
   classification of FraX + ASD. The Study design included two cohorts of
   boys with FraX (3-8 years), a larger main cohort for cross-sectional
   analyses (n = 56, 24 with ASD), and a longitudinal subset (n = 30, 11
   with ASD) of the main cohort with up to 3 yearly observations. The focus
   was on the relative contribution of delayed adaptive socialization and
   social withdrawal, including item components of their corresponding
   rating instruments, to the diagnosis of ASD in boys with FraX. Using a
   combination of regression analyses, we demonstrated that: (1) as delayed
   socialization, social withdrawal is also a correlate of FraX + ASD; (2)
   items of social withdrawal scales representing avoidance were the main
   predictors of ASD status, particularly in older boys; (3) adaptive
   socialization skills reflecting rules of social behavior and recognition
   and labeling of emotions, linked to verbal reasoning abilities, were
   selectively associated with FraX+ASD; (4) adaptive socialization is the
   primary determinant over time of ASD status in boys with FraX; and (5)
   integrated adaptive socialization-social withdrawal models allow the
   identification of distinctive FraX+ASD subgroups. Altogether, our
   findings suggest that two distinct but interrelated social behavior
   abnormalities, one linked to impaired cognitive processes (delayed
   socialization) and the second one to disturbance in limbic circuits
   (avoidance), play a role in the development of ASD in boys with FraX.

AB Objectives. We examined the changes in Black adolescent fertility rates
   in high-school areas with school-based health centers and compared them
   over time with changes in rates in high-school areas without
   school-based health centers.
   Methods. Fertility rates were estimated for high-school areas with and
   without school-based health centers with geocoded birth certificate and
   school enrollment data.
   Results. A high adolescent fertility rate (165 births/1000) in 1992
   among Black students in Denver high-school areas with school-based
   health centers declined to a low rate (38/1000) in 1997 that matched the
   rate of school areas that did not have school-based health centers.
   Rates declined for both types of areas over the study period, but the
   rate of decline in the areas with school-based health centers was
   significantly greater (77% vs 56%).
   Conclusions. The rapid and significant decline in Black adolescent
   fertility in school areas with school-based health centers strongly
   suggests that attending to the health needs of students at risk of
   pregnancy resulted in a radically lowered risk of fertility. The decline
   is likely the result of strategies to identify, intervene, and follow-up
   on students engaging in behaviors that place them at risk for unintended
   pregnancy.

AB Objectives. We assessed whether asthma is associated with urban
   children's use of special education services.
   Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 24 randomly selected
   New York City public elementary schools using a parent-report
   questionnaire focusing on sociodemographic characteristics, special
   education enrollment, asthma diagnosis and symptoms, school absences,
   and use of health care services.
   Results. Thirty-four percent of children enrolled in special education
   had been diagnosed with asthma, compared with 19% of children in the
   general student population. After control for sociodemographic factors,
   children with asthma were 60% more likely than children without asthma
   to be enrolled in special education (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.22, 2.16). Asthmatic children in special
   education were significantly more likely to be from low-income families
   and to have been hospitalized in the previous 12 months than asthmatic
   children in general education.
   Conclusions. Inadequate asthma control may contribute to a greater risk
   of asthmatic children residing in urban areas being placed in special
   education. School health programs should consider targeting low-income
   urban children with asthma at risk for enrollment in special education
   through increased asthma interventions and medical support services.

AB Objectives. We examined racial and ethnic disparities in the total

   Methods. We used the Brief Pediatric Asthma Screen Plus (BPAS+) and the
   Spanish BPAS+, validated, caregiver-completed respiratory
   questionnaires, to identify asthma and possible asthma among students in
   14 racially/ethnically diverse public elementary schools.
   Results. Among 11490 children, we demonstrated a high lifetime
   prevalence (12.2%) as well as racial and ethnic disparities in diagnosed
   asthma, but no disparities in prevalences of possible undiagnosed
   asthma. Possible asthma cases boost the total potential burden of asthma
   to more than 1 in 3 non-Hispanic Black and Puerto Rican children.
   Conclusions. There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in
   diagnosed asthma among inner-city schoolchildren in Chicago. However,
   possible undiagnosed asthma appears to have similar prevalences across
   racial/ethnic groups and contributes to a high total potential asthma
   burden in each group studied. A better understanding of underdiagnosis
   is needed to address gaps in asthma care and intervention for low-income
   communities.

AB Objectives. We assessed whether the association between low birthweight
   and early childhood asthma can be explained by an extensive set of
   individual- and neighborhood-level measures.
   Methods. A population-based sample of children born in large US cities
   during 1998-2000 was followed from birth to age 3 years (N = 1803).
   Associations between low birthweight and asthma diagnosis at age 3 years
   were estimated using multilevel models. Prenatal medical risk factors
   and behaviors, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, and
   neighborhood characteristics were controlled.
   Results. Low-birthweight children were twice as likely as normal
   birthweight children to have an asthma diagnosis (34% vs 18%). The fully
   adjusted association (OR = 2.36; P < .001) was very similar to the
   unadjusted association (OR = 2.48; P < .001). Rates of renter-occupied
   housing and vacancies at the census tract-level were strong independent
   predictors of childhood asthma.
   Conclusions. Very little of the association between low birthweight and
   asthma at age 3 can be explained by an extensive set of demographic,
   socioeconomic, medical, behavioral, and neighborhood characteristics.
   Associations between neighborhood housing characteristics and asthma
   diagnosis in early childhood need to be further explored.

AB Objectives. Using a community-based participatory research approach, a

   that influence youth wellness to guide the design of a culturally and
   locally relevant health promotion program.
   Methods. Open-ended interviews with key informants, a school
   self-assessment using the Centers for Disease Control's School Health
   Index, and a locally generated environmental inventory provided data
   that were triangulated to yield a composite of influential factors and
   perceived need within the community.
   Results. Family involvement and personal goal setting were identified as
   key to youth wellness. Supportive programs were described as having
   consistent adult leadership, structured activities, and a positive local
   and regional image. Availability of illicit drugs and alcohol, poor
   teacher attitude, and lack of adult involvement were significant
   negative factors that impact youth behavior.
   Conclusions. Local/native (emic) and university/nonnative (etic)
   perspectives and abilities can be combined to yield a culturally
   relevant formative assessment that is useful to public health planning.
   In this collaborative effort, standard means of data collection and

AB Objectives. We examined race/ethnicity and nativity correlates of
   prenatal substance use.
   Methods. Using data on a nationally representative cohort of pregnant
   women in US cities (N=4185), we evaluated the relative importance of
   socioeconomic status, paternal health behaviors, social support, and
   maternal stress and health history in explaining variations in prenatal
   substance use by race/ethnicity and nativity.
   Results. Maternal stress and health history appeared to fully explain
   differences in alcohol use by nativity, but these and other factors
   could not explain differences in prenatal smoking. For all
   races/ethnicities, paternal health behaviors were most strongly
   associated with maternal substance use. Except among Black women,
   socioeconomic background bore little relation to prenatal substance use
   after adjustment for more proximal risk factors (e.g., paternal and
   maternal health behaviors). Social support was most protective among
   Hispanic women.
   Conclusions. Foreign-born immigrant women are at equal risk of prenatal
   alcohol use compared with similarly situated US-born women and should
   not be overlooked in the design of interventions for at-risk women.
   Furthermore, the inclusion of fathers and the development of social
   support structures for at-risk women can strengthen interventions.

AB This ethnographic account of the rituals of risk and error after NASA's
   Columbia accident reveals the mechanisms by which sociological theory
   traveled across the disciplinary boundary to public and policy domains.
   The analysis shows that analogy was the instigator of it all, enabled by
   the social mechanisms of professional legitimacy, conversation,
   technologies, time, networks, and social support. It demonstrates the
   work sociologists do when theory travels from professional sociology to
   nonacademic audiences and what happens to the theory and the sociologist
   in the process. It reveals the tensions when professional sociology,
   critical sociology, public sociology, and policy sociology are joined. A
   study of sociology in the field, it shows how sociologists negotiate the
   meaning of their work in a nonacademic situation. Thus, this account
   contributes to research and theory on social boundaries, the diffusion
   of ideas, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and current debates
   about public sociology and the role of the sociologist, adding to the
   sociology of our own work.

   political impact of military preparedness. It instead suggests that
   military personnel policies impact social welfare efforts to the degree
   that they alter citizens' relationships to labor markets, directly
   provide social welfare benefits to military personnel, or create
   discursive obstacles to other groups seeking benefits. The results
   indicate that net of military spending, nations with relatively large

   and older (N = 16,657) in a cross-sectional survey of a large national
   sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, were
   analyzed: self-reported frequency of attendance at religious services,
   cigarette smoking. health status, sociodemographic variables, and
   measured body mass index (BMI).
   RESULTS: In persons 20 years and older, 58% of frequent attenders (>= 52
   times/y) and 53% of others were overweight or obese (BMI >= 25 kg/m(2)).
   After stratifying to eliminate interactions in a logistic regression
   model and controlling for sociodemographics, smoking, and health status,
   no significant association was seen in European-American women overall.
   In all others, the significant positive associations of frequency of
   attendance and overweight could be explained by these other variables
   (fully adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.36; p
   = 0.08). The same was true for obesity (BMI >= 30 kg/m(2)).
   CONCLUSION: In a national sample of the US population, the prevalence of
   overweight or obesity is greater in self-reported frequent attenders of
   religious services than in others, but the association was explained by
   controlling for multiple sociodemographic and health variables.

AB PURPOSE: The aim is to identify the characteristics of common health
   survey questions that may be associated with cross-cultural variability
   in question comprehension.
   METHODS: Interviews with respondents representing four cultural
   subgroups in the United States were analyzed through behavior coding to
   identify survey question characteristics that may be associated with
   cross-cultural variability in comprehension. Using survey responses as
   the unit of analysis, nested within survey respondents and survey
   questions, hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine the effects
   of four questionnaire design features on cultural variations in
   comprehension difficulties.
   RESULTS: Respondent culture was found to moderate the effects of
   response format, question length, and reading levels.
   CONCLUSIONS: Several question design strategies that reduce overall
   comprehension difficulty appear to also increase cross-cultural
   disparities.

AB PURPOSE: Unique experiences associated with "race," such as racism, may
   adversely affect health. Our goal is to assess whether racism is
   associated with the occurrence of hypertension in African-American
   women.
   METHODS: In the first prospective examination of perceived experiences
   of racism in relation to the incidence of hypertension, we used data
   from the Black Women's Health Study, a follow-up study of US black women
   that began in 1995. The 1997 follow-up questionnaire contained eight
   questions designed to measure personally mediated racism and
   institutionalized racism. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
   estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with control for age, body mass
   index, and questionnaire period.
   RESULTS: There were 2316 incident cases of hypertension reported during
   104,574 person-years of observation from 1997 to 2001. Most women
   reported experiences of racism. In the total sample, IRRs for the
   association of racism with incident hypertension were close to the null.
   However, some positive associations were observed for personally
   mediated racism in women born outside the United States.
   CONCLUSIONS: There may be an increase in hypertension associated with
   experiences of racism in certain subgroups of African-American women.

AB Studies (CMS) has helped us better understand how social groups relate
   to time, especially to the past, it has taken little notice of how
   embodied social actors collectively relate to time. In contrast,
   expanding upon the French School and the French sociological tradition,
   I argue for an approach that, on the one hand, connects mental schemata
   to bodily schemata to social frameworks. And on the other hand, I speak
   of how embodied social actors collectively relate to common pasts and
   presents; and of how embodiment can thus provide a structure of
   possibilities for individuals and groups, as well as shared compasses
   and orientations that help people move toward certain futures while
   foreclosing others.

   change. The paper specifically examines the role of markets and
   government in efficient adaptation responses. For adaptations to be
   efficient, the benefits from following adaptations must exceed the
   costs. For private market goods, market actors will follow this
   principle in their own interest. For public goods, governments must take
   on this responsibility. Governments must also be careful to design
   institutions that encourage efficiency or they could inadvertently
   increase the damages from climate change. Finally, although in a few
   cases actors must anticipate climate changes far into the future,
   generally it is best to learn and then act with respect to adaptation.

AB We conducted a qualitative study of 23 subjects to determine how African
   Americans perceive culturally competent care by physicians. Our
   objectives were to understand patients' perceptions of: 1) high-quality
   health care by physicians; 2) the role of culture and ethnicity in the
   doctor-patient relationship; and 3) patients' expectations of doctors.
   We developed a discussion guide and a questionnaire to capture the
   perception of competent (desirable or high-quality) health care in the
   context of cultural beliefs and attitudes. We found that African
   Americans are concerned with traditional performance aspects of care. In
   addition to professional demeanor and appropriate diagnosis and
   treatment, communication and respect were critical aspects of the
   process of care. Most participants thought that physicians should know
   something about African American culture but only in the context of
   healthcare issues. For these individuals, a culturally competent doctor
   is one who provides effective treatment while showing respect and using
   effective communication methods, regardless of the ethnicity and sex of
   the doctor. Future research on cultural competence in the doctor-patient
   relationship must elicit the full range of patient values-technical
   performance, general (culture-nonspecific) process of care, and
   cultural-specific preferences.

AB After 50 years of steady increase, per capita visits to US national
   parks have declined since 1988. This decline, coincident with the rise
   in electronic entertainment media, may represent a shift in recreation
   choices with broader implications for the value placed on biodiversity
   conservation and environmentally responsible behavior. We compared the
   decline in per capita visits with a set of indicators representing
   alternate recreation choices and constraints. The Spearman correlation
   analyses found this decline in NPV to be significantly negatively
   correlated with several electronic entertainment indicators: hours of
   television, (r(s) = -0.743, P < 0.001), video games (r(s) = -0.773, P <
   0.001), home movies (r(s) = -0.788, P < 0.001), theatre attendance (r(s)
   = -0.587, P < 0.025) and internet use (r(s) = -0.783, P < 0.001). There
   were also significant negative correlations with oil prices (r(s) =
   -0.547, P < 0.025), foreign travel (r(s) = -0.452, P < 0.05), and
   Appalachian Trail hikers (r(s) = -0.785, P < 0.001). Income was
   significantly positively correlated with foreign travel (r(s) = 0.621, P
   < 0.005) but negatively correlated with national parkvisits (r(s) =
   -0.697, P < 0.005). There was no significant correlation of mean number
   of vacation days, indicating available vacation time is probably not a
   factor. Federal funding actually increased during this period, and so
   was rejected as a probable factor. Park capacity was rejected as
   limiting since both total overnight stays and visits at the seven most
   popular parks rose well into the mid-1990s. Aging of baby boomers was
   also rejected as they are only now reaching retirement age, and thus
   during the period of visitation decline were still of prime family
   vacation age. Multiple linear regression of four of the entertainment
   media variables as well as oil prices explains 97.5% of this recent
   decline (r = 0.975, multiple r(2) = 0.950, adjusted multiple r(2) =
   0.925, SE = 0.015, F = 37.800, P < 0.0001). We may be seeing evidence of
   a fundamental shift away from people's appreciation of nature
   (biophilia, Wilson 1984) to 'videophilia,' which we here define as "the
   new human tendency to focus on sedentary activities involving electronic
   media." Such a shift would not bode well for the future of biodiversity
   conservation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   patterns, and Axis I and Axis 11 comorbidity, among adults with DSM-IV
   ASPD who reported onset of conduct disorder (CD) in childhood (< age 10)
   versus adolescence (>= age 10). Prevalence of each ASPD diagnostic
   criterion and comorbid lifetime disorder was estimated. Logistic
   regression was used to examine associations of childhood-onset CD with
   ASPD symptom patterns and comorbid disorders. Among the 1422 respondents
   with ASPD, 447 reported childhood-onset CD. Childhood-onset respondents
   were more likely than adolescence-onset respondents to endorse CD
   criteria involving aggression against persons, animals, and property
   before age 15, and to endorse more childhood criteria and lifetime
   violent behaviors. Childhood-onset respondents displayed significantly
   elevated odds of lifetime social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder,
   drug dependence, and paranoid, schizoid, and avoidant personality
   disorders, but significantly decreased odds for lifetime tobacco
   dependence. Childhood-onset CD appears to identify a more
   polysymptomatic and violent form of ASPD, associated with greater
   lifetime comorbidity for selected Axis I and Axis 11 disorders, in
   nonclinical populations.

AB Two studies, based on an alcohol myopia model, were designed to
   understand the role of women's alcohol consumption on vulnerability to
   sexual assault. We predicted that, in a high-conflict social situation,
   alcohol would make it more difficult to recognize sexual assault risk,
   lowering intentions to resist sexual advances. Method: In Study 1, women
   (N = 51) were recruited in bars and classified as having a high (.06 or
   greater) breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) or low BrAC. They were
   asked to project themselves into a hypothetical scenario that portrayed
   interest in establishing an intimate relationship and included mild
   sexual aggression. In Study 2, women (N = 101) were randomly assigned to
   an alcohol (target BrAC: .08%), placebo, or no-alcohol condition. They
   responded at two time points to a similar hypothetical scenario that
   described mild sexual aggression (Time 1) and serious sexual aggression
   (Time 2). Results: In Study 1, women with higher BrAC perceived less
   risk in the scenario and anticipated less resistance than women with low
   BrAC. In Study 2, similar results were found but only following serious
   aggression. There were no placebo effects. Both studies suggest that the
   effects of alcohol on resistance are partially mediated via risk
   perceptions. Conclusions: Alcohol appears to reduce intentions to resist
   sexual advances from an acquaintance while increasing intentions to
   pursue relationship-enhancing behaviors. Effects are not completely
   explained by an alcohol myopia perspective. Differences in findings
   between the two studies may reflect differences in methodology, context,
   or sample.

AB Objective: Few studies focus on the outcome of patients after they drop
   out of substance-use disorder (SUD) treatment, and there appear to be no
   prior studies of the long-term outcomes of these patients. The aim of
   this study is to determine how well such patients do after dropping out
   of treatment and to identify predictors of differential outcomes.
   Method: Patients in 15 residential SUD treatment programs were assessed
   at treatment entry and at 5-year follow-up on their frequency and
   severity of substance use, expectancies and beliefs about substance use,
   and social resources and stressors. Patients who dropped out and stayed
   out of treatment (n = 193) were compared with those who completed
   treatment (n = 3,204). Predictors of 5-year SUD problems among dropouts
   were identified. Results: In general, dropouts and treatment completers
   did not differ significantly on their levels of SUD problems at 5 years.
   At baseline, patients who dropped out reported more involvement in
   12-step organizations and greater cognitive impairment and more closely
   identified with the label "drug addict" than "alcoholic." Lower severity
   of SUD, lower self-efficacy, fewer positive substance-use expectancies,
   and less stress from social networks predicted fewer SUD problems at 5
   years among dropouts. Conclusions: In addition to focusing on substance
   use, providers should address the adequacy of patients' social support
   and counter positive substance-use expectancies at the earliest stages
   of treatment before patients drop out.

AB Objective: On weekend evenings, thousands of youths (ages 20 and
   younger) and young adults (ages 21-25) residing in communities along the
   US. border cross into Mexico to patronize all-night bars where the
   drinking age is 18, rather than 21, and where the price of alcohol is
   considerably less than in the United States. On January 1, 1999, Judrez,
   Mexico, implemented a 2 AM (instead of 5 Am) bar-closing policy. The
   number of crossers and their blood alcohol concentration levels on
   return were reduced in the year following this policy change. The
   present study's objective was to determine the long-term (7-year) effect
   of the earlier-closing bar policy on cross-border drinking in Mexico.
   Method: Analyzed data (1998 to August 2005) were from quarterly
   breath-test surveys at the El Paso (Texas)/Juarez (Mexico) border, bar
   observations in Judrez, and trauma data in El Paso. Results: Bar surveys
   in Juarez show that the 2 AM closing policy, initiated 7 years ago,
   continues to be enforced, as has the reduction (89%) in youthful
   crossers returning after 3 AM. The number of underage youths returning
   earlier in the evening (before 3 AM), however, unchanged for 2 years
   after the policy change, has doubled recently. Conclusions: The early
   closing of bars in Juarez has a continuing positive impact on the
   reduction of the number of those returning after 3 AM. Although
   initially there appeared to be no displacement of the late returnees
   into the early hours (before 3 AM), the number of bar visitors crossing
   and returning earlier has been steadily increasing. Suggestions for
   reducing cross-border heavy episodic drinking are described.

AB Objective: This study examined the association between scheduling at
   least one Friday class and the pattern and levels of alcohol use and
   heavy drinking in a sample of New Zealand college students. Method: Two
   waves of survey data were collected from 866 college students in New
   Zealand in the first and second semesters of the 2000 academic year.
   Descriptive and regression analyses were conducted to examine the
   associations between scheduling Friday class in the second semester,
   levels of alcohol use and heavy drinking in the past month, and alcohol
   use on different weeknights. We hypothesized that (1) heavier-drinking
   students would be less likely to schedule any Friday classes, (2) having
   at least one Friday class would be inversely related to concurrent
   alcohol use and heavy drinking when adjusting for potential confounders,
   and (3) having Friday class would be inversely related to alcohol use
   and heavy drinking on Thursdays and prior week-nights. Results: Analysis
   results supported the hypothesis that heavier-drinking students would be
   less likely to schedule Friday classes but did not support the
   hypothesis that scheduling at least one Friday class would be inversely
   related to concurrent alcohol use and heavy drinking when adjusting for
   potential confounders. Having Friday class also was not associated with
   typical drinking on Thursday or Friday, but having Friday class was
   inversely associated with Thursday as the biggest drinking day when
   controlling for background variables. Conclusions: Findings of this
   study indicate that heavier-drinking students are less likely to
   schedule Friday classes. Scheduling at least one Friday class may reduce
   the likelihood of heavy drinking on Thursdays but may have no effect on
   the overall levels of alcohol use and heavy drinking among college
   students.

   threatened. It is incumbent upon us not to allow these modern-day
   threats to destroy an important resource and legacy in the annals of
   African-American people.
   This paper explores medical education in the 19th and 20th centuries,
   the creation of black medical schools and the forces that lead to the
   demise of many of these institutions. In recalling this history, we
   acknowledge the almost-impossible odds faced by these pioneers and learn
   from their mistakes and failures.

AB Background: Although several studies have outlined the need for and
   benefits of diversity in academia, the number of underrepresented
   minority (URM) faculty in academic health centers remains low, and
   minority faculty are primarily concentrated at the rank of assistant
   professor. In order to increase the diversity of the faculty of the
   University of California, San Diego (UCSD) School of Medicine, the UCSD
   National Center for Leadership in Academic Medicine, in collaboration
   with the UCSD Hispanic Center of Excellence, implemented a junior
   faculty development program designed in part to overcome the
   differential disadvantage of minority faculty and to increase the
   academic success rate of all faculty.
   Methods: Junior faculty received counseling in career and research
   objectives; assistance with academic file preparation, introduction to
   the institutional culture; workshops on pedagogy and grant writing; and
   instrumental, proactive mentoring by senior faculty.
   Results: After implementation of the program, the retention rate of URM
   junior faculty in the school of medicine increased from 58% to 80% and
   retention in academic medicine increased from 75% to 90%.
   Conclusion: A junior faculty development program that integrates
   professional skill development and focused academic career advising with
   instrumental mentoring is associated with an increase in the retention
   of URM faculty in a school of medicine.

AB Women and minority faculty and students are seriously under-represented
   in university and academic healthcare institutions. The role of
   mentoring has been identified as one of the significant factors in
   addressing this underrepresentation.
   We have described the mentoring efforts at two institutions of higher
   learning in assisting women and minority students and faculty in being
   accomplished in their academic pursuits.
   One-hundred-thirty students and > 50 women and minority faculty have
   participated in the mentoring programs described. The number of
   participants has increased dramatically over the years and continues to
   evolve positively. These programs appear to be quite successful in the
   short term. Further evaluation of measurable outcomes will be necessary
   to fully determine their true impact. The mentoring models for women and
   under-represented minority faculty and students at Creighton University
   Health Sciences Schools and Wake Forest University School of Medicine
   will serve as a guide for other Health Sciences Schools.

AB While sociologists and the public at large are increasingly interested
   in the life conditions of animals, conceptual and empirical development
   of the topic is limited. This paper seeks to further develop the
   sociological research on attitudes toward animal well-being. We build on
   insights from contemporary stratification theory to explain the nature
   of animal attitudes and their determinants. We also extend past work by
   examining a broader range of factors related to attitudes about animal
   wellbeing, focusing on place, other social structural factors, and
   individuals' unique animal-related experiences. Data are from a survey
   of over 4,000 Ohio residents conducted in 2002. We find that childhood
   experience has the greatest place-based effect on attitudes. Other
   findings highlight the importance of social structural factors,
   suggesting support for the "underdog hypothesis." Women, people
   experiencing economic hardship, those with less education, younger and
   middle aged people, and blacks tend to be more concerned with animal
   well-being. Individualized, experiential variables are also important.
   Our results reflect the complexity of attitudes about animals and point
   to the need for greater sociological attention to factors left largely
   unexplored in previous studies, including childhood place-based factors,
   economic hardship, and individuals' unique animal-related experiences.

AB Cultural sociology agrees that meanings attributed to objects vary
   depending upon the cultural competencies of viewers, but tends to ignore
   the role of identities in interpretation. This article argues that both
   identities and competencies influence interpretation. Through an
   analysis of how 307 undergraduate students at a Midwestern state
   university interpreted a black-and-white photograph of an individual
   masturbating, this article finds that assessments of the degree to which
   the image should be considered art and/or pornography are associated
   with self-reported indicators of both cultural competencies and
   identities. Indicators of religious and conventional identities and of
   training with regard to photography stand out in this regard. The
   intersection of the constructions of pornography and art enabled the
   authors to classify participants as Nonartistic Conservatives,
   Nonartistic Liberals, Artistic Liberals, and Artistic Conservatives and
   to show that interpretations are a consequence of how persons are
   simultaneously situated in relation to both moral and aesthetic
   criteria.

AB Even when the timing, sequence, and manner of notification are
   instrumentally inconsequential, how one conveys information affects the
   meaning of the telling. This article introduces the concepts of
   "notification norms" and the "information order," showing how the former
   constrain the behavior of nodes in social networks as well as enabling
   manipulation of the relationships that comprise those networks.
   "Notification" is defined as information transmission motivated by role
   obligations and notification norms as social rules that govern such
   transmission. These rules produce patterns of information dissemination
   different from what individual volition would yield and from what
   technology makes possible. The capacity to wield a socially sanctioned
   repertoire of notification rules is a learned competence. Competent
   notifiers must also understand the local epistemological ecology-the
   distribution and trajectory of information, as well as the projects,
   concerns, and priorities of one's fellows. This study of notification
   introduces the broader concept of "the information order" and is a first
   step in the project of a sociology of information.

AB Sociologists who do field work in medical settings face an intractable
   tension between their disciplinary field, which takes a critical
   perspective toward medicine, and their ethnographic field, which often
   includes physicians. This paper explores the ethical problems that
   result from the collision of the two fields. While in the field,
   ethnographers are forced to choose between sociology and their
   obligations to host members, as they decide whether to disclose their
   actual research agendas, whether to ask tough questions or to reveal
   their concerns, and whether to give advice. The tension persists when
   field workers leave the field to write, forcing them to choose between
   competing interpretations and to decide what to reveal or conceal in the
   interests of confidentiality. Through these moral choices about what to
   ask, record or present to the reader, ethnographers shape the academic
   field even as it shapes them.

   bioethicists' earlier neglect of infectious disease to their
   under-appreciation of the extent to which the problem of infectious
   disease is related to social factors and thus to questions of justice.
   We argue that a social causation of illness model - well-known to
   sociologists of medicine, but incompletely understood by bioethicists -
   will improve future bioethical analysis of issues related to infectious
   disease. By emphasising the relationships between social and economic
   structures of inequality and health, the social causation model provides
   a richer approach to ethical issues associated with infectious disease
   than the more commonly used biomedical model.

   freedom is examined, as is how the pervasiveness, centralization,
   autonomy, type (adversarial vs. inquisitorial), and discretion of legal
   and judicial systems impact religious freedom. The application of key
   concepts from the work of Donald Black, including status, intimacy, and
   third party partisanship seem especially useful, and well as issues
   related to the social production of evidence used in legal cases

   actions that comprise those gatherings, and in the dispersal processes
   that bring such gatherings to an end. In reviewing the phenomena to be
   explained, I also call attention to the limitations of the concepts of
   "the crowd" and of "collective behavior." Finally, to make sense of the
   dynamic variation and alternation between individual and collective
   actions, and the variation in the latter, I champion and extend G. H.
   Mead's theory of the act as a closed-loop, negative-feedback model of
   purposive action. No lesser model of agency and action is adequate to
   the challenge of understanding and explaining the phenomena in question.

AB Empathy is the ability to experience and understand what others feel
   without confusion between oneself and others. Knowing what someone else
   is feeling plays a fundamental role in interpersonal interactions. In
   this paper, we articulate evidence from social psychology and cognitive
   neuroscience, and argue that empathy involves both emotion sharing
   (bottom-up information processing) and executive control to regulate and
   modulate this experience (top-down information processing), underpinned
   by specific and interacting neural systems. Furthermore, awareness of a
   distinction between the experiences of the self and others constitutes a
   crucial aspect of empathy. We discuss data from recent behavioral and
   functional neuroimaging studies with an emphasis on the perception of
   pain in others, and highlight the role of different neural mechanisms
   that underpin the experience of empathy, including emotion sharing,
   perspective taking, and emotion regulation.

AB Ecovillages, co-housing communities, and other types of intentional
   communities (ICs) have proliferated in recent years. There are currently
   several thousands of these communities worldwide and their numbers are
   increasing rapidly. We surveyed a subset of these communities to learn
   more about their characteristics, including their world view or vision,
   the status of four basic types of capital (built, human, social, and
   natural), and the quality of life (QoL) they provide for their
   residents. Survey results indicate that ICs have a better balance
   between built, human, social, and natural capital than unintentional
   communities (based on a parallel survey of neighborhoods in Burlington,
   VT, USA) and that this results in a higher QoL among residents. It is
   difficult to assess the sustainability of ICs, but the data indicates
   that within ICs, social capital is substituted for built capital thereby
   reducing the level of material throughput. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All

AB Background The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was
   launched in 2002 to attract and rapidly disburse money to fight these
   diseases. However, some commentators believe that poor countries cannot
   effectively use such resources to increase delivery of their health
   programmes-referred to as a lack of absorptive capacity. We aimed to
   investigate the major determinants of grant implementation in developing
   countries.
   Methods With information available publicly on the Global Fund's
   website, we did random-effects analysis to investigate the effect of
   grant characteristics, types of primary recipient and local fund agent,
   and country attributes on disbursements that were made between 2003 and
   2005 (phase one of Global Fund payments). To check the robustness of
   findings, regression results from alternative estimation methods and
   model specifications were also tested.
   Findings Grant characteristics-such as size of commitment, lag time
   between signature and first disbursement, and funding round-had
   significant effects on grant implementation. Enhanced political
   stability was associated with high use of grants. Low-income countries,
   and those with less-developed health systems for a given level of
   income, were more likely to have a higher rate of grant implementation
   than nations with higher incomes or more-developed health systems.
   Interpretation The higher rate of grant implementation seen in countries
   with low income and low health-spending lends support to proponents of
   major increases in health assistance for the poorest countries and
   argues that focusing resources on low-income nations, particularly those
   with political stability, will not create difficulties of absorptive
   capacity. Our analysis was restricted to grant implementation, which is
   one part of the issue of absorptive capacity In the future, assessment
   of the effect of Global Fund grants on intervention coverage will be
   vital.

   adults. death rates for adults will, low socioeconomic status (SES) were
   highest in high-SES neighborhoods, lower in moderate-SES neighborhoods
   and lowest in low-SES neighborhoods. This study examines whether these
   findings extend to little to hospitalization.
   Methods: Population-based study of 1686 women and men, aged 25 to 74 at
   baseline. from 82 neighborhoods in four California cities. Participants
   were surveyed and medically examined in 389-1990 and followed through
   the end or 2002. Neighborhood-level SES was defined by five census
   variables and divided into three levels. Individual-level SES was
   defined by household income and educational level mid divided
   intotertiles (nine individual/neighborhood SES groups).
   Results: There more 627 hospitalizations. The age- and gender-adjusted
   rates of any hospitalization between 1989-1990 and the end of 2002 for
   adults with low SES were highest for those living in high-SES
   neighborhoods (51% compared with 28% to 38% for adults from the other
   eight individual/neighborhood group). For We adults, time to
   hospitalization, as indicated by survival curves, was significantly
   shorter compared with the other individual/neighborhood groups (p <
   0.01, multilevel Cox proportional hazards model). Findings more not
   explained by baseline differences in individual-level sociodemographic
   characteristics, health behaviors or risk factors, health status, or
   proximity to neighborhood goods and services.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that factors leading to increased
   mortality for adults with low SES in high-SES neighborhoods also affect
   hospitalization.

   to compare the amount of evidence-based care received as well as
   clinical and functional outcomes.
   Results: Poor subjects were more severely ill at baseline, with more
   medical and psychiatric comorbidity. The increases in the amount of
   evidence-based care and reductions in clinical symptoms and disability
   were comparable in the two groups such that poorer individuals, although
   responding equivalently, continued to be more ill and disabled at 12
   months.
   Conclusions: The comparable response of poor individuals in this study
   suggests that standard CBT and pharmacotherapy treatments for panic
   disorder do not need to be "tailored" to be effective in poor
   populations. However, the more severe illness both at baseline and
   follow-up in these poor individuals suggests that treatment programs may
   need to be extended in order to treat residual symptoms and disability
   in these patients so that they might achieve comparable levels of
   remission.

   domesticity sanctioned the separation of public and private spheres,
   defined as masculine and feminine, respectively. Archaeological and
   historical evidence from Deerfield, Massachusetts, however, reveals that
   gendered uses of space were fluid and specifically that women were
   active agents in the village beyond the domestic sphere. This evidence
   calls into question the validity of these categories, illustrating how

AB In an era when relativism and questions of modernity have unsettled the
   premises and goals of the development project, there is a seductive
   quality to the universalism of Nussbaum's capabilities approach. We
   query Nussbaum's philosophically based contribution and raise
   epistemological concerns about her commitment to a list of central human
   capabilities. We argue that attention to state forms and practices, as
   well as unequal power relations, must be incorporated into analyses of
   capability and development. This leads us to support Sen's advocacy of
   deliberative democracy as a productive space for collectivities and
   individuals to strive for social justice and equity. Such a focus is
   necessarily attentive to multiple forms of inequality and domination and
   is best understood by engaging historically specific analyses of state
   formations.

   confirmed the factor structure of our multicomponential model of

   specificity, as measured by depressive cognition about self and others,
   is important to predicting changes in perceived support and demand over
   time. Each component of depression was related to social support and
   social demand cross-sectionally, whereas only the cognitive component of
   depression predicted changes in support and demand prospectively. Future
   research should consider the pathways linking depressive cognition to
   perceived support and demand.

   conversations about conflicts in their relationships. EA couples showed
   more positive and less negative emotional behavior than did CA couples,
   despite similarities in reports of emotional experience and autonomic

AB Objectives: Tumor stage, age, and cell type are well-characterized
   predictors for cervical cancer survival; socioeconomic factors may also
   play an important role. The purpose of this study is to estimate
   cervical cancer survival by socioeconomic indicators and race/ethnicity
   among elderly women diagnosed with cervical cancer.
   Methods: We studied 1251 women with cervical cancer aged 65 or older,
   identified between 1992 and 1999 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology,
   and End Results [SEER]-Medicare linked data. All women had similar
   access to care through Medicare fee-for-services insurance. A composite
   measure of socioeconomic status was created using census tract level
   data for poverty, education, and income. Cox proportional hazard
   modeling was used for all-cause and cervical cancer-specific survival
   analysis.
   Results: Increased age (P < 0.0001) and advanced tumor stage (< 0.0001)
   were associated with poorer all-cause and cervical cancer-specific
   survival. After adjustment for age, stage, and treatment, increased
   co-morbidity scores and having non-squamous cervical cancer were
   associated with poorer all-cause survival (P < 0.001). After adjusting
   for confounders, women receiving hysterectomy vs. no surgery or any
   treatment had significantly better all-cause and cervical
   cancer-specific survival. Socioeconomic factors were not associated with
   either all-cause (P for trend = 0.79) or cervical cancer-specific (P for
   trend = 0.81) survival. No racial/ethnic differences in all-cause or
   cervical cancer-specific survival were observed after adjusting for
   socioeconomic factors.
   Conclusion: Among women with similar access to care, neither minority
   race/ethnicity nor poorer socioeconomic status were associated with
   poorer survival in this large sample of older women diagnosed with
   invasive cervical cancer. Presence of co-morbid conditions and treatment
   were important predictors of cervical cancer survival. (c) 2005 Elsevier

AB Objective: Excess body weight is related to significant morbidity and
   mortality. However, less is known about the relationship of body weight
   to health-related quality of life (HRQOL), especially for Asian
   populations. We examined the relationship of excess weight and HRQOL in
   a general population sample from Taiwan.
   Research methods and procedures: This cross-sectional study used a
   national representative sample (n=14221) from the 2001 Taiwan National
   Health Interview Survey. Body weight was categorized using body mass
   index (BMI in kg/m(2)) as normal (18.5-24.9), overweight (25-29.9), and
   obese (>= 30). HRQOL was measured using the Taiwan version of the SF-36.
   We compared the body weight-HRQOL relationships by age, gender, and
   status of chronic condition, respectively. We especially used the
   Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) to examine the relationships of
   BMI and HRQOL by taking into account the correlations of HRQOL within
   households. Four models were developed to adjust sequentially for sets
   of covariates: Model 1 with no adjustment; Model 2 adjusting for
   sociodemographic variables; Model 3 adding chronic conditions; Model 4
   further adding smoking status.
   Results: Unadjusted physical HRQOL was best for normal weight, worse for
   overweight, and worst for obese individuals. For unadjusted mental
   HRQOL, overweight subjects had at least as good mental domain scores of
   HRQOL as those with normal weight or obesity, depending on the
   subscales. As age increased, excess weight was associated with worse
   physical, but not mental HRQOL. Compared to men, women with excess
   weight showed a greater deficit in physical HRQOL. Multivariable
   analyses suggested that obesity was associated with worse physical HRQOL
   compared to overweight, which, in turn, was worse or comparable to
   normal weight. Specifically, in the model adjusting for demographic
   variables, the deficit in physical functioning and physical component
   scores for the obese vs normal weight were statistical significant (P <
   0.05) and clinically important difference (effect size >= 0.3). Both
   obesity and overweight were associated with higher mental component
   scores than normal weight, but the effect size was < 0.3.
   Conclusion: In Taiwan, excess weight was related to worse physical, but
   not mental HRQOL. The lack of impact of increased body weight on mental
   health status presents a potential challenge to preventing the increases
   in obesity. More research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms by which
   excess weight affects specific domains of HRQOL, and to develop
   effective prevention strategies.

AB Inevitably, more is forgotten than is remembered; what is lost to memory
   may be viewed as collective amnesia. This article considers the
   development of qualitative sociology as a distinct social world within
   the discipline; its emergence reflects sociology's growth and shifts in
   publishing practices that encouraged sociology's division into separate
   specialties. However, these developments have costs: ethnography is
   increasingly divorced from its historical context, and despite receiving
   considerable lip service, synthetic grounded theory is uncommon.
   Ethnographers need to consider both the benefits and the costs of these
   developments.

   a brief social role play with an unfamiliar adult. There were 27
   participants with Turner syndrome, 20 with fragile X syndrome, and 28 in
   an age-matched comparison group. Females with fragile X did not exhibit
   more abnormal language, but exhibited less of what is typical during
   initial interactions. Overall rates of dysfluencies did not differ,
   although females with fragile X made more phrase repetitions. Females
   with Turner syndrome had no language use abnormalities. Our findings

   tasks that included synchronize-continue tapping at a wide range of

   entrainment theory of timing and event tracking, were tested. A
   preferred period hypothesis predicted a monotonic slowing of a preferred
   rate (tempo) of event tracking across the life span. An entrainment
   region hypothesis predicted a quadratic profile in the range of event
   rates that produced effective timing across the life span; specifically,
   age-specific entrainment regions should be narrower in childhood and

AB African-American men have the highest prostate cancer rates worldwide,
   and innovative efforts are needed to increase cancer prevention and
   screening behaviors among this population. Formative research was
   conducted to assess attitudes and behaviors linked to prostate cancer
   prevention activities that could be used to develop a culturally
   relevant intervention for an African-American church-based population.
   Four gender-specific focus groups were conducted with 29 men and women
   at two African-American churches in central North Carolina. Three
   primary themes emerged from the focus group discussions: culturally and
   gender-influenced beliefs and barriers about cancer prevention and
   screening; barriers related to the healthcare system; and religious
   influences, including the importance of spiritual beliefs and church
   support.
   These discussions revealed the importance of the black family, the
   positive influence of spouses/partners on promoting cancer screening and
   healthy behaviors, the roles of faith and church leadership, and beliefs
   about God's will for good health. These findings also revealed that
   there are still major barriers and challenges to cancer prevention among
   African Americans, including continued mistrust of the medical community
   and negative attitudes toward specific screening tests.
   Findings provide important insights to consider in implementing
   successful prostate cancer prevention interventions designed for

   to the construction Of the highland muangs that typically incorporated
   status differences, ethnic diversity, and ecological variety. Muang
   polities achieved governance of both a diverse network of peoples and a
   diverse natural habitat. Since contemporary upland peoples and resources
   remain within administrative entities where lowland political and

AB Objective. Studies examining trends in problem alcohol use for U.S.
   adults residing in rural locations are lacking. This study examines
   recent trends in heavy and binge drinking in urban counties and three
   types of rural counties.
   Methods. Random-digit telephone survey of adults aged 18 years or older
   residing in states participating in the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System, in the years 1995/1997 (n = 247,255), 1999/2001 (n
   = 362,077) and 2003 (n = 257,659). Analyses were performed in 2006.
   Results. Metropolitan counties experienced higher prevalence of heavy
   and binge drinking than rural counties in all years, and all geographic
   areas showed upward trends in both drinking behaviors. Trends in heavy
   drinking were sharper in rural counties (3.8% to 5.4% compared with 4.9%
   to 6.0% in metro counties). Metropolitan and rural counties overall saw
   similar increases in binge drinking, however, the greatest increase
   occurred in remote micropolitan counties (12.7% to 15.7%).
   Conclusion. Heavy and binge drinking are problems that continue to
   increase in rural areas nationwide. Because of the difficulties inherent
   in accessing and administering substance abuse treatment in rural areas,
   special attention should be given to tailoring alcohol abuse
   interventions to the needs of rural residents. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

   differences are due to socioeconomic compositional differences, cultural
   differences, or some degree of each continue to surface in the
   literature. In this article, I use the U.S. military as an institutional
   counterfactual to larger society because, I argue, it isolates many of
   the conditions commonly cited in the literature to explain race
   differences in divorce trends. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of

AB This study contributes to the sociological study of suicide via an
   exploration of the implications and application of literary texts in
   sociological analysis. The examination of two pairs of literary texts
   suggests that some cases of suicide can be self-affirming. When the
   characters find themselves in circumstances that threaten their
   perception of who they are in their social contexts, they may choose the
   possibility of death over life with a change in self-concept. The
   interpretation of the four selected narrative cases of self-affirmative
   suicide is nestled in complexities of self-identity: two from The Iliad
   by Homer, and one each from Andorra and I'm Not Stiller by Max Frisch.
   Relating the findings to Turner's theory of impulsive versus
   institutional loci of real self, the article argues that institutionally
   constituted characters are more likely than impulsive-selves to find
   self-killing an acceptable resolution to their crises of identity. The
   findings are discussed in relation to classic theory in the sociology of
   suicide, concepts of the real self, and the use of literature in social
   science research.

AB As the counterfactual model of causality has increased in popularity,
   sociologists have returned to matching as a research methodology. In
   this article, advances over the past two decades in matching estimators
   are explained, and the practical limitations of matching techniques are
   emphasized. The authors introduce matching methods by focusing first on
   ideal scenarios in which stratification and weighting procedures warrant
   causal inference. Then, they discuss how matching is often undertaken in
   practice, offering an overview of the most prominent data analysis
   routines. With four hypothetical examples, they demonstrate how the
   assumptions behind matching estimators often break down in practice.
   Even so, the authors argue that matching techniques can be used

AB The early 20th century Southerner lived in a disease environment created
   by a confluence of poverty, climate and the legacy of slavery. A deadly
   trio of pellagra, hookworm and malaria enervated the poor
   Southerner-man, woman and child-creating a dull, weakened people ill
   equipped to prosper in the modem world. The Northern perceptions of the
   South as a backward and sickly region were only compounded by the
   realization that her population was malnourished, infected by worms, and
   continually plagued by agues and fevers. As historian John Duffy
   concluded, "As a chronically debilitating disease, it [malaria] shared
   with the other two the responsibility for the term 'lazy Southerner''.

AB Empirical longitudinal studies assessing why community-level violence
   rates change over time are lacking. Despite a wide-ranging literature,
   questions remain as to whether changes over time are due to factors
   occurring in specific periods (period effects) or individuals in
   successive cohorts (cohort effect). The objective was to assess the
   relative contribution of age, period, and cohort effects on violence
   trends. The authors assessed differences in self-reported violence
   between two cohorts of males (n = 1,009) from the Pittsburgh Youth
   Study, which tracked delinquency and risk factors from 1987 to 2000. The
   youngest cohort were aged 7-19 years, and the oldest cohort were aged
   13-25 years. Yearly measures of violence were examined through
   generalized estimating equations. The oldest cohort reported higher
   levels of violence even after adjustment for age and major
   individual-level risk factors (odds ratio (OR) = 1.45, 95% confidence
   interval (CI): 1.17, 1.81) such as gang participation and drug dealing,
   as well as community-level factors (OR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.65, 2.82).
   However, when period effects were included, cohort differences were
   rendered insignificant (OR = 1.23, 95% CI: 0.78, 1.94). The authors
   conclude that differences in the rates of violence over time may be
   attributed to changing social factors (period effects) and not to
   differences between the individuals (cohort effect) of cohorts.

AB The authors examined the relation between neighborhood income, as a
   measure of socioeconomic status, and childhood cancer. Incident cases of
   childhood solid tumor and lymphoma in 1985-2001 were identified from
   provincial cancer registries in Canada. Residential postal codes at the
   time of diagnosis were used to assign cases to census neighborhoods.
   Person-years at risk were determined from quintiles of population by
   neighborhood income, sex, and 5-year age group, constructed using census
   population data. Poisson regression was used to calculate incidence rate
   ratios across neighborhood income quintiles. Compared with the incidence
   rate in the richest income quintile, moderately lower rate ratios of
   0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.63, 0.86) and 0.84 (95% confidence
   interval: 0.69, 1.04) were observed, respectively, for carcinomas and
   renal tumors in the poorest income quintile. No association was found
   for other types of cancer. Although a potential relation between
   socioeconomic status and childhood cancer cannot be excluded, the
   overall pattern seems compatible with random variation.

AB Background: While concerns about road rage have grown over the past
   decade, states have made it easier for motorists to carry firearms in
   their vehicles. Are motorists with guns in the car more or less likely
   to engage in hostile and aggressive behavior?
   Methods: Data come from a 2004 national random digit dial survey of over
   2400 licensed drivers. Respondents were asked whether, in the past year,
   they (1) made obscene or rude gestures at another motorist, (2)
   aggressively followed another vehicle too closely, and (3) were victims
   of such hostile behaviors.
   Results: Seventeen percent admitted making obscene or rude gestures, and
   9% had aggressively followed too closely. Forty-six percent reported
   victimization by each of these behaviors in the past year. Males, young
   adults, binge drinkers, those who do not believe most people can be
   trusted, those ever arrested for a non-traffic violation, and motorists
   who had been in a vehicle in which there was a gun were more likely to
   engage in such forms of road rage.
   Conclusion: Similar to a survey of Arizona motorists, in our survey,
   riding with a firearm in the vehicle was a marker for aggressive and
   dangerous driver behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Aims To investigate the prospective influence of social influence and

   expectancies among adolescents with and without drinking experience.
   Design Longitudinal data from students in the control schools of a field
   trial designed to evaluate a school-based drug prevention program.
   Setting A total of 19 middle schools in South Dakota, USA. Measurements
   An alcohol outcome expectancy scale administered to 1410 students in
   grades 8 and 9. After using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to
   develop an expectancies measure, multiple-group (grade 8 drinkers versus
   grade 8 non-drinkers) path analysis was used to model 9th grade alcohol
   expectancies. Grade 8 social influence and bonding variables were used
   as predictors, controlling for grade 8 expectancies. Findings At the
   bivariate level, peer and adult influences and social bonding variables
   were related consistently to alcohol outcome expectancies among drinkers
   and non-drinkers. A bivariate relationship between alcohol advertising
   and alcohol expectancies was found among drinkers only. In the
   multivariate model, greater alcohol use by important adults predicted
   independently increased alcohol positivity among drinkers; greater
   perceived approval of alcohol use by parents and peers predicted
   diminished perceived potency of alcohol among non-drinkers.
   Advertisement exposure and social bonding variables were not independent
   predictors of alcohol expectancies in the multivariate model.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that attempts to alter adolescents'
   alcohol expectancies are likely to fail unless they address the
   influence of immediate social models on these beliefs.

AB Background Patients with myocardial infarction (MI) are at further
   increased risk for untoward events when patients also exhibit low social
   support and/or depression. The ENRICHD study was the largest controlled
   trial in post-Ml patients attempting to treat these psychological
   comorbidities and provides an opportunity to examine the medical and
   psychological characteristics that may affect risk in this population.
   Methods We analyzed the baseline characteristics and their relationship
   to the primary end point of long-term mortality and recurrent infarction
   and to the secondary end points of overall mortality and cardiovascular
   mortality in 2481 post-Ml patients. Cox proportional hazards models were
   used to predict the risk of these outcomes over a mean of 2.5 years of
   follow-up.
   Results Death or nonfatal MI occurred in 24.1%, all-cause mortality in
   13.7%, and cardiovascular mortality in 8.4% of the sample (62% of the
   total). Age, heart failure, pulmonary disease, Killip class, ejection
   fraction, an elevated creatinine, the use of non-angiotensin-coverting
   enzyme asodilators, prior MI, diabetes, depression, and bypass surgery
   after acute MI were all significant multivariable predictors.
   Conclusions The medical predictors of adverse events in post-MI patients
   with low social support and/or depression were similar to those of
   patients with MI in other clinical trials.

AB Objectives. We studied the use of complementary and alternative medicine
   (CAM) among women in 4 racial/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic Whites,
   African Americans, Mexican Americans, and Chinese Americans.
   Methods. We obtained a nationally representative sample of women aged 18
   years and older living in the United States in 2001. Oversampling
   obtained 800 interviews in each group, resulting in a sample of 3068
   women.
   Results. Between one third and one half of the members of all groups
   reported using at least 1 CAM modality in the year preceding the survey.
   In bivariate analyses, overall CAM use among Whites surpassed that of
   other groups; however, when CAM use was adjusted for socioeconomic
   factors, use by Whites and Mexican Americans were equivalent. Despite
   the socioeconomic disadvantage of African American women, socioeconomic
   factors did not account for differences in CAM use between Whites and
   African Americans.
   Conclusions. CAM use among racial/ethnic groups is complex and nuanced.
   Patterns of CAM use domains differ among groups, and multivariate models
   of CAM use indicate that ethnicity plays an independent role in the use
   of CAM modalities, the use of CAM practitioners, and the health problems
   for which CAM is used.

AB Objectives. We tested whether local cultural and social values regarding
   the use of health care are associated with the likelihood of home death,
   using variation in local rates of home births as a proxy for geographic
   variation in these values.
   Methods. For each of 351110 adult decedents in Washington state who died
   from 1989 through 1998, we calculated the home birth rate in each zip
   code during the year of death and then used multivariate regression
   modeling to estimate the relation between the likelihood of home death
   and the local rate of home births.
   Results. Individuals residing in local areas with higher home birth
   rates had greater adjusted likelihood of dying at home (odds ratio [OR]
   = 1.04 for each percentage point increase in home birth rate; 95%
   confidence interval [CI] = 1.03, 1.05). Moreover, the likelihood of
   dying at home increased with local wealth (OR = 1.04 per $10000; 95% CI
   = 1.02, 1.06) but decreased with local hospital bed availability (OR =
   0.96 per 1000 beds; 95% CI = 0.95, 0.97).
   Conclusions. The likelihood of home death is associated with local rates
   of home births, suggesting the influence of health care use preferences.

AB Objectives. The movement to publicly report data on provider quality to
   inform consumer choices is predicated on assumptions of equal access and
   knowledge. We examine the validity of this assumption by testing whether
   minority/less educated Medicare patients are at greater risk of being
   discharged from a hospital to the lowest-quality nursing homes in a
   geographic area.
   Methods. We used the 2002 national Minimum Data Set to identify 62 601
   new Medicare admissions to nursing homes in 95 hospital service areas
   with at least 4 freestanding nursing homes and at least 50 African
   Americans aged 65 years or older with Medicare admissions to nursing
   homes.
   Results. The probability of African Americans' being admitted to nursing
   homes in the lowest-quality quartile in the area was greater (relative
   risk [RR] = 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0, 8.45) in
   comparison with Whites. Individuals without a high-school degree were
   also more likely,to be admitted to a low-quality nursing home (RR =
   1:22; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.46).
   Conclusions. African American and poorly educated patients enter the
   worst-quality nursing facilities. This, finding raises concerns about
   the usefulness of the current public reporting model for certain
   consumers.

AB Objectives. Our understanding of the relationships between perceived
   discrimination and health was limited by the cross-sectional design of
   most previous studies. We examined the longitudinal association of
   self-reported everyday discrimination with depressive symptoms and
   self-rated general health.
   Methods. Data came from 2 waves (1996 and 2001) of the Eastside Village
   Health Worker Partnership survey, a community-based participatory survey
   of African American women living on Detroit's east side (n=343). We use
   longitudinal models to test the hypothesis that a change in everyday
   discrimination over time is associated with a change in self-reported
   symptoms of depression (positive) and on self-reported general health
   status (negative).
   Results. We found that a change over time in discrimination was
   significantly associated with a change over time in depressive symptoms
   (positive) (b = 0.125; P < .001) and self-rated general health
   (negative) (b = -0.163; P < .05) independent of age, education, or
   income.
   Conclusions. The results reported here are consistent with the
   hypothesis that everyday encounters with discrimination are causally
   associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. In this sample
   of African American women, this association holds above and beyond the
   effects of income and education.

AB The progression to alcohol dependence unfolds across multiple stages,
   including the decision to initiate use, the development of regular
   patterns of use, and (for some individuals) the subsequent development
   of problems associated with alcohol use. Using data from two
   population-based, longitudinal twin studies, FinnTwin16 (FT16) and
   FinnTwin12 (FT12), we applied multiple stage genetic models (Heath et
   al., Twin Res. 5 (2002) 113) to better understand the extent to which
   genetic and environmental influences impact the initiation of alcohol
   use, frequency of use in adolescence and young adulthood, and alcohol
   problems in young adulthood. Shared environmental factors played a large
   role in initiation, and a more moderate role on frequency of use, and it
   was largely the same influences acting across these stages of use.
   However, there was no significant evidence of shared environmental
   influences on alcohol problems in early adulthood. Problems were largely
   influenced by genetic factors that overlapped with genetic influences on
   frequency of use. Unique environmental factors were largely specific to
   each stage, with some overlap between alcohol problems and frequency of
   use at age 25.

AB Are genetic and environmental risks for adolescent substance use
   specific to individual substances or general across substance classes?
   We examined this question in 645 monozygotic twin pairs, 702 dizygotic
   twin pairs, 429 biological sibling pairs, and 96 adoptive (biologically
   unrelated) sibling pairs ascertained from community-based samples, and
   ranging in age from 12 to 18 years. Substance use patterns and symptoms
   were assessed using structured psychiatric interviews. Biometrical model
   fitting was carried out using age- and sex-specific thresholds for (a)
   repeated use and (b) problem use, defined as one or more DSM-IV symptoms
   of abuse or dependence. We hypothesized that problem use would be more
   heritable than use in adolescence, and that both genetic and
   environmental risks underlying tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use and
   problem use would be significantly correlated. Results of univariate
   analyses suggested significant heritable factors for use and problem use
   for all substances with the exception of alcohol use. Shared
   environmental factors were important in all cases and special twin
   environmental factors were significant for tobacco use, tobacco problem
   use, and alcohol use. Multivariate analyses yielded significant genetic
   correlations between each of the substances (for both levels studied),
   and significant shared environmental correlations among use variables

AB The papers in this special issue have in common an interest in
   developmental variations in the heritability of substance use, abuse,
   and problems. A number of the studies are longitudinal, and even those
   that are cross-sectional are analytically focused on whether
   heritability, shared, and nonshared environmentality effects are
   constant or change over the period from onset of use to the time when
   problem use is more constant. This commentary provides an overview of
   the work from a developmental psychopathology perspective. Findings are
   linked to the existing longitudinal/developmental literature on the
   epigenesis of substance use disorders and similarities and
   contradictions are noted. Suggestions for next step work, involving the
   need for increased differentiation of the substance abuse phenotypes,
   the utilization of phenotypic measures that delineate heterogeneity of
   course, and more precise definition of the specific environmental
   variations that underlie shared and nonshared environmental liability,
   are provided.

AB Research has demonstrated a robust relationship between social status,
   physiology and health in humans and animals. However, perceptions of
   social status within a specific social group have rarely been studied in
   this area and may provide additional relevant information. The current
   investigation examines subjective perceptions of social status as a
   moderator of cognitive, emotional and cortisol responses to stressor
   tasks characterized by social-evaluative threat or its absence. As part
   of a larger study, 81 college students living in a residential dormitory
   completed a measure of their subjective perceptions of their social
   status within their dormitory floor. They were randomly assigned to
   undergo a standard performance stressor task either with or without
   social evaluation. It was hypothesized that individuals who perceived
   that they were of low status within their dorm group would show greater
   increases in negative self-evaluative emotions (i.e., shame) and
   cognitions (low social self-esteem) and greater cortisol responses to
   the stressor under conditions of social-evaluative threat. Subjective
   social status moderated cortisol responses to the social-evaluative
   stressor, but in a direction opposite that hypothesized. Individuals who
   perceived themselves to be of high status showed sizable and significant
   cortisol increases (both peak and recovery), while those who perceived
   themselves to be of low status did not mount a significant cortisol
   response to the stressor. Both groups showed increased negative
   self-evaluative responses to the tasks. A discussion of the possible
   health implications of the robust cortisol responses of high status
   individuals and the hyporesponsive cortisol reactions of low status
   individuals is provided. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB Purpose: The purpose of this analysis was to assess the impact of
   pretreatment factors on quality of life (QOL) in cancer patients.
   Methods and Materials: Pretreatment QOL (via Functional Assessment of
   Cancer Therapy [FACT], version 2) was obtained in 1,428 patients in
   several prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials
   including nonmetastatic head-and-neck (n = 1139), esophageal (n = 174),
   lung (n = 51), rectal (n = 47), and prostate (n = 17) cancer patients.
   Clinically meaningful differences between groups were defined as a
   difference of I standard error of measurement (SEM).
   Results: The mean FACT score for all patients was 86 (20.7-112) with SEM
   of 5.3. Statistically significant differences in QOL were observed based
   on age, race, Karnofsky Performance Status, marital status, education
   level, income level, and employment status, but not by gender or primary
   site. Using the SEM, there were clinically meaningful differences
   between patients <= 50 years vs. >= 65 years. Hispanics had worse QOL
   than whites. FACT increased linearly with higher Karnofsky Performance
   Status and income levels. Married patients (or live-in relationships)
   had a better QOL than single, divorced, or widowed patients. College
   graduates had better QOL than those with less education.
   Conclusion: Most pretreatment factors meaningfully influenced baseline
   QOL. The potentially devastating impact of a cancer diagnosis,
   particularly in young and minority patients, must be addressed. (c) 2006

AB Objectives: To test the relation between socioeconomic status (SES) and
   biomarkers of chronic stress, including basal cortisol, and to test
   whether these biomarkers account for the relation between SES and health
   outcomes.
   Design: Cross sectional study using data from the 2000 social and
   environmental biomarkers of aging study (SEBAS).
   Setting: Taiwan.
   Participants: Nationally representative sample of 972 men and women aged
   54 and older.
   Main outcome measures: Highest risk quartiles for 13 biomarkers
   representing functioning of the neuroendocrine system, immune/
   inflammatory systems, and the cardiovascular system: cortisol,
   adrenaline ( epinephrine), noradrenaline ( norepinephrine), serum
   dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEA-S), insulin- like growth factor 1
   (IGF1), interleukin 6 (IL6), albumin, systolic blood pressure, diastolic
   blood pressure, waist-hip ratio, total cholesterol-HDL ratio, HDL
   cholesterol, and glycosylated haemoglobin; self reported health status
   (1 - 5) and self reported mobility difficulties (0 - 6).
   Results: Lower SES men have greater odds of falling into the highest
   risk quartile for only 2 of 13 biomarkers, and show a lower risk for 3
   of the 13 biomarkers, with no association between SES and cortisol.
   Lower SES women have a higher risk for many of the cardiovascular risk
   factors, but a lower risk for increased basal readings of adrenaline,
   noradrenaline, and cortisol. Inclusion of all 13 biological markers does
   not explain the relation between SES and health outcomes in the sample.
   Conclusions: These data do not support the hypothesis that chronic
   stress, via sustained activation of stress related autonomic and
   neuroendocrine responses, is an important mediator in the relation
   between SES and health outcomes. Most notably, lower SES is not
   associated with higher basal levels of cortisol in either men or women.
   These results place an increased burden of proof on researchers who
   assert that psychosocial stress is an important pathway linking SES and
   health.

AB BACKGROUND: Homelessness is associated with high rates of health and
   substance use problems.
   OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the age, housing, health status, health
   service utilization, and drug use of the homeless population over a
   14-year period.
   DESIGN: Serial cross-sectional.
   PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,534 literally homeless adults recruited at
   service providers in San Francisco in 4 waves: 1990-1994, 1996-1998,
   1999-2000, and 2003.
   MEASUREMENTS: Age, time homeless, self-reported chronic conditions,
   hospital and emergency department utilization, and drug and alcohol use.
   RESULTS: The median age of the homeless increased from 37 to 46 over the
   study waves, at a rate of 0.66 years per calendar year (P < .01). The
   median total time homeless increased from 12 to 39.5 months (P < .01).
   Emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and chronic health
   conditions increased.
   CONCLUSIONS: The homeless population is aging by about two thirds of a
   year every calendar year, consistent with trends in several other
   cities. It is likely that the homeless are static, aging population
   cohort. The aging trends suggest that chronic conditions will become
   increasingly prominent for homeless health services. This will present
   challenges to traditional approaches to screening, prevention, and
   treatment of chronic diseases in an aging homeless population.

AB BACKGROUND: English proficiency may be important in explaining
   disparities in health and health care access among older adults.
   SUBJECTS: Population-based representative sample (N = 18,659) of adults
   age 55 and older from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey.
   METHODS: We examined whether health care access and health status vary
   among older adults who have limited English proficiency (LEP), who are
   proficient in English but also speak another language at home (EP), and
   who speak English only (EO). Weighted bivariate and multi-variate survey
   logit analyses were conducted to examine the role of language ability on
   2 aspects of access to care (not having a usual source of care, delays
   in getting care) and 2 indicators of health status (self-rated general
   health and emotional health).
   RESULTS: Limited-English proficient adults were significantly worse off
   (1.68 to 2.49 times higher risk) than EO older adults in 3 of our 4
   measures of access to care and health status. Limited-English proficient
   older adults had significantly worse access to care and health status
   than EP older adults except delays in care. English proficient adults
   had 52% increased risk of reporting poorer emotional health compared
   with EO speakers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Provision of language assistance services to patients and
   training of providers in cultural competence are 2 means by which health
   care systems could reduce linguistic barriers, improve access to care,
   and ultimately improve health status for these vulnerable populations.

AB Objective: Despite minimum-purchase-age laws, young people regularly
   drink alcohol. This study estimated the magnitude and costs of problems
   resulting from underage drinking by category-traffic crashes, violence,
   property crime, suicide, bums, drownings, fetal alcohol syndrome,
   high-risk sex, poisonings, psychoses, and dependency treatment-and
   compared those costs with associated alcohol sales. Previous studies did
   not break out costs of alcohol problems by age. Method: For each
   category of alcohol-related problems, we estimated fatal and nonfatal
   cases attributable to underage alcohol use. We multiplied
   alcohol-attributable cases by estimated costs per case to obtain total
   costs for each problem. Results: Underage drinking accounted for at
   least 16% of alcohol sales in 2001. It led to 3,170 deaths and 2.6
   million other harmful events. The estimated $61.9 billion bill (relative
   SE = 18.5%) included $5.4 billion in medical costs, $14.9 billion in
   work loss and other resource costs, and $41.6 billion in lost quality of
   life. Quality-of-life costs, which accounted for 67% of total costs,
   required challenging indirect measurement. Alcohol-attributable violence
   and traffic crashes dominated the costs. Leaving aside quality of life,
   the societal harm of $1 per drink consumed by an underage drinker
   exceeded the average purchase price of $0.90 or the associated $0.10 in
   tax revenues. Conclusions: Recent attention has focused on problems
   resulting from youth use of illicit drugs and tobacco. In light of the
   associated substantial injuries, deaths, and high costs to society,
   youth drinking behaviors merit the same kind of serious attention.

PD JUL 2006

AB Objective: The primary aim of this study was to examine whether
   admission differences in levels of spirituality predisposed
   alcohol-dependent individuals to favorable or unfavorable outcomes
   following admission to facilities that differed in the degree to which
   spirituality was emphasized. It was hypothesized that individuals whose
   admission level of spirituality was congruent with the treatment
   program's orientation and who as such were considered optimally placed
   (i.e., "matched") for treatment would evince better in-treatment
   outcomes. Method: Four hundred and five participants completed measures
   of spirituality and psychosocial well-being at intake and at end of
   treatment. Results: In examining the entire sample, no matching effects
   were observed on discharge status, abstinence efficacy, or desire to
   drink. When analyses were restricted to those cases scoring in the upper
   or lower quartiles in spirituality, we observed a paradoxical effect, as
   individuals recording lower levels of spirituality at the less spiritual
   program evinced significantly poorer outcomes (i.e., less abstinence
   efficacy, greater desire to drink). Conclusions: These findings hint at
   the importance of spirituality in the environment of care, indicating
   that individuals low in spirituality were at risk for poorer outcomes,
   but exposure to a program that emphasized spirituality lowered that
   risk.

AB Although all of us must teach against the text at times, I find myself

   and practice of qualitative research are both embedded in the folklore
   of mainstream sociology and supported by the textbooks that we use in
   our classrooms. However, many students resist instructors' attempts to
   question textbooks, which they regard as "gospel truth". How can we get
   our students to go beyond both textbook myths and mainstream folklore to
   grapple with misleading and inaccurate statements? In this article I
   suggest several strategies to raise awareness of myths about qualitative
   research, explain why several common statements about qualitative
   methods are myths, and suggest classroom strategies for engaging
   students in challenging these myths. I end with an evaluation of my own
   efforts to teach against the text in an undergraduate methods class.

AB The maximization of productivity and labor efficiency has been a
   hallmark of the American agriculture and food system. The result of
   these twin processes is an industrial, concentrated, and consolidated
   provisioning system that produces cheap and plentiful food. Many view
   this model as a panacea for providing food to a modem industrial
   workforce, yet, increasingly, others are identifying cracks in this
   system. Research shows that an abundant food supply from an industrial
   model of agriculture has hidden costs to farm family stability, rural
   community well-being, and human and ecosystem health. A recent turn in
   this research has shifted away from the identification of weaknesses
   toward the exploration of viable options to redesign the food system in
   a manner that ensures long term sustainability. Civic agriculture is one
   such model that includes community-embedded initiatives to re-localize
   agriculture in communities of place, while enhancing food security,
   literacy, safety, and rebuilding rural communities. In this paper, I
   detail an exercise to teach the concept of civic agriculture through the
   development of community-based learning in the form of global and local
   public learning communities, service-learning advocacy, and
   international exchange. To demonstrate the comparative nature of
   agriculture and food system changes, as well as emerging models of
   sustainability, I developed a partnership with a Hungarian class which
   allowed students to compare and contrast approaches to sustainable
   development and probe the role of history and culture as causal forces
   in these endeavors. I describe my efforts to develop this partnership
   and weave opportunities for service-learning advocacy into the
   curriculum.

AB Although many of us would like to get beyond lecturing, we often lack
   concrete strategies for doing so, particularly in our larger classes.
   This paper suggests one such strategy for creating a discussion-based
   course. The success of such a course is predicated on students reading
   and thinking about the course material (receiving "first exposure")
   prior to attending class so that class time can be devoted to more
   substantively engaging activities grounded in guided discussion. The
   vehicle I propose for achieving this first exposure to the course
   material is the "Course Preparation Assignment" (CPA). This article
   explains the rationale for discussion-based courses, describes the
   development and use of CPAs, and assesses a discussion-based course by
   comparing it to a traditional lecture course on several outcomes. The
   assessment reveals that the use of these assignments to create a
   discussion-based course has been a great success, allowing me to foster
   student engagement with the course material by spending the majority of
   class time coordinating, facilitating, and leading discussions, rather
   than constantly lecturing at the students.

   misconceptions, resistance, retention, and transfer. I analyze the use
   of this combined method in a course on racial and ethnic relations and
   provide examples to suggest that students commonly use four ideologies
   to understand racial and ethnic inequality: blaming the victim,
   justification, naturalization, and colorblind racism. I describe how I
   helped students identify and unlearn these ideological misconceptions
   and replace them with a sociological conceptual framework. I analyze the
   results of a pre-test, post-test, and follow-up test showing that
   students' use of ideology declined on each subsequent exam while their
   use of sociology increased during the semester and was partially
   retained months later. Finally I discuss the study's limitations and the
   utility of students learning the falseness of ideology.

   in recent national reports on higher education. This article shows how
   instructors can use a current article from the American Sociological
   Review (ASR) to facilitate moral reflection and global awareness. The
   ASR article, with its focus on the political implications of moral
   cosmologies of Muslims, its cross-national methodology, and its
   non-western geographical focus, is well suited to these pedagogical
   goals. We offer active learning exercises designed to promote ethical
   examination and global understandings in an introductory sociology
   course, a theory course, and an upper-level course on political
   sociology, sociology of religion, or globalization.

AB This case study examines the socioeconomic changes that took place
   between 1990 and 2000 in and around lands managed by the Bureau of Land
   Management (BLM) Coos Bay District in southwestern Oregon for purposes
   of assessing the effects of the Northwest Forest Plan (the Plan) on
   rural economies and communities in the Coos Bay region. The case study
   included an analysis of changes in the district's programs, as well as
   socioeconomic changes that occurred within the communities of Coos Bay,
   Myrtle Point, and Reedsport. Data were gathered during 2003 and 2004
   from multiple sources including U.S. census databases, county and state
   criminal justice and economic development databases, and BLM annual
   reports. Interviews with BLM employees and community residents provided
   additional insights on how the Plan affected local socioeconomic
   conditions and the district's interactions with local communities.The
   study indicates that by the time the record of decision for the Plan was
   signed, the Coos Bay region's timber sector had already lost a
   substantial portion of the wood products processing capacity and
   employment opportunities. Additionally, the changes in socioeconomic
   conditions that took place in the mid and late 1990s-an outflow of
   younger workers, inmigration of older workers and retirees, school
   closures, increased levels of educational attainment, declines in
   manufacturing sectors, and expansion of the services sector-are changes
   that took place during the same period in rural communities across much
   of the Western United States. It is thus likely that the types of
   overall socioeconomic changes observed in the Coos Bay region between
   1990 and 2004 would have occurred with or without the Plan.Owing to
   legal challenges, the Coos Bay District was unable to provide a steady
   and predictable supply of timber from 1994 onward. District foresters
   shifted their focus toward developing thinning techniques for density
   management of stands less than 80 years old. Barring legal action, sales
   from these younger stands will enable the district to provide a
   predictable supply of smaller diameter timber in future years. In the
   post-Plan years, the Coos Bay District also significantly expanded its
   capacity to carry out multiple-use land management. It played a key role
   in community-based watershed restoration and recreation and tourism
   development efforts. As a result, the district is now in a much better
   position to provide the public, including residents of local
   communities, with a broad array of forest values and opportunities
   (i.e., improved fish habitat, more recreation sites, more cultural
   sites, etc.). Key factors in the success of post-Plan community-district
   partnerships included ongoing and substantial support from upper level
   leadership, a stable district budget (in marked contrast to the budget
   declines in neighboring national forests), and a relatively stable
   staffing level (in contrast to the downsizing that occurred in
   neighboring national forests).

AB Recent behavioral experiments aimed at understanding the evolutionary
   foundations of human cooperation have suggested that a willingness to
   engage in costly punishment, even in one-shot situations, may be part of
   human psychology and a key element in understanding our sociality.
   However, because most experiments have been confined to students in
   industrialized societies, generalizations of these insights to the
   species have necessarily been tentative. Here, experimental results from
   15 diverse populations show that (i) all populations demonstrate some
   willingness to administer costly punishment as unequal behavior
   increases, (ii) the magnitude of this punishment varies substantially
   across populations, and (iii) costly punishment positively covaries with
   altruistic behavior across populations. These findings are consistent
   with models of the gene-culture coevolution of human altruism and
   further sharpen what any theory of human cooperation needs to explain.

AB Life expectancy is commonly used to summarize the life-time mortality
   experience of a population. Differences in life expectancy are
   well-known across different levels of socioeconomic status such as
   income and education. A recent simulation study of potential life-years
   lost has shown the effects that major diseases contribute to differences
   in life expectancy at birth. We propose a general methodology to
   decompose life expectancy and expected life-years lost by disease in
   order to determine the contribution of diseases to differences in life
   expectancy at each given age. We show that the estimates for the life
   expectancy, expected life-years lost and their variances at each age can
   be computed backward recursively from an old age. The difference in life
   expectancy between groups will be shown to include contributions from
   diseases and life-year differences which occur after an old age cut-off
   beyond which the contribution of diseases cannot be easily determined.
   Diseases will be grouped into 14 major disease categories. Data from the
   National Longitudinal Mortality Study will be used for demonstration
   purposes. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB Problem: Priority health-risk behaviors, which contribute to the leading
   causes of morbidity and mortality among youth and adults, often are
   established during childhood and adolescence, extend into adulthood, are
   interrelated, and are preventable.Reporting Period Covered: October
   2004-January 2006.Description of the System: The Youth Risk Behavior
   Surveillance System (YRBSS) monitors six categories of priority
   health-risk behaviors among youth and young adults, including behaviors
   that contribute to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use;
   alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to
   unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including
   human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections; unhealthy dietary
   behaviors; and physical inactivity. In addition, the YRBSS monitors
   general health status and the prevalence of overweight and asthma. YRBSS
   includes a national school-based survey conducted by CDC and state and
   local school-based surveys conducted by state and local education and
   health agencies. This report summarizes results from the national
   survey, 40 state surveys, and 21 local surveys conducted among students
   in grades 9-12 during October 2004-January 2006.Results: In the United
   States, 71% of all deaths among persons aged 10-24 years result from
   four causes: motor-vehicle crashes, other unintentional injuries,
   homicide, and suicide. Results from the 2005 national Youth Risk
   Behavior Survey (YRBS) indicated that, during the 30 days preceding the
   survey, many high school students engaged in behaviors that increased
   their likelihood of death from these four causes: 9.9% had driven a car
   or other vehicle when they had been drinking alcohol; 18.5% had carried
   a weapon; 43.3% had drunk alcohol; and 20.2% had used marijuana. In
   addition, during the 12 months preceding the survey, 35.9% of high
   school students had been in a physical fight and 8.4% had attempted
   suicide. Substantial morbidity and social problems among youth also
   result from unintended pregnancies and STDs, including HIV infection.
   During 2005, a total of 46.8% of high school students had ever had
   sexual intercourse; 37.2% of sexually active high school students had
   not used a condom at last sexual intercourse; and 2.1% had ever injected
   an illegal drug. Among adults aged >= 25 years, 61% of all deaths result
   from two causes: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Results from the
   2005 national YRBS indicated that risk behaviors associated with these
   two causes of death were initiated during adolescence. During 2005, a
   total of 23.0% of high school students had smoked cigarettes during the
   30 days preceding the survey; 79.9% had not eaten >= 5 times/day of
   fruits and vegetables during the 7 days preceding the survey; 67.0% did
   not attend physical education classes daily; and 13.1% were
   overweight.Interpretation: Since 1991, the prevalence of many
   health-risk behaviors among high school students nationwide has
   decreased. However, many high school students continue to engage in
   behaviors that place them at risk for the leading causes of mortality
   and morbidity. The prevalence of many health-risk behaviors varies
   across cities and states.Public Health Action: YRBS data are used to
   measure progress toward achieving 15 national health objectives for
   Healthy People 2010 and three of the 10 leading health indicators, to
   assess trends in priority health-risk behaviors among high school
   students, and to evaluate the impact of broad school and community
   interventions at the national, state, and local levels. More effective
   school health programs and other policy and programmatic interventions
   are needed to reduce risk and improve health outcomes among youth.

AB Are American attitudes toward economic inequality different from those
   in other countries? One tradition in sociology suggests American
   "exceptionalism," while another argues for convergence across nations in
   social norms, such as attitudes toward inequality. This article uses
   International Social Survey Program (ISSP) microdata to compare
   attitudes in different countries toward what individuals in specific
   occupations "do earn " and what they "should earn," and to distinguish
   value preferences for more egalitarian outcomes from other confounding
   attitudes and perceptions. The authors suggest a method for summarizing
   individual preferences for the leveling of earnings and use kernel
   density estimates to describe and compare the distribution of individual
   preferences over time and cross-nationally. They find that subjective
   estimates of inequality in pay diverge substantially from actual data,
   and that although Americans do not, on the average, have different
   preferences for aggregate (in)equality, there is evidence for:
   1. Less awareness concerning the extent of inequality at the top of the
   income distribution in America
   2. More polarization in attitudes among Americans
   3. Similar preferences for "leveling down" at the top of the earnings
   distribution in the United States, but also
   4. Less concern for reducing differentials at the bottom of the
   distribution.

AB Effects of age and the calendar year when individuals first
   self-identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual on their sexual orientation
   identity development were examined in a large community sample (N=767,
   47% female, 18-74-years-old). These 2 variables were used to examine the
   timing and sequencing of 7 coming-out experiences: first awareness of
   same-sex attraction; first sexual experiences with opposite-sex
   partners; first sexual experiences with same-sex partners;
   self-identification as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; disclosure to someone
   other than a parent; disclosure to mother; and disclosure to father. The
   significant effects of age revealed that self-identification in
   adolescence as opposed to adulthood was associated with an overall young
   coming-out trajectory for all milestone experiences, which occurred in
   both earlier and recent historical contexts. Adolescents as opposed to
   adult self-identifiers were also more likely to demonstrate
   identity-centered sequences in which self-identification preceded
   same-sex sexual experiences, and fewer of these individuals had any
   heterosexual experience. Significant historical context effects
   indicated recent trends toward younger disclosure of orientation to
   others and to parents, greater likelihood of an identity-centered
   sequence, and younger ages for first heterosexual but not same-sex,
   sexual experiences. Among women, there was a recent trend toward greater
   likelihood of having a bisexual identity milestone. In general, the
   maturational effects were independent of historical context, with the
   exception that only adolescent self-identifiers who came out recently
   disclosed to others and to parents at an average age younger than 18
   years. These developmental and historical trends expand on the
   stage-sequential framework to show how the process of sexual orientation
   identity development is driven by maturational factors as well as social
   changes.

AB A multitude of factors influence condom use self-efficacy, including
   age, gender, ethnicity, condom use attitudes and barriers, sexual
   experience, and partner characteristics. The current study integrated
   past research by evaluating these factors in a large, ethnically diverse
   university sample of women and men (N=665). The role of gender on condom
   use and sexuality variables was assessed across ethnic groups.
   Hierarchical linear regressions were then calculated to explain levels
   of condom use self-efficacy using the hypothesized sexual predictors in
   nonvirgin, sexually active, and recent condom use subsamples. Predictors
   explained 18-45% of variance in condom use self-efficacy. Findings
   suggest that a few key variables accounted for the majority of variance
   in condom use self-efficacy: condom use attitudes, condom use barriers,
   satisfaction with sexual communication, anticipated number of sexual
   partners, one-time sexual encounters, and ethnic identity. Significant
   gender differences emerged in condom use self-efficacy, condom use
   attitudes, and condom use behaviors. Ethnic differences were found in
   range of sexual experience and sexual partner characteristics. It is
   recommended that future studies examining sexual risk behavior
   incorporate the diverse sexual factors that affect condom use
   self-efficacy.

AB Despite numerous studies that measure self-reported condom use, there is
   currently no agreed upon "gold standard" in terms of the best way to
   assess condom use. The purpose of the current study was to review
   measures of self-reported condom use within correlational studies of
   sexual risk behavior, and to evaluate such measures on the basis of
   suggestions from the methodological literature. An additional purpose
   was to examine specifically whether measures published in the
   correlational literature have improved over time. A systematic review of
   studies was undertaken and specific review criteria were used to guide
   the inclusion of studies. A final set of 56 studies that contained 72
   measures of self-reported condom use were included in the review. These
   measures were coded and evaluated on 12 dimensions, including measure
   type, number of response categories, recall period, sex partner
   specificity, and sex act specificity. Results indicated a great amount
   of diversity in terms of how condom use has been measured in the
   literature. Although results indicated that measures published between
   1996 and 2003 were of higher quality on a number of dimensions as
   compared to 1989-1995, a number of these gains were minimal and in some
   cases measures have decreased in quality. The overall conclusion is that
   the sexual risk behavior literature should implement more of the
   recommendations made by methodological scholars in this area. Specific
   recommendations are summarized and presented in a way that may be
   helpful in guiding the development of future measures of self-reported
   condom use.

AB In early modern Venice, establishing the cause of a disease was critical
   to determining the appropriate cure: natural remedies for natural
   illnesses, spiritual solutions for supernatural or demonic ones. One
   common ailment was the French disease (syphilis), widely distributed
   throughout Venice's neighborhoods and social hierarchy, and evenly
   distributed between men and women. The disease was widely regarded as
   curable by the mid-sixteenth century, and cases that did not respond to
   natural remedies presented problems of interpretation to physicians and
   laypeople. Witchcraft Was one possible explanation; using expert
   testimony from physicians, however, the Holy Office ruled out witchcraft
   as a cause of incurable cases and reinforced perceptions that the
   disease was of natural origin. Incurable cases were explained as the
   result of immoral behavior, thereby reinforcing the associated stigma.
   This article uses archival material from Venice's Inquisition records
   from 1580 to 1650, as, well as mortality data.

   for its initiation and for its long duration. Racism, bureaucratic
   inertia, and the personal motivations of study personnel have been
   suggested as possible explanations. We develop another explanation by
   examining the educational and professional linkages shared by three key
   physicians who launched and directed the study. PHS surgeon general Hugh
   Cumming initiated Tuskegee, and assistant surgeons general Taliaferro
   Clark and Raymond A. Vonderlehr presided over the study during its first
   decade. All three had graduated from the medical school at the
   University of Virginia, a center of eugenics teaching, where students
   were trained to think about race as a key factor in both the etiology
   and the natural history of syphilis. Along with other senior officers in
   the PHS, they were publicly aligned with the eugenics movement. Tuskegee
   provided a vehicle for testing a eugenic hypothesis: that racial groups
   were differentially susceptible to infectious diseases.

   evaluated the neural basis for these cultural differences in an
   event-related fMRI study. East Asian and American participants
   incidentally encoded pictures of (1) a target object alone, (2) a
   background scene with no discernable target object, and (3) a distinct
   target object against a meaningful background. Americans, relative to
   East Asians, activated more regions implicated in object processing,
   including bilateral middle temporal gyrus, left superior
   parietal/angular gyrus, and right superior temporal/supramarginal gyrus.
   In contrast to the cultural differences in object-processing areas, few
   differences emerged in background-processing regions. These results
   suggest that cultural experiences subtly direct neural activity,
   particularly for focal objects, at an early stage of scene encoding.

   thousands of families. The combination of a sense of lateness ( lagging
   behind national and global development) and an emerging progrowth
   coalition between local governments and real estate developers is
   shaping post-Mao urban redevelopment. Several forms of civic opposition
   and popular discontent have been elicited by the restructuring. Although
   largely marginalized, these alternative views of urban forms and
   counterpractices help sustain a much-needed critical point of view that
   questions and destabilizes the seemingly inescapable machine of

   hand, the political openings created by the end of the bipolar postwar
   world have allowed what Eleanor Roosevelt described as the "curious
   grapevine" of nongovernmental actors to carry ideas and practices
   associated with universal human rights into different parts of the world
   as part of broader transnational development activities. On the other
   hand, this spread of human rights discourse has only magnified the
   different problems at the heart of human rights, problems that are
   theoretical, practical, and phenomenological. Anthropology has an
   important part to play in addressing these problems and in suggesting
   ways in which human rights can be reframed so that their original
   purposes, those embodied in documents like the UDHR, stand a better
   chance of being realized.

AB Evolutionary theory predicts that males will provide less parental
   investment for putative offspring who are unlikely to be their actual
   offspring. Cross-culturally, paternity confidence ( a man's assessment
   of the likelihood that he is the father of a putative child) is
   positively associated with men's involvement with children and with
   investment or inheritance from paternal kin. A survey of 67 studies
   reporting nonpaternity suggests that for men with high paternity
   confidence rates of nonpaternity are( excluding studies of unknown
   methodology) typically 1.9%, substantially less than the typical rates
   of 10% or higher cited by many researchers. Further cross-cultural
   investigation of the relationship between paternity and paternity
   confidence is warranted.

AB Social complexity and sustainability emerge from successful problem
   solving, rather than directly from environmental conditions. Social
   complexity develops from problem solving at all scales from local to
   national and international. Complexity in problem solving is an economic
   function, and can both support and hinder sustainability. Sustainability
   outcomes may take decades or centuries to develop. Historical studies
   reveal three outcomes to long-term change in problem-solving
   institutions: collapse, resiliency through simplification, or continuity
   based on growing complexity and increasing energy subsidies. The slow
   development of complexity in problem solving makes its effects difficult
   to perceive, especially over short time periods. Long-term social
   sustainability depends on understanding and controlling complexity. New
   strategies to mitigate or control complexity are offered. (c) 2006

AB This paper is a work-in-progress account of ideas and propositions about
   resilience in social-ecological systems. It articulates our
   understanding of how these complex systems change and what determines
   their ability to absorb disturbances in either their ecological or their
   social domains. We call them "propositions" because, although they are
   useful in helping us understand and compare different social-ecological
   systems, they are not sufficiently well defined to be considered formal
   hypotheses. These propositions were developed in two workshops, in 2003
   and 2004, in which participants compared the dynamics of 15 case studies
   in a wide range of regions around the world. The propositions raise many
   questions, and we present a list of some that could help define the next
   phase of resilience-related research.

TI Scale mismatches in social-ecological systems: Causes, consequences, and
   solutions
SO ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY
VL 11

PD JUN 2006
PY 2006
AB Scale is a concept that transcends disciplinary boundaries. In ecology
   and geography, scale is usually defined in terms of spatial and temporal
   dimensions. Sociological scale also incorporates space and time, but
   adds ideas about representation and organization. Although spatial and
   temporal location determine the context for social and ecological
   dynamics, social-ecological interactions can create dynamic feedback
   loops in which humans both influence and are influenced by ecosystem
   processes. We hypothesize that many of the problems encountered by
   societies in managing natural resources arise because of a mismatch
   between the scale of management and the scale(s) of the ecological
   processes being managed. We use examples from southern Africa and the
   southern United States to address four main questions: ( 1) What is a
   "scale mismatch?" ( 2) How are scale mismatches generated? ( 3) What are
   the consequences of scale mismatches? ( 4) How can scale mismatches be
   resolved? Scale mismatches occur when the scale of environmental
   variation and the scale of social organization in which the
   responsibility for management resides are aligned in such a way that one
   or more functions of the social-ecological system are disrupted,
   inefficiencies occur, and/or important components of the system are
   lost. They are generated by a wide range of social, ecological, and
   linked social-ecological processes. Mismatches between the scales of
   ecological processes and the institutions that are responsible for
   managing them can contribute to a decrease in social-ecological
   resilience, including the mismanagement of natural resources and a
   decrease in human well-being. Solutions to scale mismatches usually
   require institutional changes at more than one hierarchical level.
   Long-term solutions to scale mismatch problems will depend on social
   learning and the development of flexible institutions that can adjust
   and reorganize in response to changes in ecosystems. Further research is
   needed to improve our ability to diagnose, understand, and resolve scale
   mismatches in linked social-ecological systems.

PD JUN 2006
PY 2006
AB Formal models used to study the resilience of social-ecological systems
   have not explicitly included important structural characteristics of
   this type of system. In this paper, we propose a network perspective for
   social-ecological systems that enables us to better focus on the
   structure of interactions between identifiable components of the system.
   This network perspective might be useful for developing formal models
   and comparing case studies of social-ecological systems. Based on an
   analysis of the case studies in this special issue, we identify three
   types of social-ecological networks: ( 1) ecosystems that are connected
   by people through flows of information or materials, ( 2) ecosystem
   networks that are disconnected and fragmented by the actions of people,
   and ( 3) artificial ecological networks created by people, such as
   irrigation systems. Each of these three archytypal social-ecological
   networks faces different problems that influence its resilience as it
   responds to the addition or removal of connections that affect its
   coordination or the diffusion of system attributes such as information
   or disease.

AB Objective: Current and past research strongly indicates a high
   prevalence of schizophrenia in the lower class in the USA and other
   stratified societies. To date. no study has tested for a connection
   between type of schizophrenia and socioeconomic status (SES). We tested
   for an interrelationship between schizophrenic subtype, SES and race.
   Methods: Positive and negative symptom scales were used to evaluate 436
   schizophrenic patients at a state hospital in the USA. All patients were
   also diagnosed by DSM standards. Social class of origin was assessed by
   the Occupational Classification Distributions of the U.S. Bureau of the
   Census. Multivariate analysis was conducted with the likelihood ratio
   chi-square.
   Results: We uncovered a distinct propensity for deficit schizophrenia to
   be elevated among the poor. The finding presents as a pure SES effect
   since the likelihood of deficit schizophrenia does not vary by race when
   social class is held constant.
   Conclusion: The finding is potentially an important new insight into the
   epidemiology of schizophrenia. It offers a better understanding for poor
   outcome among lower class patients in stratified societies such as the
   United States. It is also consistent with longitudinal research by
   European investigators. (c) 2006 Elsevier SAS. All rights reserved.

AB Theory in the sociology of religion suggests that a prerequisite for
   cooperative coalitions among religious groups on political matters is a
   decline in sectarianism. In analyses of survey data I show that
   sectarianism has receded for the religious left but not the religious
   right. Groups that would comprise the religious right are less likely to
   want the other conservative religious groups to have an influence on
   public opinion, while groups oil the left are less opposed to other
   liberal groups having influence. It is particularly clear that
   conservative Protestants are wary of the influence of Catholics. I also
   conduct exploratory analyses to examine who, among the members of the
   religious groups who would comprise the religious right, is more
   sectarian. I find that while demographics are largely nondeterminative,
   those who are supportive of religiously-based politics are the least
   sectarian.

AB This study examined whether psychosocial and cultural factors were
   related to four dimensions of cardiac-related quality of life (global,
   physical, emotional, and social functioning) in 120 Hispanic coronary
   heart disease (CHD) outpatients in south Florida. Survey data were
   collected on sociodemographic (age, gender, socioeconomic status),
   psychosocial (depression, social support), and cultural factors
   (acculturation, familism, fatalism), and quality of life. Medical data
   on CHD severity (New York Heart Association class, time since diagnosis)
   were obtained from patients' clinic records. Hierarchical regression
   analyses revealed that women and patients with more severe CHD had
   poorer quality of life than men or patients with less severe CHD.
   Psychosocial and cultural factors were associated with poorer quality of
   life after controlling for sociodemographic and medical variables:
   Depression was associated with all four quality of life dimensions (p <
   .001); and fatalism (p < .05) was associated with lower social
   functioning in women. These findings identify Hispanic subgroups with
   poor cardiac-related quality of life that can benefit from special
   outreach.
