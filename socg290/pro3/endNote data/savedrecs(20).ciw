AB A constitutive view of metaphor is used to examine speeches of Lyndon
   Johnson and Ronald Reagan.  This analysis shows Johnson's establishment
   of the metaphor of the footrace to describe life in the United States
   and Reagan's attempt to contest this metaphor.  Johnson's rhetoric
   appealed to the notion of the ''starting line'' and the need for
   government to establish equal competitive conditions.  Reagan appealed
   to the ''runners'' and argued that individual competitors need to rely
   on athletic ''character'' rather than government to succeed.  It is
   argued that attention to the sport metaphor in public discourse as well
   as to the theoretical points raised in its analysis is needed in the
   sociology of sport.

AB According to adherents of instructional technologies (as well as

   classrooms should result in enhanced cognitive, behavioral, and
   affective outcomes.  In an experimental test of these propositions, I
   employed a variety of computer-based educational activities over several
   quarters.  Students overwhelmingly favored individual activities of this
   sort, but they just as strongly rejected the possibility of adding more
   of these exercises.  Furthermore, one-tailed t-tests comparing the
   experimental with the control classes yielded no significant differences
   either in overall material mastery or in overall attitude toward
   instruction.  Several explanations for support of the null hypothesis
   are proposed.

   debate--has been depicted in 53 criminology textbooks published from
   1956 to 1965 and from 1983 to 1992.  My data show that despite dramatic
   shifts in criminological thinking from determinism toward a more
   moderate position on the choice debate, most criminology textbooks in
   both periods favor a deterministic view.  I conclude with a call for
   sociologists as teachers to reflect carefully about how they depict the
   choice debate to their students.

AB Hidden within Max Weber's Ancient Judaism, 'The Sociology of Religion'
   chapter in Economy and Society, and The Religion of China lies a causal
   explanation for the rise of monotheism in ancient Israel.  Weber's
   powerful analysis becomes apparent only if reconstructed by reference to
   central tenets of the causal methodology that underlie his diverse
   substantive texts.  If 'adequate casuality' is to be achieved, (a)
   facilitating and necessary orientations of action, and (b) synchronic
   and diachronic interactions of action must be present.  Yet Weber's
   causal methodology does not involve simply a 'weighing' of positive or
   favouring orientations of action against obstructing action; nor does it
   rely upon linear 'causal chain' procedures.  Rather, the conjunctural
   interactions of patterned action that occur within a context of
   patterned action are pivotal.  This three-stage methodology guides this
   reconstruction of Weber's analysis of the rise of monotheism.

AB This paper examines the history of the sociology of knowledge in light
   of the two problems that have systematically thwarted all efforts to
   fulfil its promise:  the self-defeating relativization of knowledge and
   the circularity of knowledge and society that the theories imply.  The
   paper looks at the strategies that social scientists have developed to
   overcome (and sometimes ignore) these problems, and building on the work
   of Clifford Geertz and Thomas Kuhn advances the concept of a cultural
   paradigm as an alternative approach.  To clarify the questions of the
   sociology of knowledge and exemplify the usefulness of the new
   perspective, the paper briefly explores the historical and cultural
   contexts that helped constitute an idea of the person as a player of
   roles.  Shakespeare notwithstanding, the perception of the person as a
   role-player, the paper suggests, is to be seen as a central element in
   the production of modernity - of an eminently American, eminently
   middle-class sort of modernity whose development it reflected and helped
   to shape.  The incorporation rather than the denial of relativism and
   circularity within this framework are discussed in the conclusion.

AB In Goffman's introduction to Interaction Ritual, he implores
   sociologists ''to identify the countless patterns and natural sequences
   of behavior occurring whenever persons come into one another's immediate
   presence.''  This article, in addressing Goffman's entreaty, amalgamates
   a number of sociological theories on interaction ritual from Durkheim
   and Goffman with others in contemporary literatures in the sociology of
   emotions and social psychology to describe a set of ''patterns and
   natural sequences of behavior'' imbedded in voices of interaction
   partners.  These patterns are shown to establish an element of social
   structure, and this research describes an objective method of
   identifying and measuring this element that previously was known on a
   qualitative basis alone.  A social status ordering pattern founded upon
   interpersonal deference and power relations is identified through
   analysis of acoustic energy levels in voices of interview partners. 
   Nonverbal measures are performed using a dual-channel Fast Fourier
   Transform analyzer and results are explained using a carrier spectrum
   model.  This report sets forth an interesting new way of objectively
   measuring the macro social constraints on micro interaction.

AB This article attempts to illuminate the phenomenology of clinical
   depression by making it sociologically intelligible.  It proceeds from
   the fundamental premise of the sociology of medicine that there is a
   dialectical relationship between illness and social experience. 
   Throughout, it explores the paradox that depressed persons greatly
   desire connection while they are simultaneously deprived of the ability
   to realize it.  In-depth interview data from 35 persons diagnosed and
   treated for clinical depression suggest that four factors interact
   synergistically to deepen depression's isolation:  (1) the intrinsic
   character of the emotional experience of depression, (2) the failure of
   individuals to have a clear vocabulary for understanding their own
   predicament, (3) the incomprehensibility of depression to ''normals,''
   and (4) the stigma attached to ''going public'' with one's problem.  The
   article concludes by outlining a research agenda that links the
   incidence of depression to structural factors diminishing social
   connection.

AB This article explores the excuses undercover narcotics officers in high
   schools make to maintain social distance (i.e., affective detachment)
   from students.  Social distance is necessary to prevent students from
   later claiming in court they were entrapped.  Officers used four
   social-distancing techniques, each linked to particular conditions and
   circumstances:  (1) claims of existing interpersonal attachment, (2)
   parental-recrimination excuses, (3) extracurricular-role-obligation
   excuses, and (4) feigned interest followed by unforeseen-circumstance
   excuses or appeals to defeasibility.  Discussion focuses on the
   conceptual importance of social-distancing excuses for the sociology of
   accounts.  The data's larger microstructural implications are considered
   through the notion of attenuated ties.  I interviewed 30 undercover
   officers operating out of a large U.S. city.

AB Retracing my own research experience in creating a sociological
   narrative about a famous industrial engineer and mother, I describe how
   I began to question modernist images of self, interests, and power. As I
   reflected on how best to characterize Gilbreth's management of women, I
   began to see that my notion of how to write critical, historical
   biography rested heavily on a binary, modernist conceptual foundation.
   My research experience rocked this foundation by convincing me that we
   should see selves as multiple and interests as malleable, and that we
   should broaden our conception of power to include disciplinary power
   which circulates through people rather than belonging to them. The paper
   concludes by affirming the merits of new ways of writing about people
   that acknowledge their multiple selves without sacrificing the political
   strength of modernist language.

AB We formulate a comprehensive theory that accounts for variation in the

   pass slowly (protracted duration) when conscious information processing
   is high; lived time is perceived to be synchronized with clock time
   (synchronicity) when conscious information processing is moderate; and
   lived time is perceived to have passed quickly (temporal compression)
   when conscious information processing is low. We examine that portion of
   the theory concerning temporal compression in light of empirical
   materials. Since episodic memory erodes as time passes, we hypothesize
   that this generates the experience of temporal compression by lowering
   the density of conscious information processing. Our data were drawn
   from three different age cohorts, and we find strong support for the
   hypothesis.

AB The social philosophy of meaning and emotions represented in the work of
   Susanne Langer was recognized by Talcott Parsons, but has yet to be
   incorporated into mainstream sociological theoritizations.  Langer's
   work is as potentially important to contemporary microsociology, and the
   sociology of emotions, as the work of Peirce, Mead, or Schutz.  The
   impediment to appreciating her work resides in contemporary confusions
   regarding the nature of logic.  Sociologists often subscribe to
   Wittgenstein's denial of the validity of formal logic in constructing
   theories of human behavior.  Langer has been misunderstood because her
   theoretizations address more than discursive logics and meanings.  The
   thrust of Langer's work is that logic and meaning exist on a
   nondiscursive level of emotions.  Though her work is more than 50 years
   old, we are now in a position to appreciate it because we are now
   exploring and conceptualizing the notion of social inferencing as
   existing beyond formal logic.

AB Recent research has revealed that war-making has played an important
   role in molding society and has precipitated a new look at
   state-building, the relationship between the state and society, and the
   ties between war-making and capitalism. In this study, I illuminate
   weaknesses in the received view of regional processes, and I demonstrate
   the value of bringing the state into analyses of regional
   transformation. Case studies of the steel industry, airframe
   manufacturers, and military installations contrast pre- and postwar
   trends to determine if the state's World War II investments transformed
   regional processes or if wartime investments merely reinforced processes
   that were already underway. For the steel industry, the
   civilian-oriented and economistic reasoning of the received view of
   regional processes is most persuasive. In contrast, the state's wartime
   logistic and strategic priorities molded the dramatic expansion of U.S.
   military bases during the war-growth machine politics played an
   important secondary role. The airframe industry offers the most
   interesting case-the economic influences on this industry intersected
   with both military and political factors. Thus, this study provides
   evidence that regional processes are molded by the overlapping, and at
   times competing, needs for use of space by economic, political, and
   military actors. The immediate lesson is that it is important to bring
   the study of war-making into the sociological mainstream.

AB Cultural sociologists and those studying socialization share an interest
   in understanding the ways in which media are important within social
   life. Studies of mass media include those focusing on the production of
   culture, the content of cultural products, and individual
   interpretations of media images. However, a fourth domain in cultural
   studies, the social world, or the context in which media are
   experienced, has been disregarded. This ethnographic analysis of an
   adolescent microculture uses a unique method for studying media
   influence a group of friends in their natural school setting
   spontaneously and collectively make gendered meanings based on media
   content. The influence of mass media on gender relations can be seen as
   the boys produce and reproduce meanings, based on stereotypical media
   messages, within their peer group. This occurs through appropriating
   scenes from cable television films that embody traditional male culture,
   identifying with the models of masculinity available through media
   content and imputing stereotypical notions of gender to the mass media.
   Integrating this important fourth realm of cultural studies-the social
   world of media-with an interpretive reproduction approach to
   socialization provides a fuller understanding of how mass media are
   influential within modem society.

AB In a thought-provoking appraisal of the state of macrosociological
   theory, Gerhard Lenski argues that its shortcomings can be rectified, in
   part, by reference to nomological reasoning. Moreover, developments in
   behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics offer
   interesting insights into analyses of social behavior across time and
   space and, in the process, reveal some useful hints about the manner in
   which sociocultural theorists might proceed in developing more elegant
   theoretical statements. With these considerations in mind, the argument
   elaborated in this essay suggests: (1) that contemporary sociocultural
   science has much to contribute to the development of a general theory of
   social behavior; (2) that theory refinement in the sociocultural
   sciences can be enhanced significantly by reference to general
   principles (specifically, an amended version of the ''maximization
   principle'') developed in recent years in the evolutionary behavioral
   sciences; and (3) that reliance on such general analytical principles is
   enormously helpful in clarifying some seemingly troublesome theoretical
   problems in, for example, studies of social demography and human ecology
   and of social stratification and mobility.

AB Outside of sociology, evolutionary theory is once again commanding
   widespread attention in social science. Having sat out the spirited
   debates over sociobiology in the 1970s, most sociologists are largely
   unaware that the field has prospered and is now a respected,
   interdisciplinary science with a growing number of influential scholars
   within the social sciences. This article takes a critical look at
   sociobiology with a consideration of both its historical origins and its
   now modified theoretical stance, which is exemplified by Timothy
   Crippen's article 'Toward a Neo-Darwinian Sociology.'' In addition, this
   essay summarizes an alternative approach that might be called
   ''evolutionary sociology. '' While it also incorporates the Modem
   Synthesis, it uses established sociological methods and theory, along
   with primate data and the fossil and archaeological records, to consider
   the biological legacy of humankind.

AB Sociologists have been unusually reluctant to incorporate into their

   genuinely evolutionary approaches is expressed, to varying degrees, in
   the reactions of Freese and Maryanski to my essay on neo-Darwinian
   sociology. In this brief response to their comments, I suggest that
   these general reservations are grounded in an unnecessary fear of
   resurgent Social Darwinism, unwarranted concerns regarding determinism
   and reductionism, unjustified allegations of teleology and tautology,
   and/or general misconceptions of the logic and principles of
   neo-Darwinian theory.

AB The article begins by underscoring the widely noted ''sociological
   crisis'' and the message from the history of science that the crisis may
   be susceptible to resolution through an application of a general law
   pertaining to a neighboring science (sociobiology in our case). From
   here, the article proceeds to pinpoint the basic argument of Professor
   Crippen's article (this issue) and then critically examines the two
   articles that critically accompany it. We find some errors of
   interpretation in Professor Maryanski's article, but on the whole it is
   a constructive critique of Crippen's essay and a related invitation to a
   biologically informed evolutionary sociology. By contrast, Professor
   Freese's interminable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and
   in the process offers a tortuous, tendentious itinerary of politically
   correct interpretations of scientific inquiry in general and
   sociobiological science in particular.

   of naturalistic observation in field settings.  This is consistent with
   the recommendations of Blumer, who argued that social processes and
   relationships, which are the appropriate subject matter for sociology,
   cannot be studied adequately within the laboratory.  In this statement,
   I argue that when the laboratory is used as a ''provocative stage,'' the
   integrity of social action and social relationships as they are manifest
   in social process can be as adequately studied in the laboratory as they
   can be in the field.  I further argue that when the laboratory is used
   in the manner specified here, Blumer's recommendations are more
   adequately met than they are in field studies.

AB Historical sociologists have been property critical of the tendency
   within the social sciences to ignore temporality and, consequently,
   historical contingency in social processes. These critical assessments
   have generated alternative formal research methods that either (a)
   continue to use variable-centered procedures but allow relations between
   variables to change through time, or (b) abandon variable-centered
   procedures altogether and move exclusively to event-centered analyses.
   After considering alternative conceptions of historically contingent
   determination that may be produced by two different formal methods
   (time-varying parameter regression and event structure analysis), the
   authors design a combined strategy that temporally nests interdependent
   forms of contingency and illustrates the approach in an empirical
   analysis of the  ''relief explosion'' in the late 1960s. Contrary to
   exhortations for exclusivist strategies, the results suggest that
   variable-centered and event-centered methods can be fruitfully combined
   In particular event structure analysis is shown to be a useful
   qualitative procedure for ''unpacking'' and interpreting quantitative
   turning points in time-varying parameter time series models. This
   strategy allows macroquantitative and historical/cultural processes to
   be integrated with formal methods.

AB Why has W.E.B. Du Bois not mattered more in sociology?  In addition to
   being on the short list of the 20th century's most influential public
   intellectuals, Du Bois made substantial, if under recognized,
   intellectual contributions as a sociologist and social theorist.  Among
   his nearly 2000 published writings, The Philadelphia Negro and Souls of
   Black Folk have all the qualities of classic works.  Yet, neither has
   been officially canonized by sociology.  The exclusion of Du Bois can be
   explained with tolerable plausibility by reference to his two key
   concepts in Souls of Black Folk:  the veil and the double-self.  One can
   only wonder what might have been significantly different about
   sociology, especially its theories of the Self and of field studies of
   race, had William James's most important student been allowed to matter.

   reveals a political program for reform of the ancient regime.  This
   reform is founded on a reform of domestic mores.  Rousseau's attendant
   conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more
   unified than that found in modern sociology.  Rousseau shows that the
   domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a ''modern''

AB Social scientists have begun to appreciate the importance of style in
   academic discourse.  Style and its evaluation, I argue, are not givens,
   but are created and negotiated by a body of readers, judging a text.  To
   explain the process by which style comes to be known, I choose the case
   of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in
   1899.  I demonstrate that style was always important in the
   interpretation of his work, and that this ''classic'' can be read as
   literature, scholarly discourse, humor, or poor writing-or a combination
   thereof.  A consensus on the qualities of Veblen's style has never
   emerged.  Focusing on claims emphasizing Veblen's irony, I suggest that
   an ironic interpretation is particularly likely when an author analyzes
   those with superior status.

AB The tendencies for older workers and more senior workers to exhibit
   lower rates of job mobility than their counterparts who are,
   respectively, younger and less senior, have a long history in labor
   market research. Yet little attention has been given to the distinct
   career processes underlying these observed patterns. Drawing on
   perspectives from life-course and organizational sociology, the author
   argues that age and tenure are markers of the temporal structures, or
   timetables, that underlie individual and organizational work careers.
   These timetables provide incentives for maintaining the employment
   relationship by allocating organizational rewards over time or by
   defining normative points of entry into and exit from the labor force.
   They also intersect as workers initiate new organizational careers at
   different ages. This ''loose-coupling'' between individual and
   organizational career patterns and its effects on job mobility can be
   represented empirically by the interaction between age and tenure. Using
   data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey, the author shows that
   short- and long-term seniority consistently strengthen attachment among
   older workers, but tenure has weaker effects at younger ages. Additional
   analyses show that similar patterns prevail among men, but the
   relationship between individual and organizational careers is less
   consequential for women attachment behavior

   is incumbent on researchers to be aware of this and to prepare

   appears that the only feasible long-term approach for researchers to

   worlds', presenting a vast ensemble of challenges for the sociological
   analysis of modernity. A historical perspective with previous periods of
   transition from one social order to the next is proposed, as well as a

AB This article examines alternative models of producer services
   development in metropolitan communities and analyzes factors associated
   with the development of producer services in two deindustrializing urban
   communities - the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) of
   Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Sample surveys of producer services in each
   metropolitan area reveal that establishments: (1) tend to be primarily
   dependent upon the revenue generated by local trade within the local
   metropolitan area; (2) tend to simultaneously engage in nonlocal trade
   and directly contribute to interurban integration and dominance of large
   metropolitan centers; and (3) engage most extensively in trade, both
   locally and nonlocally, with other service-sector industries, rather
   than manufacturing. These findings suggest that producer services
   development may be sustained in deindustrializing urban communities and
   that it is not primarily dependent upon trade with locally based
   manufacturing industry.

AB Data from the 1984 Carnegie survey of faculty at U.S. universities show
   substantial disciplinary variation in perceptions that one's field is
   stagnant. We examine the extent to which variation in pessimism about
   the intellectual state of one's field can be explained by theories that
   attribute it to field-level variation in anomie and consensus. We also
   examine the effects of individual-level characteristics on disciplinary
   discontent using a multilevel analysis. We find that both anomie and
   consensus exert strong effects on the average levels of scholarly
   pessimism within fields. In addition, there is an interaction effect
   involving the level of consensus in a field and whether the field is
   primarily pure or applied. The multilevel analysis shows that the
   effects of field-level variables are not attributable to compositional
   differences in individual characteristics and that, as a group, the
   field-level variables are stronger determinants of scholarly pessimism
   than individual characteristics.

AB This article addresses three issues raised in Mauk et al.s (1994)
   article on country music and suicide. First, Mauk et al.'s charge that
   suicide is an individual act that cannot be assessed through group
   statistics is a paradigmatic critique that can be leveled against the
   bulk of sociological work on suicide. The position of Mauk et al. is
   precisely that which Durkheim ([1897] 1966) polemicized against in order
   to legitimate the discipline of sociology in the nineteenth century.
   Second, their notion that ''psychological autopsies'' constitute the
   only legitimate methodology for studying suicide is an overstatement.
   Third, the noted ecological fallacy problems can, in fact, be remedied
   through properly specified models. Many ecological relationships
   involving suicide have been replicated with individual-level data.
   Fourth, the charges that our subcultural argument is ''barely implied'
   and that the notion of a country music subculture is a myth are
   inaccurate. We reiterate our subcultural theory as well as the evidence
   in support of such a subculture.

AB Sociology appears to be one of the most internally divided disciplines,
   if not the most. Departmental struggles, which have led to sociologists
   complaining to administrators about each other, have put the field in
   bad repute among campus officials and have endangered its survival in
   some schools. The American Sociological Society and American
   Sociological Association have been among the most conflict-ridden
   associations in academe for generations. Severe internecine struggles
   have a long history in the field. It may be suggested that they are
   related to the propensity of the field to attract social reformers and
   political activists. But hard evidence indicates sociology graduate
   students are among the weakest, as judged by test scores.

   namely, ways in which standard concepts in American sociology of
   religion take different meanings and connotations in other countries.
   Five examples involve religious identity, fundamentalism, church-state

AB Russian sociology, while significant before the 1917 revolution and into
   the mid-1920s, was non-existent for a quarter of a century under Stalin.
   His death and subsequent political liberalization under Krushchev
   allowed sociology to re-emerge under the protective wing of economics. 
   Curtailed by a ''period of stagnation'' during the Brezhnev reign,
   greater sociological freedom accompanied the Gorbachev glasnost period
   including access to Western sources and ideas previously ''forbidden.'' 
   Totalitarian history and structure has conditioned Russian sociology;
   made it quite applied and wedded to social reform.  Tatiana Zaslavskaia
   provided leadership for sociological endeavors during former Soviet
   years, and continues to do so.  Her orientation and the reactions of her
   Novosibirsk State University colleagues to the ideas of various Western
   social theorists provide some insight into the state of contemporary
   Russian sociology.

EP 186

PD APR 1994
PY 1994
AB We examine the conditions that affected the progressivity of the
   individual income tax in the United States between 1916 and 1986. A
   multivariate time-series analysis shows how macroeconomic conditions,
   state imperatives, the organizational capacities of social classes, and
   political conditions have affected the progressivity and the symbolic
   component of the income tax. Progressivity is measured by the difference
   between the effective tax rates paid by moderate income and very high
   income families. The symbolic component of this tax is measured by the
   difference between the nominal tax rate and effective income tax rate
   paid by very high income families. The results reveal that changes in
   tax progressivity are due largely to macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions, such as unemployment, economic development, and budget
   deficits, although the organizational capacities of social classes and
   political conditions, such as labor organization and political
   participation, also have effects. Changes in progressivity are due
   primarily to adjustments in the rates paid by very high income families.
   However the impacts of these conditions on tax progressivity changed
   somewhat when the federal income tax was transformed into a mass tax
   during World War II. Finally, political conditions have a relatively
   greater effect on the symbolic component of the income tax than on
   progressivity. Overall, this analysis supports a structural theory of
   the state in which the influences of politics and social classes on
   revenue extraction are circumscribed by macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions.

AB While most Western and Chinese scholars emphasize the success of Chinese
   family planning programs, this study focuses on fertility that violates
   family planning regulations in China. The concept of ''deviant
   fertility'' here refers to reproductive behavior that violates current
   family size norms by producing more than the accepted number of
   children. An approach that bridges the sociology of fertility and the
   sociology of deviance is established. Specifically, the theoretical
   framework is based on the cultural conflict perspective of deviance
   developed by Thornsten Sellin (1938). The normative conflict concerning
   fertility in general and confrontations between traditional large family
   norms and current family planning rules in China are explicated.

AB We introduce the concept of defiant behavior: actions that, although
   often defined politically as crime, are defined by their actors as
   necessary, legitimate, and morally appropriate. We then link this
   concept to two distinct substantive subfields of sociology: (1)
   criminology and the sociology of deviance and social control, and (2)
   political sociology and the sociology of social movements. A review of
   the literature on organized defiance suggests a clear theoretical
   confluence between the microstructural concept of biographic
   availability, drawn from the resource mobilization and political process
   perspectives within the sociology of social movements, and social
   control theories of crime and deviance. Likewise, there is a similar
   confluence between the socialization effects of prior activism, also
   from the resource mobilization perspective, and differential
   association/social learning theory in criminology. Finally, we present
   results from a study of the defiant activities of some members of the
   sanctuary movement. The form of defiance examined here, the smuggling of
   undocumented Central Americans across the United States-Mexico border,
   provides a unique test of the scope and power of both social control and
   social learning theories.  Based on self-report survey data collected
   form a sample of 141 participants in the Tuscon, Arizona, sanctuary
   movement, our findings provide strong support for social learning theory
   but fail to support social control theory.  In fact, the observed
   effects of the control theory variables are generally in a direction
   opposite to that predicted by the theory.  Implications of the study for
   the theoretical development of criminology and deviance and for the
   sociological study of social movements are discussed.

AB Most students learn how sociologists study class in introductory
   sociology courses. This exposure also influences how students think
   about class stratification; thus it is important to know how
   Introductory textbooks portray this stratification. Sociologists
   conceptualize class in two principal ways. Distributional approaches
   depict classes as aggregates of individuals possessing some criterion
   (e.g., income). These conceptions label people descriptively, but cannot
   designate the social forces at work in class stratification, Relational
   approaches focus on relations of control and subordination which are
   established through interactions; they highlight the potential for
   conflict among classes as well as the existence of a system of
   oppression and privilege. Both approaches teach students about
   inequality, but in very different terms. A content analysis shows that
   depictions of class stratification in 15 introductory texts are
   overwhelmingly distributional This finding has implications for how
   instructors portray class stratification in contemporary societies.

   the same professor, during the fall 1992 semester In each class,
   students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. a journal-writing
   group or an attendance group. In one class, journals were collected
   three times a semester on random, unannounced dates; in the other class,
   journals were collected at the end of the semester, on the day of the
   final. Essay examinations and multiple-choice examinations were given.
   Attendance was recorded in each class. It was hypothesized that students
   who kept journals would ha ve significantly higher test scores than
   students who did not keep journals, and that students who kept journals
   in the class in which journals were routinely collected would have
   higher test scores than students who kept journals in the class in which
   journals were collected only at the end of the semester Neither
   hypothesis was supported, but number of absences and prior grade point
   average did explain variances in essay scores and multiple-choice
   scores. This finding suggests that professors may be justified in
   requiring attendance as a strategy for increased learning.

   Italian State formation through a historical sociology of the state. The
   mapping of particular forms of others in popular imagination including
   vagrants; 'beggars, and gypsies', in the nineteenth century resonates
   with contemporary state projects which seek to document and identify new
   'alien' newcomer groups. The official document, an integral part of a
   technology of state power constitutes a kind of 'cosmology, with whole
   social orders, classes and others codified in each line entry. The state
   designates absolute definitions of places, bodies and things. In 1885
   the first medical survey of Italy sought to map out the ''medical
   geography'' of the nation, such practices laid the ground work for
   conceptions of normalcy and difference. The definition of the average
   citizen' is an integral part of the construction of State as Cosmos.
   Difference and its mapping in its interplay with ''normalcy'' defines in
   many ways, the State. yet there can be no taken-for-granted submission
   of the subaltern classes to this state cosmos, nor to the practices of
   the social sciences complicit in its construction.

   framework draws on a social constructionist perspective that includes
   aspects of phenomenology and symbolic interactionism to define
   ''landscape'' as the symbolic environment created by a human act of
   conferring meaning on nature and the environment. This landscape
   reflects the self-definitions of the people within a particular cultural
   context. Attention is directed to transformation of the physical
   environment into landscapes that reflect people's definitions of
   themselves and on how these landscapes are reconstructed in response to
   people's changing definitions of themselves. Case studies from sociology
   and anthropology illustrate the social construction of nature and the
   environment. A discussion of the applied implications of the theoretical
   framework in social impact assessment and the global implications in the

AB Secularization is most productively understood not as declining
   religion, but as the declining scope of religious authority. A focus on
   religious authority (1) is more consistent with recent developments in
   social theory than is a preoccupation with religion; (2) draws on and
   develops what is best in the secularization literature; and (3) reclaims
   a neglected Weberian insight concerning the sociological analysis of
   religion. Several descriptive and theoretical ''pay-offs'' of this
   conceptual innovation are discussed: new hypotheses concerning the
   relationship between religion and social movements; the enhanced
   capacity to conceptually apprehend and empirically investigate
   secularization among societies, organizations, and individuals; and
   clearer theoretical connections between secularization and other
   sociological literatures. Ironically, these connections may indeed spell
   the end of secularization theory as a distinct body of theory, but in a
   different way than previously appreciated.

AB Durkheim's doctoral dissertation can justifiably be called sociology's
   first classic. Rereading it 100 years later enables us to see major
   domains of the contemporary world where its analysis remains, of
   actuality, heuristic or yet to be fully appreciated: for example, its
   themes of anomie as economic deregulation and corporatism as an
   institutional arrangement to deal with anomie. At the same time,
   Durkheims discourse reflects its historical embeddedness, such as his
   discussion of the sexual division of labor, which needs to be reworked.
   A second feature of emergent contemporary social solidarity unforeseen
   by Durkheim (and the great majority of theorists of change) is what may
   be termed ''the return of mechanical solidarity.

AB The source of social life, according to Durkheim, is the similitude of
   consciousnesses and the division of labor. The former is best evident
   among primitive societies where a ''mechanical solidarity,'' evidenced
   by repressive law, prevails; the latter in advanced societies where
   populations evidence greater ''dynamic density,'' and juridical rules
   define the nature and relations of functions. In combating individualism
   and basing the existence of societies on a ''consensus of parts, ''
   Durkheim refutes his positivistic emphasis which denies the relevance of
   ends to a scientific study of society. In his discussion of social ends
   is a latent anti-mechanistic trend. The theory of unilinear development
   is established on deficient ethnographic data. It assumes the absence of
   division of labor among primitive societies and of any ''mechanical
   solidarity'' among modem societies. Repressive and restitutive law
   Durkheim seeks to use as indexes of mechanical and organic solidarity,
   but he does not establish with any precision the perfect associations
   which he assumes obtain between his types of solidarity and of law.

AB What was Durkheim doing-in the sense of an intended social action-in
   writing De la Division du travail social? At least a part of the answer
   is that Durkheim's project was linguistic-i.e., he was attempting to
   replace an outworn vocabulary of Cartesian metaphysics with a more
   Germanic lexicon-one in which simplicity gave way to complexity, the
   abstract to the concrete, the ideal to the real deduction to induction,
   rationalism to empiricism, and so on. To some extent, this was motivated
   by the superiority-widely acknowledged among intellectuals of the Third
   Republic-of German science and Protestant scientific education. But an
   additional motivation was Durkheim's belief that only a real, concrete
   entity-society as a ''thing'' (chose)-could provide an object worthy of
   the veneration of the ''new man'' of the Republic. Durkheim's attempt to
   construct a science of social facts was therefore itself subsidiary to
   another, ''higher'' purpose-i.e., the construction of a moral authority
   (real, concrete, complex) adequate to the needs of the Third French
   Republic. Rather than an end in itself, Durkheim's sociology should thus
   be seen as a means to other ends-i.e., the ''construction'' of a
   particular kind of ''fact''-within a specific social and historical
   context.

AB A classic text is not always canonized. Canonical texts are frequently
   anything but classics. Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society is an
   instance of the former; his Rules of Sociological Method of the latter.
   Both books are based on errors of fact and method. Division of Labor was
   so intentionally the classical theory of modern divided societies that
   Durkheim, son of generations of rabbis, totally misrepresented the facts
   of Ancient Israel. In Rules, Durkheim was so intent on writing the
   canonical text of sociology's methods that he stipulated rules that even
   he (in Suicide) could not use. Durkheim was thus a giant of the
   sociological past because, not in spite of, his errors. He erred because
   he dared to think seriously about the moral issues of his time. Hence,
   the ironic fate of Durkheim's sociology-it led in two different
   directions. From Rules and Suicide came modern empirical sociology. From
   Elementary Forms came all the antimodernists-beginning with
   Levi-Strauss, and from him, Derrida and the others-who became, among
   other things, the most articulate critics of the sociology Durkheim
   helped invent. Such is the genius of classic, if not canonical, authors
   like Durkheim.

AB Religious experience is an important but understudied aspect of
   religion. Sociologists need a theoretical approach that appreciates the
   existence of and variation in the social distribution of religious
   experiences. Recognizing that theories are interpretive frameworks
   through which we view the world, and understanding that ''every way of
   seeing is a way of not seeing,'' we examine two potential ''ways of
   seeing'' religious experience in modem society and explore their ability
   co shed light upon recent surveys which suggest that as much as half the
   United States adult population has had what can be called ''religious
   experiences. '' As the dominant views in sociology largely exclude from
   consideration the experiential dimension of religion, we turn to
   perspectives that take religious experience more seriously, what
   Lindbeck (1984) calls the ''experiential-expressive'' and
   ''cultural-linguistic'' views. While the former is an advance over the
   dominant views, it too has liabilities. We advocate the
   cultural-linguistic theory as die most sophisticated way of seeing
   religion. As a preliminary test of this view, we examine the
   relationship between ''ecstatic'' religious experience and
   ''conventional'' religiosity, predicting that the most contentional
   worshipers will have ecstatic experiences most frequently. Logistic
   regression analysis of General Social Survey data supports this
   prediction.

   of secondary formal and informal tourism businesses when an enclave
   tourist resort was introduced into the town of Luperon, Dominican
   Republic, a community with no prior experience with the tourism
   industry. The study found that the inherent flaw of enclave tourism as a

   and local businesses in order to increase resort profit margins.

   that might be achieved by artificial intelligence technology:  symbolic
   processors, expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and
   classifier systems.  The first major accomplishments of artificial
   social intelligence (ASI) have been in the realm of theory, where these
   techniques have inspired new theories as well as helping to render
   existing theories more rigorous.  Two application areas for which ASI
   holds great promise are the sociological analysis of written texts and
   data retrieval from the forthcoming Global Information Infrastructure. 
   ASI has already been applied to some kinds of statistical analysis, but
   how competitive it will be with more conventional techniques remains
   unclear.  To take advantage of the opportunities offered by ASI,
   sociologists will have to become more computer literate and will have to
   reconsider the place of programming and computer science in the
   sociological curriculum.  ASI may be a revolutionary approach with the
   potential to rescue sociology from the doldrums into which some
   observers believe it has fallen.

AB The review by Humphrey et al. (1993) is arguably the most important
   effort to date to advance our understanding of poverty in
   resource-dependent communities-one that is likely to be remembered as
   pivotal, not just because it brings together four highly diverse
   theoretical perspectives, but because its clarity will facilitate the
   recognition of important gaps and of the need for empirical testing. All
   four of the perspectives appear to have important weaknesses, although
   the weaknesses appear not to be due so much to the efforts of Humphrey
   et al. as to the fact that social scientists have often overlooked
   biophysical variables in the past. For the future, there is a need for
   more systematic empirical analysis, including a more explicit focus on
   the characteristics of natural resource activities. In particular,
   attention needs to be devoted to (1) long-term declines in both
   extractive and ''linked'' employment; (2) the high levels of volatility
   that characterize world commodity markets; and (3) the tendency for
   social science expectations about natural resources, like many other
   forms of ''social construction,'' to be based on untested assumptions
   that may have grown out of past experiences, but that are not based on
   careful analysis of long-term trends, and that may prove inadequate as a
   guide to the future.

AB Critical studies of agriculture in advanced industrial societies
   identify either macrolevel or micro-level forces as causes of farm
   operator survival. The structure of agriculture, the structure of
   non-farm industry, and the structure of land ownership define the macro
   level context of survival. Individual demographic characteristics and
   farm enterprise characteristics related to household and farm labour,
   debt, and vulnerability define the micro-level context of survival.
   Using two panel data sets on North Carolina farm operators collected
   during two different farm crisis periods, we combine micro-level survey
   data with macro-level data on county agricultural, industrial, and
   landholding structures in multivariate analyses of farm operator
   failure/survival. The two types of data allow us to examine
   individualized action within farm and county contexts. For the first
   panel, operator on-farm labour is the only significant predictor of farm
   operator failure. For the second panel, farm scale and large farm county
   agricultural structure are the significant predictors of farm operator
   failure. The results argue against a single deterministic explanation of
   farm operator survival and for the integration of time and spatial
   context with micro- and macro-levels of analysis.

   and we allow the quality of our students' classroom experiences to be
   compromised in ways that, as sociologists, we could easily anticipate
   and avoid. We need data on the role that FTAs play in undergraduate
   instruction in sociology in the United States. To realize the
   contribution that FTAs can make to internationalizing our curriculum, we
   need to approach the FTA problem as sociologists, involve both
   undergraduates and FTAs in the analysis of this problem, and work toward
   incorporating both groups into a sociological community of discourse.

   We argue for a proactive feminist pedagogy that enhances women's

   introduce a quantitative and a qualitative software program which help
   to create a proactive environment that enhances women's computerized

   to support, extend, and routinize sociological study of the military as

AB Americans watch a great deal of television. But the factors
   traditionally considered to determine or explain television
   usage-availability of free time, low income or class status, low
   education, emotional difficulties, and lack of structured social
   interactions-are not generalizable across the adult life span. The
   television viewing of people over the age of 30 has been understudied-a
   research bias that mirrors society's youth orientation and essentially
   excludes older adults from this model. The author analyzed data
   collected in the National Opinion Research Center's 1988 General Social
   Survey to assess the determinants of television viewing for adults of
   all ages. Results indicate that as persons perceive themselves to be in
   different stages of life and take on age-appropriate roles, tasks, and
   perspectives, they have distinctively different reasons for viewing.

AB Durkheim's theory of religion is approached from the perspective of his
   lifelong concern with the question of meaning and moral order in modern
   society. This emphasis naturally leads to a consideration of wider
   themes informing Durkheim's sociology of religion than are usually found
   in analyses focusing exclusively on his treatment of primitive religion
   in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1964). Durkheim wes as the
   distinguishing feature of modernity the progressive emancipation of the
   individual from traditional sources of influence. The evolution toward
   greater individuation, culminating in the ''cult of the individual'' or
   ''religion of humanity,'' is set by Durkheim within the context of the
   role of collective ideals in promoting social change and in the
   maintenance of moral order. Religion, the major symbolic expression of
   societal wide ideals, is identified as the key variable which enables
   Durkheim to reconcile the competing demands of individuals for freedom
   with the interests of society in collective welfare.

AB Using a queuing framework, the authors investigate explanations for
   women's inroads into academic sociology since 1970. Women's entry has
   occurred most dramatically among sociology doctorates, with women now
   representing about half of all those awarded PhDs. Access to faculty
   positions has been more modest: Approximately one in four faculty
   members are currently women. From a systematic review of research on
   women's achievements in sociology, publications produced by sociology's
   professional association, and other statistical sources, the authors
   focus on three major explanations for women's increased access to
   academic sociology. First, men eschewed graduate training in sociology
   as research and development funding dropped. real earnings declined, and
   the academic labor market contracted. Second, in the 1970s academic
   employers increasingly turned to women, in part because of the salience
   of anti-discrimination legislation and also because women sociologists
   generated pressure for change. Third, women themselves increasingly
   chose graduate training in sociology because sociology's subject matter
   lent itself to the inclusion of issues central to their lives. Although
   the numbers studying for advanced degrees in sociology (and the number
   of sociology PhDs) are once again increasing, it is too early to tell
   whether women will make further inroads, or whether the, ir numbers will
   remain stable or decline.

AB An analysis of the published literature on the use of writing in
   teaching sociology suggests that one of the missing elements is a
   systematic view, of how, writing relates to the discipline of sociology.
   This article attempts to address that issue by suggesting that the
   experience of writing is fundamentally sociological. Using Mills'
   concept of the sociological imagination, I suggest that the act of
   composing any written work is a movement from the very personal and
   private to the larger social context of considering one's audience, the
   conventions of writing, and other structural (or public) issues and back
   again to the private and personal. The article concludes with
   implications for instructors who require students to write and who seek
   to help students become more effective writers.

AB The awarding of the 1992 Nobel Prize for Economics to Gary Becker draws
   attention to Becker's outstanding work in economics. At the same time,
   it draws attention to a new phenomenon, for which Becker himself is more
   responsible than anyone else: the use of basic principles of economics
   to address problems in sociology. Much of the work for which Becker is
   best known treats problems that are quite outside the field of economics
   proper and fully within the field of sociology. What is striking about
   this is that Becker remains committed to the explanatory logic of
   neo-classical economics; he applies that logic uncompromisingly, using
   the same tools in examining marriage markets as in examining financial
   markets. In this paper, some of Becker's work on sociological problems
   are discussed and assessed.

AB One of the difficulties of integrating environmental variables into
   sociological analyses is that societies have a dualistic relationship
   with the biophysical environment. Humans are like other species in
   depending on the environment, yet humans are also unique among all
   species in the potential for altering and sometimes evading
   environmental constraints. A second and related difficulty results from
   the degree to which humans incorporate the environment into their
   everyday views of reality; the process often seems so automatic that the
   biophysical realities can be forgotten, taken for granted, or ignored,
   both by residents and by those who study them. This problem is
   particularly significant for studies that fail to be sufficiently
   comparative to be able to observe significant variations in
   environmental and technological factors. The problem is illustrated with
   a study that deals with a relatively traditional social-psychological
   dependent variable-attitudes toward a proposed development. The focus is
   on the apparent paradox of a form of industrial development that has
   been welcomed with open arms in one area of the country while virtually
   opening armed warfare in another, namely drilling for offshore oil. To
   explain the marked differences across regions, it is necessary to
   understand the influence of biophysical and technological variables, as
   well as the social and historical differences across the regions.
   Implications for further research are discussed.

AB Perspectives in sociology are currently being.reassessed in light of
   postmodernism, which has been associated with the abandonment of faith
   in the social self and scientific inquiry. As an emergent problematic,
   postmodernism stands in sharp contrast to a modernist pragmatic (and
   innocent) conception of symbolic interactionism-which is centered in the
   Meadian conception of prosocial selves. However, this article identifies
   some ''late-modem'' interactionists-Goffman, Stone, Becker, Lemert, and
   Mills-who, in providing a corrective for an innocent pragmatic inquiry
   into the self, created a foundation for contemporary inquiry into the
   social. This corrective entailed a reconceptualization of the self as
   the focal point of the situated act and, specifically, its changing
   definition from cooperative and reflective to strategic and imaginary.
   While we suggest that their work represented a loss of innocence in
   interactionism, it did not create a loss of faith in scientific inquiry
   into the self and social action. Rather, the work of the late modernists
   has inspired a reconstruction of scientific inquiry into the social that
   encompasses, but is not encompassed by, postmodernism.

   distinctions, and self-control versus conformity in shaping health
   lifestyles and the reality of their operationalization in the postmodern
   world. In a largely applied subdiscipline like medical sociology,
   Weber's work offers a theoretical background on which to enrich our

   theoretical challenges posed by lifestyle research.

AB This article discusses three major contributions of Eliot Freidson to
   the sociology of professions: (a) Freidson's work introduces a new
   concept of the professions rooted in the social organization of labor
   markets. This concept is far more harmonious with the contemporary
   situation of professions than any previous effort to conceptualize the
   differences between professions and other occupations. (b) The work
   provides an analysis of the spheres of professional control that result
   from the knowledge monopolies and gatekeeping activities of the
   professions. In this analysis, Freidson provides a new perspective on
   the meaning and social consequences of applied knowledge. (c) In a more
   humanistic vein, the work provides a measured defense of professions in
   the face of critics who see their powers as unnecessary, harmful, or
   both. The article concludes by commenting on a paradox suggested by
   Freidson's work. This paradox concerns the simultaneous strength and
   weakness of the contemporary professions, their strength as market
   shelters and their weakness as a status category and as activities
   connected to the larger political economy.

   Eliot Freidson has both contributed to and advocated a distinctive
   variety of medical sociology: one that applies structural perspectives
   to medical institutions and remains detached from medicine's own
   viewpoints and assumptions. This article reviews Freidson's legacy to
   six substantive arenas in the study of medical institutions. It then
   examines the evolving status of the type of scholarship Freidson
   championed. Conventional wisdom holds that medical sociology is in the
   doldrums because applied work has supplanted discipline-grounded
   research. This article suggests a counterhypothesis: Institutionally
   oriented medical sociology is no less prevalent than in the past;
   rather, the perceived salience of this type of work has declined because
   of trends within sociology at large.

AB ''Communicative work directed to transforming an individual's total

   'status degradation ceremony'''    (Garfinkel 1956, p. 420). Status
   degradation ceremonies are particularly troublesome for undercover
   narcotics agents. In this context, they act as the mechanism by which
   agents' dissembled identities are questioned and their real police ones
   revealed. This process, what officers call ''getting narced,'' is the
   topic of the present paper. Explored here are both its causes and the
   responses officers proffer to neutralize full identity exposure. Causes
   are tactical in nature and involve transactional overaggressiveness.
   Neutralization responses are dramaturgical in nature and involve
   sarcastic admission, evidential refutation, and belligerent
   denial/threatening retort. Discussion focuses on the conceptual
   implications of officers' counteruncovering moves (Goffman 1969) as
   these relate to the sociology of accounts (Scott and Lyman 1968). Data
   were drawn from ethnographic interviews with 30 high school undercover

AB In this paper I describe a minicourse, adapted to an illiberal
   pedagogical setting, that draws on the Vietnam War, and I provide a
   synopsis of its content. My purpose is to suggest a strategy for using
   the war as a case study for two topics central to the concerns of
   sociologists-inequality and ideology. Data about the war are marshaled
   to address two questions: ''Were the burdens of war equally
   distributed?'' and ''Was the American military handicapped in Vietnam by
   political constraints?'' To address the first question, I use
   information about the draft, draft policy, and American casualties to
   suggest that policy reproduced institutionalized inequalities of race
   and class. To the second question I bring to bear measures of American
   operations-expenditures and destructive force-and total casualties to
   argue that conservative apologies invoking self-defeating limits ignore
   the magnitude and consequences of our efforts in Vietnam. Within the
   synopsis, I incorporate sources for data, note some problems in the data
   available, make suggestions about interpretation, and address some
   pedagogical issues.

AB This paper constructs a set of criteria for identifying the paradigmatic
   underpinnings of racial and ethnic relations textbooks. It applies those
   criteria to 10 recent books and summarizes the findings. With few
   exceptions, the textbooks favor assimilationist, cultural pluralist, or
   eclectic approaches. The compilation of social histories is emphasized
   over theory review and evaluation. The debate on the declining
   significance of race receives little attention. Comparative analysis
   reveals a number of problems in these books; for example, eclectic
   approaches are constructed from a set of contradictory assumptions. The
   paper argues that these problems are rooted in the troubled relationship
   between American liberalism and the sociology of racial and ethnic
   relations. It concludes by briefly suggesting how these problems can be
   overcome.

AB The social-locational perspective on environmental concern has relied on
   traditional demographic variables to account for citizen positions.
   Young, educated, liberal urbanites or the 'new middle class'' have been
   considered most environmentally minded.   Some studies, however, suggest
   a different perspective. Attitudinal variables concerning concrete
   issues, especially political alienation and risk perceptions, have been
   proposed as more important stimulants of environmentalism.   We
   incorporate the two perspectives into a single design which examines
   citizen positions on a proposed nuclear waste facility in a western New
   York locality.    Our findings cast doubt on the social-locational
   perspective but confirm the notion that feelings of alienation and
   perceptions of risk are key determinants of environmental concern. We
   conclude with implications for theory and policymaking.

AB In current science studies, there are only few systematic efforts at
   explaining how different scientific specialties change over time. Such
   specialties are viewed here as organizations in which workers deal with
   various degrees of task uncertainty and mutual dependence. The
   sociological theory of change suggests that scientific change is
   generally triggered by competition, but that various types of change
   depend on the social organization and status of scientific groups. Some
   fields change through permanent discoveries, some through specialization
   and cumulation, yet others change through cognitive fragmentation. This
   argument can synthesize the various independent branches of contemporary
   science studies. The proposed theory has wider significance for some
   core problems in sociology, such as the relationship between the natural
   and social sciences, the prospects for a science of society, and the
   possibility of cumulative progress.

AB During a career that has spanned more than 40 years, Roy Francis has
   made substantial contributions to sociological teaching and research.
   Building on his experiences as a student, he holds dear the ideals of a
   liberal education and continues to search for new ways of transmitting
   those ideals in the face of changing social patterns. A prolific writer,
   Francis' books and papers often examine the proper relations between
   theory and research and explore the potential of symbolic interactionism
   as an epistemological framework. He has been active in sociology's
   professional affairs, especially in promoting visual sociology as a
   teaching and learning medium. His roles as a student, professor,
   administrator, and president of the Midwest Sociological Society round
   out a career that has encompassed all facets of modem scholarship. In
   each of these roles, Francis stresses the moral dimensions of the
   academic life, and he instills in his students the sense of intellectual
   obligation to their scholarly forebears that he feels toward his own.

AB The central thesis of this article is that denominations are composed of
   two parallel structures overlying congregations: a religious authority
   structure and an agency structure. This article elaborates the notion of
   religious authority structure, provides a brief overview of agency
   structure origins, and sociologically distinguishes the two structures.
   Placing denominational dual structure at the center of organizational
   analysis: (a) leads to a heretofore elusive sociological definition of
   religious organizations; (b) reveals the horizontal rather than vertical
   nature of intradenominational power shifts, thereby challenging the
   common (mis)perception that congregations are increasingly beholden to
   agencies; (c) highlights both the largely ignored role of agencies and
   the often overlooked top-down component in intradenominational conflict
   and schism; and (d) makes it easier to conceptualize and investigate
   processes of internal secularization. This approach to denominational
   organization is in line with a recent development in the sociology of
   organizations in which organizational subunits rather than
   organizational wholes occupy the center of attention.

AB Music is associated with many sport events, yet little research is

   musical selections frequently associated with sport with a focus on the
   meaning these musical selections have to the listeners. Other studies of
   music and society indicate that music may provide a means of promoting a
   collective consciousness, social integration, and political ideology.
   The present study utilizes an auditory elicitation approach. That is,
   respondents wrote the subjective meanings they associated with the
   musical selections as they were being played. The selections elicited a
   variety of meanings and emotions from the respondents. The responses to
   the music are interpreted within the functionalist, critical, and
   sociology of emotions/nostalgia frameworks.

   by the individual self; 2) dreams reflect social reality; 3) dreams are
   public rhetoric; and 4) dreams are collectively interpretable. With the
   development of sociological approaches that examine topics previously
   defined as psychological, such as the sociology of emotion and

   productions should not exclude them from social analysis.

   use of outdoor recreation areas. Data for this analysis came from
   telephone interviews conducted with 1057 households in Maricopa and Gila
   counties in Arizona. The analysis was conducted using a subsample of
   respondents of Mexican ancestry. The results support the socioeconomic,

   Goffman's ''Communication Conduct in an Island Community'' (1953) with
   respect to several key Durkheimian concepts. Also discussed are several

   Stanford Lyman-which help to further delineate the conditions of the

AB One of the central goals of teaching sociology is the development in
   students of sociological perspective, which encourages them to reflect
   on their own society from a distance. The concept of ethnocentrism is
   often introduced in sociology courses to sensitize students to the ways
   in which their perceptions of social life are shaped by the fact that
   they are ''insiders'' to their own society and ''outsiders'' to others.
   Here we discuss a series of instructional techniques built around the
   use of Horace Miner's classic, ''Body Ritual among the Nacirema,'' which
   we have developed and implemented to assist students in developing an
   awareness of social influences on their perceptions and judgments. The
   techniques are based on the observation that ethnocentrism involves two
   forms of distortion, termed ''insider's bias'' and ''outsider's bias.''
   Students must confront both of these in order to develop a full
   appreciation of the subtle impact of culture on perceptions.

AB Recent developments in historical sociology emphasize the centrality of
   temporality to analysis and explanation. Narrative uses temporal order
   to organize information about events and to foster their understanding
   but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological
   explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for
   the computer-assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences,
   ''event-structure analysis,'' that infuses narrative with greater rigor
   and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in
   Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can
   be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of
   events.

AB Marbles games (''pitch''), perhaps the most widely played of all
   traditional boys' games in Trinidad and Tobago, have declined
   precipitously in the last two decades. This article documents close to
   200 marbles terms found in Trinidad and Tobago English Creole. Although
   most are British in origin, there are East Indian, French Creole, and
   possible African influences on this lexicon. An analysis of the
   discourse of marbles talk in its sociocultural context was prompted by
   its high affect for men who had played pitch as boys. Using frameworks
   from the sociology of games and from studies in language and gender,
   marbles talk is shown to demonstrate features of ''masculine''
   gender-linked use of language and games, including highly elaborated
   rules and strategies, and competitive and confrontational use of
   language.

AB Refugees are individuals forced to flee from their homelands because of
   categorical persecution or because they are bystanders caught in the
   crossfire of war or civil strife. Such involuntary exile often leads to
   alienation in the most literal sense of the term. Whether expellees,
   escapees, or displaced persons, refugees share a common fate and, often,
   a common destiny: those who are dispossessed are dependent on others to
   provide care, succor, protection, and assistance. Yet responses to their
   plight are almost invariably highly selective, the quality of mercy
   being strained by considerations other than pure altruism. This paper, a
   commentary on the sociology of exile, attempts to convey the sense and
   significance of estrangement and responses to it in both historical and
   contemporary contexts. Early sections deal with concepts and concerns;
   later ones examine United States refugee policies and practices relating
   to exile, ethnicity, and the politics of rescue.

AB Feminist phase theory describes the process of integrating women's
   studies scholarship as a series of identifiable stages, for both
   individuals and disciplines. Literature on the revolutionary and
   paradigm-shift potential of women's studies scholarship suggests
   important disciplinary differences in its construction, adoption, and
   diffusion. We reformulate feminist phase theory in paradigm shift terms,
   then operationalize and contrast two versions of it. Our analysis and
   review indicate that the missing variable in women's studies
   transformation projects is the participants' discipline. Data from our
   integration project show faculty in interpretive disciplines scoring
   higher on degree of integration of women's studies scholarship but not
   changing as a result of the project itself, while those in positivist
   disciplines do change but have lower absolute scores. These findings
   indicate a need for different integration strategies based on
   discipline. Empirical support for one sequential ordering in feminist
   phase theory argues for the importance and centrality of women-focused
   scholarship.

AB A selective appropriation of postmodernist theories is undertaken with
   special reference to their applicability to macrosociology and to other
   branches of sociological inquiry that employ conceptions of social and
   cultural totality. The appropriation is premised on the thesis that
   theories of culture, such as postmodernism, can contribute to sociology
   by their analyses of cultural form, providing sociology with general
   descriptions of what social processes must mediate and with guidance on
   how to grasp its own cultural form(s). Three notions of cultural
   totality, ''bricolage'' (Claude Levi-Strauss), ''discursive formation''
   (Michel Foucault), and ''deconstruction'' (Jacques Derrida), are
   considered. All have in common a description of cultural form that
   stresses nonsystematic order. They are contrasted to Talcott Parsons'
   modernist and systematizing macrotheoretic reflection on culture and
   society. A deconstruction of Parsons yields the alternative of a
   less-than-systematic, postmodernized (macro)-sociology.

   focus on how macrocomparative sociologists address the threats to
   validity which surround sample selection, research design, and data and
   measurement. Nearly all the studies we investigate have explanation as a
   goal. A major threat to many studies (almost a third) is the failure to
   apply any method of control. Most authors wish to draw general
   conclusions, but problems of sampling raise questions about their
   ability to do so. Researchers agree that measurement is problematic.
   However, issues surrounding measurement are largely neglected. We

AB Research on life transitions highlights the normative and nonnormative

   decades, life course perspectives have provided a strategic context for
   studying the genesis of life transitions and their personal and social
   consequences. Both population-based and individual models of transitions
   have become more complex, focusing on the ways that social and
   historical contexts shape life transitions. At the individual level,
   progress has also been made in identifying the mechanisms by which
   transitions affect outcomes. Research on life transitions continues to
   grapple with two major issues-the challenges raised by heterogeneity,
   and the need to better link macro and micro perspectives-although
   advances have been made in both cases. One of the most promising
   characteristics of recent studies is cross-fertilization of concepts and
   methods from previously distinct research traditions: role theory,
   social stress theory, and life course sociology.

PD JAN 1993
PY 1993
AB This article examines racial classifications on United States population
   census schedules between 1890 and 1990 to provide insights on the
   changing meanings of race in US society. The analysis uses a sociology
   of knowledge perspective which assumes that race is an ideological
   concept that can be interpreted most productively by relating its
   definition and measurement to the larger social and political context.
   Four themes are identified and discussed: (i) the historical and
   continuing importance of skin colour, usually dichotomized into white
   and non-white, in defining race and counting racial groups; (ii) a
   belief in 'pure' races that is reflected in a preoccupation with
   categorizing people into a single or 'pure' race; (iii) the role of
   census categories in creating pan-ethnic racial groups; and, (iv) the
   confusing of race and ethnicity in census racial classifications. Each
   theme demonstrates the potential or actual role of official statistics,
   exemplified by census racial data, in reflecting and guiding changes to
   the meaning and social perceptions of race. A detailed examination of
   racial classifications from the 1980 and 1990 Censuses shows that the
   influence of political interests on racial statistics is particularly
   important. The article concludes with a discussion of whether official
   statistical recorders such as population censuses should categorize and
   measure race, given the political motivations and non-scientific
   character of the classifications used.

   nutrition can be taught in several settings, including in sociology
   departments as an entire course, in lectures in other courses, or in
   continuing and occasional examples. Sociologists also teach in nutrition
   and food science departments and other applied settings. Three
   approaches to teaching in this area are described: 1) sociology of food
   and nutrition. 2) food and society, and 3) nutritional sociology.
   Practical instructional issues in teaching the sociology of food and

   diversity of students, experiential learning, and team teaching.
   Teaching resources include reading materials, audiovisuals, syllabi,
   organizations, and publications. Incorporating food, eating, and

AB This paper explores the possibility of developing a general and formal
   social-action theory of labeling emotions. The theory is based upon the
   assumption that there is an underlying formal structural social-action
   system of expectations and sanctions that significantly influence how
   actors label their emotions. Some permutations of the four basic
   expectation-sanction states are elaborated, hypothetically labeled, and
   tested over a 14-year period.  The ''constructionist'' view of the
   necessity of a cultural context in labeling emotions is challenged by
   removing the ''moral'' content from the survey instrument. The findings
   indicate that the formal model, devoid of content, is effective in
   differentiating emotion labels. The tests yielded promising results for
   developing a comprehensive and formal mapping of emotions. Taxonomical
   extrapolations of the theory are suggested and some further applications
   and needed research are discussed.

AB The Simmelian call for a formal sociology is applied to aloneness to
   uncover generic patterns of relation between the individual and the
   community. Three forms of aloneness are distinguished by focusing on the
   interactional and relational levels of sociation underlying each.
   Other-imposed aloneness as represented by isolation is an asymmetric
   form. It is the state of being cut off from immediate interaction or
   extended relations. Mutually constructed aloneness is represented by
   privacy and solitude. Both privacy and solitude are symmetric,
   intentional, and cooperative; but privacy is the temporary suspension of
   interaction and implies at most a common past and shared future, and
   solitude rests upon a foundation of committed, temporally extended
   relationships. Self-imposed aloneness as represented by escapism is
   asymmetrical and involves a negative affirmation of the community. It is
   rooted in a distorted temporal existence.

   treating aquaculture as agriculture and focusing on issues of equity,
   labor patterns, nutrition, and health. Another approach stresses what
   aquaculture has in common with fisheries and is concerned with the use
   of shared resources such as bays and estuaries and an exploration of the
   possibility of turning fishermen into aquaculturists. Areas in which
   future work is needed are identified.

AB Agency has long been an important topic in sociological theory.
   Recently, sociologists have devoted attention to new models of cultural
   evolution drawn from a variety of disciplines. This paper examines the
   role of agency in evolutionary theory. We begin by distinguishing
   evolutionary theory from developmental theories that are usually
   identified with evolution in discussions of social theory. We then offer
   an approach to agency and to power grounded in social rule systems
   theory. These discussions provide a context to definition of agency as
   effective, intentional, unconstrained and reflexive action by individual
   or collective actors. Using contemporary evolutionary theory, we
   consider the circumstances under which individual and collective action
   can meet these requirements and thus be considered agentic.

AB There has been a long-standing debate over who controls the large
   American corporation. The results presented here indicate that existing
   power relations within the firm, the conception of control that
   dominates the firm's actions, and the actions of competitors account for
   the economic actions undertaken by large firms, while the differences in
   manager or owner or bank control and the presence of bank interlocks do
   not. A sociology of markets is therefore more likely to account for the
   courses of actions of large firms by considering these relations, rather
   than focusing on the construction of interests by bankers, owners, or
   board interlocks.

AB In a strident attack on the Weber thesis, Malcolm MacKinnon1 argues that
   Weber was mistaken and evasive in his interpretation of Calvinism.
   According to MacKinnon, theological developments after Calvin, in
   Puritan covenant theology, removed from Calvinism the salvation anxiety
   that might have supplied a motive for conduct which unintentionally
   rationalized worldly activities. MacKinnon's analysis sharply
   distinguishes between Calvin's determinist doctrine and the voluntarist
   covenant theology in Puritanism, whose serene doctrine of assurance
   eliminated salvation anxiety. This analysis - I submit - grossly
   distorts the primary and secondary evidence which clearly shows that
   Puritan covenant theology contained the essential elements attributed to
   the Protestant ethic by Weber. MacKinnon's indictment of Weber must be
   dismissed because the evidence presented for it is an implausible and
   insupportable interpretation of Puritan doctrine. However, MacKinnon's
   errors are instructive: they illustrate the importance of controlling
   two types of selectivity effects that can bias sociological
   interpretations of belief systems. One type has its origins in
   MacKinnon's exegetical practices; the other, far more interesting type
   originates in the practices of the clerical authors whose texts
   constitute the primary data. MacKinnon may have overlooked the second
   type of selectivity, which involves variable textual representations of
   a belief system, because he thinks it is impertinent to attribute
   inconsistency and contradiction to Calvinist belief systems. This
   untenable assumption leads to the clumsy distinction between determinism
   in Calvin and voluntarism in Puritanism that is the keystone in
   MacKinnon's critique of Weber. The flaws in MacKinnon's critique should
   therefore be understood in terms of a bad sociology of knowledge
   implicit in his analysis and not necessarily as a reflection of his
   evident animus toward Weber.

AB Raw material extraction once offered an effective route to economic
   development, but societal relationships with environment and technology
   have changed so fundamentally that extractive industries today appear
   more likely to lead rural regions to economic addiction. Key
   characteristics of addictive activities include rising costs of
   operation at most extractive facilities, combined with downward trends
   in world commodity prices. Key characteristics of vulnerable communities
   and regions include increasing geographic isolation, imbalances of scale
   and power with respect to extractive industries, and the absence of
   realistic alternatives for diversified development. Key pressures toward
   addiction are created by ambiguities that mask the addictive tendencies,
   including ambiguities of price signals, of employment and development
   possibilities for remote regions, and of resource exhaustion. The net
   result is that, while the encouragement to develop extractive industries
   is often coupled with advice to avoid developing an excessive dependency
   on a single economic sector, the very regions and nations having the
   greatest need to hear such advice may also have the lowest realistic
   ability to respond to it.

AB The purpose of this article is to raise some questions and to make some
   observations about the linkages of sociology to its specialties by
   reviewing the changing relationship of sociology and criminology. In the
   United States, the development of criminology as a field of study has
   been closely linked to the development of sociology as a discipline, and
   sociology has given American criminology its distinctive cast.
   Criminology has benefited from theoretical and methodological
   developments in sociology and in tum has contributed to sociology as one
   of its central specialties. In the past two decades, the dominance of
   sociology in criminology has diminished, and criminology has gravitated
   somewhat away from the cen ter of sociology. However, sociology remains
   very much the intellectual 'center of gravity" in criminology, and
   criminology remains an important part of sociology. Both criminology and
   sociology will benefit by a continuation and reinvigoration of their
   prior relationship.

   workers. A model of a semiotic square is used to analyze the experiences
   of bored and busy work. Through this analysis of bored and busy work,
   the author discovered clerical workers' perceptions and activities which
   were both subordinating and empowering. Clerical workers participate in
   the process of subordination through bored/busy work. However, they also
   participate in empowering strategies through not-bored/not-busy work.
   This sociology of knowledge approach shows that people are not
   automatons and strengthens our understanding of the social reproduction

AB Drawing on a 3-year ethnography and participant observation study of a

   subproletarian bodily craft of boxing by uncovering its embedded social
   logic and meaning, and (b) contribute to a theory of practice that
   escapes the false antinomies associated with rational choice and
   normative models of action. The first part explores the peculiar
   relation of symbiotic opposition that ties the boxing gym to its
   proximate social matrix of the black ghetto and to the masculine street
   culture from which it draws its sustenance and shelters its members. The
   second part treats boxing as a Durkheimian "social art" whose mastery
   involves an intensive, ascetic, and strictly regulated manipulation of
   the body designed to inculcate through direct embodiment the set of
   corporeal, visual, and mental schemata immanent to pugilistic practice.
   The social production of the pugilistic habitus as embodied practical
   reason thus suggests the need to place the socialized lived body at the
   center of the analysis of social action.

AB Previous research contends that when Talcott Parsons developed the
   substantive argument of The Structure of Social Action, he turned away
   from the theoretical emptiness of American social science and drew on
   the ideas of four European social thinkers- Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and
   Marshall. Such research exemplifies the "content-fit model" of
   predecessor selection, which assumes that intellectual predecessors are
   chosen on the basis of a fit between their ideas and the project of the
   thinker who engages them. This model fails to explain Parsons's
   exclusion of the American institutionalists, most notably his Amherst
   teachers Walton Hamilton and Clarence Ayres, whose work fit directly
   with the argument of The Structure of Social Action. Institutionalist
   work was also characterized, however, by its negative reputation,
   particularly at, Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where
   Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber were thinkers of growing
   reputational standing. Examination of Parsons's involvement in the local
   Harvard network indicates that contemporary reputational judgments
   decisively affected his choice of intellectual predecessors. This
   analysis also brings to light the organizational and institutional
   conditions under which a "reputational model" is required to understand
   the process of predecessor selection.

   paper traces patterns of citations to a sample of 100 articles published
   in Social Problems during 1974-83. Evidence that citation rates are not
   gender neutral, primarily as a result of the citation practices of women
   scholars, is presented. Women's work and gender articles are cited more
   frequently than other works, especially in nonsociological sources and
   by women scholars. Women's scholarship and gender articles take longer
   than other works to reach peak citation years, a pattern that might
   disadvantage women and scholars of gender related subjects when tenure

AB This article draws on the intellectual traditions of industrial
   sociology to argue that social organizational variables as well as
   economic inputs affect production. Using a sample of 683 North Carolina
   farms, varying in size from 50 acres or fewer to more than 4,500 acres,
   the study found that the social organization of production and the
   occupational community of farming significantly affect production, net
   of the influences of agricultural resources, and the socio-demographic
   characteristics of the farm operators. Participation in the occupational
   community and having a production organization that is family based,
   with relatively high variation across status groups in task performance,
   have substantial payoff in farm sales. Resources prove to be more
   important for the productiveness of small farms, whereas social
   organizational influences are more significant for medium to large
   farms, suggesting that farms must achieve a minimum scale of operations

AB Over the past few years, numerous studies in sociology have concluded
   that foreign investment harms poor nations. These studies have focused
   on the coefficient for foreign capital stock, controlling for "flow"
   (new investment), and-defying logic-have inferred that a negative
   coefficient for stock reflects "dependency effects" that retard economic
   growth. Since capital stock is the denominator for investment rate, the
   greater the stock, the lower the investment rate, for a given level of
   new investment. Hence the negative coefficient for capital stock found
   in dependency studies indicates a beneficial investment effect, not a
   harmful effect. This point is demonstrated by reanalysis of the data
   used in dependency studies. In these data, foreign investment spurs
   growth. Earlier analysts have concluded otherwise only because their
   conclusions have belied their findings.

   of simplification. (2) Leisure is social, embedded in the roles and
   conflicts of a divided social system. (3) Leisure is contextual without
   being determined. Leisure should not be trivialized; it is important

AB Arguing that the phenomenon of global environmental change has received
   inadequate attention within environmental sociology and that the
   predominant approach of environmental sociology to global change has
   been limited, this article suggests several new perspectives.
   Environmental sociology must give more attention to the social
   construction of environmental knowledge, by building on and transcending
   the debates within the sociology of science of the past 15 years. At the
   same time, environmental sociology must rethink its theories that give
   analytical priority to the nation-state and to national units of
   analysis. These principles are illustrated through analyses of the role
   of global constructions of environmental knowledge and the recent
   politics of global environmental change.

   developed and operationalized in a nationwide study of Forest Service
   employees. Its results suggest that the attitudes and values of one
   particular segment of Forest Service employees, the Association of
   Forest Service Employees for Environmental Ethics (AFSEEE), represent an
   alternative resource management paradigm that differs significantly from
   the dominant management paradigm held by the majority of Forest Service
   employees. The emergence of this extraorganizational group of Forest
   Service employees dedicated to agency reform is unprecedented in the
   history of federal land management agencies; their charactetistics, both
   sociodemographic and attitudinal, are compared and contrasted with those
   of non-AFSEEE Forest Service employees. The potential role of AFSEEE as
   a change agent is discussed relative to other changes that are occurring

   need to carefully screen and prepare students, to acquaint them with the
   variety of placements available, and to take into account any special
   needs they may have. Site visits and seminars are also discussed as a
   means of ensuring quality supervision and sensitizing students to
   potential problems they may encounter in the placement site. The article
   stresses the importance of carefully crafted and legally sound contracts

   Third World education in introductory sociology textbooks. To examine
   this issue, we first provide a content analysis of the chapters on
   education in 22 current texts. This analysis reveals that such texts
   tend to provide an ethnocentric portrayal of education by placing the
   United States and other northern industrialized nations at the center of
   the educational universe while virtually ignoring educational issues in
   relation to the three-quarters of the world's population, those who live
   in Third World nations. We then suggest specific issues regarding Third

AB The use of internships in educating sociology majors has increased in
   recent years so that currently most departments offer some type of
   internship opportunity. Most programs are on a small scale, offering
   three or four hours of course credit. Although a major justification of
   internship programs is that they help students in career choice
   clarification, there has been little hard evidence that small-scale
   programs achieve this end. Using qualitative and quantitative data to
   evaluate a small-scale internship program, this research found that it
   helped students significantly in clarifying career choices, by providing
   information on occupations, reducing indecisiveness and anxiety
   regarding choice, and increasing confidence in the ability to choose.

   addressed an extraordinarily broad array of social phenomena, often of a
   community problem variety, in his research. His research employed a
   social systems analysis frequently focused on the rural context and had
   a strong applied orientation with the result that his findings have been
   widely used as the basis for the formulation of important national and
   international program and policy decisions. Bertrand's work has
   attracted wide attention abroad as well as in the United States. Because
   of his many contributions to the discipline of sociology, he has

   various offices in professional societies and associations, including

AB Historical sociologists have criticized their discipline for a tendency
   to ignore the temporal dimensions of social life, either by studying the
   correlates of outcomes rather than the character of temporally connected
   events or by treating events as surface manifestations of large-scale
   and long-term processes of change. These critiques have led to a
   reassessment of the value of narratives and to new methods for mapping
   historical sequences of events. Yet there has been relatively little
   discussion of the concepts needed to create a more event-centered
   historical sociology. This article explores the way in which four
   different concepts of time - duration, pace, trajectory, and cycle -
   have been used in recent historical social science. These concepts allow
   one to analyze the temporal characteristics of connected events that
   constitute long-term historical processes as well as the way in which
   actors understand and experience the temporal flow of events. They are
   most useful, the author argues when employed in a manner that is
   attentive to the understandings of social actors and the problematic
   reconstruction of the past. These concepts constitute building blocks
   for the construction of a more event-centered historical sociology.

AB With the re-emergence of historical sociology as a dominant focus of
   inquiry has come a renewed interest in more general methodological,
   theoretical, and epistemological issues that have long occupied debates
   about the relationship between history and theory. A recently published
   article by Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter brings to the fore several
   core themes in these debates. Kiser and Hechter claim that comparative
   historical sociologists not only have turned against general theory but
   theories in general. The authors argue that these conclusions are based
   on a narrow definition of the enterprise of historical sociology and on
   an attempt to confine the definition of theory to general laws. In this
   article, they first demonstrate that historical sociologists have not
   forsaken theory. Next, they articulate the dilemmas that general
   theories defined as general laws pose for historical analysis, and
   finally, they delineate what methodologically self-conscious historical
   sociologists have identified as the core elements of a temporally
   grounded historical sociology.

AB This research attempts to clarify the organization's role in creating or
   reinforcing occupational stratification by explicitly examining how
   major organizational characteristics, including dynamic processes of
   expansion, contraction, and turnover, affect change over time in women's
   representation. The research focuses on academic sociology, a discipline
   that recently made modest gains in incorporating women faculty and
   graduate students. Drawing on longitudinal surveys of sociology
   departments in the western United States, the study examines the extent
   and direction of 5-year changes in the sociology faculty sex composition
   and the degree to which men and women faculty are concentrated at
   different academic ranks. These changes at the departmental level in
   women's representation and position are analyzed as outcomes that vary
   depending on characteristics of the political economy of the department
   and of the institution as a whole. The model explains a substantial
   portion of the variance among departments in progress toward gender
   equity. In particular high institutional prestige, research orientation,
   large size, public auspices, nonurban setting, and faculty growth are
   major predictors of higher representation of women. The analysis has
   implications for understanding the link between organizational change
   and how stratification by gender is either preserved or altered.

AB We examine the structure of sociology using data on overlapping
   memberships in the discipline's "visible colleges," the specialty
   sections of the American Sociological Association. Hypotheses about the
   structure of joint specialization in sociology are derived from four
   general theories of professional and scientific specialization: 
   ideational theory, political-economic theory, professional power theory,
   and intellectual circle/network theory.  We analyze joint specialty
   section memberships using multidimensional scaling techniques and
   produce a spatial model of the discipline's specialty structure.  The
   tightest clusters of specialties arise from the confluence of ideational
   aspects (like shared concepts or subject matter), professional power
   interests, and social characteristics of members.  Although a major
   division in the discipline is embedded in the political-economic
   environment of sociology, three cross-cutting dimensions are required to
   adequately  represent the discipline's structure. The main dimensions of
   differentiation are:  (1) "conflict" versus "applied" perspectives, (2)
   micro versus macro units of analysis, and (3) ascriptive characteristics
   of members. These three dimensions support the validity of
   political-economic, ideational, and professional power theories,
   respectively.

   materials, to teach basic concepts and analytic strategies, to

   twentieth century, of drawing eclectically on several other disciplines,
   to a stance of building its arguments almost entirely out of
   neoclassical materials.  This paper argues that such a stance cannot
   provide a persuasive account of economic institutions, and suggests a
   broader foundation based on classical sociological arguments about the
   embeddedness of economic goals and activities in socially oriented goals
   and structures.  Emphasis is placed on how economic activity comes to be
   coordinated by groups of people rather than carried out by isolated
   individuals.  Firms in developing countries, business groups, and the
   origins of the electrical utility industry in the United States are
   posed as cases of the 'social construction of economic institutions'. 
   It is argued that, although proper analysis of such cases involves a
   high level of contingency, these contingencies can be taken into account
   in a systematic theoretical argument, and that historicist pitfalls can
   be avoided.  Such an argument is posed as the distinctive agenda for a
   new economic sociology.

TI LAW THAT DOES NOT FIT SOCIETY - SENTENCING GUIDELINES AS A NEOCLASSICAL

AB Chances of realizing a legal rationality that does not fit society are
   limited. Referring to Weber's "Sociology of Law," to related themes in
   the sociology of polity, organizations, and occupations, and to recent
   debates on technocratization, juridification, delegalization, and
   responsive law, this article presents a theoretical discussion of this
   thesis. An empirical case, using the neoclassical concept of sentencing
   guidelines, exemplified by the federal and Minnesota cases, supports the
   argument. The neoclassical movement, aiming to reverse the
   substantivation of law and to correct lack of due process, functional
   failures, disparities, and discrimination, faces considerable
   impediments and may result in counterproductive effects. The article
   demonstrates that (1) societal conditions that caused substantivation
   hamper reformalization in the political process; organizational and
   occupational consequences of substantivation also impede (2) political
   and (3) implementation chances of neoclassical instruments; and (4)
   impediments to reformalization derive from the method of central
   guidance used to reestablish sociologically formal rationality.

AB Although the analysis of 'styles of thought' formed the basis of Karl
   Mannheim's substantive sociology of knowledge, relatively little
   attention has been given to the specifics of this incipient research
   programme. This article provides a reconstruction and critique of the
   basic features of the sociological analysis of styles of thought as
   found in the empirical work of Mannheim, C. Wright Mills, and Kurt
   Danziger. Some pertinent objections to Mannheim's method of analyzing
   thought styles are addressed, and some comparisons are drawn between the
   sociology of styles of thought and kindred work in the history of ideas.
   I conclude with some suggestions on the kinds of research sites that
   could further extend the research programme of stylistic analysis of
   ideas.

AB The purpose of this research report is twofold:  First, we analyze a
   complex of attitudes about rape myths, adversarial sexual beliefs, and
   gender-role conservatism; and second, we evaluate the impact of
   rape-education intervention strategies on American college students'
   attitudes.  Using the Solomon four-group design, we randomly assigned 14
   classes of Sociology 101 students (total N = 582) to three different
   treatment conditions:  a live rape-education workshop, a video of the
   workshop, and a control group.  We found significant gender differences
   in students' attitudes on all the scales, with women being more
   knowledgeable about rape, less likely to blame the victim, and less
   accepting of adversarial sexual beliefs and gender-role conservatism. 
   Most important, we found that within the limits of the study,
   rape-education intervention works in changing some attitudes about rape
   for both men and women students.  We examine the impact of the different
   educational strategies and explore curricular implications, including
   the need to teach about rape within a feminist context.

AB Today sociologists tend to doubt the rural-urban continuum, the idea
   that community is more characteristic of country places than cities.
   Based on an ethnographic study of an English exurban village, I argue
   that the continuum remains an important source of identity for country
   residents, one from which they derive social-psychological and material
   benefits. They root this conception of themselves as country people in
   nature, making this identity a particularly secure one. These real
   social consequences suggest that sociology should no longer doubt the
   reality of the rural-urban continuum, at least at the level of the
   definition of the situation. It, therefore, should remain an important
   topic of sociological study.

AB This paper outlines four theoretical approaches to the sociology of
   weapons proliferation:  strategic-functional theories, factional
   theories, geopolitical theories, and institutional theories.  Although
   rarely formulated explicitly, the first three approaches are implicit in
   the existing literature on proliferation.  All three see proliferation
   as the result of rational decision making, although they differ as to
   the locus of these decisions, with strategic-functional theories
   focusing on the nation-state, factional theories on subnational
   interests, and geopolitical theories on global superpowers.  In
   contrast, the institutional approach disputes the rationality of
   procurement, arguing instead that weapons purchases are structured and
   driven by institutionalized normative structures that link advanced
   weaponry with modernization and soverignty.  The policy implications of
   this perspective are discussed, and parallels to recent developments in
   organizational theory are highlighted.

AB This paper examines several facets of gender integration within academic
   sociology: total segregation, as in all-male faculties; appointments of
   women in token or solo positions; variations in the departmental faculty
   sex ratio; and the "ghettoization" of women in lower academic ranks and
   positions with heavy committee assignments. These outcomes are analyzed
   at the organizational level as the product of the operation of internal
   and external labor markets in academia. Drawing on a representative 1984
   national survey of sociology departments (N = 230), multivariate
   analyses indicate that a large proportion of the variation in gender
   integration from one department to the next can be predicted from the
   organizational context. Several organizational factors appear to
   militate against total segregation (all-male faculties) while promoting
   balance in the faculty sex ratio and in the distribution of academic
   rank. These include demand for labor in the form of job opportunities,
   especially those created through turnover; women in the institutional
   power structure, including a separate women's studies program; and a
   state legislative climate favoring women's legal and political rights.

AB Blau's (1977) macrostructural theory builds on the assumption that
   social structure affects intergroup relations.  This relationship
   depends upon the opportunity for intergroup contact.  Previous tests of
   Blau's theory, however, treat opportunity as an unmeasured construct. 
   P*, as a measure of opportunity for intergroup contact, not only enables
   a test of that assumption, but also merges general sociological
   principles with specific middle-range ones like those urban sociology
   develops.
   Findings here modestly support Blau's opportunity for contact
   assumption.  Serendipitously, the analysis demonstrates that
   heterogeneity asymmetrically influences opportunities for intergroup
   contact between groups of varying size.  Because increasing
   heterogeneity presupposes an increase in the minority proportion and a
   decrease in the majority, it enhances majority and suppresses minority
   opportunities for intergroup contact.  This suggests that Blau's
   heterogeneity theorem, which assumes a symmetrical effect on contact,
   needs some qualification.

   sentiments and symbols in organizing and motivating urban behavior, and
   symbolic interactionists increasingly are becoming interested in social

   Cooley's emphasis on selectivity and interpretation in the process of

AB It is relatively easy to determine if evidence supports or does not
   support a given theory or conclusion, but a central problem in sociology
   is our inability to go beyond this and develop truly convincing evidence
   about a theory.  Several changes in current practices are vital,
   including the cessation of nonproductive assaults between sociologists
   on the evidence used in the discipline.  More fundamentally, theory
   should not be viewed as one pole of a continuum with research on the
   other end.  A probabilistic view of theory is proposed such that a
   theory may be correct even if there is negative evidence.  This leads to
   a different way of evaluating evidence, a different view of the role of
   examples, a distinction between explanations of particular events as
   opposed to evaluations of theories, skepticism about the possibility of
   developing theories that account for long complex chains of events, and
   a sharp differentiation between the evidence used in applied as opposed
   to basic research.  A new sociological specialty should concern itself
   with epistemological issues that arise in determining the verifiable
   propositions that are the basic building blocks to sociological
   knowledge.

AB Interpreting and predicting the social world requires assumptions about
   human tendencies.  Empirical validation of such premises, however, is
   not available.  They are, essentially, beliefs held by the observer. 
   Most important, perceptions of the sources and types of effective social
   control hinge on conceptions of human nature.  This is awkward for the
   sociology of work because quite starkly divergent analytical
   consequences can result.  This article describes two contrasting sets of
   assumptions:  the optimistic and the pessimistic.  A towering
   representative of the former perspective is Karl Marx, and of the
   latter, Sigmund Freud.  The perspectives are then applied to Kai
   Erikson's recent essay on alienation to illustrate the different
   conclusions that one might draw by substituting one cluster of
   assumptions for the other.  The results suggest that the sociology of
   work would be better served if our writing and teaching explicitly

AB In this article, data on home health agencies reveal surprisingly few
   differences between organizations of different tax status (nonprofit vs.
   forprofit). These findings directly contradict economic theories of
   nonprofit organization, as well as third-party government theory from
   political science. Since ecological theory in sociology proposes a
   useful explanation for organizational similarities, the authors search
   for differences between nonprofit and forprofit organizations among
   generalists and specialists. They find that specialists are quite
   similar, regardless of tax status, but generalists are different, a
   disparity that seems to contradict ecological analysis. Since
   institutional theory also explains isomorphism, the authors search for
   differences between organizations that do and do not belong to chains.
   Chains are more similar than nonchains. The discussion of the results
   centers on changes in the institutional context of home health care over
   the last decade, especially cascade effects of prospective payment
   schemes and the advent of new organizational forms. The authors conclude
   that the idea of accommodative isomorphism helps account for
   similarities among nonprofit and for-profit chains.

   programs and the specific strategies these faculty members used in
   nurturing critical reasoning skills.  We developed a four-page
   questionnaire to assess the students' perceptions of these programs. 
   Overall the programs appear effective in the eyes of the students; 70
   percent believed they had adequate opportunities to develop their
   critical reasoning skills, and 62 percent reported an increase in those
   skills.  We discuss the findings from this project in terms of the

AB A content analysis of 47 social theory textbooks reveals that certain
   social theorists are no longer given the coverage they once received. 
   After examining some reasons for the general decline in coverage of many
   theorists, the continued popularity of Hegel, the decline of interest in
   Machiavelli and Vico, and the continued slight coverage of Ibn Khaldun,
   we discuss the impact of both the Cold War and "scientific" sociology on
   the content of theory texts.

AB The few surveys of employment opportunities for behavioral scientists in
   industrial firms have been limited in scope.  As employment
   opportunities for behavioral scientists in industrial firms increase,
   such surveys can provide behavioral science departments with useful
   information when curriculum changes are considered.  This study was
   based on a random selection of 300 North Carolina manufacturing firms. 
   It sought to determine the extent to which these firms hired behavioral
   scientists, the disciplines from which they came, and how their
   employers evaluated them.  We discuss the implications of this survey
   data for curriculum reform in small universities and colleges.

AB Sociology and other social sciences traditionally have focused on
   preparing students for study at the graduate level rather than on
   training them for employment in a wide variety of settings.  Using
   survey data from 1,194 alumni in the social sciences, we obtained
   ratings of each major regarding the development of basic employment
   skills.  We found that, in relation to other social science majors, the
   sociology major received mediocre ratings in developing such skills.  We
   note improvement of this rating, however.  The highest ratings were
   given by nonwhite males and the lowest by nonwhite females.  We also
   found a substantial income gap between the genders among CSU social
   science alumni regardless of race, parents' educational level, GPA, or
   rating of the major's development of basic employment skills.

PD WIN 1991
PY 1991
AB As a result of environmental and agrarian activism and of academic
   critique, a substantial amount of space is available now for moving
   agricultural technoscience onto new trajectories. A critical rural
   sociology has played a key role in pushing forward the deconstructive
   project that has been instrumental in creating this space. And rural
   sociologists can be active agents in the reconstruction of the
   alternative science that must emerge from "actually existing" science
   and that must be developed if there is to be a truly alternative
   agriculture. But to be effective in this effort we need to enlarge not
   only the canon of our colleagues in the natural sciences, but our own
   canon as well. This article suggests that the theoretical resources for
   such reconstruction are available in contemporary sociological and
   feminist interpretations of science. Material resources for the
   reconstruction of a "successor science" are to be found in the "local
   knowledge" that is continually produced and reproduced by farmers and
   agricultural workers. Articulations and complementarities between
   theoretical resources are suggested and potentially productive research
   areas are outlined.

AB Participant observation data from both Japan and the United States are
   used to correct the common argument in the sociology of religion that
   Zen Buddhism in America is mainly a deviant cult response to personal
   strains resulting from various social discontinuities and conflicts.
   While such explanations do shed light on the recruitment of some
   participants in new religious groups, they suffer from being exaggerated
   and from being historically and cross-culturally incomplete. The present
   analysis argues that the emergence of organized Zen in America must also
   be understood as the result of a process of culture diffusion of
   Mahayana Buddhism from East Asia to North America since World War II.
   This process has also involved a sectarian reformation of Zen in the
   course of its diffusion from Japan, suggesting that American Zen may be
   better understood as a sectarian rather than a "cult" movement. Data are
   provided by the author's accompaniment of an American Zen Master on his
   travels in Japan for the purpose of official confirmation by the Soto
   Sect as a Zen priest and teacher. Visits to numerous temples in the
   American priests lineage provided extensive illustration of the reality
   of Zen's cultural and institutional diffusion to North America, of the
   ancient and traditional origins of this "new" American religion, and of
   the reformation it has undergone during its transplantation from East to
   West. The article concludes with an outline of a six-stage culture
   diffusion model for future research.

AB American norms for the proper timing of events are reflected in a
   preference for academic achievement "on schedule." Unlike most other
   societies with formalized education, however, we also tolerate
   educational late blooming. The preference for blooming "on time" may be
   explained by the positive social functions of scheduling educational
   success. Such rigidity in the American experience, however, would run
   counter to the value we place on higher education as a medium for
   equality of opportunity and would threaten the existence of many
   institutions of higher learning that serve specialized markets. While
   the American tolerance for educational late blooming has created
   opportunities not found in other societies, late blooming may also have
   the latent dysfunction of encouraging "temporal loafing. "

AB This paper situates metatheorizing in a postpositivist approach to
   social science.  Postpositivism contends that social science is
   organized around competing traditions, which are comprised of
   generalized discourse and research programs.  Following an examination
   of the relations between discourse and programs, the dynamics fueling
   social scientific competition are outlined.  Because that competition is
   subject to recurrent distortions and therefore cannot insure that the
   best arguments win, it is proposed that metatheorizing assume an
   adjudicative posture and evaluate the conflicting claims of rival
   schools.  This suggestion is elaborated in the context of Ritzer's
   pioneering work on metatheorizing.

AB The current debates on metatheory in sociology do not account for the
   fact that metatheorizing, as a distinct intellectual activity, is
   unequally distributed throughout the sciences.  As a reflexive and
   critical subspecialty, metatheory and metasociology are more likely to
   routinely accompany work in loosely coupled and highly controversial
   disciplines.  The theory of scientific organizations explains the
   propensity for metatheorizing as the outcome of weak and conversational
   fields that rely mostly on texts to support their discourse.

PD FAL 1991
PY 1991
AB When Parsons derived action theory from Durkheim's sociology, he also
   argued with Durkheim, disputed his claims, and expressly rejected some
   of his fundamental principles.  Accordingly, American functionalism
   contained a hidden "negative image" of Durkheim.  Parsons's student,
   Harold Garfinkel, addressed functionalism at its weak points, eventually
   overthrowing most of what Parsons had to say about society.  Some of
   these weak points were predicated on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim,
   including explicit rejection of Durkheim's equivalences between society,
   morality, and objective reality.  Garfinkel's ethnomethodology therefore
   rejected what had been premised on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim.  In
   so doing, it reversed the negative image of Durkheim back to its
   positive classical form and empirically demonstrated some of Durkheim's
   most troubling principles.  Since Garfinkel did not deliberately recover
   Durkheim in this manner, the dynamics of this case make it an
   interesting study of how theorists read other theorists.

TI EMBEDDING POLANYI MARKET SOCIETY
SO SOCIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES
VL 34
IS 2
BP 219
EP 235
PD SUM 1991
PY 1991
AB Karl Polanyi remains one of the most trenchant critics of neoclassical
   economics. His "embeddedness" thesis, which holds that all economic
   activities and institutions are enmeshed in social relations and
   institutions, offers a sound theoretical basis for economic sociology.
   Nonetheless, he fails to embed the market concept. This theoretical
   lacuna manifests itself in his classic account of the rise of market
   society in England, The Great Transformation ([1944] 1957), where he
   neglects to consider institutional diversity and discontinuities in
   English commercial development. Polanyi's embeddedness thesis can be
   taken to its logical conclusion; that is, even the market can be
   embedded. "Markets" can be treated as social networks or organizations
   constituted by traders. I offer as an empirical illustration a brief
   case study of the rise of "market society" in England.

PY 1990
AB By examining the 5,413 illustrations provided in 33 introductory
   sociology textbooks published between 1982 and 1988, we explored the way
   textbook publishers in sociology pictorially construct images of gender
   and race. Individuals in a picture are coded for race and gender
   identity; each picture is coded for location in or outside the United
   States and for placement in 1 of 26 substantive topics. Although people
   of color were shown in numerically "fair" proportions, including Blacks
   seemed to be a way of "staging" equality in the United States, while
   including other minorities appeared to offer "cross-cultural"
   comparisons to American society. Women accounted for only 36 percent of
   the individuals portrayed in these books, regardless of racial and
   ethnic category. Race and gender seemed to be conceptualized as
   nonoverlapping categories; White women "have" gender, while women of
   color apparently "have" only race. White men and boys occupied the
   center stage in these images of society; not only were more White men
   and boys presented than any other gender or race category, but they also
   received more exclusive attention and visually dominated the crucial
   institutions of politics and the economy. Although authors and
   publishers may strive to be fair, the way that race and gender
   representation is constructed in introductory sociology textbooks tends
   to reflect rather than critique popular American stereotypes.
