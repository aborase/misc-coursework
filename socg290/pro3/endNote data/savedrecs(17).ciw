AB Unlike text-based cybersex, televideo is an embodied experience.
   Participants present their bodies as an object to be looked at. Through
   in-depth interviews this study examines the relationships among selfhood
   and the body and the context in which both are located. The body, much
   like the self, exists as both a viewed object and an experienced
   subject. Televideo cybersex participants manipulate this relationship by
   presenting themselves as only a body, the experience of which acts back
   in an erotic "looking glass" affecting how the self conceives of the
   body. While in some cases the medium serves to create a "disembodied"
   context for interaction, as this study illustrates, it may also serve to
   fully embody The obvious relationships among self, body, and social
   situation made evident in any form of sexual experience are largely
   unexplored in sociology, yet hilly within the realm of interest and
   theoretical models of symbolic interaction.

   identifies as prerequisite to critical thinking. After exploring the

   some of the kinds of strategies that foster deep structure learning. The
   bulk of the paper then examines a number of ironies that exist for
   instructors who employ strategies that enhance critical thinking. The
   ironies of effective teaching arise because instructors and students
   socially construct the classroom and the teaching/learning exchange
   quite differently.

   in teaching about genocide and the Holocaust. Sociology provides the
   theoretical tools necessary for us to meaningfully integrate research,
   teaching, and learning in this area. To move closer to explanation and
   prediction, we need to more fully develop a sociology of genocide and
   the Holocaust-one grounded, for example, in the study of collective
   behavior and social movements, in the study of social groups and group
   dynamics, in the interaction of structure and agency, and in the study
   of the social constructions of group identity. Examples drawn from
   several sociology courses are used to illustrate how the "sociological"
   can be integrated in the study of genocide and the Holocaust and how the
   study of the Holocaust can be integrated into our study of the
   "sociological.".

AB Service learning, the integration of community service and curricular
   content, is being embraced by sociologists in a variety of teaching
   settings. One of the primary challenges of service-learning pedagogy is
   incorporating the community-based experience into the curriculum. This
   article will center on my strategy for meeting this challenge. My
   Introduction to Sociology course employs a thematic approach in order to
   create a fully integrated experiential learning experience. I have used
   this highly adaptable approach successfully in two types of
   institutional settings. This article will describe the institutional
   contexts, course content and objectives, service-learning component, use
   of themes for integrating service and curriculum, and student outcomes.
   In addition, I will explore the potential pitfalls of this approach and

   compared to the early years of the journal, it is clear that fewer

   research and writing about the key components of assessment plans
   (statement of purpose, goals and outcomes objectives, and assessment
   mechanisms) and about the work involved in conducting an annual
   assessment program. We discuss the evolution of assessment within
   sociology and the paucity of both descriptive and explanatory research
   on assessment of student learning. We also pose important research
   questions that sociologists could pursue to enhance understanding of the
   context, content, process, and effects of assessment. The paper also
   examines the assessment movement itself: forces that have stimulated the
   movement, the demonstrated benefits of conscientious assessment of
   student learning, sources of resistance to assessment, and the general
   status of assessment in higher education today.

AB Previous studies have established that people encode the race of each
   individual they encounter, and do so via computational processes that
   appear to be both automatic and mandatory. If true, this conclusion
   would be important, because categorizing others by their race is a
   precondition for treating them differently according to race. Here we
   report experiments, using unobtrusive measures, showing that
   categorizing individuals by race is not inevitable, and supporting an
   alternative hypothesis: that encoding by race is instead a reversible
   byproduct of cognitive machinery that evolved to detect coalitional
   alliances. The results show that subjects encode coalitional
   affiliations as a normal part of person representation. More
   importantly, when cues of coalitional affiliation no longer track or
   correspond to race, subjects markedly reduce the extent to which they
   categorize others by race, and indeed may cease doing so entirely.
   Despite a lifetime's experience of race as a predictor of social
   alliance, less than 4 min of exposure to an alternate social world was
   enough to deflate the tendency to categorize by race. These results
   suggest that racism may be a volatile and eradicable construct that
   persists only so long as it is actively maintained through being linked
   to parallel systems of social alliance.

   to test for a wide variety of genetic disorders in children. These
   developments raise important ethical questions about the proper use of
   genetic testing. One context, in particular, where these questions have
   arisen is that of preadoption genetic testing. This article examines the
   current consensus view recently advanced by the American College of
   Medical Genetics and The American Society of Human Genetics on when
   pediatric testing is ethically permissible. We argue that the consensus
   view does not adequately recognize the special ethical responsibilities
   that arise in the preadoption context. Once these special ethical
   responsibilities are identified, they provide a compelling argument to
   revise the current standards to permit more preadoption genetic testing
   than is currently recommended. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB As emissions trading regimes become increasingly popular mechanisms for
   environmental pollution control around the world, environmentalists are
   asking whether market-based programmes meet their promise of both
   efficient and equitable pollution reductions. The emissions trading
   regime of the USA's Acid Rain Programme (ARP) is investigated in order
   to determine whether the programme has concentrated sulphur dioxide
   (SO2) pollution disproportionately for the poor and people of colour.
   While the USA emissions trading regime has been hailed as a success for
   cost-efficiently reducing pollution in the aggregate, critics contend
   that the programme is insufficiently attentive to the localized
   concentrations of harmful SO2 that trading can create. Further,
   advocates of environmental justice question whether emissions trading
   might exacerbate the disproportionate pollution burdens already facing
   the poor and people of colour. Stack emissions and pollution allowance
   holdings for all 110 power plants participating in Phase I of the
   trading programme are correlated with income and racial demographic
   characteristics of the people living around each plant to determine
   whether the ARP might raise distributive environmental justice concerns.
   Using USA Census data at the tract level, income and racial demographics
   around plants that increased and decreased their emissions as well as
   plants that were net purchasers and sellers of pollution allowances over
   the first three years of the programme are compared. For the first few
   years of the ARP, the emissions trading regime does not appear to have
   been concentrating SO2 pollution disproportionately for the poor and
   racial minority populations.

AB Nepal has a number of wetlands in the lowland region of the country
   along the southern Indo-Nepalese border that have experienced great
   pressures from growing human populations due in part to migration of
   people from the mountains. A questionnaire survey and informal
   interviews with key informants in 1998 were used to explore the
   socio-economic status of indigenous and non-indigenous inhabitants' use
   patterns of forest and wetland resources and attitudes about
   conservation in Ghodaghodi Lake, a proposed Ramsar site, in the lowlands
   of western Nepal. Tharus, indigenous to the region, represented 33% of
   the population; the rest were migrants from the mountains. Tharus had
   lower literacy rates, larger landholdings and kept different livestock
   species. Most Tharu families were dependent on extraction from wetlands;
   all groups used forests for fuelwood but mountain settlers used forests
   for fodder more than did Tharus. Most respondents expressed willingness
   to participate in the conservation of Ghodaghodi Lake; however, only
   12%, mostly mountain settlers, had ever participated in formal
   conservation activities. Conservation attitudes were strongly influenced
   by educational level and resource use. Educated males of higher caste
   and mountain origin who had previously participated in formal management
   activities were more positive towards conservation than other groups.
   There is a need to implement a participatory integrated management plan,
   to include community development, education and off-farm income
   generation, to assure participation of Tharus and lower caste households
   of mountain origin in the conservation and management of wetlands and
   forests in the area.

AB With perhaps controversial implications for theory and practice, this
   paper suggests that the validity of Hardinian theories of tire commons
   are dependent on the implicit rational choice assumption that resource
   users are aware of resource degradation. Without an awareness of the
   collective costs of resource rise, there can be no dilemma between
   pursuing individual benefits and avoiding collective ruin. In such
   situations, the dilemma of the commons cannot be validly, said to be
   tire cause of resource depletion, and many traditional policy options to
   address common resource depletion may not be effective. Two reasons for
   the lack of awareness about resource degradation are (1) fatalistic
   beliefs that humans cannot harm a resource base, and (2) the growing
   complexity and abstraction of modern environmental problems that have
   obscured the collective costs of resource use from our individual and
   societal awareness.

AB This paper examines the relationship between rural socialization and
   hunting participation. Assessments of the cultural significance of
   hunting as a "way of life" in rural areas echo traditional assertions of
   the importance of rurality, but do not consider the interplay between
   rural residence and other variables that affect hunting participation.
   Although previous research has demonstrated that rural residents are
   more likely to participate in hunting, as are males and those who are
   influenced by family, the interaction of these variables is poorly
   understood. A national survey used a socialization framework to explore
   the more specific conditions under which rural upbringings were
   associated with increased hunting participation. Rural upbringings
   fostered air increase in hunting primarily when the socialization
   relationship between agent and target was unlikely to do so and when
   participation was consistent with gender norms: rural males whose
   fathers did not hunt were more likely to hunt than urban males whose
   fathers did not. In no other cases did rural upbringings result in an
   increased propensity for hunting. Therefore we suggest that broad
   statements about the cultural significance of hunting to rural life be
   made more cautiously, with the effects of other variables taken into
   account.

   addresses topics informal sociological models and the definition,

   standard classes of formalisms used to construct models in contemporary
   sociology can be derived from the general theory of models. This
   demonstrates, at a high level of abstraction, the isomorphism of many
   formal sociological models to the formal models used in virtually every
   scientific discipline today. I also review recent model-building and
   model-evaluation efforts in which I have participated on the estimation
   of active life expectancy of the U.S. elderly population, an assessment
   of the robustness of a recently proposed adjusted total fertility rate,
   and the construction of a new index of child and youth well-being. These
   studies show how formal models help us to see patterns in data that
   otherwise are not detectable, improve social measurement, and, in
   particular, define and interpret social indicators.

AB Is the new paradigin in the sociology of religion, known commonly as the
   "supply-side" or "rational choice" perspective, leading towards a
   plausible general theory? At this point, the answer remains dependent
   upon how one interprets current deviations from the paradigin's
   predictions. This article investigates two cases in postcommunist
   Europe, Poland and East Germany, which appear to contradict a simple
   core hypothesis of the new paradigin. We argue that these anomalous
   cases are opportunities to examine and potentially extend the
   explanatory range of the new paradigin. Ultimately, we conclude that
   these cases can be shown through closer analysis to fit with the
   underlying logic of the new paradigin and thereby argue for the theory's
   continued evaluation and augmentation.

AB The sociology of music has been an area largely left to European
   sociologists. In an effort to generate greater domestic interest in the
   field, an examination of Max Weber's methodology and an update to his
   study of music is proposed. Fewer occupations or cultural projects are
   more social than making music, and the domestic sociological community's
   absence from the debate is deplorable given the dominant position our
   country possesses regarding musical production. Weber's Sociology of
   Music, which combines urban theory, class/labor theory, rationalization
   theory, and even climatic changes, is an excellent place to begin a
   thorough discussion of the social components of music. Our present
   understanding of cultural theories, urban theories, and Habermas's
   Communicative Action Theory can be employed to improve on Weber's
   theory; toward a new approach for the study of the sociology of music.

AB As sociologists we are guided by a rational approach to understanding
   the social world. This rational approach is also evident in the way we
   test students. But do students approach tests from the same orientation
   that we take in creating them, or are they influenced by such
   nonrational orientations as superstitions? To explore this question the
   authors created and administered the Luck and Superstition Questionnaire
   to 426 students taking Introduction to Sociology. We found that nearly
   70 percent of students indicate some level of test-related superstitious
   practice. However, we also found that superstitious practice was largely
   unrelated to religious belief and practice, gender and race, educational
   performance and grade expectations, and end-of-semester pressures. These
   results are entirely consistent with Colin Campbell's theory of modern
   superstition. Superstitious practice in modem society is
   self-sustaining-not integrated into social institutions or systems of
   belief-and only "half-believed" by the very practitioners of modern
   superstition.

AB Although significant social progress characterized the twentieth
   century, sociologists usually avoid acknowledging progress for fear of
   encouraging complacency about social problems. In four paradoxical ways,
   progress raises concern about social problems. The paradox of
   perfectionism is that optimistic beliefs in social perfectability
   highlight failures to achieve perfection and thereby foster pessimism.
   The paradox of proportion is that reducing large problems makes smaller
   problems seem relatively larger. The paradox of proliferation is that
   social progress encourages recognition of a larger number of problems.
   Finally, the paradox of paranoia is that progress fosters fears of
   social collapse. Sociologists need to consider the consequences of
   downplaying progress.

AB Bringing sociological theory and research to bear on the "quota debates"
   dogging discussion of federal civil rights legislation in the early
   1990s, this article highlights sociology's role in shaping employment
   law and shows how apparently technical legal arguments about allocating
   burdens of proof affect labor market resource allocation among the
   classes, races, and genders. Contrasting institutional-sociological with
   liberal-legal concepts of discrimination, the article shows why
   disparate impact theory has been the most sociological approach to Title
   VII enforcement. It also shows how disparate impact-a theory and method
   for establishing legally cognizable employment discrimination injurious
   to women and minorities-is, and is not, related to affirmative action-a
   policy encompassing a broad range of procedures intended to provide
   positive consideration to members of groups discriminated against in the
   past. Finally, a competing incentive framework is used to show that,
   although disparate impact creates some incentives for employers to adopt
   quota hiring, such incentives are counter-balanced by major incentives
   working against race- and gender-based quotas. Major counterincentives
   stem from disparate impact itself, from other aspects of equal
   employment law, and from organizational goals shaping business response
   to the legal environment.

   sociology has been divided from the start along national lines, yet
   continues to progress towards harmony thanks to the "dialogical"
   commitments of the various national traditions. I argue that Levine
   misjudges the character and depth of past and present rifts, and that he

AB This article illuminates Levine's analysis of the German tradition in
   his book Visions of the Sociological Tradition in the light of Max
   Weber's concept of verstehen. According to Levine, the understanding of
   subjective meaning is the most important theme of thinkers whose ideas
   resulted in the founding of sociology in Germany. Visions is more than a
   history of sociological theory, its broadest purpose being to stimulate
   a dialogue among competing "narratives" that will reduce the
   fragmentation in contemporary sociology and also address the moral
   dilemmas in contemporary society. This dialogical purpose provides a
   criterion for selecting ideas that best represent the various
   sociological traditions. Considering Weber in the context of Levine's
   book will not only clarify the German tradition but will also lead to
   both support and criticism of his dialogical thesis.

   view for understanding the formation of sociology in Germany. The author
   suggests that Levine's account can be supplemented and strengthened by
   reconstructing the German tradition both as an effort to proceed without
   foundational philosophical systems and as an outgrowth of social
   economics and the historical school of political economy. Most
   importantly, Levine shares the call for sociology as the site of

AB Critics of Visions in this symposium raise three general questions. The
   question of inclusiveness is addressed by linking pertinent criteria to
   the book's aims; that of justifying national traditions by reviewing
   pertinent evidence; and that of the viability of dialogue by arguing
   that responsive communication does not entail full agreement. A number
   of particular issues the critics raise are addressed by the book's
   arguments regarding the relation of the discipline of sociology to its
   philosophical background, the international setting of early sociology,
   Durkheim's individualism, Weber's distinction between naturalism and
   interpretability, Marx's treatment of Feuerbach and of nationalism, and
   the relation between power and knowledge. This response concludes by
   explicating the proposal that the time may be ripe to rejoin a number of
   the elements of Aristotelian social science that had been delegated to
   various national traditions of social theory in the modern era.

PD December, 2001
PY 2001
AB With perhaps controversial implications for theory and practice, this
   paper suggests that the validity of Hardinian theories of the commons
   are dependent on the implicit rational choice assumption that resource
   users are aware of resource degradation. Without an awareness of the
   collective costs of resource use, there can be no dilemma between
   pursuing individual benefits and avoiding collective ruin. In such
   situations, the dilemma of the commons cannot be validly said to be the
   cause of resource depletion, and many traditional policy options to
   address common resource depletion may not be effective. Two reasons for
   the lack of awareness about resource degradation are (1) fatalistic
   beliefs that humans cannot harm a resource base, and (2) the growing
   complexity and abstraction of modern environmental problems that have
   obscured the collective costs of resource use from our individual and
   societal awareness.

AB Objectives. Recent studies suggest that lesbians and gay men are at
   higher risk for stress-sensitive psychiatric disorders than are
   heterosexual persons. We examined the possible role of perceived
   discrimination in generating that risk.
   Methods. The National Survey of Midlife Development in the United
   States, a nationally representative sample of adults aged 25 to 74
   years, surveyed individuals self-identifying as homosexual or bisexual
   (n = 73) or heterosexual (n = 2844) about their lifetime and day-to-day
   experiences with discrimination. Also assessed were 1-year prevalence of
   depressive, anxiety, and substance dependence disorders; current
   psychologic distress; and self-rated mental health.
   Results. Homosexual and bisexual individuals more frequently than
   heterosexual persons reported both lifetime and day-to-day experiences
   with discrimination. Approximately 42% attributed this to their sexual
   orientation, in whole or part. Perceived discrimination was positively
   associated with both harmful effects on quality of life and indicators
   of psychiatric morbidity in the total sample. Controlling for
   differences in discrimination experiences attenuated observed
   associations between psychiatric morbidity and sexual orientation.
   Conclusions. Higher levels of discrimination may underlie recent
   observations of greater psychiatric morbidity risk among lesbian, gay,
   and bisexual individuals.

AB African-Americans have lower lung function than whites. However, the
   relative contributions of body habitus and socioeconomic factors are
   unknown. To address this question, we analyzed data from 1242 white (806
   women, 436 men) and 1084 African-American (696 women, 388 men)
   asymptomatic, nonsmoking adult participants of the third National Health
   and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). African-Americans were
   poorer, had larger FEV1/FVC and body mass index (BMI), but lower sitting
   height, FEV1 and FVC than whites. Cross-sectional regression analyses
   using spirometric, anthropometric, and socioeconomic data were performed
   separately by sex to investigate racial differences in lung function.
   Sitting height accounted for 35-39% of the race difference in both
   sexes. Poverty index accounted for about 7.5% and 2.5% of the racial
   difference in women and men, respectively, whereas the effect of
   education accounted for about 2% in women and 4.7% in men. With further
   adjustment for BMI, we could account for only about half of the racial
   difference in FEV1 and FVC. We conclude that the racial difference in
   lung function is only partially explained by a shorter upper body
   segment in African-Americans. Although low socioeconomic indicators are
   related to lower lung function, they explain only a small proportion of
   this racial difference.

AB Objectives: To describe beliefs about infant sleep position among
   African American grandmothers and other older caregivers (senior
   caregivers [SCGs]) and to measure the incremental effect on the rates of
   prone sleep after educating a group of African American SCGs.
   Design: Survey of sleep practices and beliefs. Randomized, controlled
   trial of a teaching intervention.
   Setting: Managed care prenatal clinic for normal risk obstetrics
   patients.
   Participants: Low-income pregnant women, self-identified as African
   American. An SCG is an older family member or friend to whom they would
   go for advice about routine child care. Pregnant women randomly assigned
   to the control group (educated about safe sleep practices) or the
   experimental group (education for both pregnant women and their SCG).
   Intervention: During the third trimester, 2 teaching sessions for
   pregnant women (both control and experimental groups) and for the
   experimental group's SCGs. One-on-one teaching emphasizing that infants
   should sleep supine.
   Main Outcome Measures: During the third trimester, description of rate
   of preference for prone sleep for infants among pregnant women and SCGs.
   Effects of teaching SCGs on (1) SCGs' postnatal beliefs about sleep
   position as a means to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome,
   and (2) the eventual rate of prone sleeping among study infants.
   Results: One hundred twenty-five women were in the control group; 98
   pregnant women and SCG pairs were in the experimental group. Senior
   caregivers were 47.1 +/- 12.4 years old (meant +/- SD). Most were
   grandmothers (either maternal, 72.5%, or paternal, 14.3%) or aunts or
   sisters (10.2%). No differences were noted in the prenatal rates of the
   prone preference (controls, 36.3%; experimental group, 35.7%; and SCGs,
   34.7%). Teaching SCGs did not increase the rate of the usual prone sleep
   in the experimental vs the control group (13.3% vs 17.3%, chi (2)=0.59,
   P=.44, 95% confidence interval for difference from -5.8% to +13.8%).
   After the teaching and during the pregnancy, the SCGs became less
   worried that the infant was susceptible to sudden infant death syndrome
   (chi (2)=16.6, P=.003) or likely to die of sudden infant death syndrome
   (chi (2)=24.7, P < .001). Their concerns about sudden infant death
   syndrome were significantly less postnatally, in particular when the
   infant was placed supine (chi (2)=19.4, P < .001).
   Conclusions: Most African American women and SCGs endorsed the supine
   sleeping position for infants. Among a group of African American
   infants, prenatal teaching of their grandmothers and other SCGs did not
   have a statistically significant incremental effect on the rates of the
   usual prone sleeping position. Contrary to our starting hypothesis, the
   SCGs of pregnant women who receive prenatal care seemed responsive to
   messages about supine sleeping. The Back-to-Sleep message should be
   delivered prenatally, but special prenatal interventions should attempt
   to reach women who do not receive prenatal care and SCGs who persist in
   their opposition to the supine sleeping position.

AB Risky behaviors (e.g., binge drinking, drunk driving, risky sex) are
   increasing among U.S. college students, and the personality trait of
   sensation seeking provides a potential link between such norm-breaking
   behaviors and biological processes. We examined the relationship between
   sensation-seeking behaviors and two hormones, testosterone and cortisol,
   in male and female college students. Hormone levels were hypothesized to
   contribute to the variability of individual scores on Zuckerman's
   Sensation-Seeking Scale. As expected, males scored higher on the scale
   than females, but the data failed to support the generally accepted
   positive relationship between testosterone and sensation seeking for
   either sex. Instead, our results support the existence of a significant
   inverse relationship between cortisol and sensation seeking in men, but
   not in women, even after adjustment for testosterone levels and age. Our
   study contributes to the current literature by (a) supporting the
   association between risky behavior and a hormone other than
   testosterone, (b) being the first to examine the association between
   cortisol and sensation seeking in women, and (c) identifying a possible
   effect of gender on the association between hormones and
   sensation-seeking behaviors. Gendered social norms and expectations are
   likely to be partly responsible for this effect. Theory-guided
   interdisciplinary research is needed to improve understanding of the
   biological influences on human behavior, and special attention must be
   paid to social context, women's perceptions of their expected behavior,
   and gendered socialization regarding norm-breaking or risky behaviors,
   which may obscure biological links to female behavior. (C) 2001 Academic

   MEASURES: Drawings of children that varied by sex (boy, girl) and weight
   (thin, average, chubby) were presented to children. Parents provided
   written consent and demographic data.
   RESULTS: Children evaluated drawings of thin children most favorably and
   drawings of chubby children least favorably. Thin girls were rated more
   favorably than average or chubby girls, for whom ratings did not differ
   significantly. Conversely, chubby boys were rated less favorably than
   average or thin boys for whom ratings did not differ significantly.

AB Objective: To assess the association between proximity to a needle

   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of residents of Harlem, New York City
   provided data for this study. We used geocoding to obtain the distance

   age-, race-, sex-, and income-adjusted logistic regression models, there
   was no significant association between (1) reporting a fight and

   robbery in the neighborhood in the previous 6 months and distance from

   ever having been robbed by drug users and distance from the nearest NEP
   (OR = 1.05, p = .91).
   Conclusions: There was no consistent association between living close to
   NEPS and violence reported by residents of Harlem in this study. This
   study suggests that NEPs do not adversely affect rates of violence in
   their vicinity.

AB Despite documented successes in the battle to clean up the coastal
   waters of Southern California, Los Angeles County residents continue to
   view the ocean more as a place of pollution than a vibrant and healthy
   place for bathing and swimming. This study shows that residents of Los
   Angeles County tend to hold perceptions of marine water quality that are
   at odds with data on bacteriological measures of water quality collected
   by local sanitation districts (and reported by not-for-profit Heal the
   Bay). Summary results of a survey of 400 randomly chosen households in
   Los Angeles County are given. Respondents were asked about their beach
   use and perceptions of environmental quality: both coastal water quality
   and air quality. The results suggest that perceptions of coastal water
   quality may be influenced less by "current coastal education campaigns"
   and more by the media and other factors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB Background. Homicide of women (femicide) by intimate partners is the
   most serious form of violence against women. The purpose of this
   analysis of a larger multisite study was to describe health care use in
   the year prior to murder of women by their intimate partner in order to
   identify opportunities for intervention to prevent femicide.
   Methods. A sample of femicide cases was identified from police or
   medical examiner records. Participants (n = 311) were proxy informants
   (most often female family members) of victims of intimate partner
   femicide from 11 U.S. cities. Information about prior domestic abuse and
   use of health care and other helping agencies for victims and
   perpetrators was obtained during structured telephone interviews.
   Results. Most victims had been abused by their partners (66%) and had
   used health care agencies for either injury or physical or mental health
   problems (41%). Among women who had been pregnant during the
   relationship, 23% were beaten by partners during pregnancy. Among
   perpetrators with fair or poor physical health, 53% had contact with
   physicians and 15% with fair or poor mental health had seen a doctor
   about their mental health problem. Among perpetrators with substance
   problems, 5.4% had used alcohol treatment programs and 5.7% had used
   drug treatment programs.
   Conclusions. Frequent contacts with helping agencies by victims and
   perpetrators represent opportunities for the prevention of femicide by
   health care providers. (C) 2001 American Health Foundation and Academic

   increased from 37.5 million in 1992(1) to an estimated 44 million in
   1997.(2) The unsuccessful attempt at health care reform in 1993 signaled
   a policy retreat at the federal level. Rather than the sweeping reform
   that was expected, growth in government-sponsored health insurance
   coverage would be, at best, incremental. Enactment of the Title XXI
   Children's Health Insurance Program, as part of the Balanced Budget Act
   of 1997, was such an incremental measure. With a vacuum in health care

   uranium-series dating show a present day-like climate from 4000 to 3000
   years ago, following a drier middle Holocene. A distinctly wetter and
   cooler period from 3000 to 800 years ago was followed by a period of
   present day-like conditions, with the exception of a slightly wetter
   interval from 440 to 290 years before the present. The stalagmite record
   correlates well with the archaeological record of changes in cultural
   activities of indigenous people. Such climate change may help to explain
   evidence of dwelling abandonment and population redistribution.

AB Injection drug use plays a critical role in the spread of HIV/AIDS, with
   an estimated 19,000 drug users infected each year. Counselling and
   testing services can be an important gateway for engaging HIV-infected
   individuals into medical care and can positively influence the
   preventive behaviours of IDUs. This study seeks to document and
   understand the complexity and range of motivations and deterrents to HIV
   testing among IDUs. Participants were recruited using a convenience
   sampling method. Interviews consisted of a qualitative guide and a
   quantitative survey to collect HIV testing histories, sex and drug risk
   behaviours, and demographic information. Interview data was coded and
   content analyzed to identify emerging themes and clarify the processes
   that drug users employ in deciding whether or not to test. Sixty-six
   drug users were interviewed. The sample reported a median of four
   lifetime HIV tests. Participants described a range of motivating and
   deterring factors to HIV testing across personal, interpersonal and
   structural categories. Drug users' decision to test is influenced by a
   complex network of factors. Better understanding of these motivators and
   deterrents can help providers develop a more holistic approach to
   targeting this high-risk population for HIV prevention efforts.

AB In view of the ever-increasing HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa,
   the expansion of HIV-1 voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) as an
   integral part of prevention strategies and medical research is both a
   reality and an urgent need. As the availability of HIV-1 VCT grows two
   limitations need to be addressed, namely: low rates of HIV-1 serostatus
   disclosure to sexual partners and negative outcomes of serostatus
   disclosure. Results from a study among men, women and couples at an
   HIV-1 VCT clinic in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania are presented. The
   individual, relational and environmental factors that influence the
   decision to test for HIV-1 and to share test results with partners are
   described. The most salient barriers to HIV-1 testing and serostatus
   disclosure described by women include fear of partners' reaction,
   decision-making and communication patterns between partners, and
   partners' attitudes towards HIV-1 testing. Perception of personal risk
   for HIV-1 is the major factor driving women to overcome barriers to
   HIV-1 testing. The implications of findings for the promotion of HIV-1
   VCT programmes, the implementation of partner notification policies and
   the development of Post-test support services are discussed.

AB We retrospectively assessed the cost-effectiveness of providing
   prevention referrals to high-risk seronegatives at HIV test sites in San
   Francisco. We examined the costs and effects from the perspectives of
   society and the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH). Cost
   categories assessed included referral materials, counsellor training and
   time required to make referrals, prevention services and the value of
   client time. Effect data are drawn from a study of 289 high-risk
   seronegatives and the published literature, and are applied to a
   city-wide caseload of 6,626 high-risk seronegatives. We estimate that a
   city-wide programme in San Francisco averts two HIV infections per year
   and yields net savings to society of $43,765, with a cost to the SFDPH
   of $20,738 per HIV infection averted. We conclude that providing HIV
   prevention referrals to high-risk seronegatives receiving antibody
   testing imposes significant costs, but has attractive cost-effectiveness
   when applied to a large high-risk population.

   70.3% were female, and 80.4% were non-Hispanic white. Subjects completed
   a self-administered questionnaire assessing a series of 12 hypothetical
   vaccines that varied along the dimensions of efficacy (80 or 50%), cost
   (free or $300) and social saturation or percentage of the population
   already vaccinated (10, 50 or 90%). The vaccines were each rated on an
   11-point scale ranging from zero ('I will never get this vaccine) to 100
   ('I will definitely get this vaccine, in increments of ten. All three
   dimensions were significantly associated with probability of vaccine
   acceptance, particularly vaccine efficacy, and cost. The highest rated
   vaccine (free, 80% efficacious, 90% saturation level) received a mean
   acceptability score of 83.4, whereas the lowest rated vaccine ($300, 50%
   efficacious, 10% saturation level) received a mean score of 32.8. The
   mean acceptability rating across all 12 vaccines was 55.14. These
   findings indicate the potential importance of considering the influence

AB The strategies that Russian and American banks use to evaluate the
   creditworthiness of prospective credit card holders are compared.
   Drawing on Knight's theory of risk and uncertainty, the authors argue
   that uncertainty, inherent in any credit transaction, can only be
   reduced to measurable risk if there are institutions that create
   stability over time, categorize events properly, and allow for
   verification and accumulation of information. In the United States, the
   gradual evolution of institutions underpinning rational calculation
   permits the transformation of uncertainty into risk. In Russia, however,
   such institutions are absent, and a great degree of uncertainty prevails
   in consumer credit. Using data from original fieldwork in Moscow, this
   study demonstrates that when actors face uncertainty and are unable to
   calculate risk, they rely on trust. Russian banks use and extend their
   existing social ties, or in some cases build new ties. They also exploit
   cardholders' own networks, unrelated to the bank, to increase their
   accountability through anchoring. These strategies, however, keep the
   market embedded, limited in size, and uninsurable. The authors conclude
   that calculation of probabilities (and economic rationality in its
   formal sense) is not an innate human ability but a social capacity that
   exists courtesy of institutional arrangements.

AB Objective: The majority of research on breast cancer risk and
   socioeconomic status (SES) has been conducted for blacks and whites.
   This study evaluates the relationship between SES and breast cancer
   incidence in California for four race/ethnic groups.
   Methods: Principal component analysis was used to create an SES index
   using 1990 Census data. Untracted cases were randomly allocated to
   census block groups within their county of residence. A total of 97,227
   female breast cancer cases diagnosed in California between 1988 and 1992
   were evaluated. Incidence rates and rate ratios (RRs) were estimated and
   a chi (2) test for trend across SES levels was performed.
   Results: SES was positively related to breast cancer incidence, and this
   effect was stronger for Hispanics and Asian/others than for whites and
   blacks. Adjusting by SES did not eliminate the differences in breast
   cancer rates among race/ethnic groups. RR differences between the
   race/ethnic groups were greatest in the lowest SES category and
   attenuated with increasing SES. An increasing trend over SES was
   statistically significant for all race/ethnic groups. Including randomly
   allocated cases affected RR estimates for white women only.
   Conclusions: Our results are consistent with similar findings for the
   Los Angeles area but differ from previous results for the San Francisco

AB Background Obesity has become a worldwide epidemic. Recently WHO
   acknowledged an urgent need to examine child obesity across countries
   using a standardized international standard. Studies in adults find
   obesity and socioeconomic factors (SES) factors are correlated, but
   results are inconsistent for children. Using an international standard,
   we examined the prevalence of obesity and compared the associations
   between SES factors and obesity across countries.
   Methods Data for children aged 6-18 from nationwide surveys in the US
   (NHANES III, 1988-1994), China (1993), and Russia (1992) were used. We
   used the recently updated US NCHS body mass index (BMI = wt/ht(2))
   reference to define obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 95th
   percentile) and overweight (85th less than or equal to BMI < 95th
   percentile). The WHO recommends an early version of the NCHS reference
   for international use. We conducted logistic analyses to examine the
   relationship between SES and obesity.
   Results The prevalence of obesity and over-weight was 11.1% and 14.3%,
   respectively, in the US, 6.0% and 10.0% in Russia, and 3.6% and 3.4% in
   China. The relationship between obesity and SES varied across countries.
   Higher SES subjects were more likely,to be obese in China and Russia,
   but in the US low-SES groups were at a higher risk, Obesity was more
   prevalent in urban areas in China but in rural areas in Russia.
   Conclusions Child obesity is becoming a public health problem worldwide,
   but the prevalence of obesity varies remarkably across countries with
   different socioeconomic development levels. Different SES groups are at
   different risks, and the relationship between obesity and SES varies
   across countries.

AB Background: Insurance coverage facilitates access to life-saving
   medications for many patients with HIV disease. Thus, the effects of
   insurance coverage changes, such as the gain or loss of coverage, may be
   important in explaining patient access and adherence to the medications
   used in the treatment of HIV disease.
   Objectives: The study's objective was to examine whether changes in
   health insurance coverage affect rates of prescription drug use by
   patients with HIV disease.
   Methods: Data were ascertained from adults participating in a series of
   up to six interviews as part of the AIDS Costs and Services Utilization
   Survey (ACSUS). ACSUS was an 18-month panel survey of patients in care
   for HIV/AIDS at 26 sites located in 10 U.S. cities. Poisson regression
   analyses with generalized estimating equations were conducted to
   determine the effects of demographic and socioeconomic variables on the
   acquisition rate of antiretrovirals, antipneumocystics, and
   antidepressants. The analytic sample consisted of 1566 respondents who
   provided 6518 interviews.
   Results: Although changes in insurance coverage were common, complete
   loss of insurance was reported in only 1.5% of the interviews whereas
   gaining insurance was reported in 3.3% of interviews. Having no coverage
   was associated with significantly lower rates of antiretroviral (rate
   ratio [RR], 0.73), antipneumocystic (RR, 0.58) and antidepressant use
   (RR, 0.31). Gaining insurance coverage was associated with lower
   antiretroviral (RR, 0.75) and antipneumocystic (RR, 0.70) use whereas
   losing insurance was associated with lower antiretroviral use (RR,
   0.58). In multivariate analyses, these associations remained.
   Conclusions: Changes in health insurance coverage are associated with
   lower rates of drug use for some medications used by patients with HIV
   disease.

AB Although the general objective of this study is to examine the extent to
   which spouses' socioeconomic characteristics determine whether modern
   contraception is used and whether family limitation (the demand for no
   more children) is desired, its central goal is to evaluate the degree to
   which the net effect of a woman's education on those fertility decisions
   is altered once a control is made for the level of schooling of the
   husband. Individual characteristics of spouses included as controls in
   this analysis are on the one hand women's attributes relating to
   employment, age, parity, ethnic identity, and urban residence and, on
   the other hand, the occupation of the husband. Data used in this
   research are provided by DHS surveys conducted in fourteen sub-Saharan
   countries: Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Benin, Senegal,
   Ghana, Central African Republic, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Namibia and
   Rwanda. With two dichotomous outcome variables, logistic regression was
   used to estimate two nested models for each dependent variable and for
   each country covered by the study. DHS respondents used as units of
   analysis in this study are women who were married (any kind of union)
   and non-pregnant at the time when each national survey was conducted.
   The findings suggest that, while an educated wife needs the support of
   an educated husband to state a preference for family limitation in
   contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, controlling for husband's education and
   other relevant covariates does little to undermine the evidence that
   woman's advanced education and the adoption of modern family planning
   are positively related in the developing world.

AB The 1998 El Nino significantly reduced garden productivity in the Upper
   Orinoco region in Venezuela. Consequently, parents were forced to
   allocate food carefully to their children. Nutrition data collected from
   village children combined with genealogical data allowed the
   determination of which children suffered most, and whether the patterns
   of food distribution accorded with predictions from parental investment
   theory. For boys, three social variables accounted for over 70% of the
   variance in subcutaneous fat after controlling for age: number of
   siblings, age of the mother's youngest child, and whether the mother was
   the senior or junior co-wife, or was married monogamously. These results
   accord well with parental investment theory. Parents experiencing food
   stress faced a trade-off between quantity and quality, and between
   investing in younger versus older offspring. In addition, boys with
   access to more paternal investment (i.e. no stepmother) were better
   nourished. These variables did not account for any of the variance in
   female nutrition. Girls' nutrition was associated with the size of their
   patrilineage and the number of non-relatives in the village, suggesting
   that lineage politics may have played a role. An apparent lack of
   relationship between orphan status and nutrition is also interesting,
   given that orphans suffered high rates of skin flea infections. The
   large number of orphans being cared for by only two grandparents
   suggests that grooming time may have been the resource in short supply.

AB This paper describes the efforts of Family Health International to
   develop a simple, standard and replicable methodology to estimate
   expenditures on family planning in developing countries. The study found
   that it is not possible, at least at this time, to develop such a
   methodology. Numerous problems were encountered in making expenditure
   estimates. First and most important, expenditure accounts are not always
   readily available. Even when these accounts are available, they may
   require some adjustments. In some instances, for example, the salaries
   of health workers who also provide family planning are in the health
   accounts, whereas in other cases the workers covered in the family
   planning accounts spend some of their time providing health services.
   Allocation variables then must be developed to separate spending on
   family planning from that on health. In some instances allocation
   variables were developed and used to separate family planning from
   health expenditures, but in this case allocation variables were not
   available and a cost analysis was performed. It is concluded that it
   takes considerable time and effort to estimate expenditures, and that
   the approach that was followed varied by country, reflecting the data
   available to make estimates.

AB Objective: This study examined the relationship of level of educational
   (LOE) achievement to pain experience, affective disturbance, and
   perceived disability among women with chronic pelvic pain presenting for
   pain treatment. Methods: 187 patients completed a battery of self-report
   inventories assessing pain, psychological status, and functional
   ability. Educational attainment was stratified across five levels from
   "less than high school" to "graduate/professional school." Results:
   Significant inverse associations were found between lower educational
   achievement and more severe pain, somatic preoccupation, emotional
   suffering and guardedness, and functional impairment. No differences
   were obtained across the groups for age, duration of pain, or symptoms
   of depression. Conclusions: These data provide support for the
   importance of socioeconomic factors, particularly LOE, in furthering our
   understanding of the morbidity observed among women suffering chronic
   pelvic pain. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

AB School-effects research in sociology cannot be separated from concerns
   about causality. Purely descriptive modeling justifications are
   untenable. Focusing on the Catholic school effect on learning, this
   article demonstrates an approach that places regression modeling
   strategies within a specific and well-developed framework for thinking
   about causality. While regression models should properly remain the
   workhorse methodology for school-effects research, regression estimates
   should more often be subject to exacting interpretations and presented
   alongside alternative estimates of more specific parameters of interest.
   In this demonstration, propensity-score matching estimates of the
   Catholic school effect for the Catholic schooled are provided to
   supplement the estimates obtained by regression models. Although subject
   to their own set of weaknesses, the matching estimates suggest that the
   Catholic school effect is the strongest among those Catholic school
   students who, according to their observed characteristics, are least
   likely to attend Catholic schools. Four alternative explanations are
   offered for this finding, each of which should be pursued in further
   research.

AB Academic professionals recognize that the educational context affects

   learning environment in order to facilitate particular learning
   outcomes. However, instructors may not realize the extent to which the
   institutional context and learning environment affect their identity and
   pedagogy as teachers. Using our experiences as two very similar
   instructors with nearly identical training currently teaching in very
   different institutional contexts (a large Midwestern Research I
   institution and a small West coast experimental teaching college), we
   suggest that an instructor's "teaching self" evolves and is shaped by
   the cultural and institutional environment in which she teaches. We end
   with a call for more systematic research on the effects that
   institutions have on teachers' identities.

AB Many teachers find experiential teaching methods useful for discussing
   emotional and controversial topics such as sexual identity or family
   violence. These methods, many of which include self-disclosure in the
   classroom, can break down the barriers between students and the social
   world. We explore the classroom management of student self-disclosure of
   sensitive topics drawing on our experiences teaching sociology at a
   large, urban university in which a number of students used their
   employment in the sex industry as springboards into class projects.
   Students' concerns with peer disapproval and the processes through which
   they disclosed their involvement in the sex industry raised several
   pedagogical and ethical issues that have not yet been addressed in the
   self-disclosure literature. We examine a number of difficulties with
   students disclosing information partially, either to teachers or to a
   few classmates, on classroom dynamics and teacher-student interactions.
   Finally, we evaluate a number of strategies, such as hidden involvement
   fictitious informant, and full disclosure, for managing self-disclosure
   in the sociology classroom, and we discuss additional steps that
   teachers can take to address sensitive topics in class.

AB One question dominates methodological debate in macrosociology: In
   explaining large-scale social processes should we seek simple theories
   that apply under a range of conditions or complex theories that are
   tailored to specific cases? Complex explanations are justified by their
   explanatory power and theoretical appeal. Simple explanations are
   justified by their falsifiability and their capacity to sustain strong
   conclusions. I weigh the merits of simple and complex explanations,
   applying some basic ideas from Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian
   analysis provides support for a compromise position that is rigorously
   grounded in the fundamental rules of probability. These ideas are
   illustrated in an analysis of labor union growth in Sweden.

AB Background: Following the April 20, 1999, massacre at Columbine High
   School, Littleton, Colo, school administrators, law enforcement
   officials, and the media reported a rash of successive bomb threats and
   threats of school violence that were attributed to imitation.
   Objective: To establish that the clustering of threats of school
   violence following the Columbine massacre was initiated by imitation.
   Design: A database of threats of school violence reported to the
   Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, Harrisburg, during the 50 days
   following the Columbine incident was examined to determine the daily
   frequency of threats. To determine factors that predict the occurrence
   of these threats, counties and school districts in which threats
   occurred were noted.
   Results: Pennsylvania school districts reported 354 threats of school
   violence during the 50 days after the Columbine massacre, far exceeding
   the 1 or 2 threats per year estimated by school administrators before
   1999. The frequency of these threats over time demonstrated a
   crescendo-decrescendo pattern. Fifty-six percent of the threats were
   made on or before day 10 after the incident, and more than one third
   occurred on days 8, 9, and 10. Factors that predicted the likelihood of
   a school's receiving a threat after the massacre included a greater
   proportion of white students and larger school enrollment.
   Conclusions: Successive threats of violence follow a publicized act of
   school violence. The media should recognize that imitation threats can
   occur and craft their stories accordingly.

   existence of emotion-related abilities that influence behavioral
   outcomes and social competence after controlling for general
   intelligence and personality. I agree with Roberts et al. that
   demonstrating the discriminant and predictive validity of a measure of
   EI in the context of rival predictors will require more research. I
   agree with the proponents of EI that emotion-related abilities do exist
   and show that such abilities in children account for unique variance in
   measures of adaptive behavior and social competence. However, evidence
   from developmental and clinical research suggest that these
   emotion-related abilities and their influence on socioemotional
   competence stem more from the direct effects of emotions than from a
   special form of intelligence.

   and barriers to access to equitable health care are described. Health
   beliefs of relevance in the provision of health care in general, and of

   genetic counseling to Latinos are discussed, such as the problems of
   language and other pitfalls in communication, the role of
   nondirectiveness in Latino culture, the medicalization of pregnancy, the
   language of prospective risks, and the meaning of disability. To provide
   culturally appropriate genetic counseling to Latinos, genetic
   professionals must be conversant with their personal and social history,
   culture, and traditions. At the same time, cultural stereotyping must be
   avoided, as the individuality of each patient must be recognized,

AB Recent advances in molecular genetics have highlighted the potential use
   of genetic testing to screen for adult-onset chronic diseases. Several
   issues must be addressed, however, before such tests can be recommended
   for population-based prevention programs. These issues include the
   adequacy of the scientific evidence, the balance of risks and benefits,
   the need for counseling and informed consent, and the costs and
   resources required. Ongoing assessment of the screening program and
   quality assurance of laboratory testing are also needed. This paper
   considers the application of general principles for mass screening to
   genetic testing for susceptibility to adult-onset chronic diseases.
   Evaluation of proposals for genetic screening in context of these
   principles reveals that needed evidence is often absent, particularly
   with respect to the predictive value of tests, efficacy of
   interventions, and social consequences of testing. The principles of
   population screening are developed into a framework for public health
   policy on genetic screening that has three stages: assessment of the
   screening test and interventions for those who test positive, including
   assessment of risks and costs, policy development, and program
   evaluation. Essential elements are identified, including evaluation of
   evidence and processes for consensus development and program evaluation.
   The proposed framework for public health policymaking outlined in this
   commentary, when combined with future efforts that involve an
   authoritative consensus process, may be useful for the evaluation and
   planning of genetic screening programs aimed at reducing morbidity and
   mortality from adult-onset chronic diseases.

   non-normative developmental demands, the individual may have to play a
   more important and active role to compensate for a lack of social

AB This article provides a critical reconstruction of Benjamin Nelson's
   work on the sociology of civilizations. His main concepts for
   civilizational analysis are located within the sociological tradition,
   in particular, the work of Durkheim, Mauss and their school and Max
   Weber. The article focuses especially on the historical, comparative and
   analytic value of Nelson's distinction among three types of structures
   of consciousness (sacro-magical, faith and rationalized structures),
   particularly the historical role of rationalized structures. It suggests
   how these concepts might be given both a fuller analytical
   differentiation and more detailed historical specification. The article
   emphasizes how intercivilizational encounters provide the settings for
   cultural innovations which serve as starting points for the later
   historical transformations of civilizations. Outcomes of civilizational
   encounters between Greece, Rome and Judaism in the Hellenistic era are
   given special attention. The article's main themes are illustrated
   throughout by reference to a variety of substantive issues and
   historical comparative civilizational contexts. These include the role
   of world religions, sciences, philosophies and other cultural forms in
   the ancient world, Western Europe, Russia and elsewhere.

   opened the door for majoritarian oppression of minority rights. Using
   data collected on 2,109 court cases on religion from 1981-1996 we
   document recent trends in court decisions on religion and address
   questions posed by supply-side theory, legal scholars, and the sociology
   of law. We find that religious sects and cults were more likely to be
   involved in court cases and more likely to receive unfavorable rulings.
   Multivariate models confirm these finding and support the charges of
   legal scholars that the Smith decision has decreased the rate of rulings
   favoring religious groups. Finally, we find that the Smith decision had
   both a period effect and a ease precedent effect.

AB Problem: Universities have a major problem with binge drinking by
   students. This problem is greater for universities near national borders
   where underage students can cross into areas where the legal drinking
   age is younger than in the United States. Method: A telephone survey of
   students at two large universities, within an hour drive of the Mexican
   border, was conducted to determine the extent of the cross-border
   drinking problem. Results: On average, the students reported about 6.5
   trips across the border to drink in the past year and indicated that
   when drinking in Mexico they consumed greater amounts of alcohol - more
   than six drinks compared to 4.5 in the United States. Summary: The study
   indicated that young mates drank the most (8.7 drinks) when in Mexico
   compared to 4.7 drinks for those older than 21 years and 4.5 drinks for
   women younger than 21 years. Thus, young male students who are more
   likely to be drivers than their female comparisons drink twice as much,
   when in Mexico, creating a significant risk for both. Impact on
   Industry: Unknown, but companies near the border may wish to consider
   special education programs aimed at underage male employees. (C) 2001

AB From the inception of the relatively short history of American bioethics
   in the mid-to-late 1960s, the place of religion in this field has been
   complex and controversial. It has also been a subject of more than
   casual interest and concern to bioethicists, and to an array of medical
   and non-medical groups in U.S. society for whom the activities and
   issues in which bioethics is engaged have ongoing import. The questions
   and the tensions linked to the status and influence of religion in the
   sphere of bioethics have ramifications that extend beyond bioethics and
   biomedicine into matters involving the relationship of religion to the
   institutional structure of American society-most particularly its
   polity, legal foundations, and realm of public affairs-and to its
   cultural attributes and tradition. It is within this larger perspective
   that we will consider the association between American bioethics and
   religion. Our analysis includes two case studies: (1) how, in the early
   years of bioethics, a pioneering organization in the field dealt with
   the "redefinition of death" in its discussions and in a major medical
   journal publication; and (2) the way in which the most recently
   appointed federal bioethics commission, the National Bioethics Advisory
   Commission, involved religion in its work on cloning and stem cell
   research.

   (Duda, 1985, 1986a; Whitehead, 1986), no work has addressed the impact
   of within-group variation in acculturation on motivational goal
   perspectives. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on data
   generated from young Mexican-American male (n = 83) and female (n = 80)
   athletes. Among males, the acculturation dimensions of media use (beta =
   .265, p < .001) and ethnic social relations (beta = .188, p < .001)
   significantly predicted a task goal perspective, explaining 32% of the
   variance, whereas increased ego involvement among female athletes was
   significantly predicted by language use (beta = .336, p < .01) and
   ethnic social relations (beta = .259, p < .05), accounting for 29% of
   the variance. Both statistical and theoretical explanations are offered
   for the observed gender differences. These preliminary results suggest
   that acculturation differentially impacts how Mexican-American male and
   female athletes derive their perceptions of competence within the
   competitive sport setting.

AB dRole incompatibility, education as an investment in human capital, and
   schooling as a transformative experience are three mechanisms that link
   women's education to the timing of marriage and first birth. We
   simultaneously evaluate these different explanations using retrospective
   life history data for two cohorts of Mexican women collected in a
   nationally representative sample. Our analyses provide evidence in
   support of all three hypotheses. While in school young women are at a
   substantially lower risk of marriage and of a first birth. We find no
   evidence that women leave school to enter into unions nor do we find
   evidence that the effect of being a student diminishes with age. Women
   who work for a wage are also at a lower risk of marriage and a first
   birth. Once we control for student and employment status, the direct
   effects of cumulative education on family formation are relatively
   modest, although cumulative education is strongly associated with
   positive attitudes towards women's work and a significant increase in
   the likelihood of premarital and postmarital employment.

PD FAL-WIN 2001
PY 2001
AB For decades, the study of social stratification has been dominated by
   environmental theories. Herein a theory is proposed that contains both
   biological and sociocultural elements. The theory asserts that most
   human females, like females of many other mammalian species, have
   evolved mating preferences biased toward males who are competent in
   provisioning resources. This female bias is hypothesized to have been
   naturally selected because females with these biases nearly always have
   had a reproductive edge over females who lack such a bias. One result of
   this bias is that human females preferentially mate with males who
   strive to rise in social status. This, in turn, has favored males who
   attain or at least strive for high social status, and who advertise and
   even exaggerate whatever status they already have achieved. At the
   genetic level, the theory postulates that alleles have accumulated on
   the human genome that promote social status-striving and achievement to
   varying degrees. To account for why males are more prone toward
   status-striving than females, the theory contends that one or more genes
   on the Y-chromosome interact with genes on the remaining human
   chromosomes to incline males to gravitate toward social hierarchies and
   to strive for niches that are relatively high in those hierarchies. Both
   tested and untested hypotheses are derived from the theory and compared
   to the empirical evidence currently available.

AB To assess the determinants of political support for redistribution, this
   time-series study analyzes historically contingent changes in the
   progressivity of the income tax. Nonviolent civil rights protest should
   increase sympathy for the least affluent and enhance support for
   redistributive policies, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   may have the opposite effect. After controlling for shifts in partisan
   control of the presidency, nonwhite presence, family incomes, and union
   strength, the results suggest that civil rights activity leads to
   redistributive tax codes, but social problems blamed on the underclass
   such as riots or crime reduce tax progressivity. Additional findings
   suggest that these relationships are contingent. The positive
   relationship between civil rights actions and redistributive tax
   policies is significantly stronger when Democrats control the
   presidency, but the negative relationship between riots and egalitarian
   taxation is enhanced during Republican administrations.

AB Child-rearing books and manuals from the early twentieth century
   indicate that pediatricians and developmental psychologists were prone
   to divide the life course of children into increasingly precise
   chronometrical "stages," e.g., focusing on changes from one month to the
   next rather than one year to another. Little is known, however, of
   whether parents also chronometricalized their children's lives. Working
   with 206 advice-seeking letters written by fathers and mothers in the
   1920s and 1930s to nationally known educator and author Angelo Patri
   (1876-1965), we develop a text-based measure of "chronometrical
   childhood," employ it in a multivariate analysis, and find that an urban
   environment heightened parents' tendencies toward chronometricity, while
   the financial strain of the Great Depression did just the opposite. Our
   results show how age can be viewed as a social construction, subject to
   the influence of ideology and economics, and that the scheduling of
   children's lives can vary in different locates and at different
   historical moments.

   wave of immigration to the United States has done little to rekindle
   scholarly interest in this topic, even as politicians and other public
   figures advocate public policies to restrict immigration as a means of
   preventing crime. Although both popular accounts and sociological theory
   predict that immigration should increase crime in areas where immigrants
   settle, this study of Miami, El Paso, and San Diego neighborhoods shows
   that, controlling for other influences. immigration generally does not
   increase levels of homicide among Latinos and African Americans. Our
   results not only challenge stereotypes of the "criminal immigrant" but
   also the core criminological notion that immigration, as a social
   process. disorganizes communities and increases crime.

   aspects of quality of life in this severely challenged population.
   Regression results show that a number of life chance and social choice
   variables affect general and domain-specific well-being. While chances
   and choices both contribute to these aspects of quality of life, there
   is only modest evidence of a mediating effect. With the exception of

AB Background Euthanasia and assisted suicide, and policies to address them
   are the subjects of contentious debate in many countries. However, the
   question of why people desire euthanasia or assisted suicide has not
   been coherently answered. We aimed to answer this question in a specific
   group of patients.
   Methods We did a qualitative study of 32 people with HIV-1 or AIDS, who
   were enrolled in the HIV-1 Ontario Observational Database at Sunnybrook
   and Women's College Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We
   elicited participants' experiences of deliberation about euthanasia or
   assisted suicide, and the meaning of these experiences with in-depth,
   face-to-face interviews. We analysed our data with grounded theory
   methods.
   Findings Participants' desire for euthanasia and assisted suicide were
   affected by two main factors: disintegration, which resulted from
   symptoms and loss of function; and loss of community, which we defined
   as progressive diminishment of opportunities to initiate and maintain
   close personal relationships. These factors resulted in perceived loss
   of self. Euthanasia and assisted suicide were seen by participants as
   means of limiting loss of self.
   Interpretation These determinants of desire for euthanasia or assisted
   suicide in people with HIV-1 or AIDS have implications for the debate on
   these practices, and development of policies to regulate them.

   for farmworkers. This study examined the beliefs of Latino farmworkers
   in North Carolina's Christmas tree industry regarding pesticide
   exposure.
   Methods In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 Mexican male seasonal
   farmworkers. Participants discussed beliefs about agricultural
   chemicals, routes of exposure, and health effects of these chemicals.
   They also discussed their knowledge and use of pesticide safety
   practices and safety training received.
   Results Most farmworkers knew that pesticides could be harmful, though
   workers varied in their levels of knowledge regarding routes of
   exposure, specific health effects of pesticides, and ways to avoid and
   reduce exposure. Workers varied considerably in the amount of safety
   training received and use of safety practices. Perceived lack of control
   and health beliefs were salient factors that decreased workers' use of
   safety practices.
   Conclusions This study adds to the growing body of research which
   documents the health beliefs of Latino farmworkers in the U.S. relative
   to pesticides and pesticide safety. This literature is beginning to show
   convergence on several points (e.g., farmworker knowledge of acute vs.
   long-term illness resulting from pesticide exposure), as well as
   regional variation in pesticide safety beliefs. This study substantiates
   the need for pesticide safety education to address issues of control as
   well as beliefs. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB PURPOSE: The nature of competing social environmental factors' influence
   on substance abuse is unclear. A longitudinal study was undertaken to
   determine the relative power of social network and neighborhood
   characteristics to predict continuing illicit drug use.
   METHODS: Three hundred forty-two inner-city adults with a history of
   injection drug use were followed for I year; their heroin and cocaine
   use were assessed semiannually. Multiple logistic regression models were
   fit to determine the degree to which social network and neighborhood
   characteristics, assessed at baseline, predicted continuing heroin
   and/or cocaine use throughout the study period.
   RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-six (69%) participants reported continuing
   heroin and/or cocaine use. Drug use by members of the social network was
   a stronger predictor of participants' continuing drug use (OR = 4.31,
   95% Cl 2.51 to 7.40) than was a high level of drug-related arrests in
   the participant's neighborhood (OR = 2.41, 95% Cl 1.24 to 4.71) after
   adjusting for drug treatment and demographic variables. Both seemed to
   have independent effects on study participants' drug use.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings reiterate the importance of breaking ties
   with drug-using associates, even for those who reside in high-risk
   environments. Further work is needed to develop interventions that
   increase drug users' success in altering social network composition or
   also treat drug-using network members. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

   METHODS: A 61-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), 7-item fruit and

   vegetable intake were completed by 132 female employees at five health
   centers in eastern Massachusetts. Intake of fruit and vegetables derived
   front all three methods and macronutrients from the FFQ were fit as
   dependent variables in multiple linear regression models (overall and by
   race/ ethnicity and education); independent variables included 3-day

   33-point Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability scale (the regression
   coefficient for which reflects its effect on estimates of dietary intake

   RESULTS: Results are based on the 93 women with complete data and
   FFQ-derived Caloric intake between 450 and 4500 kcal/day. In women with
   college education, FFQ-derived estimates of total caloric were
   associated with under- reporting by social desirability trait (e.g., the
   regression coefficient for total caloric intake was -23.6 kcal/day/point
   in that group versus 36.1 kcal/day/point in women with education less
   than college) (difference = 59.7 kcal/day/point, 95% confidence interval
   (CI) = 13.2, 106,2). Except for the single question on which women,vith
   college education tended to under-report (difference =.103
   servings/day/point, 95% Cl 0.003, 0.203), there was no association of

   CONCLUSIONS: The effect of social desirability trait on FFQ reports of

   (RR for death, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.43; chi (2)=3.69;P=.05), and
   "Decided the devil made this happen" (RR for death, 1.19; 95% Cl,

   Conclusions: Certain forms of religiousness may increase the risk of
   death. Elderly ill men and women who experience a religious struggle
   with their illness appear to be at increased risk of death, even after
   controlling for baseline health, mental health status, and demographic
   factors.

AB The purpose of our study was to conduct a preliminary investigation into
   the experiences and mental health of Senegalese refugees. Although
   research has established that refugees are more prone to psychiatric
   illnesses than the general population, little has been written about
   West African refugees. Our focus was on adult refugees (18 years of age
   and older) from the Casamance region of Senegal. A total of 80
   participants (39 women, 41 men) were randomly selected from refugee
   camps in The Gambia. The Harvard Trauma Questionnaire and the Hopkins
   Symptom Checklist-25 were used to assess levels of traumatization and
   mental health status. Typical of refugees of war, participants reported
   suffering a large number of various traumas. High prevalence rates of
   anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder were also found
   in this group. A substantial mental health problem exists within the
   Senegalese refugee population that may signify a potential human crisis.

AB Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements of 120 female teachers of
   Japanese-American or Caucasian ethnicity working in public schools
   located in Hilo, Hawaii, were recorded. BP was measured at 15-min
   intervals during waking hours and 30-min intervals during sleep over a
   24-hr period that included a full work day. These measurements were
   averaged during three daily settings: at work, at home while awake
   ("home"), and during sleep. ANCOVAs using ethnicity as a predictor
   variable of BP, with age and the body mass index (BMI) as covariates,
   show a significant interaction effect between age and ethnicity in some
   daily settings. Among Japanese-Americans partial correlations between
   age and systolic BP controlling for the BMI are significant in these
   settings, while among Caucasians none of the correlations are
   significant. Menopausal status is not significantly related to BP when
   age is controlled in analyses. There was no significant ethnic
   difference in number of symptoms reported, including frequency of "hot
   flushes/flashes," within the past two weeks. Those who reported hot
   flushes had significantly elevated BP in waking settings but not during
   sleep. The greater increase in BP with age in Japanese-Americans may be
   related to their elevated risk for development of hypertension. The lack
   of a significant relationship between menopausal status and BP may be
   due to the high rate of usage of hormonal replacement therapy in this
   sample, as well as an unusually high rate of hysterectomy. (C) 2001

AB This cross-sectional study reports on the menopausal transition of Mayan
   women from Yucatan, Mexico. A total of 228 women completed the study,
   and 118 women were classified by history as postmenopausal; the others
   were premenopausal. Demographic information, reproductive history,
   physical examination, hormone concentrations, radial bone density, food
   samples, and history of physical activity were obtained. The average age
   at which menopause occurred by history was 44.3 +/- 4.4 years; this is
   reflected in the distribution of FSH levels by age. None of the women
   reported symptoms of hot flashes, and none recalled any history of
   significant symptoms associated with their menopausal transition.
   Hormone levels were similar to U.S. reference values with elevated FSK
   (66.6 +/- 29.1 mIU/ml), low estradiol (9.4 +/- 8.3 pg/ml) and estrone
   (13.3 +/- 7.8 pg/ml), E1 > E2, and normal levels of testosterone and
   androstenedione. BMD declined with age, and values were lower than
   reference values for United States women. Clinical evidence of fracture
   was not detected by history or physical examination even for those who
   were 20 years postmenopausal. The endocrine characteristics of menopause
   among Mayan women in Yucatan are similar to hormonal changes reported
   for women in the United States, but signs, symptoms, and apparent
   consequences are different in the two populations. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss,

AB This study seeks to determine the age at natural menopause and factors

   in Montana. Data were obtained from a probability sample of 150 women.
   Rates of surgical menopause among women who had experienced menopause
   were similar to those found in NHANES I for U.S. women. Median age at
   natural menopause by the status quo method (51.2 years) was comparable
   to that determined for other populations. Within the group of women who
   already had experienced natural menopause, age at menopause was
   associated in bivariate models with age at menarche (b = -0.83 +/- 0.44
   years, P = 0.07), household income (b = 1.85 +/- 0.71 years, P = 0.01),
   "ever use" of birth control(b = 4.52 +/- 1.58 years, P = 0.008), "ever

   current or recent unemployment (b = 4.75 +/- 1.97 years, P = 0.02),
   having been breastfed (b = -6.93 +/- 2.67 years), and educational
   attainment (ANOVA by tertiles of menopause age, mean 10.0 +/- 3.6 years
   of education for earliest, 13.0 +/- 2.2 years for latest, P = 0.04). In
   multivariate models, "ever use" of oral contraceptives, household
   income, and age at menarche remained significant predictors of age at
   menopause (R-2 = 0.33-0.35, P = 0.002-0.004), with household income
   modifying the effect of age at menarche (analysis of joint effects). The
   findings are discussed in the context of cohort experiences, examining
   implications for both early and later-life influences on menopause age.

   integrating these environmental factors into the analysis of late-life
   well-being (operationally defined as household health) is presented and
   explored in three settings: an Old Order Amish community, the
   neighboring community of non-Amish, and an Ifugao community in the
   Philippine highlands. Intensive interview and observation of function
   were completed in st sample of at least 25 households in each community.
   The complex interaction of social and biological factors is explored in
   case studies and through multiple regression analysis with household
   health as the dependent variable. The results emphasize the importance
   of social support and assessing capabilities within the household. The
   results also suggest the need for natural field observation of work to
   better understand the influence of pacing and scheduling, necessity of
   work, and the role of environmental modification in postmenopausal

AB The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recently recommended that the National
   Institutes of Health (NTH) reevaluate its employment of "race," a
   concept lacking scientific or anthropological justification, in cancer
   surveillance and other population research. The IOM advised the NIH to
   use a different population classification, that of "ethnic group"
   instead of "race." A relatively new term, according to the IOM, "ethnic
   group" would turn research attention away from biological determinism
   and toward a focus on culture and behavior.
   This article examines the historically central role of racial
   categorization and its relationship to racism in the United States and
   questions whether dropping "race" from population taxonomies is either
   possible or, at least in the short run, preferable. In addition, a
   historical examination of "ethnicity" and " ethnic group" finds that
   these concepts, as used in the United States, derive in part from race
   and immigration and are not neutral terms; instead, they carry their own
   burden of political, social, and ideological meaning.

AB In this article the authors conducted a critical review of ongoing and

   of social support systems in the drug-using behavior of Hispanics.
   Published and unpublished preliminary data from these studies are
   presented and discussed. This critical review of the research literature
   supports earlier findings that social support systems play an important
   role in preventing drug abuse among Hispanics. Specifically, this review
   found that familial factors, peer influences, involvement with religious
   institutions, and after-school activities have a powerful impact on the
   drug-using behaviors of Hispanic child, youth and adult drug users. The
   authors suggest that drug prevention and treatment programs within
   Hispanic communities will be more successful if they incorporate social
   support systems into their programs. In conclusion, the authors identify
   areas in which the role of social support systems in the drug-using
   behavior of Hispanics need further investigation.

AB OBJECTIVE: Incontinence-specific and generic measures of well-being were
   regressed on potential predictors to identify incontinent respondents at
   risk for psychosocial distress and to understand the relationship
   between urinary incontinence (UI) and other determinants of social and
   emotional status.
   DESIGN: Survey data were collected May 1994 through April 1996.
   SETTING: Telephone interviews as a supplement to a nationally
   representative monthly consumer survey.
   PARTICIPANTS: Analyses were based on 1,116 continent and 206 incontinent
   respondents age 40 and older.
   MEASUREMENTS: Incontinent respondents self-reported the extent to which
   urine loss restricted social activities or affected their feelings about
   themselves. All respondents were asked whether they felt depressed,
   lonely, or sad. Covariates included sex, age, race, education, social
   desirability, health status, frequency of urine loss, quantity of loss,
   and urgency.
   RESULTS: The majority of incontinent respondents reported that urine
   loss did not restrict activities or diminish self-esteem. Incontinent
   respondents who were younger, mate, less educated, lower in social
   desirability, in poorer health, or losing greater quantities of urine
   were more likely to report psychosocial distress, although these
   correlates were not consistently significant. Compared with continent
   respondents, significantly higher percentages of incontinent respondents
   reported feeling depressed, lonely, or sad. In the multivariate models,
   incontinence retained an independent association with loneliness, but
   not with sadness or depression.
   CONCLUSION: Even though the direct psychosocial impact of urine loss may
   be minor in many cases, UI is associated with a constellation of
   physical and behavioral factors that can impose a social and emotional
   burden. This suggests that UI cannot be adequately evaluated or treated
   without consideration of the patient's overall quality of life.

AB OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between acculturation,
   immigration, and prevalence of depression in older Mexican Americans.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis from a cohort study.
   SETTING: Urban and rural counties of the Central Valley of Northern
   California.
   PARTICIPANTS: One thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine Latinos
   recruited from a population-based sample (85% Mexican Americans) with a
   mean age of 70.6 (range 60-100; standard deviation (SD) = 7.13); 58.2%
   were women.
   MEASUREMENTS: Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Center for
   Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D). Acculturation was
   measured with the Acculturation Rating Scale for Mexican Americans-II.
   Psychosocial, behavioral, and medical histories were also obtained.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of depression (CES-D greater than or equal to
   16) was 25.4%. Women were at greater risk (32.0%) than men (16.3%;
   male/female odds ratio (OR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) =
   1.90-3.09). The prevalence of depression was higher among immigrants
   (30.4%, OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.36-2.13), bicultural participants (24.2%,
   OR = 1.66, 95% CI = 1.24-2.24), and less-acculturated participants
   (36.1%, OR = 2.95, 95% CI = 2.22-3.93) compared with U.S.-born (20.5%)
   and more-acculturated groups (16.1%). When adjustments for education,
   income, psychosocial, behavioral, and health-problem factors were made,
   the least-acculturated participants were at significantly higher risk of
   depression than highly acculturated Mexican Americans (OR = 1,56, 95% CI
   = 1.06-2.3 1).
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with previously reported
   estimates of a higher prevalence of depression for older Mexican
   Americans than non-Hispanic Caucasians and African Americans and are the
   first to report the prevalence and risk of depression for older
   U.S.-born and immigrant Mexican Americans. The high prevalence of
   depression of the least acculturated group may be related to cultural
   barriers encountered by immigrants and less-acculturated older Mexican
   Americans and to poorer health status.

AB Background: With the advances of feminism, men have gradually
   relinquished their once-exclusive 'masculine' roles as fighters and
   breadwinners. In response to this change, the male body may have gained
   in relative importance as one of the few surviving marks of masculinity.
   We hypothesized that these trends might be quantified by using a
   commercial measure such as advertising. Methods: We examined the
   proportion of exposed male and female bodies portrayed in advertisements
   between 1958 and 1998 in two leading American women's magazines.
   Results: In both magazines, the proportion of undressed women in the
   advertisements has changed little over the last 40 years, whereas the
   proportion of undressed men has increased dramatically, especially since
   the early 1980s. Conclusions: Trends in commercial advertising offer
   tentative support for the hypothesis that the male body is increasing in
   importance as a mark of masculinity - at least as judged from the
   actions of advertisers seeking to influence women's attitudes. Copyright

AB Medical sociology and public health share many of the same concerns in
   the study of social and cultural factors that affect the health of the
   population. Differences in theoretical approaches, methodological
   procedures, conceptualization and measurement, and research objectives,
   however, often serve to limit the potential for collaboration between
   the two disciplines. Sociologists possess many of the theoretical models
   and analytical techniques needed in public health for the study of the
   impact of socioeconomic status, poverty, inequality, differentials in
   power, and social and cultural differences on disease outcomes and
   health status. Although in the past, public health professionals were
   dependent primarily on the theoretical and analytical models offered by
   epidemiology and social psychology, current trends in public health
   research ha ve opened a wider variety of opportunities for sociologists
   to contribute to public health research. Public health has reached a
   crossroads that leads in two directions: a broad approach that addresses
   the sociocultural foundations of health and a more narrow approach
   focusing on more proximal risk factors such as individual lifestyles or
   health risk behaviors. This article presents a review of the factors
   that led to this crossroads in public health and offers suggestions as
   to how sociologists might take advantage of the opportunities afforded
   by the broader approach to public health that is gaining momentum among
   some public health practitioners. Medical sociologists are uniquely
   equipped to assist public health in recapturing its historical
   commitment to social justice in the maintenance of health for the entire
   population.

AB Managed care is prompting a large revision not only in the ways doctors
   are employed and paid but also in the essence of the relationship
   between doctors and patients. In medical sociology, a discipline with a
   long-standing focus on scrutinizing the role of both the physician and
   the patient, there has already been discussion of a shift from the
   doctor as more all knowing to a less dominant position vis-a-vis both
   the patient and delivery of care. Patients are aware of shifts that
   place physicians in an environment characterized by new roles and
   responsibilities, such as acting as a gatekeeper. Limitations on health
   care coverage and the rethinking of roles have led to a depiction of the
   patient as the consumer of care and the managed care plan's becoming the
   commercial enterprise from which a service is obtained. The model of the
   patient as consumer of medically related goods and services appears to
   be growing, as does a model of the physician as one who contracts for a
   specified range of services for specific patients. In this article,
   trends in and problems with contemporary managed care are raised. Calls
   for patients' rights legislation may be among the health trends of the
   new millennium.

AB Internet technology is changing the way individuals gather information,
   interact with others, and organize their time. This technology has
   implications for research in medical sociology in the new millennium.
   This study discusses the background and usage estimates of Internet
   technology and how this technology affects individuals gathering of
   health information. Potential consequences of this technology for
   patient-provider interactions are also examined, as are the implications
   of Internet communication for social support and health. Current
   measures of social support may be underestimating the effects of social
   support on health by not assessing the influence of support garnered
   through communications on the Internet. The Internet also presents a
   variety of new research venues that medical sociologists should pursue.
   Two of these possibilities-on line surveys and analysis of online
   communication and text-are discussed. Although the Internet is
   increasing research opportunities for medical sociologists, the fact
   that a digital divide still exists with regard to Internet access and
   use cannot be ignored.

AB Studies have consistently shown race and ethnicity to be important
   determinants of health. The specific nature of this influence, however,
   is still a mystery. In the new millennium, racial and ethnic
   differentials in health are bound to become a major focus in medical
   sociology not only because of their persistence but also because of the
   demographic changes taking place in the United States. It is estimated
   that racial and ethnic minorities are expected to increase from the
   current level of 25 % of all Americans to 40 % by 2030 and that minority
   groups will make up more than hall of the U.S. population by 2050. Thus,
   overcoming health disparities attributable to race and ethnicity has
   become more urgent in ensuring good health for the nation. This article
   suggests that analyses of the health status of Latinos, the second
   largest minority group in the country, must attend to cultural factors.
   The need for a culture-specific approach to Latino health is
   indispensable to such discourses in medical sociology.

AB A theory of collective violence must explain both why it is collective
   and why it is violent. Whereas my earlier work addresses the question of
   why collective violence is violent, here I apply and extend Donald
   Black's theory of partisanship to the question of why violence
   collectivizes. I propose in general that the collectivization of
   violence is a direct function of strong partisanship. Strong
   partisanship arises when third parries (1) support one side against the
   other and (2) are solidary among themselves. Such support occurs when
   third parties are socially close to one side and remote from the ther
   and when one side has more social status than the other Third parries
   are solidary M-hen they are intimate, culturally homogeneous. and
   interdependent. I focus in particular on lynching: Lynching is a joint
   function of strong partisanship toward the alleged victim and weak
   partisanship toward the alleged offender. Unequal strong partisanship
   appears in both classic lynchings (of outsiders) and communal lynchings
   (of insiders) across societies and history. Where partisanship is weak
   or strong on both sides, lynching is unlikely to occur. Evidence
   includes patterns of lynching in various tribal societies. the American
   South, imperial China, and medieval Europe.

AB Local economic institutions (systems of property rights and rules of

   as well as state formation and religious change. In this paper, I
   outline the theoretical implications of these regional effects. None of
   our existing macrolevel theories and explanations of the "rise of the
   West" can adequately incorporate them, so I present an alternative
   theory, based on rational choice premises. Yet the existence of these
   regional effects also highlights the deficiencies of a rational choice
   theoretical approach. First, the approach is unable to explain
   historical contexts, institutional legacies, or the effects of timing,
   which were vital for outcomes of social change but that lie outside the
   model itself. Second, although it can be very useful, the model of the
   actor motivated by material self-interest often proved inadequate in
   historical situations. Solutions are suggested.

AB Professional socialization for sociologists continues to be contested,
   with contemporary debates about 1) the structure of graduate training
   and its rigor, and 2) the content of the body of knowledge that new
   professionals should master. This paper describes the institutional
   practices related to qualifying examinations in 178 U.S. sociology
   graduate departments (response rate 82%). it addresses two broad
   questions: First, what is the structure of qualifying exams in sociology
   Specifically, what is the format, timing, and method of evaluation of
   this requirement How often is this exam system revised Are prestige
   rankings associated with the structure of qualifying exams Second, whet
   is the substance of these exams Do practices across departments reveal a
   "canon" within the discipline of sociology The findings indicate
   significant differences between Ph.D.-granting and M.A.-granting
   programs in exam structures, though there is considerable consistency in
   exam structures within each type of department. in most Ph.D. and M.A.
   programs, there have been recent changes in the format, content or
   evaluation of exams. Ph.D. departments with higher rankings offer
   students more freedom in taking exams and report higher rates of
   successful completion. The substance of exams is quite diverse, both in
   terms of topic areas and readings within those areas, indicating little
   in the way of a sociological "canon" passed down to future professionals
   in the discipline.

AB Two sites located on the northern Levantine coast, Ucagizli Cave
   (Turkey) and Ksar 'Akil (Lebanon) have yielded numerous marine shell

   Accelerator mass spectrometry (AMs) radiocarbon dates indicate ages
   between 39,000 and 41,000 radiocarbon years (roughly 41,000-43,000
   calendar years) for the oldest ornament-bearing levels in Ucagizli Cave.
   Based on stratigraphic evidence, the earliest shell beads from Ksar
   'Akil may be even older. These artifacts provide some of the earliest
   evidence for traditions of personal ornament manufacture by Upper
   Paleolithic humans in western Asia, comparable in age to similar objects
   from Eastern Europe and Africa. The new data show that the initial
   appearance of Upper Paleolithic ornament technologies was essentially
   simultaneous on three continents. The early appearance and proliferation
   of ornament technologies appears to have been contingent on variable
   demographic or social conditions.

AB This paper presents some initial modeling results from a large,
   interdisciplinary research project underway in the southern Yucatan
   peninsular region. The aims of the project are: to understand, through
   individual household survey work, the behavioral and structural dynamics
   that influence land managers' decisions to deforest and intensify land
   use; model these dynamics and link their outcomes directly to satellite
   imagery; model from the imagery itself; and, determine the robustness of
   modeling to and from the satellite imagery. Two complementary datasets,
   one from household survey data on agricultural practices including
   information on socio-economic factors and the second from satellite
   imagery Linked with aggregate government census data, are used in two
   econometric modeling approaches. Both models test hypotheses concerning
   deforestation during different time periods in the recent past in the
   region. The first uses the satellite data, other spatial environmental
   variables, and aggregate socio-economic data (e.g., census data) in a
   discrete-choice (logit) model to estimate the probability that any
   particular pixel in the landscape will be deforested, as a function of
   explanatory variables. The second model uses the survey data in a
   cross-sectional regression (OLS) model to ask questions about the amount
   of deforestation associated with each individual farmer and to explain
   these choices as a function of individual socio-demographic, market,
   environmental, and geographic variables, in both cases, however, the
   choices of explanatory variables are informed by social science theory
   as to what are hypothesized to affect the deforestation decision (e.g.,
   in a von Thunen model, accessibility is hypothesized to affect choice;
   in a Ricardian model, land quality; in a Chayanovian model,
   consumer-labor ratio). The models ask different questions using
   different data, but several broad comparisons seem useful. While most
   variables are statistically significant in the discrete choice model,
   none of the location variables are statistically significant in the
   continuous model. Therefore, while location affects the overall
   probability of deforestation, it does not appear to explain the total
   amount of deforestation on a given location by an individual. (C) 2001

AB Landuse/landcover (LULC) dynamics in northeast Thailand are driven by a
   host of scale dependent relationships that are observed at the pixel to
   landscape levels, but may be influenced by decisions made at the
   household and/or community levels. To understand complex systems, it is
   important to examine the interplay between scale, pattern, and process
   so that landscape form and landscape function may be inter-related.
   Statistical relationships between plant biomass levels and selected
   social, biophysical, and geographical variables are assessed at nine
   different cell resolutions beginning at 30 m and extending to 1050 m.
   The basic intent is to examine the scale dependence of population and
   environment relationships in a northeast Thailand study site, a region
   that has experienced pronounced LULC change associated with
   deforestation and agricultural extensification and intensification to
   support lowland rice and upland cash crops. More subtle landscape
   changes are also occurring, those related to intra-annual crop
   phenologies and monsoonal rainfall patterns. For each variable and at
   successively coarser resolutions, cell values are calculated by
   hierarchical aggregation of the original 30m grid. The beta-values of
   each variable are assessed and the R-2-values of each multiple
   regression model are tracked over the nine spatial resolutions.
   Canonical correlation is used to link a group of environmental variables
   to a group of social variables across the same 9-scale steps to assess
   the scale dependence of their relationships. Pattern metrics and LULC
   proportions are also computed to ascertain the composition and spatial
   organization of the landscape for the same nine cell resolutions.
   Finally, multiple regression models are computed for two separate image
   dates within a single water year to explore intra-annual variation in
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the level of
   explanation achieved through selected population and environment
   variables. In this scenario, spatial scale is held constant at 30m, but
   distance decay coefficients, used to construct a population potential
   variable, are altered and model results tracked to assess NDVI
   sensitivities to population distribution parameters as well as wet and
   dry conditions and their seasonal differences on derived R2-values and
   beta-coefficients.
   LULC patterns in northeast Thailand are the products of scale dependent
   relationships that extend across thematic domains representing social,
   biophysical, and geographical factors. Results indicate the importance
   of population factors at finer scales and biophysical factors at coarser
   scales for explaining variation in plant biomass levels. (C) 2001

AB Laughter emerges naturally in interaction. In the context of the
   telephone survey interview, however, laughter threatens standardization.
   Consequently, some survey research centers prohibit interviewers from
   laughing during the administration of surveys. The data for this study
   are recorded telephone interviews from one such survey research center.
   How interviewers handle the "laughter invitations" of respondents is
   analyzed Because these interviewers are not taught what to do when
   laughter occurs, they rely on their tacit knowledge, either accepting
   the invitation, declining it, or engaging in "pseudo-laughter":
   Interviewers most often decline or use a pseudo-laughing response.
   Laughter patterns in a survey research center that does nor prohibit
   interviewer laughter are examined for comparison, and generally much
   more reciprocation and laughter are observed. Respondent laughter
   exhibits a central tension in the telephone survey interview: How can
   interviewers maintain both standardization and an appropriately
   affiliative social relationship with respondents? The differential
   management of this tension is explored in terms of survey methodology,
   the sociology of (social) scientific knowledge, and the organization of
   talk in institutional settings.

   cessation have been based on the smoker's perceptions only. In this
   pilot study of 58 couples, pregnant women who had smoked in the 30 days
   before pregnancy and their partners reported the positive and negative
   support or cessation they had received (women) or provided (partners).
   Mean levels of the women's and partners' perceptions of support were
   compared, and correlations of the two reports were analyzed while
   controlling for the effect of the couple's smoking status. Women's and
   partners' reports were similar except partners reported wanting the
   women to stop smoking more than women perceived. Women's and partners
   perceived negative support were moderately correlated (r congruent to
   .48, p congruent to .001). Partner-reported positive support also was
   associated with women's perceived negative support (r congruent to .30,
   p congruent to .03). These relationships remained significant after
   controlling for partners' and women's smoking status. Generally,
   partners reported giving more positive and less negative support than
   women perceived. Results suggest the need for further examination of
   couples' perceptions of support and the impact on smoking cessation
   during pregnancy.

AB Sex workers have their perspective on HIV transmission, claiming that in
   general they are more similar than different from other people in HIV

   goes against public and professional opinion that prostitution is a
   major vector in the spread of AIDS, Taking the sex workers' similarity
   claim seriously, this paper considers the conditions under which it
   would be valid We focus on those factors that make a population more or
   less vulnerable to HIV and how they affect its spread into the sex work
   population. Data from New Zealand comparing men sex workers and other
   men who have sex with men is used to evaluate these ideas. Data
   partially support the hypothesis in that these two groups of men are
   similar with regard to their HIV status. We do find the sex workers to
   be different, however in their being less likely to engage in safe sex
   practices. We provide an explanation for why this has not lead to their
   having a higher rate of seropositivity.

AB Recently an alarming trend toward unprotected anal intercourse has
   emerged in men who have sex with men. A highly dangerous form of
   unprotected anal intercourse, barebacking - the deliberate and conscious
   choice to engage in anal sex without condoms knowing that there are
   risks involved - has received much attention in the gay press. This
   trend poses new challenges for HIV prevention. As the target population
   changes, prevention interventions must also evolve to remain effective.
   A review of the scientific literature on risk behaviors and the popular
   literature and websites devoted to barebacking suggests that many
   contextual factors influence the decision to engage in unprotected anal
   intercourse. This review examines the most salient contextual factors

AB Armed Forces & Society (AF&S), is a major scholarly outlet for social
   scientists interested in military subjects, and in 1999 completed 25
   volumes of continuous publication. This article presents data on
   authorship and affiliations for volumes 1-25 of AF&S and compares the
   findings to studies of other scholarly journals. Topical areas of
   analysis include (co)authorship, sex configurations of (co)authors, and
   academic, regionaL and institutional affiliations of authors. Results
   show the journal to be fairly international and highly
   interdisciplinary. Overall, AF&S is both similar and dissimilar along a
   number of sociodemographic dimensions compared with other sociology and

AB The authors examined the independent and interactive effects of
   acculturation status and family cohesiveness on a series of psychosocial
   and medical risk factors of pregnancy among 500 women of Mexican origin.
   In general, both higher and lower levels of acculturation produced
   positive or negative psychosocial and healthcare consequences, and the
   operative relationships depended heavily on the particular outcome
   chosen. Higher levels of family cohesiveness tended to foster the most
   constructive health and psychosocial outcomes. However in some
   circumstances higher levels of family cohesiveness resulted in less
   coping and a lower quality of prenatal care for less acculturated women.
   An important implication of this study is that psychosocial and health
   information can be obtained through assessments that identify, different
   subgroups of Mexican American women and depend on women's level of
   acculturation and family cohesiveness. Culturally competent health
   practitioners or clinicians can conduct these assessments in a prenatal
   healthcare setting.

AB Aims-To assess the relation between a country's economic developmental
   status and its prevalence of blindness.
   Methods-Available epidemiological data on worldwide visual loss and its
   causes compiled by the World Health Organization were reviewed. Findings
   were compared with economic development data from the involved countries
   and regions. Analysis was completed in view of the socioeconomic status
   of each country and region.
   Results-Analysis of the global distribution of blindness indicates a
   trend of higher prevalence existing in developing countries with lower
   per capita income. Preventable causes of blindness (that is, cataract,
   trachoma) are also more prevalent in these countries.
   Conclusions-Because economic development is shown to be a factor in
   blindness, programmes for blindness prevention should not be the only
   route to the elimination of unnecessary blindness throughout the world.
   Concomitant economic development is also necessary to reduce and
   eventually eradicate much of the preventable and avoidable causes of
   blindness.

AB This meta-analysis involved 35 studies examining eating disturbance and
   body dissatisfaction in white and non-white populations and the role of
   acculturation in the development of eating-related psychopathology,
   While the role of acculturation in predisposing non-whites to eating
   disorders remains to be determined mean effect sizes indicate that
   whites report more eating disturbance than non-whites. Differences are
   greatest when studies compare black and white college samples on
   measures of subclinical eating pathology, like dietary restraint, ideal
   body shape, and body dissatisfaction. They are weakest when non-clinic
   populations and clinical forms of eating disturbance, like bulimia
   nervosa, are examined. These findings suggest that the current
   literature may be incorrect in its view that subclinical and clinical
   forms of eating disturbance represent the poles of a single continuum.
   In addition, they call into question the belief that SES influences the
   development of eating pathology. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

AB In Western societies, parental expression of positive emotion has been
   positively related to the quality of children's social functioning,
   whereas their expression of negative emotion has been negatively or
   inconsistently related. The relations of parental expressivity to
   3rd-grade Indonesian children's dispositional regulation, socially
   appropriate behavior, popularity, and sympathy were examined. Parents,
   teachers, and peers reported on children's social functioning and
   regulation, and parents (mostly mothers) reported on their own
   expression of emotion in the family. Generally, parental expression of
   negative emotion was negatively related to the quality of children's
   social functioning, and regression analyses indicated that the relations
   of parental negative expressivity to children's popularity and
   externalizing behaviors might be indirect through their effects on
   children's regulation. Unexpectedly, parental expression of positive
   emotion was unrelated to children's social functioning.

   computer simulations are performed to show the effects of ascertainment
   bias on relative population weight estimates. Not surprisingly, given
   that the RSP markers were originally identified in a small panel of
   Caucasians, estimates of relative population weights are biased and the
   European population weight is artificially inflated. However, the
   effects of ascertainment bias are not apparent in a principal components

   other genetic systems with inherently low heterozygosity such as Alus or

AB This article traces the arrival and the subsequent debates about the
   place of the tourist in sociology. The sociology of tourists first
   focused on their economic, and then their physical and sociocultural
   impacts, in the stereotypical case of mass tourists of the metropolis
   visiting historical and peripheral locations. More recently, Graburn and
   Smith differentiated tourists by class, gender and lifestyle, and then
   by national origin. Tourism has come to be seen as a form of expressive
   and perhaps therapeutic culture comparable to art, play and leisure. The
   tourist as sight-seer was first castigated by snobbish social
   commentators, and then valorized as a seeker of authenticity by
   MacCannell, and as a easter of gazes by Urry. Cohen usefully examined
   the range of tourists' experiences and authenticities. In this special
   issue Lengkeek and Harrison re-examine tourist differentiations,
   authenticities and subjective experiences. Thorns and Perkins conjoin
   the notion of the tourist as sight-seer with that of physical performer,
   while Liebman Parrinello looks at the tourist as both embodied and as
   technologized.

   This paper reviews and critiques the major theorists with an eye to
   showing that not only is nationalism a potentially divisive ideology, it
   is also a fundamental means of social organization in the contemporary
   world and, despite the current globalization buzz, is likely to remain
   so. It is also claimed that nationalism cannot be studied in isolation
   within a single state or country. Despite its insistence on the idea of
   the nation, nationalism is a transnational phenomenon and must be
   treated as such. Among the theorists critiqued are Anthony D. Smith,
   Ernest Gellner, Walker Connor, Benedict Anderson, John Breuilly, Liah
   Greenfeld, Craig Calhoun, and Rogers Brubaker.

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the predictive value of psychosocial factors as
   risk factors for all-cause mortality.
   DESIGN: A community-based longitudinal cohort study: The Honolulu Heart
   Program.
   SETTING: Population-based study conducted in Oahu, Hawaii.
   PARTICIPANTS: Three thousand four hundred and ninety-seven men age 71 to
   93 were examined and followed prospectively for all-cause mortality for
   an average of 6 years.
   MEASUREMENTS: Psychosocial data were obtained using the Lubben Social
   Networks Scale (LSNS). The LSNS consists of 10 items-family
   relationships (three items), relationships With friends (three items),
   and interdependent social supports and living arrangements (four items).
   We divided the LSNS score into quartiles for comparison, with the first
   quartile representing the lowest social support and the fourth quartile
   representing the highest social support.
   RESULTS: A significant dose-response relationship was noted with LSNS
   score and total mortality: 33.8% in the first quartile died over the
   follow-up period, 23.4% in the second, 18% in the third, and 15.7% in
   the fourth (P < .001). Six-year age-adjusted mortality rates were 66.2,
   45.7, 37.8, and 33.7 per 1,000 person years in the first, second, third,
   and fourth, respectively (P < .001). Using age-adjusted Cox proportional
   hazards models, with the first quartile of LSNS as the reference group,
   relative risk for mortality was 0.69 (95% confidence interval (CI) =
   0.58-0.82), 0.57 (95% CI = 0.47-0.70), and 0.52 (95% CI = 0.43-0.64) in
   the second, third, and fourth quartiles, respectively. Cox models were
   repeated, controlling for age and smoking status, and low LSNS scores
   remained significantly associated with higher mortality (P =.0001).
   CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that social networks were
   significantly independently associated with 6-year all-cause mortality
   in this cohort of older Japanese-American men. Social interventions in
   old age may reduce early mortality.

AB Background. The costs of physical inactivity are beginning to be
   recognized. Research to pinpoint these costs will provide needed
   information for researchers and policy-makers to develop cost-effective
   physical activity promotion programs. We present the association of
   walking with health services use and costs within a sample of 695 older,
   urban primary care patients.
   Methods, A survey provided most data, but utilization and cost data were
   obtained from a medical records system. Multivariate models were
   developed to assess the association of walking with health services use
   and costs, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, chronic
   disease, health status, and previous utilization.
   Results. Thirty-eight percent of respondents reported walking 0 minutes
   per week, 49% walked 1 to 119 minutes, and 13% walked 120 minutes or
   more. In the multivariate analyses, a report of walking 120 or more
   minutes was associated with a lower risk of emergency room visit and
   hospital stay in the subsequent year. No association was found between
   walking and primary care visits and total cost.
   Conclusion. These analyses suggest an association of walking 120 minutes
   or more with decreased emergency room visits (OR = 0.5, P = 0.046) and
   hospital stays (OR = 0.6, P = 0.034), This suggests that physical
   activity promotion among socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults
   has the potential to provide cost savings. This will not be known,
   however, until physical activity can be promoted and maintained among
   these adults. (C) 2001 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

AB CULTURAL beliefs and attitudes have been identified as significant
   contributing factors in the development of eating disorders. Rates of
   these disorders appear to vary among different racial/ethnic and
   national groups, and they also change across time as cultures evolve.
   Eating disorders are, in fact, more prevalent within various cultural
   groups than previously recognized, both within American ethnic
   minorities and those in other countries. This review examines evidence
   for the role of culture as an etiological factor for the development of
   eating disorders. Historical and cross-cultural experiences suggest that
   cultural change itself may be associated with increased vulnerability to
   eating disorders, especially when values about physical aesthetics are
   involved. Such change may occur across time within a given society, or
   on an individual level, as when an immigrant moves into a new culture.
   Further research into the cultural factors that promote the development
   of eating disorders is much needed. Understanding how cultural forces
   contribute to the development of disorders is needed so that preventive
   interventions can be created.

AB The concept of sacrifice used to be a dominant theme in social
   scientific theorizing, but it is now so neglected that recent work
   speaks of the need for a "recovery" of sacrifice. Similarly,
   self-sacrifice in the service of family members, formerly seen as high
   virtue, is now often characterized as personality defect or
   self-defeating behavior. Neither self-sacrifice nor family love play a
   significant part in the prevailing family theories, grounded as they are
   in the assumption of self-interest and framed in the logic of
   utilitarian individualism and the rationalized marketplace. This
   "silence" is more ideologically based than reflective of family process.
   The absence of a language of sacrifice and love limits our ability to
   give voice to our experience, and the professional neglect of these
   concepts diminishes our understanding of the processes they name. Some
   recent work on sacrifice by scholars in other disciplines has
   implications for family theory. We draw from the disciplines of
   economics, history, philosophy, literature, sociology, and from life as
   lived by everyday people ill making the case that self-sacrifice is a
   powerful and essential part of social lift, generally, and family life
   in particular. It merits a more substantial place in contemporary
   theory. Some theoretical approaches compatible with self-sacrifice as
   principle and practice are offered..

   human capital and adaptive preference theories suggest that switching
   will remain infrequent, and will tend to occur between similar
   denominations. Second, "strict church" perspectives argue that demanding
   sectarian denominations will have higher retention, and be more
   attractive destinations. Third, market niche perspectives argue that
   niche overlap will foster high rates of religious mobility. Finally,
   theories emphasizing normative constraints on religious choices suggest
   that quasi-ethnic religious groups will have a greater hold on members.
   This article examines trends and patterns of religious mobility in the
   U.S. between 1973 and 1998 using data from the General Social Surveys.
   Retention rates, distributions of original and destination affiliations,
   and mobility tables are compared across three periods, and four broad
   cohorts using log-multiplicative association models. I find some support
   for hypotheses generated by status theories, and for several
   propositions from rational actor theories, however the decline of
   denominationalism perspective is unsupported.

AB This study uses time-series regressions to investigate the political and
   other determinants of shifts in the prison population. Partisanship is
   measured with Republican control over the presidency. To gauge
   presidential effects on public opinion, we include counts of the
   consecutive years Republicans held the presidency, while latent
   political conflict is assessed with economic inequality. The necessity
   to compete for votes with punitive measures is assessed with a
   presidential election dummy. With crime rates and additional effects
   held constant, the presence of a law-and-order Republican president and
   the election variable lead to subsequent expansions in the incarcerated
   population. The length of time Republicans herd the presidency and
   economic inequality also explain this outcome. The results suggest that
   political determinants explain shifts in the percentage of the

AB Our objective is to explore the adequacy of traditional structural
   explanations for the often-documented association between size of place
   and urbanity traits and to raise the possibility that cultural factors,
   too often neglected in urban sociology, play an important role in this
   relationship. Using survey data from a sample ages 15-89, we compare
   four sets of respondents with different child/adult residential
   configurations: those who grew up in nonurban places and as adults live
   in nonurban places (locals), those who grew up in nonurban places but as
   adults reside in urban places (cosmopolitans), those who grew up in
   urban places and reside in urban places as adults (urbanites), and those
   reared in urban places but residing as adults in nonurban places
   (escapees). The sets are compared with respect to six different measures
   of urbanity-anonymity, tolerance, alienation, community social bonds,
   deviant behavior, and involvement in unconventional subcultures. Our
   results support the contention that size has an independent effect on
   urbanity, but Various structural theories generally fail to explain many
   aspects of the relationship. Instead, the views of Hummon (1990) about a
   shared culture of place are most consistent with our findings. We
   conclude by noting the kinds of contributions such a culturalist
   perspective can make to understanding the link between size of place and
   individual characteristics. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

AB The idea that civil society is declining has been much discussed
   recently, for example, by Fukuyama (Trust: The Social Virtues and the
   Creation of Prosperity. New York: Free Press, 1995) and Putnam (The
   American Prospect 13 (Spring):35-42, 1993; Nobel Symposium, Uppsala,
   Sweden, August 27-30, 1994; PS: Political Science and Politics,
   December: 664-683). At the same time, another stream of research
   suggests that racial tolerance is increasing through time (Quillian,
   American Journal of Sociology 101 (3):816-860,1996; Firebaugh and Davis,
   American Journal of Sociology 94 (2):-251-272. This paper combines ideas
   from several intellectual traditions to suggest that economic conditions
   may affect civil society, which in turn may influence social tolerance.
   These ideas are explored, using multivariate analysis of pooled General
   Social Survey data from 1972 to 1994. The results suggest that the
   fabric of civil society and economic conditions may contribute somewhat
   to espoused tolerance. Greater economic security, together with the
   attitudes fostered by a vibrant civil society including greater trust
   and less anomia, appear to increase espoused social tolerance. Period
   effects and the effects of other demographic factors remain strongly
   related to expressions of tolerance. While alternative interpretations
   may be offered depending on whether the interaction terms, Year x
   Education or Cohort x Education, are included in the analysis, the high
   correlation between the two suggests that these interpretations cannot
   be seen as oppositional. Finally and most important, the analysis
   reveals many parallels between espoused racial and homosexual tolerance,
   suggesting a more generalizable model of social tolerance.

AB Management for migratory birds at an ecosystem scale requires forming
   cooperative partnerships with the private sector. To be effective,
   however, wildlife managers must understand the economic and social
   attitudes of private landowners to ensure that strategies involving
   stakeholders are viable and can be implemented. We documented attitudes
   of farmers in the San Luis Valley (SLV) of Colorado toward Rocky
   Mountain Population greater sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis tabida)
   using a self-administered, mail-back survey. Overall response rate was
   46.7%. Viewing sandhill cranes in the SLV was considered somewhat
   important or important by 78.6% of respondents. In contrast, only 62.1%
   of respondents indicated that viewing sandhill cranes was somewhat
   important or important on their own land. Farmers' attitudes toward
   viewing sandhill cranes on their own property were related (P=0.02) to
   perceived conflicts with crop production. The extent of crane use
   (P=0.04) was the only variable we tested that predicted whether
   conflicts were reported. Our results suggest that partnerships between
   farmers and natural resource agencies concerned with management of
   sandhill cranes may be viable. However, the role of farmers in ally
   proposed management strategy must be examined carefully because there
   may be an upper limit of crane use on private land that farmers will
   tolerate.

AB A common characterization of adolescence is that parent influence
   decreases and friend influence increases as adolescents age. From that,
   we hypothesized that the association between parent and adolescent
   smoking decreases and the association between friend and adolescent
   smoking increases as adolescents become older. The hypothesis is tested
   with data from The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.
   Adolescent smoking is measured as progressions to more frequent smoking
   and as continuations from prior smoking levels. There is no support for
   the hypothesis, a finding consistent with the earlier panel study that
   tested it. The age-specific findings are discussed in the context of
   programs designed to influence adolescent cigarette smoking and why the
   hypothesis that drove this study was not confirmed. Among supplementary
   findings reported is that adolescent smoking is more influenced by
   friend smoking than by parent smoking. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

   substance use and their PSS from both family and friends. The effects of
   gender and age were also examined. Overall, friend PSS was higher than
   family PSS, regardless of paternal history. Females scored higher than
   males on friend PSS. Older adolescents (19-21 years old) perceived
   higher social support from friends than younger adolescents (14-15 years
   old). Heavy marijuana and tobacco users reported lower family and friend
   PSS than light users, while heavy alcohol users reported higher friend
   PSS than light users. Young FH+ adolescents reported using marijuana at
   an earlier age than young FH- adolescents. Since the influence of friend
   PSS on substance use provides a more complex picture than family PSS
   among adolescents, future analyses will focus on the underlying
   mechanisms of peer influence on drinking and drug use. (C) 2001 Elsevier

   programs have been designed that specifically target pregnant smokers.
   Longitudinal studies, however, have shown that there is a group of women
   who are unable to quit smoking while pregnant. Women from a rural area
   of the Mid-West (N = 299) were interviewed postpartum to determine the
   stresses these women experienced prenatally and the association of the
   stress with continuing to smoke during pregnancy. Subjects were divided
   into three groups: Nonsmokers, Quitters, Smokers. This study not only
   confirms other reports that these women are more stressed but also
   documents some of the major stressors. Statistically significant
   differences were found between groups for financial worries (P=.0002),
   problems with the family (P < .001), and domestic violence (P < .001).
   Assessing pregnant women for stress and, especially, domestic violence

AB Context: Previous studies have suggested that excessive lead exposure is
   related to aggressive and violent behavior.
   Objective: To evaluate the association between estimated air lead
   concentrations and homicide rates.
   Design: Cross-sectional ecological study.
   Setting: All counties in the contiguous 48 stares of the United States.
   Exposure Measure: Estimated air lead concentrations and blood lead
   levels.
   Main Outcome Measure: The homicide rate in each county.
   Results: Negative binomial regression was used to examine the
   relationship between air lead concentrations and the incidence of
   homicide across counties in the United States (N=3111). After adjusting
   for sociologic confounding factors and 9 measures of air pollution, the
   only indictor of air pollution found to be associated with homicide
   rates was air lead concentration. Across all counties, estimated air
   lead concentrations ranged from 0 to 0.17 mug/m(3). The adjusted results
   suggest that the difference between the highest and lowest level of
   estimated air lead is associated with a homicide incidence rate ratio of
   4.12 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-16.61).
   Conclusion: The results of this study support recent findings that there
   is an association between lead exposure and violent behavior.

   Methods: Cross-sectional self-reported survey of pediatricians and
   family physicians in 3 New York metropolitan statistical areas who had
   seen 1 or more adolescents for well care within the past 6 months.
   Results: Of 564 eligible physicians, 371 (66%) responded. Physicians
   reported asking most adolescents about smoking (91%) but were less
   likely to ask about peer smoking use (41%) or smokeless tobacco use
   (32%). Similarly, they reported assessing motivation to quit for 81% of
   smokers, but less often helped set quit dates (34%)) or scheduled
   follow-up visits (28%). Family physicians were more likely to provide
   more effective smoking cessation interactions than pediatricians (mean
   smoking counseling performance score, 61 vs 53; P < .001). Family
   physicians were also more likely to be familiar with National Cancer
   Institute guidelines than pediatricians (48% vs 27%; P < .001). Female
   physicians reported having spent more time with their last adolescent
   patient (mean, 26 vs 21 minutes; P<.001) and more often spent time alone
   with adolescent patients (85% vs 76% of visits; P<.001) than did male
   physicians. In multivariate modeling, specialty, familiarity with
   National Cancer Institute guidelines, time spent, and confidentiality
   factors were associated with better smoking counseling performance.
   Conclusion: Familiarity with smoking cessation guidelines and
   physician's specialty and practice style with adolescents are associated
   with better delivery of tobacco cessation counseling to adolescents.

AB Objective. This study continues an investigation into the role of
   decline in performance of valued life activities in the development of
   depressive symptoms among persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We
   examined whether declines in specific types of activities are important
   in the onset of depressive symptoms or whether the important factor is
   simply the overall burden of activity decline.
   Methods. Data from a longitudinal study of persons with RA, for which
   individuals are interviewed annually, were used. Two analyses (n = 344
   and 310) were conducted because of differences in the way life
   activities were assessed over time. Each analysis covered 4 interviews
   (1989-1992 and 1995-1998). Analyses were structured so that the decline
   in performance of life activities clearly preceded the development of
   depressive symptoms. The outcome variable was the presence of depressive
   symptoms at time 4; primary independent variables were activity decline
   between time 2 and time 3. Individuals with high levels of depressive
   symptoms prior to time 4 were excluded from the analyses.
   Results. In both analyses, total decline in performance of life
   activities was an important predictor of subsequent high levels of
   depressive symptoms. However, some activity domains were more closely
   linked to the onset of new depressive symptoms than others. In
   particular, declines in the ability to perform recreational activities
   and engage in social interactions were linked to the onset of new
   depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion. Declines in the ability to engage in recreational activities
   and social interactions appear to significantly increase the risk of new
   depressive symptoms. These findings can give direction to both clinical
   inquiries into patients' functioning and interventions intended to
   enhance functioning.

AB Hinduism is one of the oldest religions of the world with no known
   beginning, no human founder. It predates recorded history. Hindus
   believe that there is one creator, all life is sacred, and therefore
   non-violence or Ahimsa is the highest Dharma of a Hindu. Belief in
   reincarnation gives continuity of life from one birth to the other until
   the soul is realized and reaches Nirvana. Ayurveda, an ancient Indian
   medical practice, is commonly used to treat patients. Other alternative
   medicines such as homeopathic treatments, message therapy are also
   commonly used for preventive as well as curative practices. Hindus in
   India tend to be more ritualistic than in the Western world. Treatment
   of Hindus has to be culturally sensitive and include Hindu beliefs and
   practices. Clinicians have to be aware that patients are rarely
   self-referred and the role of the family is crucial. Clinicians should
   distinguish between healthy and unhealthy religiosity based on how it
   interferes with adaptation to life situations.

AB Aphasia affects functional activities and participation in social roles
   years after onset. Some group and individual programs have reported
   success in improving social activities and perceived wellness. These
   programs typically last several weeks or months. A short, 2-day seminar
   style program designed for adults with chronic aphasia and their
   families is described in this report. Six-month follow-up data from
   participant pairs demonstrates a significant improvement in functional
   activity level, improved knowledge of aphasia, and improved family
   relationships. Nonparticipant pairs did not demonstrate any changes over
   the same period. These findings replicate and extend those of a previous
   study on the same 2-day seminar [Top. Stroke Rehabil. 2 (1995) 53.]. The
   results of this study demonstrate the important outcomes of even a very
   brief program designed to address the long-term psychosocial needs of
   adults living with aphasia and their families. Educational objectives:
   As a result of this activity, the participant will be able to: (1)
   describe a brief family education seminar for adults with chronic
   aphasia; (2) discuss outcomes in family adjustment, community
   reintegration, and activities of daily living associated with
   participation in a family education seminar; and (3) evaluate areas of
   programming and outcomes that should be addressed in future research.

AB Objective: This report describes the development of the Massachusetts
   Youth Screening Instrument-Second Version (MAYSI-2), a brief screening
   measure to identify youths with potential mental, emotional, or
   behavioral problems at entry points in the juvenile justice system.
   Method: This 52-item self-report measure, with content relevant to
   common mental health problems in delinquent populations, was
   administered to 1,279 male and female youths, aged 12 to 17, in
   Massachusetts juvenile justice facilities. A subsample of youths also
   received the Millon Adolescent Clinical Inventory (MACI) and the Youth
   Self-Report (YSR). The instrument was subsequently administered to 3,804
   male and female youths in California Youth Authority custody. Results:
   Factor analyses of the 52 items identified seven scales that were
   conceptually associated with various mental, emotional, and behavioral
   problems of youths, which were generally confirmed by separate factor
   analyses with the California sample. The scales manifested adequate
   internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Most scales were
   substantially correlated with conceptually similar scales in the MACI
   and YSR, and they identified most youths who scored at clinically
   significant levels on those instruments. Conclusions: The MAYSI-2 shows
   promise as a reliable and valid screening tool to assist juvenile
   justice staff in identifying youths who may need an immediate response
   to mental or emotional problems.

   82% had a history of a substance use problem and 47% had used specialty
   mental health services during their lifetime. Conclusions: A substantial
   proportion of female juvenile offenders merit a mental health
   evaluation. Interventions for these high-risk youths should include an
   assessment for substance use disorders because of the association of
   recidivism and substance use problems in this population.

AB The behavior of fishermen is often far more complicated than assumed by
   fisheries managers. Those concerned with the Maine lobster (i.e.,
   American lobster Homarus americanus, hereafter "lobster") fishery have
   long favored a cap on the number of traps each license holder can use.
   Fishermen favor trap limits primarily to cut costs and limit congestion,
   and managers believe such limits will help reduce fishing effort. Yet
   when trap limits were imposed by the legislature and the lobster zone
   councils between 1995 and 1998, the number of traps fished in Maine
   waters increased greatly. A survey of half the lobster license holders
   carried out in the summer and fall of 1998 revealed that the response of
   fishermen to trap limits was highly differential. Some fishermen
   reduced, but more increased, the number of traps they fished. A
   complicated set of variables influenced those decisions concerning trap
   numbers, including the regulatory environment, age and characteristics
   of the fishermen, relative economic opportunities, and reference group
   behavior. One of the assumptions running through the literature on
   fisheries management is that fishermen are homogenous and respond in
   similar ways to management initiatives. In fact, if we can judge by the
   data from the Maine lobster fishery, the response of fishermen to a
   management initiative can be quite diverse, and license holders may
   respond to a wide variety of social and economic factors in ways that
   confound the goals of management. This study points out that the effects
   of management cannot be ascertained unless we have an accurate and
   relatively sophisticated understanding of the myriad factors motivating
   the decisions of the fishermen.

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the effects of
   partner interactions on ambulatory blood pressure in a sample of 120
   healthy adults who were monitored over a 6-day period. Methods: After
   each blood pressure measurement, participants rated characteristics of
   ongoing social interactions, along with emotional activation, physical
   activity, talking, posture, and other covariates, with computer-assisted
   self-report assessments. Results: Using multilevel modeling, we showed
   that blood pressure was significantly lower during social interactions
   with one's partner relative to social interactions with any other person
   and relative to periods of not interacting. Interactions with partners
   also were characterized by significantly less talking and emotional
   activation and more intimacy and perceived emotional support; however,
   these differences did not mediate the partner effect on blood pressure,
   In addition, the relative benefits of interacting with a partner were
   not moderated by relationship quality, gender, or race, Conclusions: The
   effects of social situations on ambulatory blood pressure may represent
   one pathway through which social relationships affect cardiovascular
   health.

AB Whereas workers' use of the strike in workplace disputes has declined
   over the past decades, their legal mobilization-that is, the filing of
   unfair labor practice charges against employers-has risen. Little
   attention in labor sociology has been given to the circumstances in
   which workers turn to the law. Yet, within the union movement and in
   other social movements as well, legal mobilization is a commonly used
   strategy. The author develops and empirically tests a model of the
   circumstances in which workers use the law. A number of factors are
   found to influence this process, in particular, the "underlying
   activity" (that is, union elections) and various economic circumstances.
   Theoretical conclusions are drawn on the basis of these findings.

AB PURPOSE: Little research has examined the validity of using census data
   to determine an individual's socio-economic status (SES), as measured by
   race and educational level. This study assessed the accuracy of using
   aggregate level data from United States Census Block Groups in
   determining race and education as SES indicators in a cohort of women
   from North Carolina.
   METHODS: The study analyzed patient data from the Carolina Mammography
   Registry and 1990 United States Census in 21 North Carolina counties.
   Women (n = 39,546) were geocoded to their census block group and their
   block group characteristics (surrogate measures) were validated with
   their self reported values on race and education. An analysis was
   performed to explore whether using these surrogate measures would affect
   measured associations with the self-reported values.
   RESULTS: Whites were accurately identified (84.8%) more consistently
   than Blacks (14.1%) regardless of their urban/rural status. Women
   without a high school diploma or equivalent were accurately identified
   (56.2%) more often than those with higher education levels (45.9%).
   Analyses using the surrogate measures were significantly different than
   the true values according to chi-square statistics.
   CONCLUSIONS: Use of census data to derive SES indicators tends to be
   more accurate for the majority than the minority population. Researchers
   must be sensitive to the ecologic fallacy when using aggregate level
   data such as the census to determine individual level characteristics.

AB The relationship of moods and social context to energy and nutrient

   function independently. The subjects were 78 predominantly white, obese
   women participating in weight-loss studies. Mean age was 36.7 (SD=7.6)
   and mean Body Mass Index was 32.1 (SD=3.6). Subjects completed 2-week
   baseline food diaries recording everything they ate, including moods and
   people present during the meals. Meals eaten in positive and negative
   moods were significantly larger than meals eaten in a neutral mood.
   Meals eaten with other people were significantly larger than meals eaten
   alone. There were no significant moods by social context interactions
   for total energy intake. Moods and social context functioned additively
   to increase the risk of over-rating. Macro nutrient analysis revealed
   only a main effect for social context. Percentage of calories from fat
   and protein were greater, whereas the percentage of carbohydrate was
   less in social contest meals compared to meals eaten alone. Clinicians
   should conduct a functional analysis to assess exposure to the frequency
   and types of risky situations. Teaching people to cope more effectively
   with social situations and moods may increase the efficacy of weight
   loss and maintenance programs. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

   est was how people determine what is appropriate behavior when they an
   faced with conflicting: norms within a given situation. Participants
   tasted cookies while alone or while observed by the experimenter.
   Further more, participants were assigned to either a "no norm" condition
   in which they were given no indication of how much other people in the
   study had eaten, an "inhibition norm" condition in which they were led
   to believe that others had eaten minimally, or an "augmentation norm"
   condition in which they were led to believe that others in the study had
   eaten a lot. When they were alone, participants were influenced by the
   norms; but when they were observed, they ate minimally, regardless of
   the norms to which they were exposed. It seems that a norm for minimal
   eating superseded a matching norm which prescribes that people should
   use the intake of their peers as a guide For appropriate behavior.

   Aims To assess the long-range impact of socio-economic status (SES) and
   birth risks on the development of emotional and nervous conditions
   through adulthood.
   Method The Johns Hopkins Pathways Study interviewed 1824 subjects born
   between 1960 and 1965. The median household income of the children at
   age 7-8 years was used to divide the cohort into high and low income
   categories. Differences in life time prevalence of emotional and nervous
   conditions through adulthood between the two income groups were
   identified.
   Results Children in the lower income group were 1.86 times more likely
   to report an emotional or nervous condition as adults. Boys in the lower
   income group at age 7-8 years were 3.2 times more likely to do so. The
   risks of difficult birth for adult mental disturbance were accentuated
   in the low-income group.
   Conclusions Children who experience birth complications are at increased
   risk of developing adult mental disturbances; this increase is mitigated
   by higher SES.

AB Background Generations of epidemiologists have documented an association
   between low socio-economic status (SES) and depression (variously

   Aims To test the extent to which social causation (low SES causing
   depression) and social selection (depression causing low SES) processes
   are in evidence in an inter-generational longitudinal study.
   Method Participants (n=756)were interviewed up to four times over 17
   years using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia
   (SADS).
   Results Low parental education was associated with increased risk for
   offspring depression, even after controlling for parental depression,
   offspring gender and offspring age. Neither parental nor offspring
   depression predicted later levels of offspring occupation, education or
   income.
   Conclusion There is evidence for an effect of parental SES on offspring
   depression (social causation) but not for an effect of either parental
   or offspring depression on offspring SES (social selection).

AB The commonsense view of religious experience is that it is a
   preconceptual, immediate affective event. Work in philosophy and
   psychology, however, suggest that religious experience is an
   attributional cognitive phenomenon. Here the neural correlates of a
   religious experience are investigated using functional neuroimaging.
   During religious recitation, self-identified religious subjects
   activated a frontal-parietal circuit, composed of the dorsolateral
   prefrontal, dorsomedial frontal and medial parietal cortex. Prior
   studies indicate that these areas play a profound role in sustaining
   reflexive evaluation of thought. Thus, religious experience may be a
   cognitive process which, nonetheless, feels immediate.

AB Objective. The goal of this work was to compare characteristics and
   survival of cervical cancer patients at adjacent public and university
   hospitals to define the effects of poverty and ethnicity on disease.
   Methods. A retrospective chart review was conducted of cervical cancer
   patients managed by gynecologic oncologists at two adjacent urban
   hospitals between 1992 and 1998. Continuous variables were compared by t
   test, categorical variables by chi (2), and survival by the Kaplan-Meier
   and log-rank methods.
   Results. In all, 372 patients were identified, with 209 (56%) at the
   public hospital and 163 (44%) at the adjacent university hospital.
   Ethnic distribution differed between the two hospitals: 100 (52%) versus
   46 (28%) African-American, 56 (29%) versus 13 (8%) Hispanic, 31 (16%)
   versus 96 (60%) Caucasian, and 5 (3%) versus 6 (4%) other (P < 0.001),
   In addition, public hospital patients presented with more advanced
   cancers (stages II-IV) than those managed at the university hospital, 96
   (48%) versus 53 (34%) (P = 0.008), and squamous cancers were more common
   at the public hospital, 154 (89%) versus 120 (76%) (P = 0.03). However,
   with a median follow-up of 17 months, stage-adjusted survival did not
   differ between the two institutions.
   Conclusions. The higher proportions of advanced and squamous cervical
   cancers encountered at the public hospital likely reflect suboptimal
   screening. Equal access to gynecologic oncologists eliminated
   disparities in stage-adjusted survival. Efforts at earlier diagnosis
   should be directed at indigent, especially minority women, (C) 2001

AB With the ending of the Cold War, the Department of Energy (DOE) is
   evaluating mission, future land use and stewardship of departmental
   facilities. This paper compares the environmental concerns and future
   use preferences of 351 people interviewed at Lewiston, Idaho, about the
   Hanford Site and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory
   (INEEL), two of DOE's largest sites. Although most subjects lived closer
   to Hanford than INEEL, most resided in the same state as INEEL.
   Therefore their economic interests might be more closely allied with
   INEEL, while their health concerns might be more related to Hanford. Few
   lived close enough to either site to be directly affected economically.
   We test the null hypotheses that there are no differences in
   environmental concerns and future land-use preferences as a function of
   DOE site, sex, age and education. When asked to list their major
   concerns about the sites, more people listed human health and safety,
   and environmental concerns about Hanford compared to INEEL. When asked
   to list their preferred future land uses, 49% of subjects did not have
   any for INEEL, whereas only 35% did not know for Hanford. The highest
   preferred land uses for both sites were as a National Environmental
   Research Park (NERP), and for camping, hunting, hiking, and fishing.
   Except for returning the land to the tribes and increased nuclear
   storage, subjects rated all future uses as more preferred at INEEL than
   Hanford. Taken together, these data suggest that the people interviewed
   know more about Hanford, are more concerned about Hanford, rate
   recreational uses and NERP as their highest preferred land use, and feel
   that INEEL is more suited for most land uses than Hanford. Overall
   rankings for future land uses were remarkably similar between the sites,
   indicating that for these stakeholders, DOE lands should be preserved
   for research and recreation. These preferences should be taken into
   account when planning for long-term stewardship at these two DOE sites.

AB The 'new rural sociology' arguably represented the most significant
   watershed in the development of rural sociology during the 1970s and
   1980s. I argue, however, that the new rural sociology, especially its
   dominant traditions of Chayanovian and neo-leninist Marxism, has now
   been almost entirely superseded as a theoretical position in agrarian
   political economy by the international food regimes, commodity
   chains/systems analysis, regulationist, and actor-network traditions. In
   addition, Wageningen School research on 'farming styles' and the
   'cultural-turn' within rural sociology and rural studies have arisen, in
   part, as challenges to the more structuralist styles of reasoning within
   agrarian political economy. Parallel trends in the sociology of
   development are also discussed. The paper concludes with an appraisal of
   the strengths and weaknesses of these new late twentieth century
   traditions in agrarian political economy, particularly in comparison
   with the new rural sociology.

AB This paper examines the question of ontological choice in agro-food
   studies, and emphasizes that such choices are consequential, determining
   analytical points of entry, arenas of theory and praxis, and normative
   positioning. These questions are explored by examining the privileged
   place of the labour process in the development of agro-food studies and,
   as a more specific illustration, in analyses of agro-biotechnology. It
   is suggested that the modernist ontological priorities embedded in the
   unreconstructed conceptualization of the labour process not only have
   been ignored but also have found an unexamined place in
   post-structuralist agrarian political economy. The discussion closes by
   reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of actor-network theory as an
   alternative avenue of critical engagement with the 'new' bio-politics of
   agro-food networks.

AB Fringe religions, often referred to as new religious movements (NRMs),
   or "cults," are a fascinating and theoretically insightful form of
   deviant behavior. For the most part, however, those who have studied
   deviant religions have identified themselves as sociologists of religion
   rather then deviance theorists, and their books and articles dealing
   with deviant religion have primarily been directed toward sociologists
   of religion. As a result, sociologists tend to reach religion as
   deviance in sociology of religion courses but not in deviance or social
   problems courses. The purpose of this paper is to highlight significant
   literature and important theoretical connections relevant to the
   teaching of deviant religions in deviance and social problems courses.
   Deviance conceptions and theory can be easily applied to the study of
   cults, and the result can be academically and intellectually stimulating
   to professor and student alike.

AB Despite increased popularity and a strong pedagogical tradition, the
   literature on community-based learning (CBL) initiatives and service
   learning evidences a certain conceptual imprecision. In the hopes of
   clarifying definitional ambiguities, we critically review the CBL
   literature, identifying six distinct types of CBL options and their
   characteristics. The result is a hierarchy of community-based learning,
   which while not proposed as a definitive conceptualization, is likely to
   be useful in terms of curricular development. Using a hypothetical
   sociology class, the community-based learning options identified (i.e.,
   out-of-class activities, volunteering, service add-ons, internships,
   service learning, and service learning advocacy) are discussed in Terms
   of their pedagogical differences and associated curricular benefits.

AB Ongoing debate about proper interpretation of DNA sequence polymorphisms
   and their ability to reconstruct human population history illustrates a
   important change in perspective that we have achieved in the past 20
   years of population genetics. To what extent does the history of a Locus
   represent the history of a population? Tools originally developed for
   molecular systematics, where genetic Lineages have been separated by
   speciation events, are routinely applied to the analysis of variation
   within our species, with conflicting results. Because of automated
   technologies and linkage analysis, we are poised to harvest a wealth of
   information about our past, if we are successful in moving beyond a
   current polarization regarding models of human evolution. Rather than
   just suggesting that true resolution will only come by considering
   fossil or archaeological evidence, the realistic and appropriate
   application of genetic models for analysis of population structure is
   also necessary. Three examples from different dispersal events are
   highlighted here.

   is absent before 2.5 million years ago (Ma), so reconstructions of
   australopithecine technology are based mainly on the behavior and
   anatomy of chimpanzees. Stone tool technology, robust
   australopithecines, and the genus Homo appeared almost simultaneously
   2.5 Ma. Once this adaptive threshold was crossed, technological
   evolution was accompanied by increased brain size, population size, and
   geographical range. Aspects of behavior, economy, mental capacities,
   neurological functions, the origin of grammatical Language, and social

AB Objectives. Social cohesion is recognized as a fundamental condition for
   healthy populations, but social cohesion itself arises from political
   unity. The history of the Berlin Wall provides a unique opportunity to
   examine the effects of partition on social cohesion and, by inference,
   on health.
   Methods. This ethnographic study consisted of examination of the
   territory formerly occupied by the Wall, formal and informal interviews
   with Berlin residents, and collection of cultural documents related to
   the Wall. Transcripts, field notes, and documents were examined by means
   of a keyword-m-context analysis.
   Results. The separation of Berlin into 2 parts was a traumatic
   experience for the city's residents. After partition, East and West
   Germany had divergent social, cultural, and political experiences and
   gradually grew apart.
   Conclusions. The demolition of the Wall-the symbol and the instrument of
   partition-makes possible but does not ensure the reintegration of 2
   populations that were separated for 40 years. The evolution of a new
   common culture might be accelerated by active attempts at cultural and
   social exchange.

AB We tested the hypothesis that lower socioeconomic status (SES) children
   display heightened cardiovascular reactivity during stressful situations
   because they are more likely to appraise a wide variety of social
   situations, including ambiguous ones, as threatening. A sample of 201
   children and adolescents, half White and half African American, were
   assessed initially Ninety of these children were retested an average of
   3 years later At both time points, children were interviewed about
   appraisals of hostile intent and feelings of anger in response to
   scenarios with negative or ambiguous outcomes. Cardiovascular reactivity
   to 3 laboratory stress tasks was measured Initially, lower SES was
   associated with greater hostile intent appraisal and anger during
   ambiguous scenarios across all participants. In addition, responses to
   ambiguous scenarios partially mediated the relation between SES and
   vascular reactivity. Longitudinally, low SES African American
   participants showed higher mean intensity of hostile intent appraisals
   during ambiguous scenarios, and these appraisals mediated the
   SES-reactivity relationship. These findings suggest that the way in
   which children appraise ambiguous social situations plays an important
   role in the relation between SES and cardiovascular reactivity.

AB Birth weight has long been a focus of study by epidemiologists and human
   biologists, because it reflects the quality of the intrauterine
   environment and may be used as a predictor of future growth and
   development. Comparisons of Black and White neonates in the USA have
   consistently shown differences in birth weight. Confounding variables
   are a major problem in any such investigation, especially socio-economic
   status which is highly correlated with race in the USA. This study was
   distinctive in the sampling of one socioeconomic stratum (low income),
   and the use of five anthropometric measures in addition to birth weight.
   The goals of this study were as follows: to determine if there were
   differences in body size and body composition at birth in Black and
   White neonates of low socio-economic status (SES), and to investigate
   what variables might account for any observed variability. The sample
   consisted of full term Black and White neonates of low SES (n = 323)
   born in Albany, NY (1986-1997). Birth weight, length, head and arm
   circumference, and subscapular and triceps skinfolds were compared. Race
   was determined through maternal self-identification. White neonates were
   significantly larger than Black neonates in birth weight, length and
   head circumference. Among female neonates none of the anthropometric
   dimensions differed between Blacks and Whites. Among male neonates,
   Whites were significantly larger than Blacks in birth weight, length,
   head and arm circumferences. Principal components analysis reduced the
   six anthropometric dimensions to two summary measures: body size and
   composition. When controlling for social and biological variables, race
   and sex were significant predictors of body composition, but not body
   size. Interpretation of results and possible causal relationships are
   discussed.

AB Social scientists concerned with processes of change within military
   organizations have begun to appropriate the language of postmodernism in
   order to describe a number of transformations observed in military
   forces cross-nationally since the end of the Cold War. Although the
   thesis of the "postmodern military" may have a novel appeal to scholars
   across a broad range of disciplines, this article argues that while
   substantial changes are indeed occurring in the armed forces of Western
   countries, there is at present little evidence to suggest that these
   changes are postmodern in nature. On the contrary, most of the
   developments in contemporary armed forces being described as such are
   actually modern in character-emerging as the result of rational,
   purposeful adaptation to environmental contingencies. We argue that the
   intellectual discourse of postmodernism is useful for military sociology
   only to the extent that scholars are able to apply discrete strands of
   postmodern social theory to predict or explain processes of change. The
   article examines the utility of three such strands: post-industrialism,
   post-Fordism and globalization. Finally, alternative criteria,
   heretofore marginalized in the discussion of the postmodern military,
   are suggested as benchmarks to determine the degree to which the armed
   forces have indeed become postmodern.

AB The responsibility to provide accessible, useful genetic counseling to
   individuals from many cultures and ethnicities arises from the
   increasing ethnocultural diversity of the populations served, coupled
   with the ethical goal of providing equal access and quality of services
   for all individuals. The multicultural education, training, and practice
   of genetic counseling involves three major components: knowledge of
   relevant ethnocultural groups, ethnocultural self-awareness, and an
   understanding of institutional and social barriers to services. Despite
   the diversity of ethnocultural groups served and the critical role of
   direct experience and training for the genetic counselor, some general
   guidelines for multicultural genetic counseling can be identified. These
   include the importance of establishing and maintaining trust, the
   essential need to respect the counselee's healthcare beliefs and
   practices, and the necessity of understanding the impact of culture on
   the process of decision making and on counselee responses to
   nondirective counseling.

   Genetic factors were found to significantly influence some traits (i.e.

   important for others (i.e. sexual promiscuity). For marijuana use,
   genetic and environmental factors were equally important; however, the
   association between risk taking and marijuana use may not be comparable
   for different behaviors. Results suggest that different etiological
   factors may underlie various risk taking traits which is relevant to

   of socioeconomic status (SES) on childhood obesity.
   DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
   SUBJECTS: One thousand one hundred and fifty seven children in the
   second or third grade of kindergartens in Saraburi Province, Thailand.
   MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight were measured and the weight-for-height
   index with the Thai national standard was used for assessing nutritional
   status. A questionnaire was used for measuring parents' socioeconomic
   status.
   RESULTS: The prevalence of childhood obesity over 97th percentile for
   weight-for-height (>p(97)) was 22.7% in urban and 7.4% in rural areas.
   There were marked relationships between childhood obesity and parents'
   educational level and household income.
   CONCLUSION: Childhood obesity is an emerging health problem in
   developing countries, especially in urban areas. This study demonstrates
   a marked correlation between SES and prevalence of childhood obesity in

   factors to physical aggression during marital conflict.
   Methods-Logistic regression models were used to analyse panel data
   collected in the National Survey of Families and Households in 1987 and
   1992. A total of 4780 married or cohabiting persons reinterviewed in
   1992 were included in the analysis, Domestic violence was defined as
   reporting that both partners were physically violent during arguments.
   Results-It was found that non-employed respondents are not at greater
   risk of family violence in comparison with employed respondents, after
   controlling for alcohol misuse, income, education, age, and other
   factors; however, employed persons receiving welfare benefits are at
   significantly higher risk. Alcohol misuse, which remains a predictor of
   violence even after controlling for other factors, increases the risk of
   family violence while satisfaction with social support from family and
   friends decreases it.
   Conclusion-These results underscore the important effect of alcohol
   misuse on domestic violence, and the need to monitor the potential
   impact of welfare reform on domestic violence.

PY 2001
AB Objective: This study examines student alcohol use and associated
   problems, including drinking and driving, at U.S. colleges that ban
   alcohol for all students on campus.
   Method: A nationally representative sample of students (N = 11,303, 61%
   women) attending U.S. colleges completed questionnaires regarding
   alcohol use and related behaviors in the spring of 1999. The responses
   of 2,252 students at 19 ban schools were compared with those of 9,051
   students at 76 nonban schools.
   Results: Students at ban colleges were 30% less likely to be heavy
   episodic drinkers and more likely to abstain from alcohol. The lower
   rates of heavy episodic drinking apply to students whether or not they
   were heavy episodic drinkers in high school. However, among drinkers,
   students at ban schools engaged in as much extreme drinking as drinkers
   at schools that do not ban alcohol and experienced the same rate of
   alcohol-related problems. At schools that ban alcohol, fewer students
   experienced secondhand effects of the drinking of others than did
   students at nonban schools. Students at ban schools were not more likely
   to drink and drive than were students at nonban schools.
   Conclusions: A campus ban on alcohol may support abstention from alcohol
   use and reduce heavy episodic drinking and the associated secondhand
   effects in college. Since this is a correlational study, we cannot
   determine whether the lower rates of heavy episodic drinking are due to
   the ban or to other factors (e.g., self-selection of students to these
   schools). Ban schools do not enroll fewer high school heavy episodic
   drinkers.

AB Objective: This article examines the factor structure of 22 symptom
   items used to configure the criteria of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and
   Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) alcohol abuse
   and dependence and relates the factor structure to background
   characteristics.
   Method: Data for this study were drawn from the National Longitudinal
   Study of Labor Market Experience in Youth (NLSY). The symptom items were
   related to the covariates using the statistical technique of structural
   equation modeling generalized to dichotomous outcomes. The present model
   is a special case of structural equation modeling, a multiple causes and
   multiple indicators (MIMIC) model, in which one or more latent variables
   (i.e., alcohol abuse and dependence) intervene between a set of observed
   background variables predicting a set of observed response variables
   (i.e., DSM-IV symptom items).
   Results: The results of the structural equation analysis provide further
   support for two dimensions underlying the DSM-IV symptom items. Although
   the two-factor dimension bore a strong resemblance to the DSM-IV
   conceptions of abuse and dependence, there were notable differences in
   the item content of the symptom items for each dimension. The dependence
   dimension drew upon items related to the abuse criteria for continued
   drinking despite social problems and recurrent drinking resulting in
   failure to fulfill role obligations. The abuse dimension drew upon items
   related to the abuse criterion for hazardous drinking and the dependence
   criterion for larger amounts over time. The two factors were shown to
   have different relationships to the background variables. Alcohol
   dependence tvas related to family history of alcoholism and educational
   status. Age was not related to dependence and inversely related to
   alcohol abuse.
   Conclusions: Findings from this study replicate the two-dimensional
   model for DSM-IV criteria found in other studies and provide further
   support for the validity of alcohol dependence in general population
   samples. A major implication of the factor structure in the present
   study relates to the different classification of cases that would
   otherwise be obtained with DSM-IV criteria. These departures were shown
   to affect abuse, which retained only 40% of DSM-IV diagnoses, more
   strongly than dependence, which retained 91% of DSM-IV diagnoses.

AB Objective: This study tested the cross-cultural applicability of

   1952) described a predictable progression of alcoholism that continues
   to be used widely in treatment, but it is unclear whether this pattern
   is consistent across cultures and genders.

   about the quantity and frequency of their drinking as well as other
   drinking experiences. Their level of cultural identification was also

   progression for the Navajo sample was modestly correlated (r(s) = 41, p
   = .005, 17% shared variance) with that for Jellinek's white men. The
   correlation of Jellinek's sample with the Navajo men was slightly larger
   (r(s) = .48, p =.001, 23% shared variance) than that of the whole
   sample; however, the comparison with Navajo women resulted in a near
   zero correlation (r(s) = .06, p = .705, 4% shared variance).
   Conclusions: In the context of studies from other cultures, these data
   suggest convergence decreases as the studied sample deviates culturally
   from Jellinek's sample of U.S, white men. These data question the
   cross-cultural applicability of this popular model of progression of
   alcoholism.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study was to test a developmental model
   of drug use in male adolescents. The model postulates that low executive
   functioning and a difficult temperament are related to aggression and
   affiliations with delinquent peers which, in turn, are related to
   elevated drug use.
   Method: Boys (N = 187) with and without a family history of a substance
   use disorder (SUD) were followed over a 6-year period. Executive
   functioning and temperament were measured at age 10-12. aggression and
   affiliations with delinquent peers were assessed at age 12-14 and drug
   use was measured at age 16.
   Results: Low executive functioning and a difficult temperament were
   related to increased aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers.
   These latter variables were related to increased drug use. Furthermore,
   the relation between difficult temperament and drug use was fully
   mediated by aggression and affiliations with delinquent peers.
   Conclusions: Drug abuse prevention efforts may benefit from clinical
   interventions aimed at strengthening executive functioning regulating
   temperament and improving socialization strategies in antisocial
   children.

AB Objective: This study was conducted to investigate the ability of the
   social development model (SDM) to predict alcohol misuse at age 16 and
   to investigate the ability of the SDM to mediate the effects of alcohol
   use at age 14 on alcohol misuse at age 16.
   Method: The sample of 807 (411 males) is from the longitudinal panel of
   the Seattle Social Development Project which, in 1985, surveyed all
   consenting fifth-grade students from 18 elementary schools serving
   high-crime neighborhoods in Seattle, Washington. Alcohol use was
   measured at age 14, predictors of alcohol misuse were measured at age 15
   and alcohol misuse was measured at age 16. Structural equation modeling
   was used to examine the fit of the model to the data.
   Results: All factor loadings were highly significant and the measurement
   model achieved a good fit with the data (Comparative Fit Index [CFI] =
   0.93). A sec end-order structural model fit the data well (CFI = 0.91)
   and also explained 45% of the variance in alcohol misuse at age 16. The
   SDM partially and significantly mediated the direct effect of age-14
   alcohol use on age-16 alcohol misuse.
   Conclusions: The risk and protective processes specified by the SDM
   serve as potential targets for the prevention or reduction of adolescent
   alcohol misuse.

BP 190
EP 198
PD MAR 2001
PY 2001
AB Objective: This study examines the ability of baseline drinking to cope
   to predict drinking behavior across an ensuing 10-year period. In
   addition, it examines whether a propensity to consume alcohol to cope
   with stressors strengthens the link between emotional distress and
   drinking behavior.
   Method: The study uses survey data from a baseline sample of 421 adults
   (54% women) assessed four times over a 10-year period (i.e., baseline
   and 1-, 4- and 10-year follow-ups).
   Results: Baseline drinking to cope was associated with more alcohol
   consumption and drinking problems at all four observations across the
   10-year interval. Baseline drinking to rope also predicted increases in
   both alcohol consumption and drinking problems in the following year.
   Moreover change in drinking to cope was positively linked to changes in
   both alcohol consumption and drinking problems over the interval.
   Individuals who had a stronger propensity to drink to cope at baseline
   showed a stronger link between both anxiety and depressive symptoms and
   drinking outcomes.
   Conclusion: Findings demonstrate the power of alcohol-related coping
   strategies in predicting long-term drinking behavior and they illustrate
   one way in which such coping is linked to alcohol use and abuse. More
   broadly they underscore the importance of considering individual
   differences in emotion-based theories of drinking behavior.

EP 210
PD MAR 2001
PY 2001
AB Objective: This study examined issues of heterogeneity in multiple stage
   development as it corresponds to qualitatively different developmental
   trajectories in alcohol use during adolescence.
   Method: Using a piecewise growth mixture modeling methodology a
   two-piece growth model capturing growth trajectories in adolescent
   alcohol use from middle school (Grades 6 through 8) to high school
   (Grades 9 through 12) was examined (N = 179; 54% male). It was
   hypothesized that (1) two stages of alcohol use development with varying
   trajectories would exist in these data (the first corresponding to
   development during middle school, followed by a second stage of
   continuing growth during high school) and (2) there would be multiple
   growth trajectories (subgroups) of alcohol use in the stage-wise
   development, with varying effects in initial alcohol use and growth
   rates of alcohol use.
   Results: Results indicated the tenability of the two-piece growth model
   of alcohol use with heterogeneity in the population comprising two
   distinct latent developmental trajectory classes. Class 1, with a high
   initial status of alcohol use at Grade 6, showed an upward increase in
   trajectory only during high school. Class 2, with a low initial status
   of alcohol use at Grade 6, showed a linear increase in middle school
   with a second growth spurt at high school entry and continuity in growth
   throughout the high school years. Analyses, incorporating time-invariate
   covariates, indicated varying influences of gender, early levels of
   deviant behavior, family structure (single vs two parent), peer
   encouragement and parent disapproval of alcohol use, and adolescent
   deviant behavior upon high school entry, on the two trajectory classes.
   Results also showed effects of the identified trajectories, with varying
   magnitudes, on later substance use in young adulthood with Class 1
   showing the strongest continuity in later substance use.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest heterogenous development of alcohol use in
   the adolescent population, associated with varying background and
   covariate influences. In addition, this heterogeneity is linked to
   alcohol and other substance use in young adulthood.

AB Objective: The present study reports the longitudinal relationship
   between alcohol warning label exposure and alcohol consumption among
   adolescents. Method: In-school surveys assessed adolescents at three
   annual time points beginning in tenth grade. There were 649 participants
   measured at all three time points; 51% were female. Four effects were
   the focus of the covariance structure, latent growth analysis of these
   data: (1) an exposure effect, whereby earlier alcohol use leads to more
   exposure to the warning label; (2) a deterrent effect, whereby earlier
   alcohol warning label exposure reduces subsequent alcohol consumption;
   (3) a harmful effect, corresponding to a positive relationship between
   early exposure and subsequent consumption; and (4) both exposure and
   deterrent effects operating at the same time. Results: There was a
   statistically significant exposure effect such that earlier alcohol use
   was associated with later exposure to the warning. The association
   between earlier alcohol warning label exposure and subsequent alcohol
   use was generally negative but not statistically significant, suggesting
   that the warning did not affect alcohol consumption. Conclusions: These
   results suggest that the alcohol warning label is having the intended
   effect as described in the law requiring the warning. That is, it is
   informing and reminding persons of the risks associated with alcohol
   use. The warning does not appear to significantly increase or decrease
   alcohol consumption.

SO JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL
VL 62
IS 2
BP 247
EP 256
PD MAR 2001
PY 2001
AB Objective: Faced with a large body of contradictory findings,
   investigators have begun to propose cognitive factors that moderate the
   effects of alcohol an stress. We tested the hypothesis, stemming from
   the appraisal-disruption model (ADM), that alcohol would be more likely
   to reduce stress when consumed prior to exposure to a stressor than when
   consumed following exposure.
   Method: Male and female social drinkers (N = 169, 85 men) with or
   without a parental history of alcoholism were recruited using separate
   structured clinical interviews with the participant and with a
   biological parent. Participants drank a moderate dose of alcohol or a
   placebo in one of two temporal sequences. Stress was induced by asking
   participants to present a self-disclosing speech about their physical
   appearance. Stress responses were assessed using four types of measures:
   self-reported anxiety, pulse rate, facial expression associated with
   negative affect and threat-related interference on a color-naming task.
   Results: Alcohol was generally more likely to attenuate stress responses
   when initial exposure to a social stressor followed drinking than when
   it preceded drinking.
   Conclusions: Findings were consistent with predictions stemming from the
   ADM. Alcohol appears to be more likely to reduce stress when initial
   stress appraisal occurs during intoxication. in contrast, when initial
   appraisal occurs prior to drinking, alcohol is less effective in
   attenuating stress.

PY 2001
AB Objective: This study examines monthly variation in reports of recent
   alcohol consumption behavior.
   Method: Telephone survey data collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor
   Surveillance System were used to measure self-reports of drinking and
   heavy episodic drinking in the 30 days before the interview. The sample
   (N = 57,758) comprised cases collected in six states in 5 selected
   years. Monthly variability in self-reported alcohol consumption was
   evaluated by logistic regression analysis, using "deviation from means
   coding" for the month of interview, with background variables and year
   of interview controlled and state-level clustering adjusted.
   Results: Adults were significantly more likely to report past 30-day
   alcohol consumption when interviewed during the month of January and
   less likely to report consumption when interviewed during March.
   Respondents were also more likely to report heavy episodic drinking
   during the month of July. Despite large differences in alcohol
   consumption between male and female participants, these seasonal
   patterns were essentially the same for bath genders.
   Conclusions: The findings suggest that assessments of alcohol
   consumption that do not consider seasonal variation may be biased. In
   order to minimize this bias, it is recommended that researchers avoid
   collecting data only during these particular times of the year or extend
   the data collection interval and control for seasonal variability.

AB Jails and prisons have become a final destination for persons with
   severe mental illness in America. Addiction, homelessness, and
   fragmentation of services have contributed to the problem, and have
   underscored the need for new models of service delivery. Project Link is
   a university-led consortium of five community agencies in Monroe County,
   New York that spans healthcare, social service and criminal justice
   systems. The program features a mobile treatment team with a forensic
   psychiatrist, a dual diagnosis treatment residence, and culturally
   competent staff. This paper discusses the importance of service
   integration in preventing jail and hospital recidivism, and describes
   steps that Project Link has taken towards integrating healthcare,
   criminal justice, and social services. Results from a preliminary
   evaluation suggest that Project Link may be effective in reducing
   recidivism and in improving community adjustment among severely mentally
   ill patients with histories of arrest and incarceration.

   Employing data from a 1995-1996 nationwide survey of land-grant

   investigate the relative importance of 19 sources of influence on
   agricultural scientists engaged in six research areas:
   productionist-oriented, sustainable agriculture, environmental, basic,
   consumer-oriented, and rural community-oriented. The first objective of
   this paper is to revisit and assess many of Busch and Lacy's findings
   about the influences on land-grant agricultural scientists. I find that
   different types of land-grant research are influenced by distinct
   combinations of factors. The second major objective is to extend Busch
   and Lacy's work by spotlighting the significant influences on
   sustainable agriculture research. My multivariate findings show that
   this research appears to exhibit influences that reflect its dual

   collected in 1995 to examine the implications of mother's work,
   childhood place of residence, and exposure to the media for
   breast-feeding patterns (exclusivity and intensity) in Nigeria and
   Uganda. Nigeria and Uganda present an interesting contrast because
   Nigeria is more modernized and economically developed than Uganda, thus
   providing a good indication of the influence of modernization on
   breast-feeding patterns. Mother's work status is defined by considering
   whether mothers earned cash from work and took their children to work,
   hence emphasizing the compatibility of work with child care. Work least
   compatible with child care had a negative effect on breast-feeding
   intensity in Nigeria. The negative effect of mother's work on exclusive
   breast-feeding (that is, if the mothers used formula or milk instead)
   observed for some working mothers in Nigeria and Uganda was partly
   confounded by urban residence, exposure to media, and other
   socioeconomic factors. Mother's work did not have a negative effect on
   breast-feeding intensity in Uganda. The relationship between mother's
   work, urban residence, media exposure, and breast-feeding practice seems
   to be stronger in Nigeria than Uganda.

AB Using data from a survey administered to a representative sample of

   prenatal care and infant health outcomes are associated with family
   poverty and neighborhood poverty. The results show that infant health
   outcomes are unrelated to both family poverty and neighborhood poverty,
   despite the association of family poverty with the adequacy of prenatal
   care and the content of prenatal care. However, the poverty paradigm
   does receive some support using measures of participation in government
   programs that serve the low-income population. Women who rely on the
   government to fund their medical care are more likely than women who
   rely on private health insurance to have an infant death. They are also
   less likely to receive the highest levels of prenatal care. Nonetheless,
   targeted government programs ran have an ameliorative impact. The
   analysis shows that participants in the Women, Infants, and Children
   (WIC) program are more likely than non-participants to receive superior
   levels of prenatal care and are less likely to have negative infant
   health outcomes.

AB Using data from the Puerto Rican Maternal and Infant Health Study, we
   investigate the implications of family income and insurance status for
   well-baby care among mainland Puerto Ricans. Given the socioeconomic
   disadvantage of Puerto Ricans, it is critical to understand the extent
   to which low income and lack of health insurance create barriers to
   well-baby care and result in low utilization. The analysis shows that
   the income-to-needs ratio is related to barriers to well-baby care, and
   a key intervening factor is insurance status. The odds of reporting any
   barriers to care are lowest among those with both adequate income and
   private health insurance. Access to insurance is also vital in achieving
   adequate well-baby care. Uninsured children receive inadequate care more
   often than children with public or private insurance, especially when
   their income is also low, Children with public insurance are as likely
   as children with private insurance to receive an adequate number of
   well-baby visits, despite the fact that their mothers report more
   barriers to care.

PY 2001
AB In a 1989 Family Planning Study in Iran, 40 percent of the married women
   of reproductive age reported that their last or current pregnancies were
   unwanted and unintended. This finding is consistent with the results
   obtained from a number of studies undertaken in the countries of North
   Africa and the Middle East. Although the phenomenon of unwanted
   pregnancy is a significant topic in the population studies, it has
   received very little attention. This paper shows the differences between
   two groups: group A, those married women who reported that their last or
   current pregnancies were wanted, and group B, those married women who
   reported that their last or current pregnancies were unwanted. The
   findings of this study clearly show significant differences between
   these two groups in regard to some key sociodemographic attributes:
   wife/husband's education, actual and desired fertility, wife's current
   age, past and present practice of contraceptive methods, and extent of
   satisfaction with family planning services are among the attributes
   differentiating these two groups. Our examination of these variables
   suggests that group B had higher parity, fertility, less desire for more
   children, less use of contraceptive techniques, and less satisfaction
   with the efficiency of the contraceptive techniques than group A. The
   relationship between education and wanted/unwanted pregnancies is mixed.
   The urban women who wanted pregnancies and were 25 years old or older
   were more educated than those who did not want pregnancies. On the
   contrary, the rural women whose pregnancies were not wanted were more
   educated than those who wanted pregnancies regardless of age, parity,
   and locality differences. Furthermore, the urban/rural women with
   different levels of parities who did not want to be pregnant were more
   educated than the urban/rural women who wanted pregnancies. Finally, the
   standardized regression coefficients, obtained in logistic regression,
   reveal that among urban women the desire for more children and parity
   are the first and second most significant independent variables
   differentiating between group A and group B. Among rural women, living
   children and the desire for more children were the first and second most
   important variables differentiating between group A and group B.

AB Using Hubei province as a case study, this paper retests the detachment
   hypothesis against the three conventional hypotheses regarding
   migration-fertility linkage (i.e., selectivity, disruption, and
   adaptation hypotheses) in explaining migrant and non-migrant fertility
   differentials in China. The analysis of yearly order-specific birth
   probabilities suggests that temporary migrants exhibit a significantly
   higher probability of having a second or higher order birth than
   comparable permanent migrants and non-migrants. This higher fertility
   among temporary migrants occurs after migration; temporary migrants
   actually do not differ from non-migrants in fertility before migration.
   But permanent migrants experience no significant change in their
   fertility after migration. The results lend a strong support to the
   detachment hypothesis, which best explains the fertility differentials
   between migrant and non-migrant populations in contemporary China; the
   separation of temporary migrants' actual residence from their official
   one does lead to a greater likelihood among temporary migrants to have
   unplanned births.

   very different world. His sociology is nor grounded in individuals, nor
   does it focus only on religious beliefs and institutions. Instead it
   emphasizes the distinction between tribes and cities as forms of social
   organization, the importance of Al 'Assabiyya or "group-feeling" in
   social life, and the special role of Islam in transforming that feeling.
   This locates religious individualism and institutionalism at distinct
   points in an historical cycle throwing new light on debates about
   religious authority, popular religion, and secularization. It also
   highlights the connections between religion and ethnicity-helping us
   understand key late 20th-century phenomena.

AB White-on-black violence was a fact of life in the Deep South during the
   decades straddling the turn of the century. Yet though the lynching of
   blacks is historically significant, it was, statistically speaking, a
   relatively rare event. While each lynching is associated with a complex
   and often gruesome narrative, particularities often overwhelm efforts to
   reveal anything other than broad structural determinants or proximate
   causes. Efforts to apply narrative methods have been limited to the
   analysis of a single lynching incident, and yield more insight into
   patterns of interaction than into the phenomena of lynching as a whole.
   This article offers a new analytic description of the temporal structure
   of local lynching histories in the Deep South between 1882 and 1930.
   Sequential analysis reveals robust variation in the temporal pattern of
   local lynching; interpretation of the finite set of patterns of lynching
   histories focuses on the sequential consequences of various microlevel
   mechanisms, and demonstrates the advantages of moving beyond the
   analysis of discrete incidents.

AB Over the past three decades, there has been a growing interest in
   religion's special meaning-making function. At the same time, scholars
   have become increasingly sensitive to the fact that the meanings evoked
   by religious symbols, stories, and practices are not universally shared
   and that they vary by social context. To date, sociologists of religion
   interested in the problem of shared meaning have not employed methods
   that can bring together diverse religious meanings and social settings
   in the same research design. As a result, their work has produced few
   empirical generalizations upon which a long-term research agenda might
   be built. In other subdisciplines, such as cultural sociology,
   researchers have employed new quantitative methods that can empirically
   connect variations in cultural meanings to variations in social context.
   This article calls for importing these methodological advances into the
   sociological study of religious meaning.

AB Although England has a rich tradition of social and political thought,
   sociology does not figure strongly in this tradition. Several
   influential accounts-such as those by Noel Annan, Philip Abrams, and
   Perry Anderson-exist to explain this fact. I examine these accounts and,
   while largely agreeing with the explanations, question whether we should
   accept the authors' conclusions. In particular, we need to ask whether
   England was so different from other countries in this respect. Moreover,
   even if sociology was weak in England, does this mean that the
   contribution of English social theory was also weak? What alternative
   traditions of social thought might exist? In examining the English case,
   we may get some insight not just into the "peculiarities of the English"
   but also into the way in which the history of sociology has come to be
   written and into some of the assumptions underlying the nature of
   sociology as a discipline.

AB In Collins's latest book, we see an attempt to apply his sociological
   theories to the history of philosophy. While Collins's marcrosociology
   of knowledge provides important insights into the role of conflict in an
   intellectual field, his microsociology is more problematic. In
   particular. Collins's micro theory ignores the fundamental importance of
   social interpretations. This leads him to use a vague and unproductive
   notion of emotions. Nevertheless, we can usefully apply Collins's
   findings to sociological theory itself As in philosophy we see the same
   competitive appropriation and elaboration of accumulated intellectual
   capital and the same struggle over the limited resources necessary to
   intellectual production, especially over what Collins calls the
   intellectual attention space.

AB This empirical study commemorates Durkheim's contribution to suicidology
   by reviewing his own and his followers' formulation of the relationship
   between the business cycle and suicide. Three distinctive sociological
   theories of suicide, including Durkeim's, were identified to link the
   suicide rate to the socioeconomic environment of the society. A
   real-income hypothesis of suicide was developed to capture (a) the
   positive impact of the economy on suicide, (b) the curvilinear impact of
   the economy on suicide implied by Durkheim's proposition, and (3) the
   interplay of both economic and sociological variables on suicide.
   Another implication from the reformulation is that there may exist a
   positive natural rate of suicide for anl:society. These two hypothesis
   were tested using the 1990 census data for the continental states of the
   United States. Some conclusions and suggestions were drawn for future

AB Objective: This study examines monthly variation in reports of recent
   alcohol consumption behavior. Method: Telephone survey data collected by
   the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to measure
   self-reports of drinking and heavy episodic drinking in the 30 days
   before the interview. The sample (N = 57,758) comprised cases collected
   in six states in 5 selected years. Monthly variability in self-reported
   alcohol consumption was evaluated by logistic regression analysis, using
   "deviation from means coding" for the month of interview, with
   background variables and year of interview controlled and state-level
   clustering adjusted. Results: Adults were significantly more likely to
   report past 30-day alcohol consumption when interviewed during the month
   of January and less likely to report consumption when interviewed during
   March. Respondents were also more likely to report heavy episodic
   drinking during the month of July. Despite large differences in alcohol
   consumption between male and female participants, these seasonal
   patterns were essentially the same for both genders. Conclusions: The
   findings suggest that assessments of alcohol consumption that do not
   consider seasonal variation may be biased. In order to minimize this
   bias, it is recommended that researchers avoid collecting data only
   during these particular times of the year or extend the data collection
   interval and control for seasonal variability.

AB Context Vehicle exhaust is a major source of ozone and other air
   pollutants. Although high ground-level ozone pollution is associated
   with transient increases in asthma morbidity, the impact of citywide
   transportation changes on air quality and childhood asthma has not been
   studied. The alternative transportation strategy implemented during the
   1996 Summer Olympic Games in Atlanta, Ga, provided such an opportunity.
   Objective To describe traffic changes in Atlanta, Ca, during the 1996
   Summer Olympic Games and concomitant changes in air quality and
   childhood asthma events.
   Design Ecological study comparing the 17 days of the Olympic Games (July
   19-August 4, 1996) to a baseline period consisting of the 4 weeks before
   and 4 weeks after the Olympic Games. Setting and Subjects Children aged
   1 to 16 years who resided in the 5 central counties of metropolitan
   Atlanta and whose data were captured in 1 of 4 databases.
   Main Outcome Measures Citywide acute care visits and hospitalizations
   for asthma (asthma events) and nonasthma events, concentrations of major
   air pollutants, meteorological variables, and traffic counts.
   Results During the Olympic Games, the number of asthma acute care events
   decreased 41.6% (4.23 vs 2.47 daily events) in the Georgia Medicaid
   claims file, 44.1% (1.36 vs 0.76 daily events) in a health maintenance
   organization database, 11.1% (4.77 vs 4.24 daily events) in 2 pediatric
   emergency departments, and 19.1% (2.04 vs 1.65 daily hospitalizations)
   in the Georgia Hospital Discharge Database. The number of nonasthma
   acute care events in the 4 databases changed -3.1%, +1.3%, -2.1%, and
   +1.0%, respectively. In multivariate regression analysis, only the
   reduction in asthma events recorded in the Medicaid database was
   significant (relative risk, 0.48; 95% confidence interval, 0.44-0.86).
   Peak daily ozone concentrations decreased 27.9%, from 81.3 ppb during
   the baseline period to 58.6 ppb during the Olympic Games (P<.001). Peak
   weekday morning traffic counts dropped 22.5% (P<.001). Traffic counts
   were significantly correlated with that day's peak ozone concentration
   (average r=0.36 for all 4 roads examined). Meteorological conditions
   during the Olympic Games did not differ substantially from the baseline
   period.
   Conclusions Efforts to reduce downtown traffic congestion in Atlanta
   during the Olympic Games resulted in decreased traffic density,
   especially during the critical morning period. This was associated with
   a prolonged reduction in ozone pollution and significantly lower rates
   of childhood asthma events. These data provide support for efforts to
   reduce air pollution and improve health via reductions in motor vehicle
   traffic.

AB In this paper we examine the effects of ethnicity on the gene flow
   between two groups living in Limon, Costa Rica. Our main interest is to
   determine if ethnicity has acted as a barrier to the exchange of genes,
   and if the groups have remained distinct genetically. We report the
   admixture estimates, F-st values, and inbreeding coefficients of the two
   samples. The data consist of blood samples and surnames obtained from
   375 individuals. The subjects' two surnames were analyzed to determine
   the ethnicity of their parents (individuals carry their father's and
   mother's first surnames). We used the formula of Crow and Mange ([1965]
   Eugen Q 12:199 -203) to compute F-t, F-n, and F-x with the surnames.
   Admixture estimates were computed for both groups using the computer
   program ADMIX.PAS kindly provided by Jeffrey Long. The estimates for the
   Hispanic-Limonense group are M1 = 0.5866 European, M2 = 0.3383
   Amerindian, and M3 = 0.0751 African ancestry. For the Afro-Limonense
   group, the admixture estimates indicate M1 = 0.1047 European, M2 =
   0.1357 Amerindian, and M3 = 0.7595 African ancestry. The F-st values are
   F-st = 0.00558 for the Hispanic group and F-st = 0.05137 for the
   Afro-Limonense group. These F-st values indicate that the Afro-Limonense
   group has experienced more genetic drift than has the other group,
   possibly as a result of its long history of isolation in Costa Rica.
   Indeed, when plotted along a scaled eigenvector R matrix of Caribbean
   gene frequencies, the two Limonense groups did not cluster with each
   other. Thus we conclude that the two ethnic groups have remained
   distinct breeding populations. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

   Methods. Data were derived from the CARDIA study, a cohort of 5115
   healthy adults aged 18 to 30 years at baseline (1985-1986) and recruited
   from the populations of 4 US cities. Respondents were followed over 10
   years.
   Results. Among 3950 respondents reexamined in 1995-1996, 20% of Whites
   and 33% of African Americans were smokers, as compared with 25% and 32%,
   respectively, in 1985-1986. On average, African Americans were of lower
   socioeconomic status. Ten-year regular smoking initiation rates for
   African American women, White women, African American men, and White men
   were 7.1%, 3.5%,13.2%, and 5.1%, respectively, and the corresponding
   cessation rates were 25%,35.1%,19.2%, and 31.3%. After adjustment for
   socioeconomic factors, most 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios
   for regular smoking initiation and cessation in African Americans vs

AB Objectives. The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term
   effects of television advertisements from the Florida "truth" campaign
   on rates of smoking initiation.
   Methods. A follow-up survey of young people aged 12 to 17 years (n =
   -1820) interviewed during the first 6 months of the advertising campaign
   was conducted. Logistic regression analyses were used to estimate the
   independent effects of the campaign on smoking initiation while other
   factors were controlled for.
   Results. Youths scoring at intermediate and high levels on a media
   effect index were less likely to initiate smoking than youths who could
   not confirm awareness of television advertisements. Adjusted odds ratios
   between the media index and measures of initiation were similar within
   categories of age, sex, susceptibility, and whether a parent smoked.
   Conclusions. Exposure to the "truth" media campaign lowered the risk of
   youth smoking initiation. However, the analysis did not demonstrate that
   all such media programs will be effective.

   elements of social learning and social exchange theories. Respondents
   were asked to indicate their frequency of use for 18 agricultural
   production practices that could be adopted on Midwestern farms at the
   time of the study. Responses to the 18 items were summed to form a
   composite variable, termed "conservation production index," for use as
   the dependent variable in multivariate analysis. Eleven independent
   variables were identified from the theory as likely predictors of
   conservation adoption, including respondents' perceptions about
   production costs, output and risks, and perceived importance of access
   to subsidies, technical assistance, and informational/educational
   programs. Regression analysis was used to assess the performance of the
   independent variables in explaining variance in the conservation
   production index. Explained variance in the three regression models
   ranged from 2% in the Minnesota watershed to 19% in the Ohio watershed.
   The researchers concluded that the model had limited utility in

   constructed as "cultureless" among white youth in two high schools: one
   predominantly white, the other multiracial. The author proposes that
   whites assert racial superiority by claiming they have no culture
   because to be cultureless implies that one is either the "norm" (the
   standard by which others are judged) or "rational" (developmentally
   advanced). Drawing on ethnographic research and in-depth interviews, the
   author argues that in the majority-white school, processes of
   naturalization-the embedding of historically constituted practices in
   what feels "normal" and natural-produced feelings of cultural lack among
   white students. Contrarily at the multiracial school, tracking and
   add-on multiculturalism helped constitute cultureless identities through
   processes of rationalization-the embedding of whiteness within a Western
   rational paradigm that subordinates all things cultural. The
   implications of these findings for critical white studies, sociology of
   education, and racial identity formation are discussed.

AB Purpose-Interest in the effects of neighbourhood or local area social
   characteristics on health has increased in recent years, but to date the
   existing evidence has not been systematically reviewed. Multilevel or
   contextual analyses of social factors and health represent a possible
   reconciliation between two divergent epidemiological
   paradigms-individual risk factor epidemiology and an ecological
   approach.
   Data sources-Keyword searching of Index Medicus (Medline) and additional
   references from retrieved articles.
   Study selection-All original studies of the effect of local area social
   characteristics on individual health outcomes, adjusted for individual
   socioeconomic status, published in English before 1 June 1998 and
   focused on populations in developed countries.
   Data synthesis-The methodological challenges posed by the design and
   interpretation of multilevel studies of local area effects are discussed
   and results summarised with reference to type of health outcome. All but
   two of the 25 reviewed studies reported a statistically significant
   association between at least one measure of social environment and a
   health outcome (contextual effect), after adjusting for individual level
   socioeconomic status (compositional effect). Contextual effects were
   generally modest and much smaller than compositional effects.
   Conclusions-The evidence for modest neighbourhood effects on health is
   fairly consistent despite heterogeneity of study designs, substitution
   of local area measures for neighbourhood measures and probable
   measurement error. By drawing public health attention to the health
   risks associated with the social structure and ecology of
   neighbourhoods, innovative approaches to community level interventions
   may ensue.

AB The proportion of foreign-born tuberculosis patients in the United
   States is increasing. To analyze the epidemiology of tuberculosis in
   foreign-born people, culture-positive patients with tuberculosis in
   Houston, Texas, were interviewed from October 1995 through September
   1998, and their isolates were molecularly characterized. Of the 1131
   patients included in the study, 795 (70.3%) were US born and 336 (29.7%)
   were foreign born. The decrease in tuberculosis case rate among US-born
   people was 3.5 times that of foreign-born people. Significantly more
   US-born than foreign-born patients belonged to strain clusters (71.3%
   vs. 29.5%; P < .001). Risk factors associated with strain clustering
   were as follows: black ethnicity, low income, and homelessness in
   US-born patients and homelessness in foreign-born patients. Isolates
   from foreign-born patients were more likely to be resistant to <greater
   than or equal to>1 drug (15.4% vs. 8.4%;) P = .001 and to be multidrug
   resistant (2.4% vs. 0.7%; P = .027) than isolates from US-born patients.
   These observations warrant increased emphasis on this distinct
   subpopulation of tuberculosis patients.

AB Objective: To determine the effectiveness of an intervention designed to
   improve outcomes for infants and toddlers in foster care. Method:
   Records were reviewed for all children who were adjudicated as in need
   of care in a specific parish in Louisiana between 1991 and 1998. This
   period included 4 years before and 4 years after a comprehensive
   intervention was implemented. Children adjudicated between 1991 and 1994
   were the comparison group, and those adjudicated between 1995 and 1998
   were the intervention group. Results: After the intervention, more
   children were freed far adoption and fewer children were returned to
   their birth families than before the intervention. There was no
   difference in length of time in care before and after the intervention.
   With regard to the same child returning in a subsequent incident of
   maltreatment, relative risk reduction for the intervention group ranged
   from 53% to 68%. With regard to the same mother maltreating another
   child subsequently, relative risk reduction for the intervention group
   ranged from 63% to 75%. Conclusions: A comprehensive preventive
   intervention for maltreated infants and toddlers in foster care
   substantially reduced rates of recidivism but had no effect on length of
   time in care.

SO JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN DENTAL ASSOCIATION
VL 132

BP 216
EP 222
PD FEB 2001
PY 2001
AB Background. Although a substantial decline in dental caries has occurred
   among U.S. children, not everyone has benefited equally. The first-ever
   surgeon general's report on oral health in America indicates that the
   burden of oral diseases is found in poor Americans. This study
   investigates the relationship between community socioeconomic status, or
   SES, and dental health of children.
   Methods. An oral health survey of 17,256 children, representing 93
   percent of children residing in 62 Tennessee communities, was conducted
   in public elementary schools during the 1996-1997 school year. Portable
   dental equipment was used far examinations, and data from each
   examination were entered directly into a laptop computer. The authors
   performed analyses of covariance to examine the relationship between
   community SES (low/medium/high) and dental health, controlling for
   community fluoridation.
   Results. Community SES was significantly related to caries experience in
   the primary teeth, the proportion of untreated caries in the primary and
   permanent teeth, dental treatment needs, dental sealants and incisor
   trauma. Overall, dental health was Significantly worse for low-SES
   communities than for medium- and high-SES communities.
   Conclusion. The authors conclude that all specific dental indexes used
   to measure children's dental health in this study, with the exceptions
   of caries experience in the permanent teeth and sealant presence, were
   inversely related to the communities' SES. The percentage of children
   with dental sealants was directly related to the community's SES.
   Practice Implications. Further improvements in oral health will
   necessitate that community-based preventive programs and access to
   quality dental care be made available to children who are identified as
   being at highest risk of experiencing oral disease.

AB Recent demographic events in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania illustrate
   that an end to the decades-long decline in numbers of inhabitants may
   soon be at an end. For those familiar with the local efforts at
   redevelopment, the glimmer of hope is no surprise. Indeed, the
   Pottsville Republican's weekly vignettes, "Defying Out-migration,"
   feature young adults returning to the county to work simply because it
   is their home and they want to live there again. Although this study
   recognizes the significance of that migration, it focuses on the trends
   among the aged. The data on the retired migrants have been collected at
   senior clubs and senior residences throughout the county. Retired
   in-migrants are studied in terms of their place of birth, educational
   attainment, marital status, occupation, and places of residence at the
   time of retirement (immediately before and after coming to Schuylkill).
   For those who are identified as return migrants, the reasons they left
   and returned are examined. To seek employment was foremost in their
   flight, whereas family ties and Schuylkill County's environment and
   society were the major pulls in their return.

AB Context Racial disparities in health care delivery and outcomes may be
   due to differences in health care access and, therefore, may be
   mitigated in an equal-access health care system. Few studies have
   examined racial differences in health outcomes in such a system.
   Objective To study racial differences in mortality among patients
   admitted to hospitals in the Veterans Affairs (VA) system, a health care
   system that potentially offers equal access to care.
   Design, Setting, and Participants Cohort study of 28934 white and 7575
   black men admitted to 147 VA hospitals for 1 of 6 common medical
   diagnoses (pneumonia, angina, congestive heart failure, chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and chronic renal failure)
   between October 1, 1995, and September 30, 1996.
   Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was 30-day mortality
   among black compared with white patients. Secondary outcome measures
   were in-hospital mortality and 6-month mortality.
   Results Overall mortality at 30 days was 4.5% in black patients and 5.8%
   in white patients (relative risk [RR], 0.77; 95% confidence interval
   [CI], 0.69-0.87; P = .001). Mortality was lower among blacks for each of
   the 6 medical diagnoses. Multivariate adjustment for patient and
   hospital characteristics had a small effect (RR, 0.75; 95% CI,
   0.66-0.85; P < .001). Black patients also had lower adjusted in-hospital
   and 6-month mortality. These findings were consistent among all
   subgroups evaluated.
   Conclusions Black patients admitted to VA hospitals with common medical
   diagnoses have lower mortality rates than white patients. The survival
   advantage of black patients is not readily explained; however, the
   absence of a survival disadvantage for blacks may reflect the benefits
   of equal access to health care and the quality of inpatient treatment at
   VA medical centers.

AB In this paper, we present a cultural evolutionary model in which norms
   for cooperation and punishment are acquired via two cognitive
   mechanisms: (1) payoff-biased transmission a tendency to copy the most
   successful individual; and (2) conformist transmission-a tendency to
   copy the most frequent behavior in the population. We first show that if
   a finite number of punishment stages is permitted (e.g. two stages of
   punishment occur if some individuals punish people who fail to punish
   non-cooperators), then an arbitrarily small amount of conformist
   transmission will stabilize cooperative behavior by stabilizing
   punishment at some n-th stage. We then explain how, once cooperation is
   stabilized in one group, it may spread through a multi-group population
   via cultural group selection. Finally, once cooperation is prevalent, we
   show how prosocial genes favoring cooperation and punishment may invade
   in the wake of cultural group selection. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

   relative leg length are associated with significant (p < 0.01)
   differences in poverty income ratio. Conversely, differences in sitting
   height are not reflected in differences in poverty income ratio. This
   finding suggests that the influence of environmental factors is greater

   decreasing its impact on the environment. Monsanto will continue to use
   the tools of genetic modification for crop improvement, combining
   germplasm, biotech traits, and agronomic solutions to offer products and
   systems that will not only benefit producers, but also offer benefits to
   processors and consumers. As the true, scientifically-based benefits of

AB Geography, as the discipline responsible for describing the organization
   of space, has developed several ways of dealing with the phenomenon of
   the central city and its surrounding hinterlands. One of the most
   prominent of models used is von Thunen's Isolated State: a predictive
   model of how rural hinterlands organize agricultural production in
   relation to an urban center. Despite today's globalized Food
   provisioning system, there are still some agricultural commodities that
   remain in U.S. city hinterlands, The most prominent of these is milk.
   The spatial organization of dairying is therefore a topic in which von
   Thunen's notions of centrality are still pertinent. In addition, outside
   of geography, his ideas had a significant effect on the agricultural
   economists who formulated dairy marketing policy. This paper will
   examine von Thunen and notions of centrality in the Formulation of dairy
   policy in the United Stares. His contribution has been very important to
   agricultural economists and agricultural geographers but less important
   to sociologists of agriculture, who see the spatial organization of food
   production around cities due as much to contingent, local political
   outcomes as to law-like notions of centrality. Comparative historical
   method in sociology has been particularly useful in determining the role
   of predictive models and contingency in determining the spatial
   organization of milksheds.

AB Previous anthropological studies identified significant interpopulation
   consistencies in the frequency and symptoms of adult depression,
   anxiety, and schizophrenia. Tests of the degree of variation of such
   behavioral phenomena across contemporary populations are significant for
   the study of human evolution because universality or near universality
   suggests specific evolved aspects of human behavior. The aim of this
   research was to provide a preliminary test of whether cross-cultural
   consistencies in symptomatology associated with some psychiatric
   conditions are observable in children as they are in adults. We tested
   for interpopulation variation in degrees (intensity and frequency) of
   anxiety, depression, withdrawal, and somatization symptomatology in
   normal samples of children. Psychometric ratings scales allowed
   assessment of characteristic symptomatology of each child in the
   different contexts of home and school. The study populations comprised
   1,208 6-11-year-old children from the Paisa community in Antioquia,
   Colombia, and African-American, Euro-American, and Hispanic children in
   the United States. We found interpopulation consistencies in some
   aspects of child behavioral symptomatology, especially depression and
   withdrawal. Mean degrees of symptomatology and percentages of children
   with clinically significant levels of symptomatology were consistent for
   both across populations, in home and school contexts, and for both girls
   and boys. Anxiety and somatization displayed more cross-cultural
   variability in expression. These patterns are in accordance with current
   understandings of cross-cultural variability and universals of adult
   psychiatric symptomatology. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB For more than a decade, sociologists of religion have been debating the
   answer to a basic question: What is the relationship between religious
   pluralism and religious vitality? The old wisdom was that the
   relationship was negative, that pluralism undermines vitality. This view
   has been challenged by advocates of a supply-side model of religious
   vitality. They argue that the relationship is positive-that pluralism
   increases vitality-and this empirical claim has become foundational to
   the larger project of applying economic theory to religion. We review
   the relevant evidence and reach a straightforward conclusion: The
   empirical evidence does not support the claim that religious pluralism
   is positively associated with religious participation in any general
   sense. We discuss this conclusion's theoretical implications, and we
   identify potentially productive directions for future research on
   religious pluralism, church-state relations, and religious competition.

AB The distinctive contribution of sociological social psychology cars be
   referred to as sociological miniaturism, a way of interpreting social
   processes and institutions that is microsociological more than it is
   psychological. We argue that social psychology of this variety permits
   the examination of large-scale social issues by means of investigation
   of small-scale social situations. The power of this approach to social
   life is that it permits recognition of the dense texture of everyday
   life, permits sociologists to understand more fully a substantive
   domain, and permits interpretive control. In the chapter we provide
   examples of this approach from two quite distinct theoretical
   orientations: symbolic interactionism and social exchange theory. We
   discuss the ways in which the study of two substantive topics, social
   power and collective identity, using these perspectives can be informed
   by closer collaboration between theorists within sociological social
   psychology. In the end it is our hope that pursuing such integrative
   theoretical and methodological efforts will produce a more complete
   understanding of important social phenomena. We offer sociological
   miniaturism as a promising vehicle for advancing the earlier call for
   greater mutual appreciation of and rapprochement between diverse lines
   of social psychological work in sociology.

   three timepoints during the first year of life. Individual Growth Models
   were applied to four activity variables: Self-feeding, Sleeping in Own

   that infants' time spent on Self-feeding and Sleeping in Own Room
   increased substantially in both groups across the first year. However,
   the Growth rate of Self-feeding differed according to infants' cultural
   background and gender, whereas the increasing rate of Sleeping in Own
   Room varied as a function of both culture and maternal working hours
   each week. Multiparty and Dyadic Interaction were stable over time.
   However, Puerto Rican infants on average spent more time in Multiparty
   Interactions than did Anglo infants. In terms of their social contacts,
   Puerto Rican infants spent more time with relatives than did Anglo
   infants. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

   107 girls, rang,ng In age from 8 to 11, completed a measure designed to
   assess five facets of a media influence previously conceptualized by
   researchers. Results: Three distinct scales emerged, which appeared to
   focus on concepts defined as internalization, awareness, and pressure.
   Correlations between subscales of the Multidimensional Media influence
   Scale (MMIS) and the Eating Disorder inventory-Body Dissatisfaction
   subscale were significant for both boys and girls. Girls had higher
   levels on all three subscales and regression analyses indicated that the
   MMIS scores predicted 30% of the variance associated with body
   dissatisfaction for girls, but an R-2 of only .10 emerged for boys.
   Internalization levels predicted significant variance beyond that
   explained by awareness and pressures, but only for the female sample.
   Discussion: The findings are discussed with regard to the usefulness of
   the MMIS for future research and the role of internalization as a risk
   factor for the development of body image disturbances and eating
   disorders. (C) 2000 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

   Method: We examined 115 male centerfold models in Playgirl magazine from
   1973 to 1997. Using the models' heights and weights quoted by the
   magazine, together with visual estimates of body fat, we calculated the
   body mass index (BMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) of each model.
   Results: The Playgirl centerfold models became increasingly "dense" and
   more muscular over time as indicated by the significant correlations
   between BMI, FFMI, and year of publication. Discussion: These
   observations, in combination with previous studies, suggest that
   cultural norms of the ideal male body are growing increasingly muscular.

   from 1257 couples to examine the socioeconomic and sociodemographic
   characteristics of married men and women and their communication with

   importance of a wide range of socioeconomic, behavioural and
   biodemographic factors in the determination of child mortality in Mall,
   with a special focus on maternal education and behaviour. The central
   hypothesis of the study is that advances in maternal education would
   contribute little to child survival in settings such as Mall's urban and
   rural communities where progress in educational attainment is not
   matched with improvements in other aspects of socioeconomic development
   such as economic growth, job creation, financial security and public
   health and medical resources. Units of analysis are children born in the
   past 5 years to DHS respondents (women aged 15-45) who were married at
   the time of the survey. The Cox proportional hazards regression
   technique has been used to estimate the net effects of variables
   included as covariates. The findings indicate that the health-seeking
   behaviour of the mother matters more than maternal education in
   explaining the observed differences in infant and child mortality in
   Mall's urban and rural areas.

AB Against the backdrop of a high prevalence of the human immunodeficiency
   virus infection in Zimbabwe, this paper analyses data from the 1997
   Zimbabwe Sexual Behaviour and Condom Use Survey to throw light on the
   degree to which sexually active adults consistently use condoms in
   high-risk sexual situations. The multivariate results indicate that at
   the time of the survey, consistent condom use in non-marital
   relationships is significantly higher for males than females, higher
   among those who had access to information about condoms from multiple
   sources than among those with limited access, and higher among those who
   have positive attitudes to condoms than among those with negative
   attitudes. Even though consistent condom use with non-marital partners
   is higher for those who know a source where condoms can be obtained,
   this effect is due to the fact that these respondents have more positive
   attitudes towards condoms. Likewise, the higher levels of consistent
   condom use exhibited by those who are aware of the efficacy of condoms
   are due to the fact that men have higher awareness of this, and men use
   condoms more consistently than women. In sum, the results suggest that
   the effects of the respondents' sex and their knowledge of the
   prophylactic importance of condoms and where condoms might be obtained
   are a function of other socioeconomic advantages they have. It is,
   therefore, concluded that programmes that use mass media information,
   education and communication campaigns to reduce shyness, embarrassment
   and stigma about condom use can help increase consistent use of condoms
   in non-marital relationships in Zimbabwe.

AB Human breast milk is primarily colostrum immediately following birth.
   Colostrum gradually changes to mature milk over the next several days.
   The role of colostrum in fighting infections and promoting growth and
   development of the newborn is widely acknowledged. This role is mediated
   by differences across cultures in the acceptability of colostrum and the
   prevalence of colostrum feeding. This study examined the prevalence of
   colostrum feeding and time to initiation of breast-feeding in 143 rural
   Bangladeshi women in Matlab thana. Structured interviews were collected
   during a 9-month prospective study conducted in 1993. Women were usually
   interviewed within 4 days of giving birth and were asked about whether
   or not they fed their child colostrum and the number of hours until they
   began breast-feeding the baby. Ninety per cent of the mothers reported
   feeding their newborn colostrum. A logistic regression found no effect
   on the prevalence of colostrum feeding from the following covariates:
   mother's age, parity, history of pregnancy loss, child's sex, mother's
   self-report of delivery complications, and the time from birth to
   interview. Fifty-nine per cent of mothers initiated breast-feeding
   within 4 h, and 88% within 12 h of parturition. Survival analysis was
   used to estimate the effects of covariates on the time from delivery to
   initial breast-feeding. Time to Initial breast-feeding was delayed
   slightly, but significantly, for older mothers, for male infants, and by
   mothers who did not report delivery complications. The percentage of
   mothers who fed their child colostrum was higher, and times to initial
   breast-feeding were shorter, than almost all previous reports from South
   Asia. These findings might be explained, in part, by methodological
   differences among studies, but it is suggested that recent changes
   towards earlier initiation of breast-feeding have taken place in rural
   Bangladesh.

AB Increased total and intraabdominal fat (LAF) obesity as well as other
   metabolic conditions associated with the insulin resistance syndrome
   (IRS) are related to low levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SKBG)
   in young and older Caucasian (CAU) and young African-American (AA)
   women. We examined whether postmenopausal AA women, a population with a
   high incidence of obesity and IRS despite low IAF, would have higher
   levels of circulating SHBG compared with CAU women, and whether there
   would be negative relationships between indexes of obesity and risk
   factors associated with IRS and SHBG levels. We measured body
   composition, SHBG, free testosterone, leptin, glucose tolerance,
   insulin, and lipoprotein lipids in 55 CAU (mean +/- SD, 59 +/- 7 yr) and
   35 AA (57 +/- 6 yr) sedentary women of comparable obesity (48% body fat,
   by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry). Compared with CAU women, AA women
   had larger waist (101 vs. 96 cm), larger fat mass (44.9 +/- 8.8 vs. 39.9
   +/- 8.1 kg), larger sc fat area (552 +/- 109 vs. 452 +/- 109 cm(2)), and
   lower IAF/SC ratio (0.28 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.38 +/- 0.15; P < 0.01), but
   similar waist to hip ratio (0.83). Both groups had similar SHBG (117 vs.
   124 nmol/L) and free testosterone (3.7 vs. 3.4 pmol/L) levels, but AA
   women had a 35% higher leptin, 34% higher fasting insulin, and 39%
   greater insulin response to a glucose load (P < 0.05) compared with CAU
   women. In CAU, but not AA, women SHBG correlated negatively with body
   mass index (r = -0.28; P < 0.05), waist (r = -0.36; P = 0.01), IAF (r =
   -0.34; P = 0.01), and insulin response to oral glucose (r = -0.37; P <
   0.05) and positively with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (r =
   0.30; P = 0.03). The relationship between insulin area and SHBG in CAU
   women disappeared after adjusting for IAF, whereas the relationship
   between high density lipoprotein cholesterol and SHBG persisted after
   adjusting for IAF, but not for fat mass. Leptin was positively related
   to fat mass (P < 0.05) in both groups, but it was related to insulin
   only in the Caucasian women (P < 0.01). There was a racial difference in
   the slopes (P < 0.05) of the relationships of leptin to fat mass (P <
   0.05). Racial differences in leptin disappeared after adjustment for
   fasting insulin. These results suggest that the metabolic relationships
   between total and regional obesity, glucose, and lipid metabolism with
   SHBG in CAU women are different from those in postmenopausal obese AA
   women.

AB Major depression is a widespread, often chronic disorder affecting the
   individual, his or her family, and society as a M;hole. It incurs
   tremendous social and financial costs in the form of impaired
   relationships, lost productivity, and lost wages. Although chronic major
   depression is eminently treatable, it continues to be undertreated and
   underrecognized. This is particularly true in primary care settings,
   where physicians are usually the first to encounter chronic depression
   but are seldom trained to distinguish depression from other medical
   illnesses with similar symptoms. In addition, because of the stigma
   attached to depression, patients often characterize their symptoms as
   part of a physical illness or fail to report them to a clinician at all.
   This article discusses the epidemiology of depression, its impact and
   burden on society, and its special character (including diagnosis and
   treatment) as a chronic illness.

AB Background: In spite of impressive results in acute studies, the
   long-term treatment of major depression remains problematic. To explore
   the return of depressive symptoms and their interaction with social
   factors on long-term outcome, we assessed 55 patients whose depression
   had been treated during a 62-week, fluoxetine maintenance study, 1 year
   after the study's termination. Method: During the year following the
   study termination, patients were free to select treatment options.
   Assessments at the 1-year follow-up included measures of depressive
   symptoms (using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HAM-D]),
   social and marital impairment (using the Weissman Social Adjustment
   Scale [SAS]), personal stressors (using the Holmes Social Readjustment
   Rating Scale), and history of treatment during the past year. Results:
   At the time of the naturalistic follow-up, 53% of patients sustained
   their improvement in mood. Factors associated with return of depressive
   symptoms included personal stresses, marital maladjustment, personal
   decision to discontinue antidepressants, and medication failure.
   Psychosocial variables were associated with poor outcome in over 90% of
   impaired subjects. Development of subsyndromal symptoms during the
   50-week double-blind phase was predictive of poorer outcome at the
   long-term follow-up. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that no matter
   how effective initial pharmacologic therapy may be, without ongoing
   clinical monitoring and support, particularly in dealing with issues
   such as marriage and handling significant life stresses, and compliance
   with medications, it will not be successful in the long-term treatment
   for a significant portion of patients with depression.

AB Quantitative sociology has grown by borrowing methods from the
   experimental sciences even though, for the most part, our data are
   observational. Where the procedures of experimental science can be
   applied, data analysis can exploit simplifying assumptions because good
   experimental design removes correlations among independent variables
   that exist nature, outside the experiment, as well as effects of
   unmeasured variables. Where the science is, of necessity, observational,
   these simplifications can not be guaranteed and, as a result, the
   analyses reached through by use of some of the standard "workhorse"
   techniques of the statistical repertoire may not be valid and
   conclusions reached by the application of these techniques are in doubt.
   This paper explores an alternative framework for data analysis in
   quanitative sociology, bypassing the statistics associated with
   experimental methods. Specifically, it explores generalizations of the
   method and quantitative theory used by physical surveyors, generalizing
   them to the needs of observational data.
   Application of this framework to text, including editorials and free
   answers to questionnaires as well as application to (social) survey
   data, supports their its for these purposes and the cartographic methods
   suggest that micro theories embedded in these methods reduce the load of
   a priori assumptions "normally" required for both text analysis and
   survey analysis. The applications suggest a research path applicable to
   "ordinary" sociological variables, including education, income,
   occupation, and gender, that shifts the burden of argument away from
   variance explained criteria and toward an integration of theory and
   method, guided by principles of parsimony and consistency.

AB The current study examined the association between support and comfort

   in a sample of 43 HIV-positive injection drug users entering a methadone
   maintenance program. Patients with high ratings of perceived spiritual
   or religious support were abstinent from illicit drugs significantly
   longer during the first six months of methadone maintenance than were
   patients with lower ratings. Controlling for the influence of
   pretreatment variables (addiction and psychiatric severity, CD4 count,
   social support, and optimism), and during-treatment variables (methadone
   dose and attendance at counseling sessions), hierarchical regression
   analysis showed that strength of religious and spiritual support was a
   significant independent predictor of abstinence. These findings suggest
   that spirituality may be an important dimension of patient experience to
   assess in future addiction treatment outcome research.

AB Objective: There is a growing appreciation that emotional, physical and
   sexual abuse events are frequently part of the life histories of
   individuals in treatment for alcohol disorders. The present study
   examines reports of lifetime abuse in a clinical trial for treatment of
   alcohol dependency. Method: Data were obtained from baseline assessments
   conducted with participants (N = 1,726; 1,307 men) entering project
   MATCH, a multisite clinical trial conducted at nine geographically
   dispersed research sites. Differences on a broad range of participant
   characteristics were examined by gender and by reported abuse type.
   Results. More than half (59%) of the participants reported lifetime
   abuse. Women were more likely (77%) to report abuse than were men (54%).
   A lower proportion of men than women (6% vs 31%) reported experiencing
   both physical and sexual abuse. Gender differences a ere found on the
   majority of psychosocial measures. Comparisons of the psychosocial
   measures by abuse type generally indicated that participants without
   abuse histories had better functioning than did participants reporting
   abuse. Conclusions: The high frequency of lifetime abuse in this
   geographically dispersed sample underscores the necessity for including
   assessment of emotional, physical and sexual abuse with alcoholism
   treatment seeking populations. Participants reporting such events may
   require other treatment in addition to that for alcohol dependency.

AB The effects of three strategies for changing stigmatizing
   attitudes-education (which replaces myths about mental illness with
   accurate conceptions), contact (which challenges public attitudes about
   mental illness through direct interactions with persons who have these
   disorders), and protest (which seeks to suppress stigmatizing attitudes
   about mental illness)-were examined on attributions about schizophrenia
   and other severe mental illnesses. One hundred and fifty-two students at
   a community college were randomly assigned to one of the three
   strategies or a control condition. They completed a questionnaire about
   attributions toward six groups-depression, psychosis, cocaine addiction,
   mental retardation, cancer, and AIDS-prior to and after completing the
   assigned condition. As expected, results showed that education had no
   effect on attributions about physical disabilities but led to improved
   attributions in all four psychiatric groups. Contact produced positive
   changes that exceeded education effects in attributions about targeted
   psychiatric disabilities: depression and psychosis, Protest yielded no
   significant changes in attributions about any group. This study also
   examined the effects of these strategies on processing information about
   mental illness.

AB This study investigated the role of politically correct labels in
   emotional reactions, attributions regarding illness, behavioral

   undergraduate students and community members, were asked to rate a
   target individual on various scales using one of four labels varying in
   "political correctness": consumer of mental health services, person with
   severe mental illness, person with schizophrenia, and schizophrenic.
   Results showed that the label "consumer of mental health services" was
   associated with less negative reactions and was considered to be
   reflective of a condition more likely to change relative to the other,
   less politically correct labels. However, this label did not result in
   greater behavioral intention to interact with persons with a psychiatric
   disorder. Furthermore, participants receiving this label identified
   fewer symptoms associated with DSM-IV criteria of schizophrenia and were
   more likely to attribute responsibility for the condition to the target
   person, relative to the other labels.

AB In this study, the paths between two prejudicial attitudes
   (authoritarianism and benevolence) and a proxy measure of behavioral
   discrimination (social distance) were examined in a sample drawn from
   the general public, Moreover, the effects of two person variables
   (familiarity with mental illness and ethnicity) on prejudice were
   examined in the path analysis. One hundred fifty-one research
   participants completed measures of prejudice toward, social distance
   from, and familiarity with mental illness, Goodness-of-fit indexes from
   path analyses supported our hypotheses. Social distance is influenced by
   both kinds of prejudice: authoritarianism (the belief that persons with
   mental illness cannot care for themselves, so a paternalistic health
   system must do so) and benevolence (the belief that persons with mental
   illness are innocent and childlike). These forms of prejudice, in turn,
   are influenced by the believers' familiarity with mental illness and
   their ethnicity. We also discuss how these findings might contribute to
   a fuller understanding of mental illness stigma.

AB Statistical methods have had a successful half-century in sociology,
   contributing to a greatly improved standard of scientific rigor in the
   discipline. I identify three overlapping postwar generations of
   statistical methods in sociology, based on the kinds of data they
   address. The first generation, which started in the late 1940s, deals
   with cross-tabulations and focuses on measures of association and
   log-linear models, perhaps the area of statistics to which sociology has
   contributed the most. The second generation, which began in the 1960s,
   deals with unit-level survey data and focuses on LISREL-type causal
   models and event-history analysis. The third generation, starting to
   emerge in the late 1980s, deals with data that do not fall easily into
   either of these categories, either because they have a different form,
   such as texts or narratives, or because dependence is a crucial aspect,
   as with spatial or social network data. There are many new challenges,
   and the area is ripe for statistical research; several major
   institutions have recently launched new initiatives in statistics and
   the social sciences.

AB This study shows several ways that formal graph theoretic statements map
   patterns of network ties into substantive hypotheses about social
   cohesion. If network cohesion is enhanced by multiple connections
   between members of a group, for example, then the higher the global
   minimum of the number of independent paths that connect every pair of
   nodes in the network, the higher the social cohesion. The cohesiveness
   of a group is also measured by the extent to which it is not
   disconnected by removal of 1, 2, 3,..., k actors. Menger's Theorem
   proves that these two measures are equivalent. Within this graph
   theoretic framework, we evaluate various concepts of cohesion and
   establish the validity of a pair of related measures:
   1. Connectivity-the minimum number k of its actors whose removal would
   not allow the group to remain connected or would reduce the group to but
   a single member-measures the social cohesion of a group at a general
   level.
   2. Conditional density measures cohesion on a finer scale as a
   proportion of ties beyond that required for connectivity k over the
   number of ties that would force it to k + 1.
   Calibrated for successive values of k, these two measures combine into
   an aggregate measure of social cohesion, suitable for both small- and
   large-scale network studies. Using these measures to define the core of
   a new methodology of cohesive blocking, we offer hypotheses about the
   consequences of cohesive blocks for social groups and their members, and
   explore empirical examples that illustrate the significance, theoretical
   relevance, and predictiveness of cohesive blocking in a variety of
   substantively important applications in sociology.

   reveal the complex and contradictory ways that my past experiences with

AB The equality/inequality dichotomy is a central concept in sociology and
   in the study of marriage. Almost all researchers, though, use their own
   preconceived definitions and measurement strategies to identify equal
   and unequal states of affairs. An alternative approach, one that better
   accords with interactionist principles, is to privilege people's
   interpretations of equality over analysts' Drawing on interviews with
   individuals who define their own marriages as equal or unequal, I
   compare people's stories about marital equality with scholars'
   depictions. While some narratives resonate (in part) with the themes
   propounded by scholars, others do not. if people's experiences of
   equality and inequality are to be taken seriously, then it is important
   to listen to what they have to say on the subject, as well as to how
   they say it. This is the distinctive contribution symbolic
   interactionists can make to the study of inequality.

   solution to this problem is to structure an interdisciplinary course
   using not only a sociological paradigm, but also paradigms of English
   and art. This yearlong course develops the individual student's ability
   to recognize and generate a deep appreciation of multiple perspectives
   (including their own), and helps them acquire critical assessment
   skills. I recommend here an array of resources for teaching about
   resistance and change while establishing an understanding of the
   existence and causes of inequality in American society. Included in this
   battery of resources are readings, mainstream and alternative video
   media, Internet exchanges, student-produced videos, issue-oriented
   student writing, and class discussions.

AB This study reports the anthropometric characteristics of a sample of

   weight, mid-upper arm circumference, head circumference and all skinfold
   thickness were measured according to standard procedures. When compared
   with other Ecuadorian populations the children in this study were
   similar to coastal Afro-Ecuadorian children and taller than native
   children from both coastal and highland regions. When comparisons were
   made inside the community, results showed that children living in
   female-headed households are taller than children from male/dual-headed
   households, but do not differ in terms of weight. Grandchildren living
   in extended households were found to have lower z-scores for height and
   weight than children living in parental households. This study clearly
   shows that, given the marginalization of highland Afro-Ecuadorian
   communities, some further investigation on the subject of growth and
   development of highland Afro-Ecuadorian children is needed.

AB Recent "science wars" challenging the primacy of scientific authority in
   technical decision making, increasingly complex policy problems, and
   expanding demands for public participation have created tension among
   both the producers and users of science, especially in the highly
   visible policy arenas of natural resource management. This article uses
   survey data collected in 1999 from Oregon, Washington, and British
   Columbia to investigate public perspectives on these conflicting roles
   for science and scientists in the natural resource and environmental
   policy making process in the Canadian and American contexts.
   Determinants of public support for involving scientists in the policy
   making process also are characterized and measured. The article
   concludes that publics in both areas of the Pacific West are likely to
   approve of Kai Lee's concept of civic science, in which research
   scientists are more actively integrated into natural resource management
   processes.

AB This paper focuses on the potential role of policy in influencing the
   poverty and land degradation problems facing Africa. This is done
   through exploring a few case studies, chosen from a broad spectrum of
   African countries - Sudan, Malawi, Nigeria, Ghana and Kenya. The first
   case study examines the comparative returns to the gum arabic
   agroforestry system cultivated by poor farmers in Northern Sudan, and
   the role of policies in influencing these returns. The second explores
   how erratic agricultural pricing policies in Malawi during the 1980s may
   have distorted the incentives of poor smallholders to adopt less-erosive
   crops in their farming systems. The third case study illustrates how
   inappropriate policies and investments can cause displacement of poorer
   rural groups from their traditional farming and grazing lands, by
   examining the loss of a major floodplain due to dam building in northern
   Nigeria. The final two case studies are concerned with policy 'lessons
   learned'. The first looks at the impact of a macro-economic adjustment
   policy - in this case trade Liberalization - on farmers' decisions to
   expand cultivated area rather than intensify crop production in western
   Ghana. The final case study examines the role of policy in land
   management success story in Africa, the Machakos District. Kenya, and
   explores the critical question of whether this success can be replicated
   elsewhere in Africa. These case studies serve two important functions.
   First, they demonstrate how policy analysis can be effective in
   highlighting key dimensions of the poverty-environment linkages
   underlying land degradation. Second, they illustrate how both 'good' and
   'bad' policies can affect the economic incentives determining poor rural
   household's decisions to conserve or degrade their land. (C) 2000

AB Objective: This study assessed the effects of race on neuropsychological
   functioning in patients with schizophrenia.
   Method: A total of 160 patients with schizophrenia completed an
   extensive neuropsychological test battery. Scores were standardized to a
   group of 99 psychiatrically and physically healthy subjects and
   categorized into seven functional domains: concentration, executive
   function, language, motor function, spatial memory, verbal memory, and
   visual processing.
   Results: African Americans (N=25) had significantly lower mean scores on
   executive function, language, spatial memory, and visual processing than
   did Caucasians (N=135). Statistical control for patient and family
   education eliminated all significant effects.
   Conclusions: Educational differences in patients and families may
   account for some of the performance heterogeneity reported in patients
   with schizophrenia and should be routinely analyzed with other
   sociodemographic factors such as race and sex.

AB Objectives. The study examined the unique and combined contributions of
   race/ethnicity, income, and family structure to adolescent cigarette
   smoking, alcohol use, involvement with violence, suicidal thoughts or
   attempts, and sexual intercourse.
   Methods. Analyses were based on the National Longitudinal Study of
   Adolescent Health. A nationally representative sample of 7th to 12th
   graders participated in in-home interviews, as did a resident parent for
   85.6% of the adolescent subjects. The final sample included 10803 White,
   Black, and Hispanic 7th to 12th graders.
   Results. White adolescents were more likely to smoke cigarettes, drink
   alcohol, and attempt suicide in the younger years than were Black and
   Hispanic youths. Black youths were more likely to have had sexual
   intercourse; both Black and Hispanic youths were more likely than White
   teens to engage in violence. Controlling for gender, race/ethnicity,
   income, and family structure together explained no more than 10% of the
   variance in each of the 5 risk behaviors among younger adolescents and
   no more than 7% among older youths.
   Conclusions. Findings suggest that when taken together, race/ethnicity,
   income, and family structure provide only limited understanding of
   adolescent risk behaviors.

   inequality on health are consistent across demographic subgroups of the
   US population.
   Methods. Data from the National Health Interview Survey on White and
   Black non-Hispanics were used. Logistic regression models were estimated
   with SUDAAN software. Perceived health was the outcome variable.
   Results. The results of the multivariate analysis, in which individual
   family income and county-level poverty rates were included were not
   consistent with existing research. In the presence of co-variates. the
   conditional effects of inequality were restricted to Whites aged 18-44
   years in the 2 highest income inequality quartiles and middle-aged
   Whites in counties with the highest level of income inequality. The
   health of Blacks of all ages, elderly Whites, and middle-aged Whites
   outside of the areas of highest inequality was unaffected when controls
   for individual characteristics and county-level poverty were in place.
   Conclusions. For the United States. the independent and direct
   contribution of income inequality to the determination of self-perceived
   health net of individual income and county income levels is restricted
   to certain demographic groups.

AB Objectives. The goals of this study were to estimate prospective
   mortality risks of city residence, specify how these risks vary by
   population subgroup, and explore possible explanations.
   Methods. Data were derived from a probability sample of 3617 adults in
   the coterminous United States and analyzed via cross-tabular and Cox
   proportional hazards methods.
   Results. After adjustment for baseline sociodemographic and health
   variables, city residents had a mortality hazard rate ratio of 1.62 (95%
   confidence interval [CI]= 1.21,2.18) relative to rural/small-town
   residents; suburbanites had an intermediate but not significantly
   elevated hazard rate ratio. This urban mortality risk was significant
   among men (hazard rate ratio: 2.25), especially non-Black men. but not
   among women. Among Black men, and to some degree Black women. suburban
   residence carried the greatest risk. All risks were most evident for
   those younger than 65 years.
   Conclusions. The mortality risk of city residence. at least among men,
   rivals that of major psychosocial risk factors such as race, low income,
   smoking, and social isolation and merits comparable attention in
   research and policy.

   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted of US mortality records

   Results. Higher standardized mortality ratios were seen for Blacks vs
   Whites (3.34 vs 0.65), low vs high educational level (1.51 vs 0.69), and
   low vs high income(1.46 vs 0.71). Excess mortality for Blacks vs Whites
   was present in the highest and lowest quintiles of median county income
   and educational level. The disparity in asthma mortality rates according

   Trends were modeled and compared via Poisson regression.
   Results. No significant differences in arrest trends emerged. Over the
   study period, increases in category-specific arrests in program and

   operationalized as individuals' average time committed to volunteering
   in the past month aggregated to the campus level.
   Results. In multivariate analyses controlling for individual

   inconsistent with the pattern expected of a simple physical

   analyses of references in the networks of various fields suggest that
   variation in network structure is due in part to differences in why
   authors cite their colleagues' work: Disproportionate citation of
   foundational documents occurs when authors cite papers as examples of

AB This longitudinal study examined the functions of socioemotional support
   among 205 African American mothers and children who reside in a
   low-income inner city environment. Approximately one-third of
   participating mothers were HIV-infected. Results indicated that
   HIV-infected women and their children endorsed receiving lower levels of
   socioemotional support than noninfected women and their children. More
   social and emotional support from neighbors and friends was associated
   with less psychological distress of both HIV-infected and noninfected
   women. More socioemotional support from the mother was associated with
   less depressive mood and disruptive behavior among all children. Some
   evidence indicated that higher levels of emotional support received by
   mothers from children were associated with greater psychological
   distress in mothers. With few exceptions, the HIV status of the mother
   did nor qualify the relationship between socioemotional support and
   psychosocial adjustment. Thus, socioemotional support appeared to serve
   as a resource factor, rather than a protective factor among these
   families. The current results tentatively indicate that families facing
   these stressors may benefit from clinical services enhancing mothers'
   access to socioemotional support from other adults.

AB Minority children in the United States are at higher risk for asthma and
   related hospitalizations than white children, and their asthma tends to
   be more severe. Empirical studies have yet to demonstrate a definitive
   cause for their high risk and severity. The strongest
   candidate-predictors include cockroach allergens, household smoking, air
   pollution, poor access to quality health care, and underutilization of
   inhaled antiinflammatory medications. In particular, recent studies have
   shown that black and Latino children continue to misuse health care and
   medications because of lack of access to culturally sensitive
   pediatricians who understand their needs and barriers, which contributes
   to more severe, poorly controlled asthma, It has been suggested that
   interventions for minority asthmatic children focus on improving access
   to asthma medical homes that deliver culturally appropriate and relevant
   care tailored to the needs of the family, improving family-provider
   communication, and improving knowledge and acceptance of asthma clinical
   practice guidelines, particularly for providers who work in
   community-based clinics. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB Objective: Using prospective data, we extend and strengthen prior
   evidence on the relationship of educational level and the risk of
   alcohol abuse and dependence among adults. Hypothesizing that risk of
   alcohol disorders would be greater among individuals who dropped out of
   high school without getting a diploma, and among those who entered
   college but then failed to get a degree, relative to those with a
   college or higher degree, we examined these relationships by
   race-ethnicity. Methods: Data are from the total of 18,571 adult
   participants selected for the Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) program
   by probability sampling of households and census tracts between 1980 and
   1984. To assess occurrence of psychiatric conditions over time, staff
   administered the Diagnostic Interview Schedule soon after sampling and
   again at followup approximately one year later. The final sample for
   this report was stratified: African Americans (N = 2856) and whites (N =
   7889). Results: In multiple logistic regression analyses, we found that
   dropping out of high school was associated with elevated risk for
   alcohol disorders, relative to those with an Associate of Arts degree or
   higher, among both African Americans (estimated relative risk (RR) =
   4.0, 95% confidence interval (Cl), 1.1-14.3, P = .03), and whites (RR =
   4.7, 95%Cl, 2.2-10.0, P = .0001). In contrast, entering college but
   failing to get a degree was associated with a significantly increased
   risk only for whites; however, African Americans were less numerous in
   the sample, causing attenuation of power. In order to assess whether
   this relationship was confounded by macrosocial factors of the
   neighborhood environment, cases were matched to non-cases by age and
   census tract, and initial conditional logistic regression analyses also
   were completed. Conclusions: If confirmed in other investigations, these
   findings may help to identify groups that are at higher risk for
   developing alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence in adulthood, and may
   aid in the development of prevention or early intervention programs.

AB Despite federal recommendations highlighting the need to include special
   population groups (mainly minorities and women) in clinical research,
   recruitment and retention of these groups present a great challenge to
   researchers. This paper describes a focus group study that was conducted
   to examine factors related to minority participation and retention in
   cancer clinical research studies. In 1996, the National Cancer Institute
   submitted a request for applicants to receive support for regional
   conferences. The purpose of the proposed conferences was to share
   current information and strategies to aid cancer clinical investigators
   in recruiting and retaining minority participants in clinical cancer
   research and to stimulate local/regional adaptations of these
   strategies. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), The
   University of Alabama, and Tuskegee University collaborated to respond
   to the request. Funding was granted by NCI for the regional conference
   in Alabama. The conference was held in Tuskegee, Alabama, the site of
   the infamous US Public Health Syphilis Study at Tuskegee. In planning
   for the conference, focus group sessions were conducted with
   African-American men and women who represented all regions of Alabama.
   The focus group information was used to identify important issues to be
   addressed at the conference.

AB Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 211 Filipino-American
   adolescents and young adults residing in Los Angeles County to assess
   AIDS related knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. Among both sexually
   active and never sexually active respondents, HIV knowledge and
   self-efficacy with respect to condom use were generally high, and the
   majority held peer norms that were supportive of condom use. More than
   half of sexually active respondents reported condom use at last
   intercourse. Knowledge of HIV transmission, demographic variables,
   barriers to condom use, peer norms, and being comfortable asking a
   steady partner to routinely use condoms were not related to condom use
   at last intercourse. Higher self-efficacy (odds ratio 2.4, P<.06) and
   carrying condoms (odds ratio 1.9, P<.08) were the only two variables
   that approached statistical significance in their relationship to condom
   use at last intercourse. Findings suggest that variables that are
   related to AIDS risk behavior among non-Asian populations may not
   explain condom use among Filipinos. Therefore, future studies should
   identify determinants of AIDS risk behavior among Filipinos and other
   Asian American populations as a first step towards developing culturally
   relevant AIDS prevention programs for these groups.

AB The study of new religious movements has been developing in recent
   decades in an intellectual context in which both religion and its
   scholarly investigation appear to be more significant and more
   controversial than seemed to be the case in the earliest decades of
   SSSR. The present paper recounts the main themes of early work on nrms
   in the 1970s and 80s and subsequently explores three current areas of
   conceptual ambiguity and/or intellectual ferment and conflict. Key
   contemporary issues represent 1) The Boundary Problem or what is a "new
   religious movement"?: 2) The growing salience of the analysis of
   catastrophic episodes of mass violence_involving nrms; and 3) Recent
   claims to the effect that scholars in the sociology of religion and
   religious studies who do research on nrms have been led by their strong
   ideological commitment to the defense of religious liberty to take up a
   defensive attitude toward controversial "cults" to a degree which has
   undermined objectivity.

AB This study shows that intramilitary elite competitive politics between
   the military democrats and autocrats determine the nature of
   democratization in Ghana and Nigeria. Also, the duration of the
   democratic transition is linked to the resolution of the intramilitary
   democratization puzzle within the political military domain. It was also
   found that the political sociology of military coup behavior reveals the
   profiles of the military democratic and autocratic elite groups in the
   armed forces organization. Furthermore, the active support of retired
   ranking military elites for civilian electoral rule, since the 1990s,
   enhances the restoration of electoral civilian democracy. Therefore,
   both the political military activities within the military regime and
   within the 'uncivil military' sector comprising retired military elites
   inform military democratic analysis in sub-Saharan Africa. Both sectors
   of the political military relations determine the "military factor"
   which is vital for successful democratization and sustaining civilian
   electoral rule in the region.

AB The influence of culture on patients with psychiatric disorders has been
   well documented in the psychiatric literature. The unique emphasis of
   this paper is the influence of current social and political events on
   psychotic patients. Current events can be classified into two groups:
   (1) Communal stressful events that affect everyone (shared stressors),
   such as earthquakes, wars, etc.; and (2) Public events, highly reported
   by mass media, but not personally stressful, e.g., elections. This
   article is devoted to the discussion about the effect of sociopolitical
   non-traumatic events on persons with psychotic disorders. The author
   reviewed evidence that sociopolitical events and technical innovations
   affect patients with psychotic disorders. The author suggests that
   social events and scientific innovations may change the content of
   delusions and affect the course of psychotic disorders. The author also
   suggests that physicians should be sensitive to the clinical impact of
   sociopolitical events. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

AB Within the discipline of sociology, approaches to studying culture have
   shifted markedly over the last forty years. In this article, we review
   these changes as well as Richard Peterson's contributions to the field,
   arguing that his work played a vital role in developing the study of
   culture as a legitimate subject. While studies of culture were marginal
   during sociology's structural period of the 1960, the 'production of
   culture' perspective of the 1970 established the arts as a legitimate
   topic by applying structural analysis to the popular culture industry
   and focusing on the organizational processes that constrain aesthetic
   choices. This depoliticizing of culture opened up the field for the
   developments of the 1980s and 1990s, which saw a rapid growth of
   interest in the analysis of cultural meaning as well as a broader
   conceptualization of culture. By considering Peterson's contributions
   along this time line, we show how his work contributed to current
   theories of culture, and how these theories have been applied to the
   arts in general, and to the music industry in particular. (c) 2000

AB The production perspective posits that the content of formally produced
   symbol systems is shaped by the social context of their production,
   distribution and use. I draw on the insights of the 'production of
   culture' perspective introduced by Richard Peterson in 1974 to analyze
   the development and influence of that same perspective. Using a
   combination of intellectual history and citation analysis, I demonstrate
   that the production perspective rapidly acquired a central position in
   the new sociology of culture that emerged in the 1970s; that it became
   hegemonic within the sociology of art and media; and that, by the 1990s,
   its influence could be seen in the study of informally produced culture
   and in the humanities. The production perspective's success is
   explicable as a function of (a) its intrinsic merit in generating
   compelling explanations; (b) the environment into which it was
   introduced, which lacked seriously competitive paradigms in the areas of
   arts, media, and informally produced culture; (c) Peterson's use of
   institutions to disseminate the perspective and create an academic
   minisocial movement on its behalf; and (d) his framing of the
   perspective, which at once located it in the great tradition of
   sociological theory but at the same time left it sufficiently unfinished
   that others could appropriate it to their own uses. (c) 2000 Published

AB To trace the importance of Richard Peterson for theories for theories of
   culture in effect this article maps developments over the past thirty
   years. Initially, Peterson introduced the production-of-culture approach
   as a grounded theoretical perspective, rather than a formal theory.
   Theoretically, this perspective was undergirded by assumptions about
   culture as genetic code. From this point of departure, Peterson
   subsequently moved to consider cultural consumption. Specifically, his
   analysis of 'culture classes' and characterization of cultural
   'omnivores' moved beyond narrower structuralist class theories of
   consumption. Given these two strands of cultural analysis-of production
   and consumption-the question arose of how to arrive at an integrated
   theory of relations between the two. A review of the sociologies of
   Wendy Griswold and Howard S. Becker suggests two central issues:
   overcoming the binary division of production versus consumption, and
   incorporating theories of meaning formation and deployment. But these
   issues in turn require a synthetic theory rather than simply the
   integration of production and consumption approaches. Recent
   developments toward a synthetic theory of culture reach a point
   anticipated by Peterson in the 1970s, in that they theorize the
   production of meaning in the course of social life. (c) 2000 Published

AB This essay analyzes the contributions of Richard A. Peterson to the
   sociology of the arts. Using an approach that converges with his
   orientation to the arts, it contextualizes his contribution within the
   state of American sociology, which, at the time, was reluctant to pay
   serious attention to that field. The institutional climate itself is
   shown to converge with American ambivalence towards the arts. By opening
   up a new area of research, he helped to legitimize the field for the
   fine arts and commercially based production, especially music. Initiator
   of the American study of the production of culture, he has made equally
   important contributions to its reception, notably through his concepts
   of omnivore and univore. He has helped to institutionalize the arts as a
   disciplinary field by his active participation in professional
   associations, in the United States and Europe. (c) 2000 Published by

AB This has been written in response to the editors' question, 'how did you
   get into the sociology of culture and how do you see what you have
   done?' The answer is that in trying to be what was then called an
   industrial sociologist, I stumbled on 'culture,' a word that wasn't then
   being employed in a useful way. With others I tried to make something
   out of it that a wide range of serious sociologists could use in finding
   their own way. The strategic idea was to turn from culture as 'normative
   values' or 'abstract norms' and view it as 'expressive symbols.' This
   paper shows the origins of the observation that culture in this sense is
   produced and explores how that idea moved from a focus on the
   institutionalized culture industry worlds to the auto-production that
   takes place as individuals and collectives adopt expressive symbols and,
   in recombining them, make them the source of their identity. (c) 2000

   labor markets that incorporates the insights of the neo-Marxist
   divide-and-rule perspective. Second, I use event-structure analysis
   (ESA) to systematically examine causal sequences in the Chicago and Gary
   union campaigns. The analyses suggest that (I) both capitalist and state
   actors meditate conflicts between racial groups in the labor market and
   that (2) employers actively contribute to racial antagonism when
   emergent interracial coalitions threaten to increase labor costs and
   polarize class struggle. The revised split labor market theory explains
   how the features of industrial labor markets affect the strategies of
   employers as well as majority and minority workers.

   consistency between words and deeds. We contend that consistency is a
   complex concept which must be studied through a situated approach. By
   employing the literature on motives in sociology and communication, we
   consider the means by which actors construct consistency and
   inconsistency in social interaction. Central to this process are
   anticipated or actual, calls for accountability. Consistency and
   inconsistency become issues when we attempt to hold self, or other,

AB The relationship between anger and parent-to-child aggression (PTCA) was
   examined in mothers presenting for treatment of mood and anxiety
   disorders, because parental anger may have adverse effects on children
   and anger may decrease with treatment. Anger's role as mediator and
   moderator of the effects of the following predictors on PTCA was
   assessed: depression, anxiety, and ecologic variables that can induce or
   buffer against stress (partner verbal aggression, satisfaction with and
   perceived availability of social support, socioeconomic status, and
   number of children). Anger was found to mediate the effects of
   depression, partner verbal aggression, satisfaction with social support,
   and number of children on PTCA. Anger also had significant effects on
   PTCA after controlling for these variables. The other predictors did not
   have effects on PTCA, and anger did not moderate their effects. If
   replicated, these findings suggest the importance of examining whether
   treatment to reduce parental anger will reduce PTCA. Copyright (C) 2000

   disabled and that of minority ethnic status yield more negative
   psychosocial outcomes for black than white persons with epilepsy. Black
   (n = 55) and white (n = 53) urban participants from a larger sample were
   matched for socioeconomic status and seizure frequency. Differences in
   these and key demographic variables were tested using chi(2) and t-tests
   and found to be non-significant. Group differences in psychosocial
   outcome variables were analyzed with the following results: (1) white
   subjects were more likely to have considered suicide and to have higher
   scores on the family background scale of the Washington Psychosocial
   Seizure Inventory (WPSI); (2) black subjects had significantly lower
   scores on the Beck Hopelessness Scale and significantly more optimistic
   attributional styles; and (3) no between-group differences were found on
   other psychosocial measures. The nature of family and community supports
   may determine intergroup differences. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All

AB Between 1981 and 1995, approximately 5 million people from either
   Mexico, Cuba, Central America, or South America immigrated to the United
   States. Some regional studies have suggested that as Hispanic immigrants
   become acculturated to American society, their risk of mental illness
   increases sharply. This study examined the Lifetime risk of psychiatric
   and substance use disorders among U.S. Hispanic subgroups and the
   specific role of nativity, parental nativity, language preferences, and
   other sociodemographic characteristics as risk factors for these
   disorders. The study used the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a
   national probability sample of 8098 U.S. adults aged 15 to 64. Selected
   DSM-III-R psychiatric diagnoses were collapsed into eight categories.
   When compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-Americans were less
   likely to have any psychiatric disorder. After multivariate adjustment,
   acculturation items predicted greater risk of having any DSM-III-R
   disorders for Mexican-Americans and "other" Hispanics and greater risk
   of having a substance abuse disorder for Puerto Ricans, among other
   significant relationships. The results suggest that there is likely to
   be an increasing prevalence of psychiatric and substance use disorders
   among Hispanics that may be attributable to increasing levels of
   acculturation among the more than 5 million recent immigrants from Latin
   America.

AB Objective: To examine the relationships among exposure to violence;
   tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use; depression; church
   attendance; and the use of violence among very young adolescents.
   Methods: An 86-item confidential questionnaire was administered to 722
   sixth grade students (mean age = 11.9 +/- 0.8 years) attending 4 middle
   schools selling neighborhoods in and around public housing.
   Results: Boys had a higher mean violence scale score than girls (P less
   than or equal to .0001), and students living in public housing had
   higher violence scale scores than other students (P less than or equal
   to .0001). Self-reported use of violence was significantly associated
   with exposure to violence (r = .45); age (r = .28); frequency: of church
   attendance (r = -.14); depression (r = .28); the probability of being
   alive at age 25 (r = -.09); the frequency of use of cigarettes (r =
   .39), alcohol (r = .37), and multiple substances (r = .38); and interest
   in a gang (r = .37). When all of these variables were analyzed with
   multiple linear regression, multiple substance use, exposure to
   violence, interest in a gang, male gender, cigarette smoking, and
   depression level accounted for 49.7% of the variation in the use of
   violence scale.
   Conclusion: Recent multiple substance use and lifetime exposure to
   violence and victimization were the strongest correlates with the
   frequency that these youth reported using violence and carrying weapons.

AB The Australian government has expressed a continuing interest in the
   assessment of research productivity as a basic element of a
   'rationalised' research funding process. Bibliometric analyses are among
   the techniques that the government uses to evaluate the quality of
   research performance. Like many other disciplines, sociology is a target
   of these assessments. This paper presents data to demonstrate how
   Australian sociology might measure up if subjected to an inquiry using
   these methods. Data are provided on the standing of Australian sociology
   internationally and on the research contributions of major Australian
   universities. Several important methodological issues are reviewed and
   discussed. It is concluded that Australian sociologists would be well
   served by becoming active participants in the ongoing national debate
   over the assessment of research performance and the allocation of
   funding for tertiary education and science.

AB Unlike older sciences such as physics and biology, sociology has never
   had a revolution. Modern sociology is still classical-largely
   psychological, teleological, and individualistic-and evert less
   scientific than classical sociology. But pure sociology is different: It
   predicts and explains the behavior of social life with its location and
   direction in social space-its geometry. Here I illustrate pure sociology
   with formulations about the behavior of ideas, ideas, including a theory
   of scienticity that predicts and explains the degree to which an idea is
   likely to be scientific (testable, general, simple, valid, and
   original). For example: Scienticity is a curvilinear function of social
   distance from the subject. This formulation explains numerous facts
   about the history and practice of science, such as why some sciences
   evolved earlier and faster than others and why so much sociology is so
   unscientific. Because scientific theory is the most scientific science,
   the theory of scienticity also implies a theory of theory and a
   methodology far the development of theory.

   sociology to mathematics and back, followed by several long-term formal
   theoretical research programs. One of these, pertaining to the formal
   representation of institutionalized social action systems, is described
   in terms of its linkage to interpretive sociology, while also noting its
   limitations from a theoretical science point of view. By interweaving
   intellectual biography and intellectual history, the paper also provides
   some contextual background for appreciating the work of the other

AB Genetic relatedness is a central concept in the study of social
   evolution. Though originally defined in terms of genealogy, the modern
   version of relatedness accommodates genetic similarity of any origin.
   This paper examines relatedness in group structured modes, in which a
   trait affects the fitness of all group members. Such traits can be
   divided into two types, based on whether their group fitness effects
   encompass all group members including the actor ("whole-group traits"),
   or only group members other than the actor ("other-only traits"). Both
   trait types are common in nature as well as in theoretical models, but
   they have rarely been distinguished clearly. The average relatedness of
   recipients to actors differs for the two trait types within the same
   population and even the same individual, leading to different selection
   pressures and evolutionary outcomes. Total relatedness in
   group-structured models can be partitioned into two components:
   structural relatedness due to the size and number of groups in the
   population, and assortative relatedness due to the distribution of
   genotypes among groups. Each component differs for whole-group vs.
   other-only traits, both in terms of their values and the factors that
   influence them. Some key differences include: positive relatedness
   requires positive assortment for other-only but not for whole-group
   traits; negative relatedness is possible for other-only but not
   whole-group traits; relatedness depends on average group size for
   whole-group but not other-only traits, and non-random assortment into
   groups affects relatedness more strongly for other-only than whole-group
   traits. Recognizing the distinction between these trait types resolves
   some apparent contradictions in the literature, and clarifies the limits
   of some previous results. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

   behaviors that are key determinants of pregnancy and sexually
   transmitted diseases (STDs).
   Methods. The 1992 Youth Risk Behavior Survey/Supplement to the National
   Health Interview Survey provided family data from household adults and
   behavioral data from adolescents.
   Results. Among male and female adolescents, greater parental education,
   living: in a 2-parent family, and White race were independently
   associated with never having had sexual intercourse. Parental education
   did not show a linear association with other behaviors. Household income
   was not linearly related to any sexual behavior. Adjustment for SES and
   family structure had a limited effect on the association between
   race/ethnicity and sexual behaviors.
   Conclusions. Differences in adolescent sexual behavior by race and SES
   were not large enough to fully explain differences in rates of pregnancy
   and STD infection. This suggests that other factors, including access to
   health services and community prevalence of STDs, may be important
   mediating variables between SES and STD transmission and pregnancy among
   adolescents.

   predictors of hunger were income below federal poverty level (odds ratio
   [OR] = 2.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.72, 4.30), receipt of food
   stamps (OR = 2.53, 95% CI = 1.57, 4.09), Latino ethnicity (OR = 2.39,

   though females are at less risk than males per national figures.
   Caucasian adolescents inaccurately perceived that they were at
   significantly greater risk than African-American peers for motor vehicle

AB OBJECTIVE: To examine the Impact of housing status on health service
   utilization patterns in low-income HIV-infected adults.
   DESIGN: A survey of 1,445 HIV-infected Medicaid recipients in New York
   State between April 1996 and March 1997.
   MAIN RESULTS: Six percent of study participants were homeless, 24.5%
   were "doubled-up," and 69.5% were stably housed. Compared with the
   stably housed, doubled-up and homeless participants were less likely to
   be seeing a physician regularly (P = .0001), and if seeing a physician,
   they were likely to have been doing so for a significantly shorter time
   (P = .02). The homeless were also less likely than either stably housed
   or doubled-up individuals to see the same physician or group of
   physicians at each ambulatory visit (P = .007). In addition, a higher
   proportion of the homeless had made one or more hospital visits over the
   prior 3 months than the nonhomeless. After multivariate adjustment,
   doubled-up participants were found to make more emergency room visits,
   the homeless were less likely to be taking prophylaxis for Pneumocystis
   carinii pneumonia, and both the doubled-up and the homeless were shown
   to use slightly more outpatient care than the stably housed.
   CONCLUSION: Our study documents differences in health care utilization
   patterns across stably housed. doubled-up. and homeless HN-infected
   persons after controlling for health insurance coverage. These
   differences, especially those pertaining to outpatient services, suggest
   that the unstably housed may be receiving less adequate health care than
   the stably housed, and hence may he more likely to experience adverse
   clinical outcomes.

AB Objective: To demonstrate that the recent decline in egg consumption in
   the United States was, in part, the result of a food scare that began in
   the 1960's.
   Methods: Using the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the
   frequency of articles about eggs, dietary cholesterol and heart disease
   in popular magazines was obtained. A content analysis was performed on a
   random sample of these articles.
   Results: The increased trend in magazine articles and public statements
   by groups such as the American Heart Association linking eggs, blood
   cholesterol and heart disease is associated with the downward trend in
   egg consumption.
   Conclusions: Public exposure to negative messages about particular foods
   can contribute to a decline in their consumption. Exposure to more
   consistently positive messages about foods can bring about an increase
   in the consumption of those foods.

AB The Women Physicians' Health Study is a nationally distributed mailed
   questionnaire survey of a random sample of 4501 female physicians. We
   examined differences in the professional characteristics and personal
   health habits of minority women physicians compared to other women
   physicians, with regard to the choice of primary care specialties, type
   or location of practice site, and career satisfaction. Most women
   physicians were self-described as non-Hispanic white (77.4%), with 13%
   Asians, and few blacks (4.3%) or Hispanics (5.2%). Blacks and Hispanics
   were more likely to choose primary care specialties (61.6% and 57.9%,
   respectively, vs. 49.3% of whites, p < 0.05). Black and Hispanic
   physicians were most likely to practice in urban areas (71.8% and 72.2%,
   respectively, p < 0.001). Minority physicians were most likely to report
   spending some time each week on clinical work for which they did not
   expect compensation. Black physicians were least likely to report high
   levels of work control and were least likely to be satisfied with their
   careers. While most physicians were compliant with the examined
   recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, we did find
   significant differences by ethnicity in compliance with clinical breast
   exams, mammograms, and pap smears. In conclusion, there continues to be
   fewer blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. physician workforce than in the
   general population. Minority women physicians are more likely to provide
   primary care services in communities that have been traditionally
   underserved and may also report higher rates of career dissatisfaction.

AB Sociology students' perceptions of their instructors' educational
   attainment levels are examined empirically. We find gender disparities:
   students misattribute in an upward direction the level of education
   actually attained by male graduate student instructors, while they
   misattribute in a downward direction the level of formal education
   attained by women, even when the female faculty member is a full
   professor. The misattributions are linked to the imputed statuses
   "teacher" for women, and "professor" for men, regardless of the actual
   positions held or the credentials earned by faculty members and graduate
   student instructors. We suggest that a process of marginalization
   explains the empirical findings-a process that is attributed by others,
   but chosen by the self, regardless of the social and economic costs
   incurred. Consequences for students and sociology professors are
   discussed.

AB Using a sample of 45 introductory sociology textbooks, this research
   addresses how poverty information is packaged as the intersection of
   class, race, and gender, and how this depiction has changed from
   the;1980s to the early 1990s. I conducted a quantitative content
   analysis of the number of index citations and the location of poverty
   information they reference; the number and composition of poverty
   tables; and the number, type, and race/gender composition of
   illustrations of poverty. Newer textbooks reveal a racialized and
   genderized depiction of poverty which differentiates the topic of
   poverty from inequality topics. Instead of promoting the development of
   a multicultural perspective, the selective location of poverty
   information via ghettoization and topic context appears to counteract
   the impact of the inclusive content of that information. implications of
   and possible strategies for overcoming the conventional topic-chapter
   format of textbooks are discussed.

AB The problems encountered in teaching race relations courses have been
   the central focus of recent discussions about pedagogical approaches to
   controversial topics. These discussions, while invaluable, fail to fully
   explore two issues.. first, the need for collective as well as
   individual strategies to deal with the problems generated by race
   relations courses; and second, the unique experiences of graduate
   students of color teaching this class at predominantly white
   universities. This paper offers a model for a collective strategy that
   departments can use to more effectively deal with problems associated
   with such courses. This model is provided by a year-long workshop
   organized by our department to analyze and address challenges posed by
   race relations classes. Our workshop was racially and ethnically
   diverse, allowing us a unique opportunity to deliberately explore the
   experiences of teachers of color. Drawing from this diversity, we
   develop a multidimensional analysis of the institutional and pedagogical
   constraints that create problems for race relations instructors, and we
   sketch a multidimensional approach to minimizing these problems.

AB While many sociology graduate programs now offer a seminar on teaching,
   most of these courses appear to emphasize reading and talking about
   teaching, rather than actually preparing to teach, in this seminar, by
   drawing on critical, feminist and humanist scholarship, the participants
   put ideas about pedagogy into practice. Each participant developed an
   undergraduate course from scratch, including a syllabus, assignments,
   lesson plans, assessments and a statement of teaching philosophy.
   Moreover, the seminar itself modeled many of the teaching techniques the
   participants might use in their own courses, including extensive peer
   review. Finally, by practicing the work habits of constancy and
   moderation from Advice for New Faculty Members: Nihil Nimus (Boice
   2000), the participants began to get more done in less time with less
   strain. The positive outcomes of this seminar suggest that this approach
   may be informative to faculty members designing or revising similar
   courses.

   particularly successful method that has been well documented. This paper
   describes an approach using clips from a television show to explore
   sociological concepts in an introduction to Sociology course. This
   method encourages students to think of sociology as something that can
   help them to make sense of their world. Students learn that sociological
   concepts are important tools that can help make sense of everyday life,
   and gain an appreciation for the complexity and value of the
   sociological imagination.

AB Friendships with competitors can improve the performance of
   organizations through the mechanisms of enhanced collaboration,
   mitigated competition, and better information exchange. Moreover, these
   benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a
   cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among
   competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information
   culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by
   customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The
   first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the
   friendship-network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with
   performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a
   given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to
   dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved
   if a manager's competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the
   benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis
   examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows
   that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors.

AB Ireland's unique and well-documented history provides insight into the
   formation and origins of population subdivisions. Of particular
   interest, is the controversial ethnogenesis of an itinerant population
   of Ireland : the Travellers. The objectives of this study were: (1) to
   determine the genetic affinity of the Travellers to the general Irish
   population based on gene frequency data, subdivided by county, and (2)
   to explore the relationship between subpopulations of Ireland, given its
   turbulent history.
   The gene frequencies of standard genetic markers collected from
   populations residing in counties of Ireland and the Travellers were
   calculated and analysed using several multivariate methods. First, a
   relationship (R) matrix was used to ascertain the scaled
   variance-covariance matrix of population similarity. Second, mean per
   locus heterozygosity ((H) over bar) was regressed on distance of the
   region from the gene frequency centroid (r(ii)). The results of this
   study include: (1) the confirmation of Crawford's (1975, in Biosocial
   Interrelations in Population Adaptations, E.S. Watts et al. (eds), pp.
   93-103) conclusions concerning the origins and genetic affinity of the
   Travellers; (2) based on several multivariate analyses, the major
   influence on population structure was unique historical events; and (3)
   Relethford and Crawford's (1995, American Journal of Physical
   Anthropology, 96, 25-38) hypothesis concerning the distinctiveness of

AB The debate between the advocates of sociological individualism and those
   of holism has been pervasive in the development of social theory. This
   debate is often situated in the false problems of sociology, since it is
   seen as a particular form of the perennial and irresolvable dilemma
   between social nominalism and realism, as well as between freedom and
   determinism. Nevertheless,the debate is far from over within
   contemporary sociology and other social science, as indicated by the
   resurgence of individualism in rational action theory and its
   repudiation by holistic social theories. The aim of this paper is to
   identify some modern variations on this theme as well as to discern
   certain common tendencies of two seemingly opposite theoretical
   perspectives, viz. the convergence upon a normative solution to the
   problem of social order. This convergence is therefore denoted normative
   convergence between sociological individualism and holistic sociology.

   regulate their own learning and intellectual development is by obtaining
   assistance From others at times of need. At school, a child who engages
   in adaptive help seeking monitors his or her academic performance, shows
   awareness of difficulty he or she cannot overcome independently, and
   remedies that difficulty by requesting assistance from teachers and
   classmates. In this article, I discuss how parents, teachers, and peers
   contribute to the development of children's skills and attitudes

   same- versus mixed-achievement classroom, and in a group of peers with
   similar versus dissimilar interests and hobbies on a school trip among
   5th, 8th, and 11th graders in Detroit and Matsuyama, Japan. Choice of
   the diverse environment varied by context, location, and grade level.
   Across contexts, preference for diversity tended to decrease among
   Detroit students, and increase among Matsuyama students with age.
   Additionally, students in Detroit were more likely than their peers in
   Matsuyama to give ability-based and activity-related explanations;
   students in Matsuyama were more likely than students in Detroit to give
   mastery-based and cognitive-related explanations, Results are discussed
   in terms of social comparison theory.

AB The knowledge we have of childhood and adolescent behaviour is, to some
   extent, a function of the unique perspective of the rater. Although many
   behavioural genetics studies have used parent and child self-reports in
   their assessments of child and adolescent adjustment, few have included
   teacher ratings of behaviour. It is possible that genetic and
   environmental contributions to teacher reports are different from those
   using parent and self-reports. The present study examined genetic and
   environmental influences on six subscales of the Child Behavior
   Checklist Teacher Report Form (CBC-TRF) using a normative sample of
   adolescents. The sample consisted of 373 same-sex twin and sibling pairs
   of varying degrees of genetic relatedness participating in the Nonshared
   Environment in Adolescent project (NEAD). For all of the CBC subscales,
   except attention problems and social problems, nonshared environmental
   influence was the most important source of variance. Additive genetic
   factors were of moderate importance for externalising behaviours,
   whereas nonadditive genetic factors contributed to the
   anxious/depressed, attention problems, withdrawn, and social problems
   subscales. For none of the constructs was shared environment a
   significant influence. Three alternative models testing for contrast
   effects, differences in twin and nontwin siblings, and differences in
   nondivorced and stepfamilies were examined. In most cases, the
   best-fitting model was a model that did not include any of these
   effects, suggesting that these factors do not critically affect the
   basic model. However, some of the patterns of correlations and parameter
   estimates were unusual and may warrant future investigation.

   facilitating recovery. This paper discusses psychological,
   physiological, behavioral, and community responses encountered in the
   aftermath of a disaster. A preventive medicine model of understanding
   disaster response is discussed in which the psychiatrist delineates
   traumatic stressors and high-risk populations. The importance of
   psychiatric participation in disaster preparedness is emphasized.
   Psychiatric interventions targeted at the various longitudinal phases of
   disaster response are reviewed.

AB This analysis employs the case of lysine price fixing involving the
   food-processing transnational corporation (TNC) Archer Daniels Midland
   (ADM) and Asian-based firms. In an "economy and society" conceptual
   framework grounded in the sociology of agriculture and food, we
   investigate the powers and limits of TNCs in the global era. We argue
   that TNCs maintain significant powers which allow them to avoid the laws
   and regulations of nation-states. ADM was able to organize an illegal
   global cartel to control the world production and price of the feed
   supplement lysine. In addition, TNCs' actions in the global arena are
   limited by their inability to trust business partners and to organize
   and maintain systems of social control; these roles historically have
   been played by the nation-state. We conclude that despite their
   significant powers, TNCs' contradictory position in the global arena
   provides opportunities that can be used to democratize society.

AB A number of checks can be done to assess reliability of attitudinal data
   pertaining to fertility. We ascertain how births that would be
   considered unintended, based on Time I reports of fertility intentions,
   are classified by respondents at a second interview after the birth
   occurred. The 1988 National Survey of Family Growth and a telephone
   reinterview allow us to identify respondents who initially intended to
   postpone or stop childbearing, but who then had a birth, and to analyze
   the reports they gave of the wantedness of the pregnancy leading to the
   birth. We also examine wantedness responses of women who claimed in 1988
   that they intended to conceive within the next few years. Reports are
   compared across a range of respondent characteristics and circumstances,
   including changes in marital status since the initial interview. The
   analysis reveals nontrivial inconsistency between women's stated birth
   intentions and their reports about the wantedness of subsequent births.
   Details across subgroups are examined. Results also provide new
   information about effects of duration since birth on intention reports.

AB Using the National Maternal and Infant Health Survey 1988 (NMIHS), a

   behavioral factors in explaining racial/ethnic disparities in infant
   mortality. In particular, we focus on the following variables: weight
   gain during pregnancy, prenatal care utilization, exercise, vitamin use,
   and substance use during pregnancy. These analyses are conducted by
   modeling both time of death (neonatal vs. postneonatal) and cause of
   death (infections, perinatal complications, delivery complications,
   congenital malformations, SIDS, other causes) outcomes. Our results
   suggest that behavioral factors are partially responsible for observed
   race/ethnic differentials in infant mortality, but are not as important
   as sociostructural determinants such as SES.

AB This study replicates Singh's (1979) "classic" examination of correlates
   of euthanasia and suicide attitudes. The purposes of the current study
   were to assess (1) changes in public attitudes toward these voluntary
   termination of life practices, and (2) changes in the effects on
   attitudes of selected independent variables. I found Americans' approval
   of both euthanasia and suicide in 1996 to be higher than that in 1977.
   The increase in the approval of suicide, however, far outstripped that
   of euthanasia. Results of OLS regressions indicated that race, religious
   commitment, religious attendance, political identification, and suicide
   approval were statistically significant predictors of euthanasia
   approval. Only religious attendance and euthanasia approval were
   statistically significant predictors of suicide approval in both 1977
   and 1996. The findings regarding euthanasia approval support those of
   Singh (1979); those regarding suicide approval do not. Triangulation of
   methods in future research is necessary to illuminate other aspects of
   these multifaceted issues.

AB Recent research in urban sociology posits that the proliferation of
   female-headed families in American cities is a result of declining
   economic prospects due to profound changes in the structure of the urban
   economy. Meanwhile, macro-level theory and research in criminology
   suggest that an association exists between family structure and rates of
   lethal violence among juveniles. Given these two streams of sociological
   thought, there is good reason to expect that increases in juvenile
   homicide rates since 1970 may be due, in part, to changes in the
   structure of the economy and the family during the 1970 to 1990 period.
   However, the nexus between deindustrialization, female-headed families,
   and juvenile homicide has received little attention in extant research.
   The objective of the current study is to remedy this gap in the
   literature by bringing together ideas about deindustrialization and
   female headship in an attempt to explain city-lever changes in Black and
   White juvenile homicide rates between 1970 and 1990. In particular, the
   research investigates the hypothesis that a decline in the manufacturing
   base of cities increased rates of female headship and thereby indirectly
   raised homicide rates. Race differences in the hypothesized structural
   relationships also are examined.

AB Drawing on a social capital theoretical framework, I examine race,
   ethnic, and gender wage inequalities. Specifically, I extend past
   research by analyzing differences in the mobilization of different types
   of job contacts, what these types of contacts and their level of
   influence "buy" job seekers in the labor market, and the extent to which
   differences in social resources explain between-group variations in
   wages. Four aspects of job contacts are implicated: the race and gender
   of the job contact, the strength of the relationship between the job
   seeker and the job contact, and the job contact's influence. Employing
   the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, I find that white men are more
   likely to mobilize weak, white, male, and influential contacts, those
   contacts hypothesized to positively impact employment outcomes.
   Moreover, their greater mobilization of male and influential ties helps
   to explain a substantial part of their wage advantage over white women
   and Latinos. However, in many ways, their overall social resource
   advantage seems somewhat overstated. They reap no advantages over
   blacks, Latinos, and white women in their use of weak and white ties.
   Furthermore, results indicate that the benefits of social resources
   appear largely contingent on the social structural location of job
   seekers mobilizing them, less on any benefits inherent in different
   "types" of job contacts.

AB This article outlines an emotional achievement perspective for the study
   of emotions in social movements. Following Denzin's work on emotions, I
   consider emotions as self-feelings that are situated, interactional, and
   temporal in nature. The concept of emotions as achievement complements
   Hochschild's emotion management perspective. While management focuses on
   control, achievement emphasizes articulation and creativity. I argue
   that, although individuals may be compelled to suppress feelings in the
   organizational context, different social contexts and practices make it
   possible for individuals to pursue emotional fulfillment and
   self-realization. In social movements, the process of emotional
   achievement among participants unfolds as a process of mobilization. An
   analysis of the emotional dynamics of the 1989 Chinese student movement
   shows that emotions were inextricably intertwined with identities and
   action and that the emotional dynamics generated in this process
   significantly contributed to movement mobilization. The article
   concludes with a discussion of the theoretical contributions of the
   emotional achievement perspective.

   explored the correlates of participation in New Age groups or
   activities. Drawing from previous work on New Age phenomena, and from
   other established traditions in the sociology of religion, we outline a
   set of hypotheses linking the consumption of New Age materials with four
   sets of factors: (a) sociodemographic characteristics; (b) conventional
   religious affiliation and participation; (c) embeddedness within
   networks of New Age believers and consumers; and (d) community religious
   context. We then rest these hypotheses using data from a recent
   telephone survey of Texas residents. Few of the expectations are
   supported. Indeed, among Texans the Purchase of New Age materials is
   more common and more evenly distributed across social space than
   previously suspected. By far the strongest predictor of such consumption
   is embeddedness within interpersonal networks composed of other New Age
   devotees. We conclude by identifying a number of promising directions
   for future theoretical and empirical work on New Age phenomena.

AB Little is known about the barriers which women living with HIV/AIDS
   encounter that impede their adherence to antiretroviral medication
   regimens. Yet in order to design effective interventions to improve
   women's adherence, it is first imperative to identify the factors that
   contribute to their non-adherence. The purpose of this study was to
   explore, from HIV-infected women 's own perspectives, the barriers they
   faced in adhering to combination antiretroviral therapies. Twenty
   HIV/-infected women were asked to keep a personal journal for a period
   of one month. In the journals, women wrote about what their lives were
   like while taking antiretroviral medications. Line-by-line open coding
   was done to identify major ideas and themes within the journal entries.
   Results showed that women faced six main barriers to adherence, those
   related to: (I) medication regimens, (2) side effects, (3) social
   relationships, (4) medication beliefs, (5) daily schedules, and (6) body
   weight. The findings underscore the difficult nature: of the
   antiretroviral regimens and illuminate the daily obstacles women face in
   adhering to therapy. Interventions that target women's unique barriers
   are needed to improve adherence to antiretroviral medication regimens.

AB Objectives. We estimated prevalence and control of type 2 diabetes in
   Puerto Rican, Dominican, and non-Hispanic White (NHW) elders and
   associated them with sociodemographic and health behavior variables and
   with body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference.
   Methods. We used a cross-sectional analysis with a sample of Hispanic
   elders in Massachusetts and a comparison group of NHWs (1991-1997). The
   analysis included 379 Puerto Ricans, 113 Dominicans, and 164 NHWs, aged
   60 to 96 years, with complete questionnaires and blood samples.
   Results. Type 2 diabetes was significantly more prevalent among Puerto
   Ricans (38%) and Dominicans (35%) than among NHWs (23%). Differences
   remained after covariates were adjusted for. Hispanics with diabetes
   were approximately 3 times more likely to use insulin than NHWs. Puerto
   Ricans were 2 times, and Dominicans 3 times, more likely to have
   glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations of 7% or above than NHWs. BMI and
   waist circumference were individually associated with diabetes. When
   included in the model together, waist circumference, but not BMI,
   remained independently associated with diabetes.
   Conclusions. Ethnicity was more strongly associated with diabetes status
   and control than were socioeconomic or measured health behavior
   variables, suggesting that genetic or other culturally related factors
   may explain these differences.

   second-grade children (M age = 7.8 years) viewed a videotape of a target
   actor presented as having a liked, average, or disliked reputation. A
   second videotape depicted a teacher's verbal responses to the target's
   behavior as (a) positive, (b) neutral-salient, or (c) corrective. Bath
   salience and valence of teacher feedback were assessed. Main effects of
   feedback and reputation indicated that feedback had at least minimal
   effects at each level of the target's reputation. Teacher feedback is
   discussed with respect to its effects on perceptions of behavior versus
   affective responses toward behavior-problem children. A significant
   interaction showed that when combined with a liked reputation, positive
   and neutral-salient feedback conditions increased the salience and
   positive evaluation of the target child, thus illustrating the
   importance of considering nonevaluative teacher attention in combination
   with children's reputational status. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB We consider a dynamic social network model in which agents play repeated
   games in pairings determined by a stochastically evolving social
   network. Individual agents begin to interact at random, with the
   interactions modeled as games. The game payoffs determine which
   interactions are reinforced, and the network structure emerges as a
   consequence of the dynamics of the agents' learning behavior. We study
   this in a variety of game-theoretic conditions and show that the
   behavior is complex and sometimes dissimilar to behavior in the absence
   of structural dynamics. We argue that modeling network structure as
   dynamic increases realism without rendering the problem of analysis
   intractable.

AB An important transition in insect life-history evolution was the shift
   from a solitary existence to living in groups comprising specialized
   castes. Caste-forming species produce some individuals that reproduce
   and others with worker functions that have few or no offspring(1).
   Morphologically specialized castes are well known in eusocial species
   like ants and termites(1), but castes have also evolved in less-studied
   groups like thrips, aphids and polyembryonic wasps(2-5). Because
   selection acts at both the individual and the colony level, ratios of
   investment in different castes are predicted to vary with environmental
   factors like competition and resources(6-8). However, experimental
   evidence for adaptive shifts in caste ratios is limited(9) owing to the
   experimental difficulty of manipulating factors thought to influence
   caste ratios(10-13), and because some species produce behaviourally
   flexible castes that switch tasks in response to colony needs(14,15).
   Unlike other caste-forming species, the broods of polyembryonic wasps
   develop clonally, so that increased production of one caste probably
   results in decreased production of the other(16). Here we show that the
   polyembryonic wasp Copidosoma floridanum alters caste ratios in response
   to interspecific competition. Our results reveal a distinct trade-off by
   C. floridanum between reproduction and defence, and show experimentally
   that caste ratios shift in an adaptive manner.

AB This study examines the differences in alcohol-related accident
   involvement among different driver groups in the state of Florida. The
   driver characteristics considered in this study are: age, gender, race,
   and residency of the driver of a motor vehicle involved in an accident
   while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or alcohol and drugs. The
   main objective of this study is to test whether there are associations
   between the different driver characteristics and alcohol involvement in
   traffic accidents, and to identify the high-risk group within each
   driver factor. This would improve our understanding of the relationship
   between alcohol involvement, accidents, and the four aforementioned
   driver factors. It would also enable us to better design educational and
   awareness programs targeting specific groups in the population to reduce
   drinking and driving in the state. The relationship between
   alcohol-related accident involvement and the driver factors are
   investigated using general descriptive statistics, conditional
   probabilities and log-linear models. The results showed that the 25-34
   age group experience the highest rate of alcohol/drug involvement in
   accidents. The rates decline with the increase in the age of the
   drivers. The results also indicated that there are significant
   relationships between the driver characteristics and alcohol/drug
   involvement in accidents. Male, white, and in-state drivers were also
   more involved in alcohol/drugs-related traffic accidents. (C) 2000

AB This paper presents an analysis of the relationships between the passage
   of key alcohol safety laws and the number of drinking drivers in fatal
   crashes. The study evaluated three major alcohol safety laws -
   administrative license revocation laws, 0.10 illegal per se, and 0.08
   illegal per se laws - on the proportion of drinking drivers in fatal
   crashes. Drivers aged 21 and older in fatal crashes at two BAC levels -
   0.01-0.09 and 0.10 or greater - were considered separately. Drivers
   under age 21 were not included because they are affected by the Minimum
   Legal Drinking Age (MLDA) law. This study used data on drinking drivers
   in fatal crashes from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)
   covering 16 years (1982-1997) for all 50 states and the District of
   Columbia. Also included in the study were such variables as per capita
   alcohol consumption and annual vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which could
   affect the number of alcohol-related crashes. The results indicate that
   each of the three laws had a significant relationship to the downward
   trend in alcohol-related fatal crashes in the United States over that
   period. This paper points out that this long-term trend is not the
   product of a single law. Instead, it is the result of the growing impact
   of several laws over time plus the affect of some factors not included
   in the model tested (such as the increasing use of sobriety checkpoints
   and the media's attention to the drinking-and-driving problem).

AB Children of alcoholics (COAs) have been characterized as an at-risk
   population in part, because of the dysfunctional family environments
   that disrupt psychosocial development among offspring exposed to
   parental alcoholism. This study examined the specificity of problematic
   family environments to children of alcoholics vs children exposed to
   other significant family stressors that included parental death,
   unemployment, separation, divorce, or major illness. University students
   completed self-report measures of family stressors, family relationship
   problems, family communication quality, family conflict, and
   relationship with parents. Based on a family stressor checklist, 20
   students exposed only to parental alcoholism and no other family
   stressors were compared to several other groups exposed to specific
   family stressors, and to 50 control subjects who had reported no family
   stressors. Results showed that students from families where a parent is
   or was an alcoholic, and where there were no other family stressors,
   recall disturbed family relations no more commonly than students
   specifically exposed to other family stressors such as parental divorce,
   death, or major illness, and no more commonly than those who reported no
   family stressors. Further analyses suggest that the disruption of COAs'
   family environments may be explained by their increased likelihood of
   experiencing additional family stressors that can have a disruptive
   effect, such as parental separation, divorce and unemployment.

AB Background: Underage alcohol use is a major contributor to morbidity and
   mortality in adolescents and young adults. This study examined drinking
   levels and ensuing problems among college students and factors
   associated with binge drinking.
   Method: The Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study
   conducted a self-administered survey. The participants include a random
   sample of 7061 students aged <21 years (defined as underage drinkers),
   and 4989 between ages 21 and 23 in 1997 at 116 nationally representative
   4-year colleges in 39 states. The outcomes of the study include
   self-reports of alcohol use, binge drinking (defined as five or more
   dr-inks in a row for men and four or more for women at least once in a
   2-week period), alcohol-related problems, preferred type of drink,
   access to alcohol, and price paid per drink.
   Results: Underage students drink less often but have more drinks per
   occasion, are more likely to drink in private settings (off-campus,
   dormitory, and fraternity parties), and pay less per drink than do
   of-age students. Correlates of underage binge drinking include residence
   in a fraternity or sorority (odds ratio [OR]=6.2), very easy access to
   alcohol (OR=3.3), obtaining drinks at lower prices (OR=2.1, for under $1
   each or a set fee for unlimited drinks), and drinking beer (OR=9.5).
   Conclusions: Effective controls on price, access, and fraternity and
   off-campus parties, and reinforcing minimum drinking age laws are needed
   to reduce the high levels of binge drinking and related health and
   behavioral problems of underage students.

AB Background: Evidence shows that social relationships play an important
   role in health and health behavior. We examined the relationship between
   social networks and cancer screening among four U.S. Hispanic groups.
   Methods: We used telephone surveys to collect data in eight U.S. regions
   that have concentrations of diverse Hispanic-origin populations. We
   interviewed 8903 Hispanic adults, for a response rate of 83%; analysis
   was restricted to the 2383 women aged greater than or equal to 40. As a
   measure of social integration, we formed a social network index from
   items on the number of close relatives and friends, frequency of
   contact, and church membership. We used logistic regression to estimate
   the effects of social integration on screening, adjusting for
   sociodemographic factors.
   Results: Among Mexican, Cuban, and Central-American women, the effect of
   social integration on mammography screening was slight. The odds ratios
   (OR) per unit change in social integration category ranged from 1.16 to
   1.22 with confidence intervals (CI) that overlapped with the null. For
   Pap smear screening, the effect was strongest among Mexican-American
   women (OR=1.44, 95% CI=1.21 to 1.72), but also evident among
   Central-American women (OR=1.22, 95% CI=0.72 to 2.06) and Cuban women
   (OR=1.25, 95% CI=0.81 to 1.93). Among Puerto Rican women, social
   integration had no effect on either mammography (OR=1.03) or Pap smear
   screening (OR=1.08).
   Conclusions: Independent of socioeconomic factors, social integration
   appears to influence cancer screening participation of Hispanic women.
   The modest effect is not universal across Hispanic groups and was
   stronger for Pap smear than for mammography screening behavior.
   Researchers should recognize Hispanic group differences in social
   network characteristics and the potential of social networks to change
   screening behavior.

AB This paper examines the attitudes and perceptions of 277 American
   Indians about hunting and fishing, risk, and future land use of the
   Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) in
   southeastern Idaho. Nearly half of our sample were Shoshone-Bannock
   tribal members living on the nearby Fort Hall Reservation, and half were
   American Indians from elsewhere in the western United States. We also
   interviewed an additional 44 White people. We examine the hypothesis
   that there are differences in environmental concerns and attitudes
   toward future land use at INEEL as a function of tribal affiliation
   (ethnicity), educational level, gender, and age. Such perceptions are
   important because of the existence of tribal treaties that govern the
   legal and cultural rights of the Shoshone-Bannock. Returning INEEL to
   the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and a
   National Environmental Research Park ranked as the highest preferred
   future land uses, whereas continuing nuclear materials reprocessing and
   increasing the storage of nuclear wastes ranked as the lowest. There
   were tribal differences in land use preferences, with those of the Fort
   Hall Indians being more similar to those of the local Whites than to
   other American Indians. All groups ranked storage of nuclear material,
   storage of additional nuclear material, and spills and accidents as the
   most serious of a list of concerns provided about the site. Fort Hall
   Indians answered an open-ended question with concerns for population
   levels and migration routes of game animals and other wildlife, more
   than hunting and human health. The Shoshone-Bannock from Fort Hall
   showed an environmental sensitivity for the well-being of wildlife and
   the health of the ecosystem and were interested in long-term
   stewardship, in addition to concern for human health. (C) 2000 Academic

AB Forty-five per cent of first marriages in Ethiopia end in divorce within
   30 years, and two-thirds of women who divorce do so within the first 5
   years of marriage. This paper looks at two factors that may have an
   impact on the risk of divorce in Ethiopia: early age of first marriage,
   and childlessness within the first marriage. Data used were from the
   1990 National Family and Fertility Survey conducted by the Government of
   Ethiopia. A total of 8757 women of reproductive age (15-49) were
   analysed. Life table analysis was used to determine the median age at
   first marriage, first birth and the median duration of marriage. Cox
   models were analysed to determine the differentials of divorce. The
   results of this analysis showed that both early age at marriage and
   childlessness have a significant impact on the risk of divorce. An
   inverse relationship was found between age at marriage and risk of
   divorce. Having a child within the first marriage also significantly
   reduced the risk of divorce. In addition, several cultural and
   socioeconomic variables were significant predictors of divorce.

AB Study objective-This study examined both individual and neighbourhood
   correlates of injury mortality to better understand the contribution of
   socioeconomic status to cause specific injury mortality. Of particular
   interest was whether neighbourhood effects remained after adjusting for
   individual demographic characteristics and socioeconomic status.
   Design-Census tract data (measuring small area socioeconomic status,
   racial concentration, residential stability, urbanisation, and family
   structure) was merged with the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)
   and a file that links the respondents to subsequent follow up of vital
   status and cause of death data. Cox proportional hazards models were
   specified to determine individual and neighbourhood effects on homicide,
   suicide, motor vehicle deaths, and other external causes. Variances are
   adjusted for the clustered sample design of the NHIS.
   Setting-United States, 1987-1994, with follow up to the end of 1995.
   Participants-From a sample of 472 364 persons ages 18-64, there were
   1195 injury related deaths over the follow up period.
   Main results-Individual level effects were generally robust to the
   inclusion of neighbourhood level variables in the models. Neighbourhood
   characteristics had independent effects on the outcome even after
   adjustment for individual variability. For example, there was
   approximately a twofold increased risk of homicide associated with
   living in a neighborhood characterised by low socioeconomic status,
   after adjusting for individual demographic and socioeconomic
   characteristics.
   Conclusions-Social inequalities in injury mortality exist for both
   persons and places. Policies or interventions aimed at preventing or
   controlling injuries should take into account not only the socioeconomic
   characteristics of people but also of the places in which they live.

AB Objectives: This study examined developmental antecedents to
   psychosocial traits in adulthood that have been linked in prior studies
   to increased risk of heart disease. The hypothesis was tested that early
   parental loss coupled with poor-quality family relationships (FR) during
   childhood would be associated with increased hostility and depression,
   and lower social support in adulthood. Methods: Participants included 30
   university students who experienced the death of one parent before the
   age of 16, and 31 control participants. Questionnaires were completed
   measuring current social support, hostility, depression, and the quality
   of FR. Results: Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) supported the
   hypothesis of maladaptive psychosocial characteristics in loss
   participants reporting poorer-quality FR. Significant interactions of
   loss and FR were found for individual variables of depressive symptoms,
   social support, and hostility. Conclusion: These results provide
   evidence that parental loss in childhood is associated with
   health-damaging psychosocial characteristics in adulthood only if the
   quality of the surviving FR is poor. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All

AB There is continued frustration over the failure of established social
   theory to be altered despite dramatic developments in women's lives and
   feminist theory. I argue that this process has been blocked by an overly
   static conception of society and gender itself. Close examination of the
   actual circumstances of African American and white women in the
   nineteenth- and twentieth-century United States reveals the relationship
   between gender and economic and political development has been a dynamic
   historical one, culminating recently in a radical transformation of
   women's lives and work. I develop the implications of this argument for
   older analytic divisions between work and home, or productive and
   reproductive labor, and for recent shifts in theory. Coherent grasp of
   the events currently altering women's lives provides a clear way to join
   gender with earlier theoretical concerns, as another moment of social
   transformation brought about by a still-infolding process of economic
   and political development.

AB Daniel Breslau's essay opens up a valuable space in seeking to align the
   sociologically impure objects explored in science studies with the
   practice of a pure sociology. I challenge Breslau's conclusion that the
   latter carl swallow the former and proceed with business as usual.
   Contrary to Breslau, I argue that confronting head-on the impure objects
   of science studies can indeed represent a new beginning in sociology as
   a discipline. I also correct Breslau's misreading of my "symmetrical
   humanism."

AB This paper introduces Niklas Luhmann's final,work, Die Gesellschaft der
   Gesellschaft (The Society of Society). According to Luhmann,
   sociologists have failed to produce even a partially adequate theory of
   society. Epistemological obstacles and humanist concerns for rationality
   and justice have prevented true progress in the discipline. With his
   "radically antihumanist, radically antiregional, and radically
   constructivistic " social system theory Luhmann intends to bring about a
   sociological enlightenment. Die Gesellschaft der Gesellschaft focuses on
   communication as the only genuinely social phenomenon. Social systems
   differentiate and evolve as they communicate in three separate
   dimensions: the social, temporal, and functional. The path of evolution
   results from a history of variation, selection, and restabilization
   within these discussions. Communication, bit by bit, produces social
   structures that, recursively, produce future structures. Society is
   communication. Sociology, as the science of society: is communication
   about how different societal systems operate, communicate, evolve, and
   maintain their boundaries.

AB Although violence against women is an important topic for many sociology
   classes, teaching about it can be problematic. Students may see violence
   against women as an individual rather than social problem, may
   trivialize or blame victims, or may react defensively. In this paper, I
   present an approach to teaching about violence that addresses some of
   these difficulties. Students keep a one-day journal of their experiences
   of fear and use of safety strategies, and then analyze their findings
   both individually and in discussion with their classmates. This analysis
   helps students to see violence not simply as an individual experience,
   but as a form of social control that differently affects social groups.
   In this paper, I describe this exercise, illustrate its effectiveness
   using excerpts from students journals, and discuss the advantages and
   disadvantages of this pedagogical approach.

AB Service learning in the local community is a useful and effective
   pedagogical technique and learning process for students and instructors.
   We offered an integrated service-learning option in a variety of
   sociology courses and assessed socio-demographic and other student
   characteristics to explore differences between participants and
   nonparticipants. We surveyed undergraduates (N = 413) from across the
   academic spectrum and enrolled in sociology courses at a large state
   university. The results contradict previous findings: we found
   heterogeneous participation in the service-learning project; no
   statistical association between prior and current service; commuter
   status and employment appear to influence student decisions to opt; and
   non-social science majors are more likely to participate than social
   science majors. Confirming previous studies, males are less likely to
   participate than females. Research in sociology shows strong support for
   service learning in passing on sociology. Results suggest students'
   other life demands should be taken into account when implementing a
   service-learning option.

AB Data from 205 course evaluation forms representing student responses in
   ten upper-level sociology courses were used to examine the role of
   instructor likability/rapport on student perceptions of learning and
   ratings of overall teaching ability. The results suggest that students
   who rate their instructor high in likability reward that instructor with
   high ratings in overall reaching ability. However, high likability
   ratings are also associated with a decrease in student perceptions of
   learning. The negative effect of likability on perceived learning
   juxtaposed with its positive impact on global teacher ratings gives some
   credence to sociological critiques of student consumerism in higher
   education. Namely, when students approach college as customers, they
   expect to be entertained and served only in ways they find pleasing.
   Suggestions for more appropriate use of student evaluations of teaching
   (SETS) and their impact on how sociologists define teaching
   effectiveness are discussed.

AB Background. Epidemiologic evidence as early as the 1930s has suggested
   urbanization is linked to schizophrenia, either by place of admission,
   place of upbringing, or, more recently, place of birth. In the past
   decade, obstetric complications have been implicated in the etiology of
   schizophrenia.
   Methods. With appropriate protections for anonymity, the files of the
   Danish Medical Birth Register were linked with the files of the Danish
   Psychiatric Case Register. The linkage produced 132 cases of
   schizophrenia and 69 cases of affective psychosis, who were born in 1973
   or later, who entered a Danish psychiatric hospital before 1994.
   Controls were drawn from a 10% sample of the Medical Birth Register.
   Analysis was by logistic regression.
   Results. The risk of hospitalization for schizophrenia was 4.20 times
   higher (95% CI = 2.4-7.4) for those born in Copenhagen versus those born
   in rural areas of Denmark, and a linear relationship was demonstrated
   between urbanization of birthplace and risk. There was no difference in
   risk of hospitalization for affective psychosis for those born in
   Copenhagen versus rural areas. Obstetric complications had a moderate
   sized relationship to schizophrenia, but the relationship of urban birth
   to schizophrenia was unaffected by adjustment for obstetric
   complications.
   Conclusion. Urban birth is a strong risk factor for schizophrenia, not
   mediated by obstetric complications, which deserves further exploration.

   cigarettes a day, compared with never smokers, were more than twice as
   likely to commit suicide. For male active-duty army personnel, the

AB The authors analyzed the relations between a variety of

   evacuation, indices of disruption of social networks) and coronary heart
   disease risk factors (heart rate, blood pressure, total serum
   cholesterol) assessed in 1987 among 693 Italian male factory workers.
   Multivariate analyses (adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, and
   educational level) revealed no long term relations between the
   quake-related experiences and blood pressure or cholesterol level.
   However, higher resting heart rates were observed for individuals who
   reported financial loss, increased distance from family/friends, or
   decreased visiting as a result of relocation after the quakes. Findings
   were unchanged after further adjustment for self-reported psychological
   distress (assessed using the global symptom index of the Symptom
   Checklist). These findings, while limited by the cross-sectional nature
   of the data, suggest that a number of psychosocial consequences of
   relocation due to a natural disaster are unrelated in the long term to
   coronary heart disease risk factors, except for small but significant
   differences in heart rate among individuals who have experienced
   financial loss and/or social network disruptions.

AB Urban communities continue to face formidable historic challenges to
   improving public health. However, reinvestment initiatives, changing
   demographics, and growth in urban areas are creating changes that offer
   new opportunities for improving health while requiring that health
   systems be adapted to residents' health needs.
   This commentary suggests that health care improvement in metropolitan
   areas will require setting local, state, and national agendas around 3
   priorities. First, health care must reorient around powerful population
   dynamics, in particular, cultural diversity, growing numbers of elderly,
   those in welfare-workplace transition, and those unable to negotiate an
   increasingly complex health system. Second, communities and governments
   must assess the consequences of health professional shortages, safety
   net provider closures and conversions, and new marketplace pressures in
   terms of their effects on access to care for vulnerable urban
   populations; they must also weigh the potential value of emerging models
   for improving those populations' care. Finally, governments at all
   levels should use their influence through accreditation, standards,
   tobacco settlements, and other financing streams to educate and guide
   urban providers in directions that respond to urban communities' health
   care needs.

AB The powerful influence of behavioral choices on health status is well
   established. The implications and challenges for urban populations are
   formidable, Understanding urban environments will better prepare health
   promotion professionals to deal effectively with the forces affecting
   health-related behaviors.
   In thinking about urban health promotion in the United States,
   researchers often distinguish between 2 frameworks; one contending with
   urbanization, which affects most of us, and another contending with
   inner-city environments, where many of the deepest needs are.
   Urbanization confers both benefits and liabilities, but the single
   greatest challenge for health promotion may lie in rt establishing
   positive social connections. In contrast, 2 key features of the
   inner-city environment may be the negative ecological forces within
   neighborhoods and the lack of control over one's fate.
   Too often, prescriptions for the inner city stereotype its problems and
   ignore its strengths. For the inner city, important Foundation stones
   for the future include ways to build on these strengths through positive
   connections and increased community control through coalition building.

AB Young to middle-aged residents of impoverished urban areas suffer
   extraordinary rates of excess mortality, to which deaths from chronic
   disease contribute heavily. Understanding of urban health disadvantages
   and attempts to reverse them will be incomplete if the structural
   factors that produced modern minority ghettos in central cities are not
   taken into account.
   Dynamic conceptions of the role of race/ethnicity in producing health
   inequalities must encompass(1) social relationships between majority and
   minority populations that privilege the majority population and (2) the
   autonomous institutions within minority populations that members develop
   and sustain to mitigate, resist, or undo the adverse effects of
   discrimination. Broad social and economic policies that intensify
   poverty or undermine autonomous protections can reap dire consequences
   for health.
   Following from this structural analysis and previous research, guiding
   principles for action and suggestions for continued research are:
   proposed. Without taking poverty and race/ethnicity into account, public
   health professionals who hope to redress the health problems of urban
   life risk exaggerating the returns that can be expected of public health
   campaigns or overlooking important approaches for mounting successful
   interventions.

AB The majority of children living in the United States today enjoy
   excellent health and access to health care. This was not always so;
   before the late 19th century, the field of pediatric medicine scarcely
   existed and the combination of harsh and unsanitary living conditions in
   the urban areas where most immigrants settled, infectious diseases, and
   improper handling of milk: was particularly deadly for infants and
   children.
   This article discusses the relationship between pediatric medicine and
   the broader children's health and public health movements in the United
   States in the early decades of the 20th century. That relationship
   resulted in 3 developments that had a profound impact on children's
   health: the establishment of dispensaries and milk stations that served
   impoverished children, campaigns to educate patents about illness
   prevention and child rearing, and the medical inspection of public
   schools and schoolchildren.
   Today, American children face both new threats to health and the
   reemergence of infectious diseases that were once thought conquered.
   Pediatricians and public health professionals must work together in the
   same spirit of social activism and community responsibility to meet
   these challenges.

   differences in health insurance coverage and having a usual source of
   medical care.
   Methods. In-person interviews were conducted with a community sample of
   695 residents of Central Har lemm, New York City. Predictors of the 3
   outcome variables and the interaction of key variables with gender were
   analyzed via logistic regression.
   Results. NO strong patterns emerged to explain gender differentials in
   having insurance coverage and having a usual provider, However, women
   employed full time had increased odds of insurance coverage, whereas
   employment had no similar effect among men. Public assistance evidenced
   a strong relationship with insurance coverage among both men and women.
   Socioeconomic factors and health insurance were important independent
   predictors of having a usual source of health care for men but had
   little effect among women.
   Conclusions. Expanding the availability of both public insurance and
   affordable private coverage fur men living in low-income communities is
   an important means of reducing Sender disparities in access to health
   care. Public assistance is an important means of enabling access to
   health care for men as well as women.

AB Objectives. This study examined health insurance coverage among

   countries with the largest number of immigrants living in the United
   Stales.
   Methods. We analyzed data from the 1998 Current Population Survey, using
   logistic regression to standardize rates of employer-sponsored coverage
   by country of origin.
   Results. In 1997, 16.7 million immigrants were not US citizens. Among
   noncitizens, 43% of children and 12% of elders lacked health insurance,
   compared with 14% of nonimmigrant children and 1% of nonimmigrant:
   elders. Approximately 50% of noncitizen full-time workers had
   employer-sponsored coverage, compared with 81% of nonimmigrant full-time
   workers. Immigrants from Guatemala, Mexico, El Salvador, Haiti, Korea,
   and Vietnam were the most likely to be uninsured. Among immigrants who
   worked full-time, sociodemographic and employment characteristics
   accounted for most of the variation in employer health insurance. For
   Central American immigrants, legal status may play a role in high
   uninsurance rates.
   Conclusions. Immigrants who are not US citizens are much less likely to
   receive employer-sponsored health insurance or government coverage; 44%
   are uninsured. Ongoing debates on health insurance reform and efforts to
   improve coverage will need to focus attention on this group.

AB Objectives. This 1999 study measured asthma prevalence among Latinos of
   different cultural traditions who live on the same streets and in the
   same buildings.
   Methods. Health promoters from El Puente in North Brooklyn, New York
   City, surveyed 3015 people in 946 households, asking standard asthma
   prevalence questions.
   Results. Some 46%, of households identified themselves as Dominican, 42%
   as Puerto Rican, 6% as other Latino, and 6% as other. Reported asthma
   period prevalence was 5.3% (93 of 1749) among Dominicans and other
   Latinos, compared with 13.2% (147 of 1115)among Puerto Ricans (odds
   ratio = 0.37; 95% confidence interval = 0.28, 0.49), a difference not
   explained by location (cluster or building), household size, use of home
   remedies, educational attainment, or country where education was
   completed. Differences were least detectable among 13- to 24-year-olds
   of both sexes and sharpest among women aged 45 years and older and girls
   from birth to 12 years.
   Conclusions, Further research oil gene-environment interactions is
   needed among Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, but asthma's associations
   with low income and unhealthy environment, which more recent immigrants
   seem better able to withstand, should not be overlooked.

   theoretical or empirical refinement of the macrosocial/contextual
   principles of the theory. We argue that human ecology and evolutionary
   theory can help respecify and revitalize demographic transition theory.
   Our respecification produces a more logical account of fertility decline
   that emphasizes the influences of service economies and the social
   adaptations attendant on ethnic heterogeneity and preindustrial social
   complexity. Analyses of changes in total fertility rates in
   approximately 60 less-developed countries suggest: (I) general (if
   partially ambiguous) support for demographic transition theory, (2)
   confirmation of a robust effect of service-sector dominance on
   fertility, and (3) the importance of ethnic homogeneity and
   preindustrial social complexity to demographic transition.

AB African-Americans have disproportionately higher rates of hypertension
   than any other U.S. ethnic group. Researchers have postulated that the
   psychosocial-stress association with racism may help explain these
   higher rates in African-Americans, as well as blood pressure variability
   among African-Americans. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study
   examined the relationship between perceived inter-ethnic group racism
   (racism) and blood pressure responses in 39 African-American females.
   Measurements of blood pressure were obtained before, during, and after a
   laboratory challenge where participants spoke about their personal views
   and feelings concerning animal rights. Perceptions of racism, as well as
   psychological and coping responses to racism, were assessed via the
   Perceived Racism Scale. The results revealed that on average,
   participants perceived racism 75.25 times/yeat: Racist statements were
   perceived most often, and speaking up was the most frequently reported
   coping response. The overwhelming majority of participants (76.47%) used
   active and passive coping responses to deal with racism. Among the
   psychological responses to racism, the magnitude of emotional responding
   was greatest for anger: Multivariate regression analyses indicated that
   perceived racism was significantly and positively related to diastolic
   blood pressure changes during the speech (p = .01), early recovery (p <
   .003), andlate recovery (p = .01) periods. Potential confounders did not
   mitigate these effects. The findings highlight the importance of
   delineating the role of more real-world behavioral challenges in future
   research exploring blood pressure variability and hypertension risk in
   African-Americans.

   participated An equal number of obese and nonobese women comprised each
   group of participants. Using five computer-generated slot. machine
   games, participants were allowed to earn points for access to a
   bicycle/stair stepper or videos/magazines. Exercise alternatives
   remained easily accessible while the sedentary choices became
   progressively difficult to access. Two sessions were completed at least
   2 weeks apart for reliability. Reliability for choosing to be physically
   active from session to session was r(1) = .83 for all participants, r(1)
   = .90 for Hispanics, and r(1) = .74 for Angles. Hispanic women earned
   twice the number of points for access to exercise (m = 20 +/- 2, 40% of
   the available points) as Angle women (m = 10 +/- 3; 20% of the available
   points), independent of body mass index (BMI) or socioeconomic status
   (SES). Hispanic women's choices to exercise were independent of
   acculturation level; however Hispanic women of higher SES and lower BMI
   chase to exercise more than Hispanic women of lower SES and higher BMI.
   Hispanic women may find exercise more reinforcing than Angle women,
   which has important implications for exercise interventions. In
   addition, results indicated that self-reported liking and enjoyment of
   exercise were not related to the choice to actually engage in exercise.
   The behavioral economic methods presented in this study provide
   preliminary results to support the use of an objective, reliable method
   to assess the determinants of exercise and sedentary activity choices in
   sedentary, Hispanic and Anglo women.

   intercourse and age of their male partners. Excluding intercourse
   experiences where physical force was threatened or used, 31% had
   intercourse by age 15 and 45% by age 16. Contrary to the impression left
   by studies of teenage mothers, girls who first had sex between age 13
   and age 15 or between age 16 and age 18 did not have a large percentage
   of much older partners (5 or more years older; 12 and 7%, respectively).
   The percentage of much older partners was higher, however, for girls who
   had sex in very early adolescence, ages 11-12 (34%). Much older male
   partners were associated with greater problem behaviors for girls who
   first had intercourse in very early adolescence (11-12), but less so for
   those who first hand intercourse between age 13 and age 15 (truancy
   only) and not at all for those who first hand intercourse at between 16
   and 18. Regardless of partner's age disparity, earlier age at first
   intercourse during adolescence was associated with a greater number of
   other problem behaviors. The implications of these findings for recent
   calls to enforce statutory rape laws more stringently to reduce teenage
   pregnancy were discussed.

   homosexual FTMs reported greater childhood gender nonconformity,
   preferred more feminine partners, experienced greater sexual rather than
   emotional jealousy, were more sexually assertive had more sexual
   partners, had a greater desire for phalloplasty, and had more interest
   in visual sexual stimuli. Homosexual and nonhomosexual FTMs did not

   within each community were compared across communities. Furthermore, the
   relations of community, community environment (a resource-risk index),
   and the interaction of these two variables to child psychosocial
   adjustment were examined. Finally, the role of informant (mother or

   from the urban community reported more risks than those fam the rural
   community. The community environment, but not community (rural vs,
   urban), related consistently to child psychosocial adjustment but only
   when the same informant (mother or child) reported both the
   resource-risk index and child psychosocial adjustment. Community did not
   qualify this relationship. Implications for prevention and intervention

   injury and 34% of significant others reported symptoms suggestive of

   39% of significant others reported symptoms suggestive of experiencing
   mild or greater anxiety. Significant relationships were not found
   between the emotional distress of significant others and difference
   scores. Moderate-to-weak relationships were found between difference
   scores and the emotional distress of individuals with brain injury. The
   relationship between chronicity and awareness of deficits was in the
   opposite direction than predicted. The adjustment of significant others
   appears to be a function of the extent to which they perceive a

AB In what Arjun Appadurai has dubbed the 'colonial imaginary' issues of
   femininity, and who possessed it, were of prime importance. An
   orientalizing sociology sought to distinguish, and indeed to fix,
   differences between metropolitan and indigenous women as a rhetoric of
   hierarchy which secured proper and western femininity to white women.
   One critical route which colonial commentators and authorities took to
   produce that knowledge was to measure women's proximity to the practice
   of prostitution, a means which permitted discussion and judgement of
   racialized sexualities as well as of proper models of feminine
   behaviour. This article will explore the ways in which the new sociology
   of the Victorian period, wielded in a colonial context, served to
   separate women through race-based ideas of sexual behaviour and sexual
   order. It will deal with British India in the nineteenth and early
   twentieth centuries.

AB Background The siesta (afternoon nap or rest), a common traditional
   behaviour in tropical areas, may increase the risk of myocardial
   infarction (MI) since the post siesta cardiovascular response very
   closely resembles the period soon after waking up in the morning when
   the onset of acute cardiovascular events is high.
   Methods We studied 505 MI survivors and 522 randomly selected controls,
   matched for age, gender, and area of residence, in a population-based
   case-control study in Costa Pica. Participation rates were 97% for cases
   and 90% for controls. All subjects completed a physical activity
   questionnaire that included occupational and leisure time components
   with specific questions on siesta. Five siesta frequency categories
   (<1/wk, 1-4/wk, 5-6/wk, daily [greater than or equal to 1 h and <2 h],
   and daily [greater than or equal to 2 h and <3:30 h]) were used to
   calculate the odds ratio (OR) by multiple logistic regression.
   Results Compared to controls, cases were more likely to take daily
   siestas (44 versus 35%, P = 0.01), and spend more time per siesta (1:07
   +/- 0:04 versus 0:54 +/- 0:04 h:min, P = 0.002). As compared to subjects
   with the lowest siesta frequency (<1/wk), the OR for MI among those in
   the highest category was 1.51 (95% CI : 1.02-2.25, P for trend = 0.006).
   After adjusting for risk factors, lifestyle, and health history the OR
   across the siesta categories were 1.0, 0.77, 1.28. 1.66, and 1.40 (P for
   trend = 0.02).
   Conclusions Our data suggest that the practice of daily siesta is
   associated with increased risk of MI.

AB Background Many reports on Iraq suggest that a rise in rates of death
   and disease have occurred since the Gulf War of January/February 1991
   and the economic sanctions that followed it.
   Methods Four preliminary models, based on unadjusted projections, were
   developed. A logistic regression model was then developed on the basis
   of six social variables in Iraq and comparable information from
   countries in the State of the World's Children report. Missing data were
   estimated for this model by a multiple imputation procedure. The final
   model depends on three socio-medical indicators: adult literacy,
   nutritional stunting of children under 5 years, and access to piped
   water.
   Results The model successfully predicted both the mortality rate in
   1990, under stable conditions, and in 1991, following the Gulf War. For
   1996, after 5 years of sanctions and prior to receipt of humanitarian
   food via the oil for food programme, this model shows mortality among
   children under 5 to have reached an estimated 87 per 1000, a rate last
   experienced more than 30 years ago.
   Conclusions Accurate and timely estimates of mortality levels in
   developing countries are costly and require considerable methodological
   expertise. A rapid estimation technique like the one developed here may
   be a useful tool for quick and efficient estimation of mortality rates
   among under 5 year olds in countries where good mortality data are not
   routinely available. This is especially true for countries with complex
   humanitarian emergencies where information on mortality changes can
   guide interventions and the social stability to use standard demographic
   methods does not exist.

   Method: Suicide rates for Irish counties were calculated for the period

   Results: The county suicide rates were positively associated with death
   rates and the percentage of elderly population and negatively with

   population under the age of 15.
   Conclusions: There is good evidence to suggest that the official suicide

   researcher's status as an "insider" was evaluated and negotiated during

   which group members define the boundaries of the group, the attributes
   they associate with it, and the meaning of the group itself: This
   interpretation of insider status, as involving complex and ongoing

   nesting Peregrine Falcons on their structures resulted in changes in
   site management or operations. Broken windows, attacks on workers,
   sanitation and restricted access to nesting areas were examples given of
   problems affecting operations. We conclude that there is no evidence to
   indicate that removing the Peregrine Falcon from the Federal Endangered
   Species List will result in widespread loss of man-made, urban nesting
   sites in the eastern United States.

AB We explore how feminist researchers informed by standpoint theoretical
   frameworks employ the process of self-reflection to counter the
   reproduction of inequalities in ethnographic investigation. Although it
   is not a cure for this dilemma, we argue that researchers can be
   self-conscious about the ways in which they reproduce power in the
   course of their work; furthermore, sustained attention to these dynamics
   will enrich ethnographic accounts. We begin by outlining the diverse
   ways in which feminist ethnographers draw on standpoint epistemology to
   generate strong reflexive methodological strategies. Then we describe
   challenges posed by postmodern and postcolonial critics, and outline how
   feminists have contributed to these debates and have responded with
   innovative methodological strategies, especially in relation to
   self-reflexive techniques. In conclusion, we discuss how rural
   sociologists might incorporate these methodological insights into their
   ethnographic investigations.

AB I explore the incorporation of the narrative approach in sociology, the
   role of sociologist as narrator, and why this approach is unsettling to
   traditional sociology, where tension exists between the post modern
   implications of a narrative approach and our empiricist assumptions. A
   narrative approach represents an epistemological shift and should force
   us to interrogate the crucial role played by narrative in the
   construction of reality. Affirmative action provides a perfect example,
   as sociologists actively define and construct what constitutes
   affirmative action through narrative. I argue that taking narratives
   seriously is key to confronting anti-affirmative action narratives and
   denaturalizing white privilege.

AB This article extends earlier work (Ulmer 1994) in applying Johnson's
   (1991) threefold commitment framework to deviance and social control.
   The central individual-level theories of deviance (differential
   association/social learning, opportunity, social control, and labeling)
   share the generic sociological goal of theorizing continuity in lines of
   action. This suggests the centrality of the concept of commitment, and
   in fact the concept is used throughout the study of deviance and social
   control. The threefold framework provides a superior conceptualization
   of commitment for the field of deviance. In addition, it integrates
   insights from the central deviance theories and directs attention to a
   wide variety of un- and underexplored directions for further research in
   deviance and social control. In addition, I briefly discuss broader
   implications of the commitment framework for other areas of inquiry,
   such as the study of social protest and the sociology of organizations.

AB Mob sociology is a theory of crowd behavior that is found in U.S. police
   literature and that has been used to design and justify demonstration
   management practices. Mob sociology is derived from sociological
   theories about crowd behavior but ignores their originators' assertions
   that crowds occur within a larger social context. Mob sociology was
   diffused throughout the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s
   through a national civil disorder training program and a variety of
   police manuals and magazines. It is highly compatible with the escalated
   force style of protest policing and has lost much of its influence since
   the introduction of negotiated management practices. How ever, it is
   still present in police literature and training programs and should be
   replaced by contemporary social science research and theory.

   cannot study "experiencing" - religious experience in real time and its
   physical, mental, and emotional constituents and therefore must study
   retrospective accounts - linguistic representations - of religious
   experiences. It is in the nature of experiencing and its linguistic
   expression that the two are loosely coupled and therefore we do not
   study phenomenological descriptions of experiences but how an experience
   is made meaningful. On this basis, existing studies of religious
   experience are criticized, and an alternative, narrative approach to
   studying religious experience which is sensitive to its unique ontology
   is elaborated. The paper concludes with some brief suggestions for
   applying the narrative approach to studying the meaning of religious
   experience.

   depression and suicidal ideation. Elevated levels of acculturative
   stress were significantly correlated with high levels of depression and
   suicidal ideation. Family dysfunction, ineffective social support,
   nonpositive expectations concerning the future, low levels of
   religiosity, low levels of education and income, and lack of agreement
   with the decision to immigrate mere significantly associated with high
   levels of depression and suicidal ideation. The overall findings suggest
   that Central American immigrants who experience elevated levels of
   acculturative stress may be at risk for experiencing heightened levels
   of depression and suicidal ideation. The findings highlight the
   importance of using culturally relevant clinical methods when assessing
   and treating depressed and potentially suicidal acculturating

   differential identification theory to Phillips's model of copycat

   and new explanations for the link between alcohol and the social suicide
   rate. Explanations are reviewed for the major new suicide trend: after
   half a century of convergence, male and female suicide rates are
   diverging. Finally, the review notes patterns of continued stability in
   suicide research findings in areas such as racial differences and

AB Reflexivity is a well-established theoretical and methodological concept
   in the human sciences, and yet it is used in a confusing variety of
   ways. The meaning of 'reflexivity' and the virtues ascribed to the
   concept are relative to particular theoretical and methodological
   commitments. This article examines several versions of the concept, and
   critically focuses on treatments of reflexivity as a mark of distinction
   or source of methodological advantage. Although reflexivity often is
   associated with radical epistemologies, social scientists with more
   conventional leanings often speak of reflexivity as a methodological
   tool, substantive property of social systems, or soul ce of individual
   enlightenment. Radical and conventional social scientists alike tend to
   stress the importance of being reflexive. as opposed to being
   unreflexive, but they do not share a coherent conception of what 'being
   reflexive' means or entails. As an alternative to reflexive
   self-privileging. I recommend an ethnomethodological conception of
   reflexivity as an ordinary, unremarkable and unavoidable feature of
   action. The ethnomethodological conception does not support a particular
   theoretical or methodological standpoint by contrasting it to an
   'unreflexive' counterpart. It has little value as a critical weapon or
   source of epistemological advantage, which, in the present context, can
   have advantages of its own for promoting peace and epistemic democracy.

   constructions of reality. Sociological study of 'the social' is still
   relatively ahistorical, and insensitive to how temporality is embedded
   in social life. In order to reduce the discipline's inclination toward
   historical myopia, two concerns are explored: (a) its tradition of using

AB Combinational use of substances refers to taking two or more substances
   together so that they affect the person at the same rime. This pattern
   of substance use presents unique health and safety risks. Trends in
   combinational use of alcohol and marijuana or alcohol and cocaine were
   determined using data from three large comparable samples of students in
   grades 7-12, in New York State, from surveys conducted in 1983, 1990,
   and 1994. Each of the three samples was demographically diverse,
   permitting detailed analysis of trends in various adolescent subgroups
   according to gender, grade level (age), and race/ethnicity. These two
   forms of adolescent combinational use of alcohol and illicit drugs
   dropped sharply from 1983 to 1990, but increased or remained stable from
   1990 to 1994. Use of alcohol and marijuana together increased sharply
   from 1990 to 1994, much more for blacks and Hispanics than for whites,
   while use of alcohol and crack or cocaine together remained stable at a
   low level in the 1990s. Both forms of combinational use increased in the
   1990s more among younger adolescents than among older ones. Analyses
   controlling for rates of use also suggest that these forms of
   combinational use are incidental to the use of the individual
   substances, rather than uniquely sought "highs." Prevention programs
   should include warnings about the dangers of combinational use,
   especially for younger adolescents.

AB PURPOSE: Life expectancy for black Americans is five to eight years less
   than for Whites. The socioeconomic status (SES) of Blacks is also less
   than for Whites, and SES is associated with early mortality. This paper
   estimates the proportion of the racial difference in mortality
   attributable to SES by specific causes of death.
   METHODS: Data on 453,384 individuals in the National Longitudinal
   Mortality Study were used to estimate the hazard ratio associated with
   black race, with and without adjustment for income and education
   (measures of SES), in 38 strata defined by cause of death and age.
   RESULTS: For women, SES accounted for much (37-67%) of the black excess
   mortality for accidents, ischemic heart disease (ages 35-54), diabetes,
   and homicide; but not for hypertension, infections, and stomach cancers
   (11-17%). For men, SES accounted fur much of the excess risk (30-55%)
   for accidents, lune cancer, stomach cancer, stroke, and homicide; but
   not for prostate cancer, pulmonary diseases, hypertension, and
   cardiomyopathy (0-17%).
   CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm those specific causes of death likely
   to underlie the overall excess mortality of Blacks, and identify those
   causes where SES may play a large role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

   281,460 men and women, ages 45 years and older, of black and white
   races, who were part of the National Longitudinal Mortality Study
   (NLMS).
   METHODS: Major findings are based on assessments of estimated relative
   risk (RR) from Cox proportional hazards models. Duration of bereavement
   for the widowed is also estimated using the Cox model.
   RESULTS: For persons aged 45-64, each of the non-married groups
   generally showed statistically significant increased risk compared to
   their married counterparts (RR for white males, 1.24-1,39; white
   females, 1.46-1.49; black males, 1.27-1.57; and black females,
   1.10-1.36). Older age groups tended to, have smaller RRs than their
   younger counterparts. Elevated risk for nun-married females was
   comparable to that of non-married males. Fur cardiovascular disease
   mortality, widowed and never-married whits males ages 45-64 showed
   statistically significant increased RRs of 1.25 and 1.32, respectively,
   whereas each non-married group of white females showed statistically
   significant increased RRs from 1.50 ru 1.60. RRs for causes other than
   cardiovascular diseases or cancers were high (for white males ages
   45-64: widowed, 1.85; divorced/separated, 2.15; and never married,
   1.48). The importance of labor force status in determining the elevated
   risk of nun-married males compared to non-married females by race is
   shown.
   CONCLUSIONS: Each of the non-married categories show elevated RR of
   death compared to married persons, and these effects continue to be
   strong after adjustment for other sociocconomic factors. (C) 2000

AB Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of
   cognitive disturbances in Nigerian Africans with newly diagnosed
   epilepsy, prior to onset of drug therapy, Methods: A total of 60
   consecutive patients (mean age 31.6 +/- 17.4, range 14 - 55 years)
   presenting with a clinical diagnosis of epilepsy were recruited for the
   study, Sixty healthy volunteers without a history of epilepsy and who
   were age-, sex- and level of education matched with the epileptic
   patients, were recruited as controls. The administration of cognitive
   tests was done with the FePsy computerized neuropsychological test
   battery. The tests administered were the visual and auditory reaction
   times, the continuous performance test and the recognition memory tests
   to assess mental speed, attention and memory respectively. The means of
   the cognitive performances of the epileptic patients and controls were
   statistically compared. Results: Epileptic patients performed worse than
   the controls across the spectrum of cognitive tasks assessed (P =
   0.00001; P < 0.025), with the exception of the P parameter (response
   bias) of the vigilance test (P = 0.488; P > 0.025). Conclusions: The
   cognitive impairments of short-term memory, psychomotor speed and
   sustained attention observed in this study are similar to those reported
   in the literature for patients with epilepsy, The results of this study
   will be useful in the counseling of patients on their educational,
   social and vocational needs.

   work circulated. Further, the article demonstrates how certain
   experimental approaches, highly effective from a scientific point of
   view, depend upon a violent exclusion of all that is social and living
   from the scientific register. The article draws on the conceptual device

AB The development of the capacity for social attention coordination, or
   "joint attention," is a major milestone of infancy. Data from a recent
   study of handicapped infants have raised the hypothesis that the
   tendency to initiate bids for joint attention may reflect processes
   associated with the frontal cortex to a greater extent than other forms
   of infant attention coordination (R. Caplan et al., 1993). This
   hypothesis was examined in a longitudinal study of 32 normally
   developing infants. The results indicated that EEG data at 14 months
   indicative of left frontal, as well as left and right central cortical
   activity, was associated with the tendency to initiate joint attention
   bids (IJA) at 14 and 18 months. In contrast, a pattern of left parietal
   activation and right parietal deactivation at 14 months was associated
   with the development of the capacity to respond to the joint attention
   bids (RJA) of others of 14 and 18 months. These results were interpreted
   to be consistent with a general anterior-posterior model of attention
   development (M. Posner & S. Petersen, 1990). The implications of these
   results for current conceptualizations of joint attention development,
   as well as for understanding the disturbance of joint attention skill
   development in autism are discussed. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons Inc. Dev

AB Objectives: The paper presents the results of an ecological-economic
   approach to identifying community-level factors that influence the
   physical growth of young children.
   Design: A cross-sectional design was used to obtain both the
   anthropometry and the ecological-economic data.
   Setting: The sites were 24 communities located in a tea plantation near
   Bandung, West Java, Indonesia.
   Subjects: 415 children between the ages of 6 and 18 months.
   Methods: Epidemiological and ethnographic methods were used to measure
   community infrastructure and services related to child growth.
   Anthropometry was used to measure child growth. Econometric methods,
   including probit and ordinary least squares regression, were used to
   analyze the effect of community-level factors on child growth.
   Results: Community vaccination programs, child care services,
   environmental sanitation and latrines were associated with better child
   growth. We concluded that community-level goods and services
   substantially contributed to health in early childhood.

AB Objectives: This paper describes the ecological and cultural backdrop of
   the subjects enrolled in an experimental study to test the validity of a
   conceptual model about the intellectual delay of undernourished
   children.
   Design: The experiment was a 12-month clinical, randomized trial on the
   effects of early supplementary feeding on two cohorts of children
   classified as nutritionally-ar-risk. Three different supplements
   (condensed milk + micronutrients; skimmed milk + micronutrients; skimmed
   milk) were given to the children during 6 or 12 months of the study,
   Setting: The plantations are 1500-1800 m above sea level in Pangalengan,
   50 km south of Bandung, West Java. Temperature fluctuates from 10 to 17
   degrees C. A high yearly precipitation is similar to 3000 mm.
   Communities are laid out at 5-15 km from one another. Living conditions
   are modest.
   Subjects: The 156 subjects were recruited from 24 day-care-centers (DCC)
   that serviced families of 24 communities in six tea plantations. The 12-
   and 18-month-old cohorts included 73 and 83 children: respectively; each
   cohort included three subgroups that received distinct supplements.
   Observations: The interactions of the caretakers with the children in
   the DCCs were consistent with the socialization for survival mode. A
   primary concern was the physical growth, health, cleanliness, sanitation
   and safety of the children. Stimulating children, providing toys and
   initiating play or other activities that would emphasize educational
   development had a low priority.

AB Latino or Spanish-speaking individuals constitute a substantial and
   growing population in the United States, in addition to their general
   presence, with cultural variations, throughout Latin America and the
   Iberian Peninsula. To respond to the needs of this population, a Spanish
   version of the Quality of Life Index (QLI-Sp) was developed. The QLI, in
   its various language versions, is a concise instrument for
   comprehensive, culture-informed, and self-rated assessment of
   health-rated quality of life. It is composed of 10 dimensions collated
   from the international literature, including aspects ranging from
   physical well-being to spiritual fulfillment, as well as a global
   perception of quality of life. Each item is to be rated on a 10-point
   line by Latino subjects according to their culture-informed
   understanding of that concept. The study samples included 60 Latino
   psychiatric patients C20 outpatient, 20 inpatient, and 20 partial
   hospitalization) and 20 Latino actively working hospital professionals.
   Mean time of completion was 2.4 minutes among health professionals and
   3.6 minutes among patients. The vast majority of respondents (72% of
   patients and 100% of professionals) judged the instrument as easy to
   use. The test-retest reliability correlation coefficient of the &LI-Sp
   mean score was .89. The discriminant validity of the QLI-Sp was
   documented by the highly significant difference obtained between the
   mean scores of the two samples selected to represent quite different
   levels of quality of life.

AB The Unified Biosocial Theory of Personality postulates that human
   personality is organized around four temperaments Novelty Seeking, Harm
   Avoidance, Reward Dependence, and Persistence - and three characters -
   Self-Directedness, Cooperativeness, and Self-Transcendence. The
   objective of the present study was to investigate the influence of
   sociodemographic factors on temperament and character without the
   confounding influence of mental disorders. Volunteers (n = 94) did not
   meet criteria for any Axis I and Axis II diagnosis, had no first-degree
   relatives with mental disorders, and were medically healthy, After
   giving written informed consent, volunteers completed the Temperament
   and Character Inventory. Analyses were conducted to determine the degree
   of association of each sociodemographic factor (i.e., age, gender,
   ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, and occupational
   status) to personality dimension, while controlling for possible
   interactions with other sociodemographic factors. Partial correlation
   analysis showed a significant association between gender and Reward
   Dependence, and occupational status was significantly related to Reward
   Dependence, Cooperativeness, and Self-Transcendence. Stepwise regression
   analysis indicated that gender and occupational status were significant
   predictors of Reward Dependence. Occupational status was the only
   predictor of Cooperativeness and Self-Transcendence. These data suggest
   that sociodemographic factors should be considered in studies
   investigating temperaments and characters as defined by the Unified
   Biosocial Theory of Personality. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

PD MAY 2000
PY 2000
AB Objective: Taxonomies of alcoholism and antisocial behaviors based on
   developmental course converge on two-group classifications that
   emphasize early and tate onset. Typologies for users of illicit drugs
   remain to be developed. This article proposes a developmental taxonomy
   of marijuana users. Method: Cluster analysis was applied to a
   representative community sample of 708 (364 male, 344 female) marijuana
   users followed from adolescence to age 34-35. The Ward method, followed
   by relocation, was used to classify marijuana users into different types
   based on age of onset, chronicity of heavy use and persistence of use.
   ANOVA and legit analyses were utilized to describe the cluster solution
   and examine the correlates of cluster membership. Results: Four
   marijuana use clusters were identified: early onset-heavy use, early
   onset-light use, mid onset-heavy use and late onset-light use. The
   groups differed from each other in degree of involvement in marijuana
   and other drugs, sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics. The
   majority of those with early onset did not become heavily involved in
   marijuana. Unique factors were associated with membership in each group.
   Factors differentiating early from mid-onset heavy use included
   association with marijuana-using peers and having had a mental disorder.
   Peer delinquency was an additional factor differentiating early
   initiators who became heavy users from those who did not. Conclusions: A
   simple two-type classification fails to take into account the
   heterogeneity of early and late onset groups. By itself, early onset
   into marijuana will not lead to problematic use or rapid progression
   into the use of other drugs. Motivation underlying use and dysfunctional
   behaviors are associated with the development of problematic drug use
   and dependence.

AB Objective: The purpose of this longitudinal investigation was to rest
   whether higher levels of general competence are linked ro greater
   refusal assertiveness that is, in turn, related to less subsequent
   alcohol use among inner-city adolescents. Method: A large sample of
   students attending 22 middle and junior high schools in New York City
   participated. Students completed surveys at baseline, at 1-year
   follow-up and at 2-year follow-up (N = 1,459; 54% female). The students
   self-reported alcohol use, decision-making skills, self-efficacy and
   refusal assertiveness. Teams of three to live data collectors
   administered the questionnaire following a standardized protocol. The
   data were collected in school during a regular 40-minute class period.
   Results: According to the tested structural equation model, Decision
   Making (beta = .07, p < .05) and Self-Efficacy (beta = .24, p < .001)
   predicted higher Refusal Assertiveness and this greater assertiveness
   predicted less drinking at the 2-year follow-up (beta = - .21, p <
   .001). Earlier drinking predicted 2-year follow-up drinking (beta = .40,
   p < .001). Goodness-of-fit indices were excellent (chi(2) = 1107.9, 238
   df, N = 1,438, p < .001; NFI = .93, NNFI = .94, CFI = .95). Conclusions:
   The tested model had a good fit and was parsimonious and consistent with
   theory. This research highlights the importance of addressing
   decision-making skills, self-efficacy and refusal assertiveness within
   adolescent alcohol prevention programs.

PY 2000
AB Objective: An examination of gender differences in alcohol-impaired
   driving. Method: Attitudes, perceptions and behaviors concerning
   drinking and driving were compared for male and female California
   drivers in three random-digit-dialing telephone survey interviews from
   1983, 1986 and 1994 (survey response rates of 58%, 52% and 49%,
   respectively). A moral reasoning framework was applied to account for
   observed gender differences. Results: Gender differences were examined
   within aggregate data from the 1983 and 1986 surveys (n = 291), and
   within the 1994 survey data (n = 608). Self-reported drinking-driving
   violations showed a substantial decline for both men and women across
   the survey periods (although violations remained much higher for men),
   paralleling the well-documented drop in alcohol-related traffic crashes
   during this time span. Men and women responded equally to the threat of
   punishment from the legal system (threat of arrest, jail, loss of
   license, fine, increased insurance), but women were much more responsive
   to social and internal controls (perceived disapproval from friends,
   feelings of guilt, violation of a moral standard). Conclusions: These
   gender differences suggest that women may play an important role in
   strengthening broad social and moral constraints regarding
   alcohol-impaired driving. Implications of these findings to deterrence,
   the effects of sanctions, and social change are discussed.

AB Objective: The present study examined the links between alcohol use and

   behaviors occurred, and tested the notion that partner type suppresses
   the negative, direct effects of alcohol use on condom use. Method: Data
   were collected as part of face-to-face interviews conducted with 1,417
   (54% female) randomly selected young adults (aged 18-25 years) who had
   had sex in the past 6 months. Results: Using within-subjects analytic
   procedures, results showed that both drinking and condom use were more
   common with casual than with serious sexual partners, as expected.
   Moreover, consistent with the suppression hypothesis, the relationship
   between alcohol use and condom use became significant and negative only
   after controlling for partner type. Conclusions: These findings suggest
   that the interrelationships among partner type, alcohol use and condom
   use are complex and that the processes linking each pair of variables
   are best understood as part of a larger system of interconnected
   variables.

AB Objective: To report data on drinking patterns and DSM-IV alcohol and
   drug dependence among whites and Mexican Americans in treatment for
   driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). Method: Interviews were
   conducted with a sample of 250 whites and 250 Mexican Americans admitted
   to one of bye DUI treatment programs in a Northern California county.
   Interviews averaged I hour in length and were conducted in the programs
   by trained interviewers. The response rare was 72% for whites and 83%
   for Mexican Americans. Results: Whites drink most frequently, followed
   by U.S.-born Mexican Americans and, finally, by Mexican Americans horn
   in Mexico. However, rates of the amount of alcohol usually consumed are
   higher for Mexican Americans born in Mexico than for the other two
   groups. Prevalence rates of DSM-IV alcohol dependence are: 29% for
   whites. 27% for U.S.-born Mexican Americans and 9% for those burn in
   Mexico. Prevalence rates of DSM-IV drug dependence are: 23% for whites,
   24% for U.S.-born Mexican Americans and 6% for those burn in Mexico.
   Conclusions: Rates of alcohol and drug dependence in these DUI treatment
   programs are much higher than rates of dependence in the general
   population, independent of ethnicity. Patterns of alcohol consumption
   vary dramatically among whites, U.S.-born Mexican Americans and Mexican
   Americans born in Mexico. The large amounts of alcohol ingested per
   occasion by Mexican-born Mexican Americans is particularly noteworthy
   and may put them at more risk for DUI. However. drug use and drug
   dependence are higher among whites and U.S.-born Mexican Americans than
   among Mexican Americans born in Mexico.

AB As socioeconomic status (SES) increases, the incidence of low
   birthweight and preterm birth decreases irrespective of social class.
   However, low birthweight remains twice as high for African-American
   women as for white women even when SES is controlled. This study
   examines to what extent second generation high SES African-American
   women experience improvement in birthweight and gestational age. One
   hundred eighty-nine former Meharry students were surveyed. Identified
   were 934 births that are the children and grandchildren of these
   students who matriculated at Meharry. These infants are compared with a
   cohort of white mothers from a study in the School of Public Health at
   Yale University. low birthweight was reduced in the third generation
   high SES African-American children (6.9%) from the second generation
   (11.4%) but remained higher than white children (3.3%). Results showed
   that African-American third generation children remained at higher risk
   for low birthweight than were white children (relative risk [RR], 1.78;
   95% confidence interval [CI], 7.03, 3.09). Similar results were observed
   for preterm delivery where the increased risk to third generation
   African-American children was 3.16 (1.89, 5.27). Persistent strong
   ethnic differences in birthweight in this high SES cohort (OR = 3.16,
   95% Cl, 1.89-5.27) support a conclusion that African-American women have
   birthweight distributions that are somewhat lighter than white women.
   This may explain a portion of current ethnic differences in birthweight.
   It is also possible that persistent psychosocial and behavioral factors
   continue to negatively influence birthweight even in second generation
   high SES African-American mothers. This explanation will require
   identification of powerful risk factors, which are largely unrelated to
   those presently under investigation.

AB Epidemiologic studies suggest that African-American women may be less
   likely to obtain mental health services. Racial differences were
   explored in wanting and obtaining mental health services among women in
   an equal access primary care clinic setting after adjusting for
   demographics, mental disorder symptoms, and a history of sexual trauma.
   Participating in the study were women veterans at a primary care clinic
   at the Durham Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Consecutive women
   patients (n = 526) between the ages of 20 and 49 years were screened for
   a desire to obtain mental health services. Patients were given the
   Primary Care Evaluation of Menial Disorders questionnaire (PRIME-MD) and
   a sexual trauma questionnaire. Mental health service utilization was
   monitored for 12 months. The median age of the women was 35.8 years;
   54.4% of them were African-American. African-American women expressed a
   greater desire for menial health services than whites, yet mental health
   resources at the clinic were similarly used by both racial groups.
   African-American women may want more mental health services; however,
   given an equal access system, there were no racial differences in mental
   health use.

AB Despite current mammography recommendations, screening rates among
   African-American women are suboptimal. The purpose of this case-control
   study was to identify the psychological, demographic, and health care
   system barriers to screening mammography use among low-income
   African-American women. A total of 574 women with screening mammogram
   appointments at an urban hospital were interviewed to determine the
   predictors of mammogram appointment noncompliance. Predictor variables
   included. demographics; breast cancer knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and
   screening practices; and type of health care provider making the
   referral. Age was inversely related to mammogram appointment
   noncompliance. Relative to women 40 to 49 years old, women 70 years of
   age and older were the least likely to miss their appointments (odds
   ratio [OR], 0.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.2, 0.5). Women referred
   for mammography by a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner were
   less likely to miss their appointments than women referred by a
   physician (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1, 0.8). Embarrassment, lack of breast
   symptoms, and forgetfulness also contributed to noncompliance. Key
   demographic, attitudinal, and health care system Factors hinder
   low-income African-American women from obtaining screening mammograms.
   These findings have significant health education and policy implications
   for health care delivery to women in this population.

AB Among several ways of trying to suppress terrorist conspiracies,
   infiltration has probably received the least attention. Impressionistic
   evidence suggests that conspiracies that carry out violent attacks
   usually have a small number of participants, and that large conspiracies
   either fail to materialize, fail to organize actual attacks, or are
   substantially less difficult to uncover. Due to the prevalence of weak
   social ties in larger groups there may be an intermediate group size,
   around 7-10 members, that is highly subject to infiltration. Building on
   work by Freeman, Granovetter, and others, this study examines a few
   features of the social ecology of interaction ties. We introduce a
   procedure for counting, within groups of size n, all interacting pairs
   {P, Q}, where P and Q are disjoint or nonoverlapping subsets (Freeman,
   1992: 153) of a given group; these subsets usually contain more than one
   person, i.e., the interacting units do not invariably consist of
   individuals. This procedure generates interaction configurations having
   unique patterns of strong, weak, and "weakest'' ties - i.e., three
   levels of tie strength corresponding to core, primary, and secondary
   ties in Freeman's terminology - such that relatively weak ties
   predominate within larger conspiracies. We speculate about ways in which
   these configurations may evolve through time.
   We then use a combinatorial analysis of group structure to develop a
   rough calculation of the probability of infiltrating conspiracies of
   size n, and we show that relatively large conspiracies, having 7 or more
   members, tend to have interaction structures that make them highly
   vulnerable to infiltration. Finally, Collins' (1985: 170-172) approach
   to interaction-chain analysis suggests that, while in real situations it
   would be hard to anticipate departures from our probability model,
   attempts to "turn around'' conspirators with weak ties appear to have a
   fairly high prospect of success.
   But the child's sob in the silence
   Curses deeper than the strong man in his wrath.

AB Much debate concerning small-N analysis has centered on the question of
   whether this research tradition has powerful tools for assessing
   causality. Yet, recent contributions make it clear that scholars are not
   in consensus with regard to the more basic: issue of which procedures
   and underlying logic are in fact used in small-N causal assessment.
   Focusing on the field of comparative-historical analysis, this article
   attempts to clarify these procedures and logic. Methods associated with
   three major strategies of small-N causal inference are examined: nominal
   comparison, ordinal comparison, and within-case analysis. The article
   argues that the use of these three strategies within particular small-N
   studies has led scholars to reach radically divergent conclusions about
   the logic of causal analysis in small-N research. One implication of
   this argument is that methodologists must sort our the interrelationship
   between strategies of causal inference before arriving at conclusions
   about the overall strengths and limitations of small-N analysis.

AB The U.S. national civilian vulnerability to the deliberate use of
   biological and chemical agents has been highlighted by recognition of
   substantial biological weapons development programs and arsenals in
   foreign countries, attempts to acquire or possess biological agents by
   militants, and high-profile terrorist attacks. Evaluation of this
   vulnerability has focused on the role public health will have detecting
   and managing the probable covert biological terrorist incident with the
   realization that the U.S. local, state, and federal infrastructure is
   already strained as a result of other important public health problems.
   In partnership with representatives for local and state health
   departments, other federal agencies, and medical and public health
   professional associations, CDC has developed a strategic plan to address
   the deliberate dissemination of biological or chemical agents. The plan
   contains recommendations to reduce U.S. vulnerability to biological and
   chemical terrorism - preparedness planning, detection and surveillance,
   laboratory analysis, emergency response, and communication systems.
   Training and research are integral components for achieving these
   recommendations. Success of the plan hinges on strengthening the
   relationships between medical and public health professionals and on
   building new partnerships with emergency management, the military, and
   law enforcement professionals.

AB This paper describes how economists ascribe values to the things people
   can choose. The economic value of an ecosystem function or service
   relates to the contribution it makes to human welfare, where human
   welfare is measured in terms of each individual's own assessment of
   well-being. After developing how this definition is used, the paper
   describes problems and opportunities for advancing the state-of-the-art
   in measuring economic values for nature. These arguments are developed
   using recent studies that attempted to estimate economic values for
   ecosystems on a global scale. One implication of this evaluation is that
   there is a need for greater communication between ecologists and
   economists. Economic analyses must reflect the intricate web of physical
   interrelationships linking activities that have harmful effects in one
   part of an ecosystem to the potential effects on other parts. At the
   same time, economic values for ecosystems accept consumer sovereignty
   and should be interpreted as descriptions of the tradeoffs involved in
   evaluating well-defined changes to specific ecosystems.

AB This essay explores the relationship between willingness to pay (WTP)
   and whatever conception of value or benefit it may be thought to
   measure. The essay argues that WTP correlates with no conception of the
   good-no notion of better or worse-other than WTP itself. The paper
   contends that concepts such as "welfare" or "well-being," rather than
   correlating empirically with WTP, function merely as proxies or
   stand-ins for it. If WTP fails to correlate with any independently
   defined conception of value, then environmental economics fails as a
   normative science. Even if WTP provided a meaningful measure of welfare
   or benefit, it could not serve as a criterion to assess the values that
   typically underlie environmental decisions. This is true because the
   reasons-ethical, religious, scientific, and political-that lead people
   to support or oppose a social policy often have nothing to do with the
   benefits those people expect that policy to afford them. This essay
   deplores the penchant of economists to evaluate on the basis of WTP all
   policy positions except their own. As an alternative, this paper
   recommends representative political processes, such as "stakeholder"
   negotiations and collaborations, which offer deliberative, diverse, and
   therefore democratic approaches to resolving environmental disputes and
   solving environmental problems.

   significantly predicted levels of burnout among AIDS caregivers, over
   and above participants' age, perceived workload and locus of control.
   Mediation analyses further showed that external coping mediates the
   effect of locus of control on burnout, but internal coping styles do not
   exhibit mediation. Results therefore replicate and extend previous
   research demonstrating the important roles of cognitive and behavioural
   coping styles in understanding burnout among providers of AIDS care.

AB Objectives. This study sought to identify early predictors of adolescent
   violence and to assess whether they vary by sex and across different
   types and levels of violence.;
   Methods. Data from a 5-year longitudinal self-report survey of more than
   4300 high school seniors and dropouts from California and Oregon were
   used to regress measures of relational, predatory, and overall violence
   on predictors measured 5 years earlier.
   Results. Deviant behavior in grade 7. poor grades, and weak bonds with
   middle school predicted violent behavior 5 years later. Attending a
   middle school with comparatively high levels of cigarette and marijuana
   use was also linked with subsequent violence. Early drug use and peer
   drug use predicted increased levels of predatory violence but not its
   simple occurrence. Girls with low self-esteem during early adolescence
   were more likely to hit others later on: boys who attended multiple
   elementary schools were also more likely to engage in relational
   violence.
   Conclusions. Violence prevention programs for younger adolescents should
   include efforts to prevent or reduce troublesome behavior in school and
   poor academic performance. Adolescent girls may also profit from efforts
   to raise self-esteem: adolescent boys may need extra training in
   resisting influences that encourage deviant behavior. Programs aimed at
   preventing drug use may yield an added violence-reduction bonus.

   Methods. in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
   men aged 17 to 39 years were assessed for lifetime history of affective
   disorders and sexual behavior patterns. The study classified this subset
   of men into 3 groups: those reporting same-sex sexual partners, those
   reporting only female sexual partners, and those reporting no sexual
   partners. Groups were compared for histories of suicide symptoms and
   affective disorders.
   Results. a total of 2.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3%, 3.1%) of
   men reported same-sex sexual partners. These men evidenced greater
   lifetime prevalence rates of suicide symptoms than men reporting only
   female partners. However, homosexually/bisexually experienced men were
   no more likely than exclusively heterosexual men to meet criteria for
   lifetime diagnosis of other affective disorders.
   Conclusions. These data provide further evidence of an increased risk
   for suicide symptoms among homosexually experienced men. Results also
   hint at a small, increased risk of recurrent depression among gay men,
   with symptom onset occurring, on average, during early adolescence.

AB Objectives. The recently published;Atlas of United States Mortality
   depicted striking regional differences in homicide rates for Black and
   White males in the United States. This study examined these rates to
   gain an understanding of the contribution of social context to
   geographic variability in homicide.
   Methods. Homicide rates were calculated by health service area for the
   years 1988 to 1992. The contributions of age, geographic location,
   urbanization, and sociostructural characteristics were evaluated by
   means of a weighted linear mixed effects model.
   Results. Regional differences in urbanization explained much of the
   geographic variation in homicide rates, but sociostructural factors also
   had a significant impact. The results suggest that these effects operate
   similarly for White and Black males, although differences were found in
   the magnitudes of the effects for the 2 groups.
   Conclusions. Results point to a strong association between homicide and
   urbanization and socioeconomic conditions in all regions of the country
   for both Black and White males. These findings shed light on the
   potential correlates of high homicide rates in the United States in the
   near future.

AB Objectives. In this study, the prevalence of and risk factors for 12
   psychiatric disorders were examined by sex and ethnicity (Indian vs
   non-Indian) among Mexican migrant farm-workers working in Fresno County,
   California.
   Methods. Subjects aged 18 through 59 years were selected under a cluster
   sampling design (n = 1001). A modified version of the Composite
   International Diagnostic interview was used for case ascertainment. The
   effects of socio-demographic and acculturation factors on lifetime
   psychiatric disorders were tested.
   Results. Lifetime rates of any psychiatric disorder were as follows:
   men, 26.7% (SE = 1.9); women, 16.8% (SE = 1.7); Indians, 26.0% (SE =
   4.5); non-Indians, 20.1% (SE = 1.3). Total lifetime rates were as
   Follows: affective disorders. 5.7%, anxiety disorders, 12.5%; any
   substance abuse or dependence, 8.7%; antisocial personality, 0.2%.
   Lifetime prevalence of any psychiatric disorder was Iowa for migrants
   than for Mexican Americans and for the US population as a whole. High
   acculturation and primary US residence increased the likelihood of
   lifetime psychiatric disorders.
   Conclusions. The results underscore the risk posed by cultural
   adjustment problems, the potential for progressive deterioration of this
   population's mental health and the need for culturally appropriate
   mental health services.

TI Involuntary out-patient commitment and reduction of violent behaviour in

AB Background Violent behaviour among persons with severe mental illness
   (SMI) causes public concern and is associated with illness relapse,
   hospital recidivism and poor outcomes in community-based treatment.
   Aims To test whether involuntary outpatient commitment (OPC) may help to
   reduce the incidence of violence among persons with SMI.
   Method One-year randomised trial of the effectiveness of OPC in 262
   subjects with psychotic or major mood disorders and a history of
   hospital recidivism. Involuntarily hospitalised subjects awaiting OPC
   were randomly assigned to release or court-ordered treatment after
   discharge. Those with a recent history of serious assault remained under
   OPC until expiry of the court order (up to 90 days); then OPC orders
   were renewed at clinical/court discretion. Control subjects had no OPC.
   Four-monthly follow-up interviews with subject, case manager and
   collateral informant-took place and service records were collected.
   Results A significantly lower incidence of violent behaviour occurred in
   subjects with greater than or equal to 36 months' OPC. Lowest risk of
   violence was associated with extended OPC combined with regular
   out-patient services, adherence to prescribed medications and no
   substance misuse.
   Conclusions OPC may significantly reduce risk of violent behaviour in
   persons with SMI, in part by improving adherence to medications while
   diminishing substance misuse.

AB Background Of available self-rated social phobia scales, none assesses
   the spectrum of fear, avoidance, and physiological symptoms, all of
   which are clinically important. Because of this limitation, we developed
   the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN).
   Aims To establish psychometric validation of the SPIN.
   Method Subjects from three clinical trials and two control groups were
   given the 17-item, self-rated SPIN. Validity was assessed against
   several established measures of social anxiety, global assessments of
   severity and improvement, and scales assessing physical health and
   disability.
   Results Good test-retest reliability, internal consistency, convergent
   and divergent validity were obtained. A SPIN score of 19 distinguished
   between social phobia subjects and controls. The SPIN was responsive to
   change in symptoms over time and reflected different responses to active
   drugs v. placebo, Factorial analysis identified five factors.
   Conclusions The SPIN demonstrates solid psychometric properties and
   shows promise as a measurement for the screening of, and treatment
   response to, social phobia.

AB This paper falls under the rubric of the sociology of knowledge, which
   bridges the gap between phenomenological philosophy and the human
   sciences (Berger et al., 1969). It presents an empirical investigation
   of the communicative construction of psychotherapeutic reality. I
   examine therapeutic talk and psychotherapists' reconstructions of the
   transition from state socialism in Germany in 1989. In both instances I
   show how psychotherapists' commonly shared interpretative conventions
   and rules of reasoning produce typical accounts. The first part of the
   paper shows how certain interpretative conventions and rules of
   reasoning organize therapeutic talk and interaction in general. The
   second part focuses on how the interpretative conventions typical of
   therapy also inform psychotherapists' interpretations of the transition
   from state socialism.

AB Objective: We examined affective and cognitive components of body image
   related to physical appearance, weight, and health among 120 university
   men and women of three racial/ethnic groups: African American, European
   American, and Latino/a American. Method: Participants completed a
   Background Information Sheet, the Multidimensional Body-Self Relations
   Questionnaire (MBSRQ) the Body-Esteem Scale (BES) with additional items,
   and the Balanced Inventory of Desirable Responding (BIDR). We tested for
   effects of race/ethnicity and gender on the body image measures while
   controlling for age, body size, social desirability, and socioeconomic
   status (SES). Results: African Americans reported greatest body
   satisfaction and least overestimation of weight. Latino/a Americans were
   equal to or higher than European Americans on all indices. Gender
   differences occurred on global body image, weight concerns, fitness, and
   health. There were no Gender x Race/Ethnicity interactions. Discussion:
   This pattern of racial/ethnic and gender differences shows a need for
   exploring a wider range of culturally relevant body image dimensions.

AB A retrospective study was conducted on 134 HIV-infected females
   evaluated at an HIV/AIDS centre in south India to characterize their
   sociodemographics, HIV risk factors and initial clinical presentations.
   The mean age was 29 years; 81% were housewives; 95% were currently or
   previously married; 89% reported heterosexual sex as their only HIV risk
   factor; and 88% reported a history of monogamy. The majority were of
   reproductive age, thus the potential for vertical transmission of HIV
   and devastating impacts on families is alarming. Nearly half of these
   women initially presented asymptomatically implying that partner
   recruitment can enable early HIV detection. Single partner heterosexual
   sex with their husband was the only HIV risk factor for the majority of
   women. HIV prevention and intervention strategies need to focus on
   married, monogamous Indian women whose self-perception of HIV risk may
   be low, but whose risk is inextricably linked to the behaviour of their
   husbands.

AB This paper examines whether low income is a barrier to contraceptive use
   in Pakistan, a country in which economic conditions are deteriorating at
   a time when the private sector is becoming a ml,re important supplier of
   contraception. Multivariate regression analysis performed using the
   Pakistan Contraceptive Demand Survey suggests that low income is a
   deterrent to modern contraceptive use in Pakistan. This is particularly
   the case for contraceptive methods supplied through the private sector.
   It is concluded that, if the aim of family planning programmes is to
   reach low-income people, the prices of contraceptives supplied through
   the private sector should be kept as low as possible.
