AB Studies that cross the boundaries between sociology and economics help
   to enhance our understanding of both economy and society. Economics has
   had a greater influence on sociology than vice versa: several core
   subfields of sociology - such as labor market sociology, stratification,
   and work and organizations - have been significantly influenced by
   economic theories; but sociology has had relatively little impact on
   economics. Communication between economics and sociology is hindered by
   intellectual barriers such as fundamentally different assumptions with
   regard to the roles of induction and deduction, as well as by
   institutional and professional obstacles. Opportunities are growing for
   integrating sociological and economic explanations, as the interests of
   sociologists and economists are converging and more work is now
   occurring on the border between the two disciplines.

AB This article maps out some interdependencies between political science
   and political sociology. It then details some lessons that political
   sociologists might take from four contemporary literatures in political
   science: (1) rational choice work on rational individual action in
   institutional context; (2) the ''nonlinear social systems'' literature
   on the contextual determination of intensely embedded social actions;
   (3) the game-theoretic literature on strategic interactions among large
   emergent class and state actors; and (4) a more qualitative inductive,
   and contextualized approach to the analysis of class and state action
   extending the tradition of Barrington Moore. The four literatures share
   a commitment to social action that is decreasingly common among
   sociologists. Yet they address questions of institutional constraint,
   contextual dynamics, and macrosocial history akin to those that are
   engaging their sociological contemporaries. This balance of attention
   between action and its constraints is the common element drawn from the
   several instructive political science literatures.

AB In the area of social psychology, sociologists have drawn more
   frequently from psychologists than the reverse. This is in part because
   sociologists more often assess the degree to which status
   characteristics, social relationships, and structural contexts influence
   individuals' thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, while psychologists more
   often explicate the mechanisms through which such social factors affect
   individuals. I illustrate these differences by discussing points of
   parallel theoretical development between the two disciplines,
   substantive divisions of labor, and selected topics of mutual inquiry.
   Although sociologists benefit substantially from psychologists' work,
   sociologists could offer their counterparts more pointed demonstrations
   that sociological mechanisms are crucial for explaining key
   psychological phenomena and that structural contexts constrain
   individuals' behaviors in ways often overlooked by psychologists.

AB Often mischaracterized as merely the application of social theory to
   past events and happenings, historical sociology is actually a distinct
   way of approaching, explaining, and interpreting general sociological
   problems. By situating social action and social structures in their
   historical contexts and by examining their historical unfoldings,
   historical sociologists exploit the temporality of social life to ask
   and answer questions of perennial importance to social theory. I draw on
   recent research and literature both in sociology and in history to argue
   that we should and can continue to deepen the discipline's ''historical
   turn'' by more thoroughly historicizing how we conduct research,
   understand and use basic analytic concepts, and develop and test general
   social theories.

AB We argue that sociology should be the integrative discipline for the
   scientific study of religion. Sociology has made considerable progress
   by incorporating specialized knowledge of religion from disciplines
   ranging from gerontology and community psychology to religious
   economics, church history, and even theology. Sociology has also
   generated insights in other disciplines concerned with the study of
   religion, at times shaping the types of questions asked, the concepts
   and research methods employed, and the conclusions reached in these
   fields. To elaborate our arguments, iue focus on two important
   substantive areas: (1) research on the relationships between religion,
   meaning systems, and personal well-being; and (2) research on religious
   behavior and religious markets. We underscore the integrative role of
   sociology, and identify several neglected opportunities for synthesis.
   In addition, briefly assess the effect of sociology on work in other
   disciplines and on the functioning of religious organizations.

   environments that have traditionally prevailed in the Black communities
   of the rural South and urban non-South. We emphasize regional variations
   in (1) the social role of religious institutions, (2) the availability
   of alternative lifestyles and secular opportunities for status and
   resources, and (3) the social norms and community expectations regarding
   church involvement A series of hypotheses regarding patterns and
   correlates of church participation are then tested, using data from the
   National Survey of Black Americans. Findings indicate that historical
   regional variations in African American religious life persist in the
   contemporary period. Moreover, our results suggest that the rural
   southern Black church retains ifs traditional ''semi-involuntary''
   character and we discuss the broader theoretical implications of this
   issue for future research in the sociology of religion.

   strategies for overcoming our poor public image.  Seven strategies for

AB The theory of demographic transition served as the principal descriptive
   tool for fertility change in developing nations for more than 30 years.
   Weaknesses of the theory as both a descriptive and an explanatory
   framework have led largely to its rejection. While a number of
   alternative frameworks have been suggested, none has received the
   widespread support once accorded transition theory. This analysis
   reviews transition theory and argues for the theoretical importance of
   institutional factors in fertility decline. Sub-Saharan Africa serves as
   the locus of the analysis because it remains the world region with the
   highest fertility and the one in which the transition is just beginning.
   The organization of agricultural production is hypothesized to be
   important for fertility behavior and is identified as one of three
   institutional areas in which rural sociology may be uniquely qualified
   to contribute.

   reactivation and global application of two nearly forgotten
   subdisciplines:  sphragistics, that is, the discipline that investigates
   ideas and practices related to the use of seals and signet rings; and
   ekistics, that is, the scientific study of human settlements.  Among the
   subconcepts that are elaborated in service to these developments are
   home territorialization, boundaried communication, and the
   territorialization of the body politic.  Examples are drawn from
   post-cold war developments in Eastern Europe.

AB Schumpeter's writings on the transition from capitalism to socialism, on

   Although Schumpeter's theoretical and sociological writings resemble the
   works of Marx, Durkheim and Weber in that they further our understanding
   of the rise and nature of modern society, his contribution to social
   theory has yet to be assessed systematically, Arguing that Schumpeter's
   perspective, if understood in social theoretical terms, provides a
   promising starting point for the sociological analysis of the changing
   relationship between economy and society, I concentrate on two elements
   of his work that are of value to theoretical sociology today: the
   distinction between creative action and rational action that is
   fundamental to his theory of the entrepreneur and his thesis that the
   success of the capitalist system leads to its demise.

   extending his theory of the conscious subject to the feminist concern
   with the issue of domination. We present a theoretical analysis of the
   subjective and intersubjective experiences of individuals relating to
   each other as dominant and subordinate; as our theoretical point of
   departure we use Schutz's concepts of the we-relation, the assumption of
   reciprocity of perspectives, typification, working,
   taken-for-grantedness, and relevance. Schutz's sociology of the
   conscious subject is striking in its lack of any extended consideration
   of power; perhaps one reason why support for his work has diminished
   since the mid-1970s. Our overlayering of feminist sociological theory's
   interest in domination with Schutz's concerns about subjectivity and
   intersubjectivity produces an elaboration and a critique of Schutz and
   expands feminist understanding of relationships of domination.

PD 1995
PY 1995
AB There is increasing sociological interest in formal models of action
   driven by a calculus of expected utility. We believe these efforts to
   extend microeconomic models to extraeconomic exchange can benefit from
   specification of societal constraints on individual choice. One type of
   constraint locates the actor in an evolving network of social ties that
   limit opportunities for exchange. Another approach assumes that choices
   are influenced by unintended outcomes that operate behind the backs of
   the actors. Considerable progress has been made in the past two years
   incorporating social structure and unintended consequences into formal
   models based on individual choice optimization. We critically examine
   leading contributions to network exchange theory (part 1) and
   evolutionary models of collective action (part 2), and assess how these
   and related developments may shape the future of rational choice theory
   and its place within sociology.

   recommendations are made concerning the strengthening of the profession.
   While recognizing the challenges faced by sociology, this appraisal
   suggests that negative perceptions within the discipline concerning

AB In Goffman's introduction to Interaction Ritual, he implores
   sociologists ''to identify the countless patterns and natural sequences
   of behavior occurring whenever persons come into one another's immediate
   presence.''  This article, in addressing Goffman's entreaty, amalgamates
   a number of sociological theories on interaction ritual from Durkheim
   and Goffman with others in contemporary literatures in the sociology of
   emotions and social psychology to describe a set of ''patterns and
   natural sequences of behavior'' imbedded in voices of interaction
   partners.  These patterns are shown to establish an element of social
   structure, and this research describes an objective method of
   identifying and measuring this element that previously was known on a
   qualitative basis alone.  A social status ordering pattern founded upon
   interpersonal deference and power relations is identified through
   analysis of acoustic energy levels in voices of interview partners. 
   Nonverbal measures are performed using a dual-channel Fast Fourier
   Transform analyzer and results are explained using a carrier spectrum
   model.  This report sets forth an interesting new way of objectively
   measuring the macro social constraints on micro interaction.

AB Retracing my own research experience in creating a sociological
   narrative about a famous industrial engineer and mother, I describe how
   I began to question modernist images of self, interests, and power. As I
   reflected on how best to characterize Gilbreth's management of women, I
   began to see that my notion of how to write critical, historical
   biography rested heavily on a binary, modernist conceptual foundation.
   My research experience rocked this foundation by convincing me that we
   should see selves as multiple and interests as malleable, and that we
   should broaden our conception of power to include disciplinary power
   which circulates through people rather than belonging to them. The paper
   concludes by affirming the merits of new ways of writing about people
   that acknowledge their multiple selves without sacrificing the political
   strength of modernist language.

AB We formulate a comprehensive theory that accounts for variation in the
   perception of time. According to our theory, lived time is perceived to
   pass slowly (protracted duration) when conscious information processing
   is high; lived time is perceived to be synchronized with clock time
   (synchronicity) when conscious information processing is moderate; and
   lived time is perceived to have passed quickly (temporal compression)
   when conscious information processing is low. We examine that portion of
   the theory concerning temporal compression in light of empirical
   materials. Since episodic memory erodes as time passes, we hypothesize
   that this generates the experience of temporal compression by lowering
   the density of conscious information processing. Our data were drawn
   from three different age cohorts, and we find strong support for the
   hypothesis.

AB The social philosophy of meaning and emotions represented in the work of
   Susanne Langer was recognized by Talcott Parsons, but has yet to be
   incorporated into mainstream sociological theoritizations.  Langer's
   work is as potentially important to contemporary microsociology, and the
   sociology of emotions, as the work of Peirce, Mead, or Schutz.  The
   impediment to appreciating her work resides in contemporary confusions
   regarding the nature of logic.  Sociologists often subscribe to
   Wittgenstein's denial of the validity of formal logic in constructing
   theories of human behavior.  Langer has been misunderstood because her
   theoretizations address more than discursive logics and meanings.  The
   thrust of Langer's work is that logic and meaning exist on a
   nondiscursive level of emotions.  Though her work is more than 50 years
   old, we are now in a position to appreciate it because we are now
   exploring and conceptualizing the notion of social inferencing as
   existing beyond formal logic.

AB Recent research has revealed that war-making has played an important
   role in molding society and has precipitated a new look at
   state-building, the relationship between the state and society, and the
   ties between war-making and capitalism. In this study, I illuminate
   weaknesses in the received view of regional processes, and I demonstrate
   the value of bringing the state into analyses of regional
   transformation. Case studies of the steel industry, airframe
   manufacturers, and military installations contrast pre- and postwar
   trends to determine if the state's World War II investments transformed
   regional processes or if wartime investments merely reinforced processes
   that were already underway. For the steel industry, the
   civilian-oriented and economistic reasoning of the received view of
   regional processes is most persuasive. In contrast, the state's wartime
   logistic and strategic priorities molded the dramatic expansion of U.S.
   military bases during the war-growth machine politics played an
   important secondary role. The airframe industry offers the most
   interesting case-the economic influences on this industry intersected
   with both military and political factors. Thus, this study provides
   evidence that regional processes are molded by the overlapping, and at
   times competing, needs for use of space by economic, political, and
   military actors. The immediate lesson is that it is important to bring
   the study of war-making into the sociological mainstream.

AB In a thought-provoking appraisal of the state of macrosociological
   theory, Gerhard Lenski argues that its shortcomings can be rectified, in
   part, by reference to nomological reasoning. Moreover, developments in
   behavioral ecology, evolutionary biology, and population genetics offer
   interesting insights into analyses of social behavior across time and
   space and, in the process, reveal some useful hints about the manner in
   which sociocultural theorists might proceed in developing more elegant
   theoretical statements. With these considerations in mind, the argument
   elaborated in this essay suggests: (1) that contemporary sociocultural
   science has much to contribute to the development of a general theory of
   social behavior; (2) that theory refinement in the sociocultural
   sciences can be enhanced significantly by reference to general
   principles (specifically, an amended version of the ''maximization
   principle'') developed in recent years in the evolutionary behavioral
   sciences; and (3) that reliance on such general analytical principles is
   enormously helpful in clarifying some seemingly troublesome theoretical
   problems in, for example, studies of social demography and human ecology
   and of social stratification and mobility.

AB Outside of sociology, evolutionary theory is once again commanding

   unaware that the field has prospered and is now a respected,
   interdisciplinary science with a growing number of influential scholars
   within the social sciences. This article takes a critical look at
   sociobiology with a consideration of both its historical origins and its
   now modified theoretical stance, which is exemplified by Timothy
   Crippen's article 'Toward a Neo-Darwinian Sociology.'' In addition, this
   essay summarizes an alternative approach that might be called
   ''evolutionary sociology. '' While it also incorporates the Modem
   Synthesis, it uses established sociological methods and theory, along
   with primate data and the fossil and archaeological records, to consider
   the biological legacy of humankind.

   the reactions of Freese and Maryanski to my essay on neo-Darwinian

   these general reservations are grounded in an unnecessary fear of
   resurgent Social Darwinism, unwarranted concerns regarding determinism
   and reductionism, unjustified allegations of teleology and tautology,
   and/or general misconceptions of the logic and principles of

AB The article begins by underscoring the widely noted ''sociological

   be susceptible to resolution through an application of a general law
   pertaining to a neighboring science (sociobiology in our case). From
   here, the article proceeds to pinpoint the basic argument of Professor
   Crippen's article (this issue) and then critically examines the two
   articles that critically accompany it. We find some errors of
   interpretation in Professor Maryanski's article, but on the whole it is
   a constructive critique of Crippen's essay and a related invitation to a
   biologically informed evolutionary sociology. By contrast, Professor
   Freese's interminable article fails to confront Crippen's argument and
   in the process offers a tortuous, tendentious itinerary of politically
   correct interpretations of scientific inquiry in general and

AB Historical sociologists have been property critical of the tendency
   within the social sciences to ignore temporality and, consequently,
   historical contingency in social processes. These critical assessments
   have generated alternative formal research methods that either (a)
   continue to use variable-centered procedures but allow relations between
   variables to change through time, or (b) abandon variable-centered
   procedures altogether and move exclusively to event-centered analyses.
   After considering alternative conceptions of historically contingent
   determination that may be produced by two different formal methods
   (time-varying parameter regression and event structure analysis), the
   authors design a combined strategy that temporally nests interdependent
   forms of contingency and illustrates the approach in an empirical
   analysis of the  ''relief explosion'' in the late 1960s. Contrary to
   exhortations for exclusivist strategies, the results suggest that
   variable-centered and event-centered methods can be fruitfully combined
   In particular event structure analysis is shown to be a useful
   qualitative procedure for ''unpacking'' and interpreting quantitative
   turning points in time-varying parameter time series models. This
   strategy allows macroquantitative and historical/cultural processes to
   be integrated with formal methods.

AB Why has W.E.B. Du Bois not mattered more in sociology?  In addition to
   being on the short list of the 20th century's most influential public

   intellectual contributions as a sociologist and social theorist.  Among
   his nearly 2000 published writings, The Philadelphia Negro and Souls of
   Black Folk have all the qualities of classic works.  Yet, neither has
   been officially canonized by sociology.  The exclusion of Du Bois can be
   explained with tolerable plausibility by reference to his two key
   concepts in Souls of Black Folk:  the veil and the double-self.  One can
   only wonder what might have been significantly different about
   sociology, especially its theories of the Self and of field studies of
   race, had William James's most important student been allowed to matter.

   the novels as well as the conventional texts of political theory, it
   reveals a political program for reform of the ancient regime.  This
   reform is founded on a reform of domestic mores.  Rousseau's attendant
   conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more
   unified than that found in modern sociology.  Rousseau shows that the
   domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a ''modern''

   explain the process by which style comes to be known, I choose the case
   of Thorstein Veblen's The Theory of the Leisure Class, published in
   1899.  I demonstrate that style was always important in the
   interpretation of his work, and that this ''classic'' can be read as
   literature, scholarly discourse, humor, or poor writing-or a combination
   thereof.  A consensus on the qualities of Veblen's style has never
   emerged.  Focusing on claims emphasizing Veblen's irony, I suggest that
   an ironic interpretation is particularly likely when an author analyzes
   those with superior status.

AB Work on the effects of department location on publishing has been
   disproportionately based on the ''hard sciences,'' disciplines dependent
   on expensive equipment. The present work explores productivity in
   sociology, a less capital-intensive discipline. An ordinary least
   squares analysis of the careers of 100 PhD graduates from the class of
   1976 finds that sustained employment in a Doctor of Philosophy
   (PhD)-level department is associated with increased productivity. The
   amount of variance explained is similar to that in studies of the hard
   sciences. This suggests that human resources and incentive systems in
   sociology are salient to publishing. Unlike the hard sciences, however,
   gender was unrelated to productivity.

AB The current depiction of ''Hispanic'' women in introductory sociology
   textbooks is distorted.  Problematic, although well-intentioned,
   strategies of presenting introductory material exclude, homogenize,
   segregate, and focus on disadvantage.  Phrases, tables, and photographs
   from several introductory sociology textbooks are cited as examples. 
   Employing a feminist interpretive analysis, this paper demonstrates the
   need for revision of sociology texts to avoid the use of these four
   problematic and distorting presentational strategies and instead move
   towards inclusion, specification, integration, and portrayal of
   advantage.

   requirements, are fast becoming an integral part of undergraduate
   education in American universities.  This newly created requirement
   imposes a number of demands on comparative multicultural courses,
   including courses on sociology of race and ethnicity.  In this essay we
   identify the challenges to curriculum development posed by the sociology
   of race and ethnicity as a specific example of a comparative
   multicultural course.  We show how conventional course design, which is
   group-oriented, is less likely to fulfill the new demands and challenges
   confronting comparative multicultural courses.  We propose a new,
   concept-oriented course design and provide suggestions for
   implementation.

   reforms, including the destructuring of the bipolar world of the Cold
   War era, the adoption of market economies to replace centrally planned
   economies, and the democratisation of authoritarian regimes.
   Essentially, this paper argues that the turbulent transition period of
   this decade is one that may be characterised as a 'new world of new
   worlds', presenting a vast ensemble of challenges for the sociological
   analysis of modernity. A historical perspective with previous periods of
   transition from one social order to the next is proposed, as well as a
   discussion of salient general socio-psychological features of the
   contemporary situation, such as changes in collective identity. Finally,
   attention is given to a methodological approach suitable to make sense
   of our world situation.

   development in metropolitan communities and analyzes factors associated
   with the development of producer services in two deindustrializing urban
   communities - the primary metropolitan statistical areas (PMSAs) of
   Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Sample surveys of producer services in each
   metropolitan area reveal that establishments: (1) tend to be primarily
   dependent upon the revenue generated by local trade within the local
   metropolitan area; (2) tend to simultaneously engage in nonlocal trade
   and directly contribute to interurban integration and dominance of large
   metropolitan centers; and (3) engage most extensively in trade, both
   locally and nonlocally, with other service-sector industries, rather
   than manufacturing. These findings suggest that producer services
   development may be sustained in deindustrializing urban communities and
   that it is not primarily dependent upon trade with locally based
   manufacturing industry.

AB Data from the 1984 Carnegie survey of faculty at U.S. universities show
   substantial disciplinary variation in perceptions that one's field is
   stagnant. We examine the extent to which variation in pessimism about
   the intellectual state of one's field can be explained by theories that
   attribute it to field-level variation in anomie and consensus. We also
   examine the effects of individual-level characteristics on disciplinary
   discontent using a multilevel analysis. We find that both anomie and
   consensus exert strong effects on the average levels of scholarly
   pessimism within fields. In addition, there is an interaction effect
   involving the level of consensus in a field and whether the field is
   primarily pure or applied. The multilevel analysis shows that the
   effects of field-level variables are not attributable to compositional
   differences in individual characteristics and that, as a group, the
   field-level variables are stronger determinants of scholarly pessimism
   than individual characteristics.

   article on country music and suicide. First, Mauk et al.'s charge that
   suicide is an individual act that cannot be assessed through group
   statistics is a paradigmatic critique that can be leveled against the
   bulk of sociological work on suicide. The position of Mauk et al. is
   precisely that which Durkheim ([1897] 1966) polemicized against in order
   to legitimate the discipline of sociology in the nineteenth century.
   Second, their notion that ''psychological autopsies'' constitute the
   only legitimate methodology for studying suicide is an overstatement.
   Third, the noted ecological fallacy problems can, in fact, be remedied
   through properly specified models. Many ecological relationships
   involving suicide have been replicated with individual-level data.
   Fourth, the charges that our subcultural argument is ''barely implied'
   and that the notion of a country music subculture is a myth are
   inaccurate. We reiterate our subcultural theory as well as the evidence
   in support of such a subculture.

   if not the most. Departmental struggles, which have led to sociologists
   complaining to administrators about each other, have put the field in
   bad repute among campus officials and have endangered its survival in
   some schools. The American Sociological Society and American
   Sociological Association have been among the most conflict-ridden
   associations in academe for generations. Severe internecine struggles
   have a long history in the field. It may be suggested that they are
   related to the propensity of the field to attract social reformers and
   political activists. But hard evidence indicates sociology graduate

AB We examine the conditions that affected the progressivity of the
   individual income tax in the United States between 1916 and 1986. A
   multivariate time-series analysis shows how macroeconomic conditions,
   state imperatives, the organizational capacities of social classes, and
   political conditions have affected the progressivity and the symbolic
   component of the income tax. Progressivity is measured by the difference
   between the effective tax rates paid by moderate income and very high
   income families. The symbolic component of this tax is measured by the
   difference between the nominal tax rate and effective income tax rate
   paid by very high income families. The results reveal that changes in
   tax progressivity are due largely to macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions, such as unemployment, economic development, and budget
   deficits, although the organizational capacities of social classes and
   political conditions, such as labor organization and political
   participation, also have effects. Changes in progressivity are due
   primarily to adjustments in the rates paid by very high income families.
   However the impacts of these conditions on tax progressivity changed
   somewhat when the federal income tax was transformed into a mass tax
   during World War II. Finally, political conditions have a relatively
   greater effect on the symbolic component of the income tax than on
   progressivity. Overall, this analysis supports a structural theory of
   the state in which the influences of politics and social classes on
   revenue extraction are circumscribed by macroeconomic and state fiscal
   conditions.

AB We introduce the concept of defiant behavior: actions that, although
   often defined politically as crime, are defined by their actors as
   necessary, legitimate, and morally appropriate. We then link this
   concept to two distinct substantive subfields of sociology: (1)
   criminology and the sociology of deviance and social control, and (2)
   political sociology and the sociology of social movements. A review of
   the literature on organized defiance suggests a clear theoretical
   confluence between the microstructural concept of biographic
   availability, drawn from the resource mobilization and political process
   perspectives within the sociology of social movements, and social
   control theories of crime and deviance. Likewise, there is a similar
   confluence between the socialization effects of prior activism, also
   from the resource mobilization perspective, and differential
   association/social learning theory in criminology. Finally, we present
   results from a study of the defiant activities of some members of the
   sanctuary movement. The form of defiance examined here, the smuggling of
   undocumented Central Americans across the United States-Mexico border,
   provides a unique test of the scope and power of both social control and
   social learning theories.  Based on self-report survey data collected
   form a sample of 141 participants in the Tuscon, Arizona, sanctuary
   movement, our findings provide strong support for social learning theory
   but fail to support social control theory.  In fact, the observed
   effects of the control theory variables are generally in a direction
   opposite to that predicted by the theory.  Implications of the study for
   the theoretical development of criminology and deviance and for the
   sociological study of social movements are discussed.

AB Most students learn how sociologists study class in introductory
   sociology courses. This exposure also influences how students think
   about class stratification; thus it is important to know how
   Introductory textbooks portray this stratification. Sociologists
   conceptualize class in two principal ways. Distributional approaches
   depict classes as aggregates of individuals possessing some criterion
   (e.g., income). These conceptions label people descriptively, but cannot
   designate the social forces at work in class stratification, Relational
   approaches focus on relations of control and subordination which are
   established through interactions; they highlight the potential for
   conflict among classes as well as the existence of a system of
   oppression and privilege. Both approaches teach students about
   inequality, but in very different terms. A content analysis shows that
   depictions of class stratification in 15 introductory texts are
   overwhelmingly distributional This finding has implications for how
   instructors portray class stratification in contemporary societies.

   the same professor, during the fall 1992 semester In each class,
   students were randomly assigned to one of two groups. a journal-writing
   group or an attendance group. In one class, journals were collected
   three times a semester on random, unannounced dates; in the other class,
   journals were collected at the end of the semester, on the day of the
   final. Essay examinations and multiple-choice examinations were given.
   Attendance was recorded in each class. It was hypothesized that students
   who kept journals would ha ve significantly higher test scores than
   students who did not keep journals, and that students who kept journals
   in the class in which journals were routinely collected would have
   higher test scores than students who kept journals in the class in which
   journals were collected only at the end of the semester Neither
   hypothesis was supported, but number of absences and prior grade point
   average did explain variances in essay scores and multiple-choice
   scores. This finding suggests that professors may be justified in
   requiring attendance as a strategy for increased learning.

AB A theoretical framework is provided to understand a cultural group's

   framework draws on a social constructionist perspective that includes
   aspects of phenomenology and symbolic interactionism to define
   ''landscape'' as the symbolic environment created by a human act of
   conferring meaning on nature and the environment. This landscape
   reflects the self-definitions of the people within a particular cultural
   context. Attention is directed to transformation of the physical
   environment into landscapes that reflect people's definitions of
   themselves and on how these landscapes are reconstructed in response to
   people's changing definitions of themselves. Case studies from sociology
   and anthropology illustrate the social construction of nature and the
   environment. A discussion of the applied implications of the theoretical
   framework in social impact assessment and the global implications in the
   shifting power struggle over competing landscapes concludes the paper.

AB Secularization is most productively understood not as declining
   religion, but as the declining scope of religious authority. A focus on
   religious authority (1) is more consistent with recent developments in
   social theory than is a preoccupation with religion; (2) draws on and
   develops what is best in the secularization literature; and (3) reclaims
   a neglected Weberian insight concerning the sociological analysis of
   religion. Several descriptive and theoretical ''pay-offs'' of this
   conceptual innovation are discussed: new hypotheses concerning the
   relationship between religion and social movements; the enhanced
   capacity to conceptually apprehend and empirically investigate
   secularization among societies, organizations, and individuals; and
   clearer theoretical connections between secularization and other
   sociological literatures. Ironically, these connections may indeed spell
   the end of secularization theory as a distinct body of theory, but in a
   different way than previously appreciated.

AB Durkheim's doctoral dissertation can justifiably be called sociology's
   first classic. Rereading it 100 years later enables us to see major
   domains of the contemporary world where its analysis remains, of
   actuality, heuristic or yet to be fully appreciated: for example, its
   themes of anomie as economic deregulation and corporatism as an
   institutional arrangement to deal with anomie. At the same time,
   Durkheims discourse reflects its historical embeddedness, such as his
   discussion of the sexual division of labor, which needs to be reworked.
   A second feature of emergent contemporary social solidarity unforeseen
   by Durkheim (and the great majority of theorists of change) is what may
   be termed ''the return of mechanical solidarity.

AB The source of social life, according to Durkheim, is the similitude of
   consciousnesses and the division of labor. The former is best evident
   among primitive societies where a ''mechanical solidarity,'' evidenced
   by repressive law, prevails; the latter in advanced societies where
   populations evidence greater ''dynamic density,'' and juridical rules
   define the nature and relations of functions. In combating individualism
   and basing the existence of societies on a ''consensus of parts, ''
   Durkheim refutes his positivistic emphasis which denies the relevance of
   ends to a scientific study of society. In his discussion of social ends
   is a latent anti-mechanistic trend. The theory of unilinear development
   is established on deficient ethnographic data. It assumes the absence of
   division of labor among primitive societies and of any ''mechanical
   solidarity'' among modem societies. Repressive and restitutive law
   Durkheim seeks to use as indexes of mechanical and organic solidarity,
   but he does not establish with any precision the perfect associations
   which he assumes obtain between his types of solidarity and of law.

AB What was Durkheim doing-in the sense of an intended social action-in
   writing De la Division du travail social? At least a part of the answer
   is that Durkheim's project was linguistic-i.e., he was attempting to
   replace an outworn vocabulary of Cartesian metaphysics with a more
   Germanic lexicon-one in which simplicity gave way to complexity, the
   abstract to the concrete, the ideal to the real deduction to induction,
   rationalism to empiricism, and so on. To some extent, this was motivated
   by the superiority-widely acknowledged among intellectuals of the Third
   Republic-of German science and Protestant scientific education. But an
   additional motivation was Durkheim's belief that only a real, concrete
   entity-society as a ''thing'' (chose)-could provide an object worthy of
   the veneration of the ''new man'' of the Republic. Durkheim's attempt to
   construct a science of social facts was therefore itself subsidiary to
   another, ''higher'' purpose-i.e., the construction of a moral authority
   (real, concrete, complex) adequate to the needs of the Third French
   Republic. Rather than an end in itself, Durkheim's sociology should thus
   be seen as a means to other ends-i.e., the ''construction'' of a
   particular kind of ''fact''-within a specific social and historical
   context.

AB A classic text is not always canonized. Canonical texts are frequently
   anything but classics. Durkheim's Division of Labor in Society is an
   instance of the former; his Rules of Sociological Method of the latter.
   Both books are based on errors of fact and method. Division of Labor was
   so intentionally the classical theory of modern divided societies that
   Durkheim, son of generations of rabbis, totally misrepresented the facts
   of Ancient Israel. In Rules, Durkheim was so intent on writing the
   canonical text of sociology's methods that he stipulated rules that even
   he (in Suicide) could not use. Durkheim was thus a giant of the
   sociological past because, not in spite of, his errors. He erred because
   he dared to think seriously about the moral issues of his time. Hence,
   the ironic fate of Durkheim's sociology-it led in two different
   directions. From Rules and Suicide came modern empirical sociology. From
   Elementary Forms came all the antimodernists-beginning with
   Levi-Strauss, and from him, Derrida and the others-who became, among
   other things, the most articulate critics of the sociology Durkheim
   helped invent. Such is the genius of classic, if not canonical, authors
   like Durkheim.

AB Sociologists have begun to explore the gains for theory and research
   that might be achieved by artificial intelligence technology:  symbolic
   processors, expert systems, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and
   classifier systems.  The first major accomplishments of artificial
   social intelligence (ASI) have been in the realm of theory, where these
   techniques have inspired new theories as well as helping to render
   existing theories more rigorous.  Two application areas for which ASI
   holds great promise are the sociological analysis of written texts and
   data retrieval from the forthcoming Global Information Infrastructure. 
   ASI has already been applied to some kinds of statistical analysis, but
   how competitive it will be with more conventional techniques remains
   unclear.  To take advantage of the opportunities offered by ASI,
   sociologists will have to become more computer literate and will have to
   reconsider the place of programming and computer science in the
   sociological curriculum.  ASI may be a revolutionary approach with the
   potential to rescue sociology from the doldrums into which some
   observers believe it has fallen.

   shortsighted. By allowing the FTA to remain invisible, we forgo the

   and we allow the quality of our students' classroom experiences to be
   compromised in ways that, as sociologists, we could easily anticipate
   and avoid. We need data on the role that FTAs play in undergraduate
   instruction in sociology in the United States. To realize the
   contribution that FTAs can make to internationalizing our curriculum, we
   need to approach the FTA problem as sociologists, involve both
   undergraduates and FTAs in the analysis of this problem, and work toward
   incorporating both groups into a sociological community of discourse.

   the master's house.'' In this paper, however we encourage women to seize
   computer tools for their own educational purposes in order to counteract
   the ''null environment'' they experience in the traditional classroom.
   We argue for a proactive feminist pedagogy that enhances women's
   computer learning by demystifying the computer and promoting
   technological equity in the classroom. To accomplish these goals, we
   introduce a quantitative and a qualitative software program which help
   to create a proactive environment that enhances women's computerized
   learning when used in conjunction with feminist pedagogical techniques.
   We also discuss the implications of introducing feminist proactive
   computer learning into the sociology curriculum and, more specifically,
   into the women's studies classroom.

   benefits as well as problems of this testing procedure are discussed.
   Faculty members see many practical benefits of using computer-based
   testing in the introductory course, while reporting that educationally
   it is at least as sound as in-class testing. Students generally like the
   flexibility of computer-based testing and find it easy to use. The
   biggest problem is that grades tend to be lower than on in-class tests.
   Alternative uses of computer-based testing also are presented.

   frames ''resonate '' with broad cultural beliefs. I analyze the rhetoric
   in media accounts from 1985 to 1990 of the dangers posed to children and
   society by heavy metal music and rap music. I also examine the images
   used to amplify each genre of music. Although both genres have lyrical
   and performance elements focusing on sex and defiance of authority
   strong enough to evoke a moral outcry, they evoke quite different
   reactions. I argue that the racial composition of the music's audiences
   and producers shape the way the two genres are perceived.

AB Americans watch a great deal of television. But the factors
   traditionally considered to determine or explain television
   usage-availability of free time, low income or class status, low
   education, emotional difficulties, and lack of structured social
   interactions-are not generalizable across the adult life span. The
   television viewing of people over the age of 30 has been understudied-a
   research bias that mirrors society's youth orientation and essentially
   excludes older adults from this model. The author analyzed data
   collected in the National Opinion Research Center's 1988 General Social
   Survey to assess the determinants of television viewing for adults of
   all ages. Results indicate that as persons perceive themselves to be in
   different stages of life and take on age-appropriate roles, tasks, and
   perspectives, they have distinctively different reasons for viewing.
   Second, the factors considered to determine TV viewing in the
   ''traditional'' model fit the pattern of younger adults' viewing best
   while predicting the behavior of the elderly least. The author proposes
   an interpretation of the findings, and discusses future research avenues
   including the development of age-sensitive models and theories.

AB Durkheim's theory of religion is approached from the perspective of his
   lifelong concern with the question of meaning and moral order in modern
   society. This emphasis naturally leads to a consideration of wider
   themes informing Durkheim's sociology of religion than are usually found
   in analyses focusing exclusively on his treatment of primitive religion
   in The Elementary Forms of Religious Life (1964). Durkheim wes as the
   distinguishing feature of modernity the progressive emancipation of the
   individual from traditional sources of influence. The evolution toward
   greater individuation, culminating in the ''cult of the individual'' or
   ''religion of humanity,'' is set by Durkheim within the context of the
   role of collective ideals in promoting social change and in the
   maintenance of moral order. Religion, the major symbolic expression of
   societal wide ideals, is identified as the key variable which enables
   Durkheim to reconcile the competing demands of individuals for freedom
   with the interests of society in collective welfare.

   This article attempts to address that issue by suggesting that the

   concept of the sociological imagination, I suggest that the act of
   composing any written work is a movement from the very personal and
   private to the larger social context of considering one's audience, the
   conventions of writing, and other structural (or public) issues and back
   again to the private and personal. The article concludes with
   implications for instructors who require students to write and who seek

AB One of the difficulties of integrating environmental variables into
   sociological analyses is that societies have a dualistic relationship
   with the biophysical environment. Humans are like other species in
   depending on the environment, yet humans are also unique among all
   species in the potential for altering and sometimes evading
   environmental constraints. A second and related difficulty results from
   the degree to which humans incorporate the environment into their
   everyday views of reality; the process often seems so automatic that the
   biophysical realities can be forgotten, taken for granted, or ignored,
   both by residents and by those who study them. This problem is
   particularly significant for studies that fail to be sufficiently
   comparative to be able to observe significant variations in
   environmental and technological factors. The problem is illustrated with
   a study that deals with a relatively traditional social-psychological
   dependent variable-attitudes toward a proposed development. The focus is
   on the apparent paradox of a form of industrial development that has
   been welcomed with open arms in one area of the country while virtually
   opening armed warfare in another, namely drilling for offshore oil. To
   explain the marked differences across regions, it is necessary to
   understand the influence of biophysical and technological variables, as
   well as the social and historical differences across the regions.
   Implications for further research are discussed.

AB Perspectives in sociology are currently being.reassessed in light of
   postmodernism, which has been associated with the abandonment of faith
   in the social self and scientific inquiry. As an emergent problematic,
   postmodernism stands in sharp contrast to a modernist pragmatic (and
   innocent) conception of symbolic interactionism-which is centered in the
   Meadian conception of prosocial selves. However, this article identifies
   some ''late-modem'' interactionists-Goffman, Stone, Becker, Lemert, and
   Mills-who, in providing a corrective for an innocent pragmatic inquiry
   into the self, created a foundation for contemporary inquiry into the
   social. This corrective entailed a reconceptualization of the self as
   the focal point of the situated act and, specifically, its changing
   definition from cooperative and reflective to strategic and imaginary.
   While we suggest that their work represented a loss of innocence in
   interactionism, it did not create a loss of faith in scientific inquiry
   into the self and social action. Rather, the work of the late modernists
   has inspired a reconstruction of scientific inquiry into the social that
   encompasses, but is not encompassed by, postmodernism.

AB Max Weber's concept of formal rationality and ideas about lifestyles in
   general are applied to current trends in health lifestyles. The central
   contribution of Weber's thinking is recognition of the dialectical
   interplay between formal versus substantive rationality, consumption
   versus production, choice versus life chances, class similarities versus
   distinctions, and self-control versus conformity in shaping health
   lifestyles and the reality of their operationalization in the postmodern
   world. In a largely applied subdiscipline like medical sociology,
   Weber's work offers a theoretical background on which to enrich our
   understanding of health lifestyles and grapple with the initial
   theoretical challenges posed by lifestyle research.

AB Sociological discourse has generally represented Satanism as a harmless,
   law-abiding alternative religion. Conversely, the antisocial and
   criminal aspects of Satanism have been the focus of most lay writing and
   media exposure. Such academic and popular portrayals are reflecting
   different facets of Satanism's heterogeneous nature. Through reexamining
   the literature, this article provides a conceptual framework for
   analyzing the differences between sociological and lay depictions. The
   term ''Satanic Establishment'' is used to refer to the respectable forms
   of Satanism, whereas the ''Satanic Underground'' denotes the
   reputed-criminal elements of Satanism. With the Satanic Establishment
   and Underground at opposite positions, a Satanic continuum of social

   the war as a case study for two topics central to the concerns of

   to address two questions: ''Were the burdens of war equally
   distributed?'' and ''Was the American military handicapped in Vietnam by
   political constraints?'' To address the first question, I use
   information about the draft, draft policy, and American casualties to
   suggest that policy reproduced institutionalized inequalities of race
   and class. To the second question I bring to bear measures of American
   operations-expenditures and destructive force-and total casualties to
   argue that conservative apologies invoking self-defeating limits ignore
   the magnitude and consequences of our efforts in Vietnam. Within the
   synopsis, I incorporate sources for data, note some problems in the data
   available, make suggestions about interpretation, and address some

AB This paper constructs a set of criteria for identifying the paradigmatic
   underpinnings of racial and ethnic relations textbooks. It applies those
   criteria to 10 recent books and summarizes the findings. With few
   exceptions, the textbooks favor assimilationist, cultural pluralist, or
   eclectic approaches. The compilation of social histories is emphasized
   over theory review and evaluation. The debate on the declining
   significance of race receives little attention. Comparative analysis
   reveals a number of problems in these books; for example, eclectic
   approaches are constructed from a set of contradictory assumptions. The
   paper argues that these problems are rooted in the troubled relationship
   between American liberalism and the sociology of racial and ethnic
   relations. It concludes by briefly suggesting how these problems can be
   overcome.

AB In current science studies, there are only few systematic efforts at
   explaining how different scientific specialties change over time. Such
   specialties are viewed here as organizations in which workers deal with
   various degrees of task uncertainty and mutual dependence. The
   sociological theory of change suggests that scientific change is
   generally triggered by competition, but that various types of change
   depend on the social organization and status of scientific groups. Some
   fields change through permanent discoveries, some through specialization
   and cumulation, yet others change through cognitive fragmentation. This
   argument can synthesize the various independent branches of contemporary
   science studies. The proposed theory has wider significance for some
   core problems in sociology, such as the relationship between the natural
   and social sciences, the prospects for a science of society, and the
   possibility of cumulative progress.

AB During a career that has spanned more than 40 years, Roy Francis has
   made substantial contributions to sociological teaching and research.
   Building on his experiences as a student, he holds dear the ideals of a
   liberal education and continues to search for new ways of transmitting
   those ideals in the face of changing social patterns. A prolific writer,
   Francis' books and papers often examine the proper relations between
   theory and research and explore the potential of symbolic interactionism
   as an epistemological framework. He has been active in sociology's
   professional affairs, especially in promoting visual sociology as a
   teaching and learning medium. His roles as a student, professor,
   administrator, and president of the Midwest Sociological Society round
   out a career that has encompassed all facets of modem scholarship. In
   each of these roles, Francis stresses the moral dimensions of the
   academic life, and he instills in his students the sense of intellectual
   obligation to their scholarly forebears that he feels toward his own.

   The present study utilizes an auditory elicitation approach. That is,

AB One of the central goals of teaching sociology is the development in
   students of sociological perspective, which encourages them to reflect
   on their own society from a distance. The concept of ethnocentrism is
   often introduced in sociology courses to sensitize students to the ways
   in which their perceptions of social life are shaped by the fact that
   they are ''insiders'' to their own society and ''outsiders'' to others.
   Here we discuss a series of instructional techniques built around the
   use of Horace Miner's classic, ''Body Ritual among the Nacirema,'' which
   we have developed and implemented to assist students in developing an
   awareness of social influences on their perceptions and judgments. The
   techniques are based on the observation that ethnocentrism involves two

   and argues that a new paradigm is emerging in that field, the crux of
   which is that organized religion thrives in the United States in an open
   market system, an observation anomalous to the older paradigm's monopoly
   concept. The article has six sections: first, a brief survey of the
   paradigm crisis; second, a development of the concept of an open market
   in the historiography and sociology of U. S. religion; third, fourth,
   and fifth, arguments that U. S. religious institutions are
   constitutively pluralistic, structurally adaptable, and empowering;
   sixth, a consideration of recent religious individualism in the light of
   the new paradigm. A conclusion sketches some research implications.

   the computer-assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences,
   ''event-structure analysis,'' that infuses narrative with greater rigor
   and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in
   Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can

AB Refugees are individuals forced to flee from their homelands because of
   categorical persecution or because they are bystanders caught in the
   crossfire of war or civil strife. Such involuntary exile often leads to
   alienation in the most literal sense of the term. Whether expellees,
   escapees, or displaced persons, refugees share a common fate and, often,
   a common destiny: those who are dispossessed are dependent on others to
   provide care, succor, protection, and assistance. Yet responses to their
   plight are almost invariably highly selective, the quality of mercy
   being strained by considerations other than pure altruism. This paper, a
   commentary on the sociology of exile, attempts to convey the sense and
   significance of estrangement and responses to it in both historical and
   contemporary contexts. Early sections deal with concepts and concerns;
   later ones examine United States refugee policies and practices relating
   to exile, ethnicity, and the politics of rescue.

AB Feminist phase theory describes the process of integrating women's
   studies scholarship as a series of identifiable stages, for both
   individuals and disciplines. Literature on the revolutionary and
   paradigm-shift potential of women's studies scholarship suggests
   important disciplinary differences in its construction, adoption, and
   diffusion. We reformulate feminist phase theory in paradigm shift terms,
   then operationalize and contrast two versions of it. Our analysis and
   review indicate that the missing variable in women's studies
   transformation projects is the participants' discipline. Data from our
   integration project show faculty in interpretive disciplines scoring
   higher on degree of integration of women's studies scholarship but not
   changing as a result of the project itself, while those in positivist
   disciplines do change but have lower absolute scores. These findings
   indicate a need for different integration strategies based on
   discipline. Empirical support for one sequential ordering in feminist
   phase theory argues for the importance and centrality of women-focused
   scholarship.

AB A selective appropriation of postmodernist theories is undertaken with
   special reference to their applicability to macrosociology and to other
   branches of sociological inquiry that employ conceptions of social and
   cultural totality. The appropriation is premised on the thesis that
   theories of culture, such as postmodernism, can contribute to sociology
   by their analyses of cultural form, providing sociology with general
   descriptions of what social processes must mediate and with guidance on
   how to grasp its own cultural form(s). Three notions of cultural
   totality, ''bricolage'' (Claude Levi-Strauss), ''discursive formation''
   (Michel Foucault), and ''deconstruction'' (Jacques Derrida), are
   considered. All have in common a description of cultural form that
   stresses nonsystematic order. They are contrasted to Talcott Parsons'
   modernist and systematizing macrotheoretic reflection on culture and
   society. A deconstruction of Parsons yields the alternative of a
   less-than-systematic, postmodernized (macro)-sociology.

AB Macrocomparative research has a broad reach within the discipline. We

   nations or of structures and processes within two or more nations. We
   focus on how macrocomparative sociologists address the threats to
   validity which surround sample selection, research design, and data and
   measurement. Nearly all the studies we investigate have explanation as a
   goal. A major threat to many studies (almost a third) is the failure to
   apply any method of control. Most authors wish to draw general
   conclusions, but problems of sampling raise questions about their
   ability to do so. Researchers agree that measurement is problematic.
   However, issues surrounding measurement are largely neglected. We
   describe these and more specific empirical findings regarding the
   practice of macrocomparative research.

AB Research on life transitions highlights the normative and nonnormative
   changes that individuals experience over time. During the past two
   decades, life course perspectives have provided a strategic context for
   studying the genesis of life transitions and their personal and social
   consequences. Both population-based and individual models of transitions
   have become more complex, focusing on the ways that social and
   historical contexts shape life transitions. At the individual level,
   progress has also been made in identifying the mechanisms by which
   transitions affect outcomes. Research on life transitions continues to
   grapple with two major issues-the challenges raised by heterogeneity,
   and the need to better link macro and micro perspectives-although
   advances have been made in both cases. One of the most promising
   characteristics of recent studies is cross-fertilization of concepts and
   methods from previously distinct research traditions: role theory,
   social stress theory, and life course sociology.

   incorparating the subject into the classroom is a useful means of

   nutrition can be taught in several settings, including in sociology
   departments as an entire course, in lectures in other courses, or in
   continuing and occasional examples. Sociologists also teach in nutrition
   and food science departments and other applied settings. Three
   approaches to teaching in this area are described: 1) sociology of food
   and nutrition. 2) food and society, and 3) nutritional sociology.
   Practical instructional issues in teaching the sociology of food and
   nutrition include combining the fields of sociology and nutrition, the
   diversity of students, experiential learning, and team teaching.
   Teaching resources include reading materials, audiovisuals, syllabi,

AB This paper explores the possibility of developing a general and formal
   social-action theory of labeling emotions. The theory is based upon the
   assumption that there is an underlying formal structural social-action
   system of expectations and sanctions that significantly influence how
   actors label their emotions. Some permutations of the four basic
   expectation-sanction states are elaborated, hypothetically labeled, and
   tested over a 14-year period.  The ''constructionist'' view of the
   necessity of a cultural context in labeling emotions is challenged by
   removing the ''moral'' content from the survey instrument. The findings
   indicate that the formal model, devoid of content, is effective in
   differentiating emotion labels. The tests yielded promising results for
   developing a comprehensive and formal mapping of emotions. Taxonomical
   extrapolations of the theory are suggested and some further applications
   and needed research are discussed.

AB There has been a long-standing debate over who controls the large
   American corporation. The results presented here indicate that existing
   power relations within the firm, the conception of control that
   dominates the firm's actions, and the actions of competitors account for
   the economic actions undertaken by large firms, while the differences in
   manager or owner or bank control and the presence of bank interlocks do
   not. A sociology of markets is therefore more likely to account for the
   courses of actions of large firms by considering these relations, rather
   than focusing on the construction of interests by bankers, owners, or
   board interlocks.

EP 332
PD FAL 1992
PY 1992
AB Raw material extraction once offered an effective route to economic
   development, but societal relationships with environment and technology
   have changed so fundamentally that extractive industries today appear
   more likely to lead rural regions to economic addiction. Key
   characteristics of addictive activities include rising costs of
   operation at most extractive facilities, combined with downward trends
   in world commodity prices. Key characteristics of vulnerable communities
   and regions include increasing geographic isolation, imbalances of scale
   and power with respect to extractive industries, and the absence of
   realistic alternatives for diversified development. Key pressures toward
   addiction are created by ambiguities that mask the addictive tendencies,
   including ambiguities of price signals, of employment and development
   possibilities for remote regions, and of resource exhaustion. The net
   result is that, while the encouragement to develop extractive industries
   is often coupled with advice to avoid developing an excessive dependency
   on a single economic sector, the very regions and nations having the
   greatest need to hear such advice may also have the lowest realistic
   ability to respond to it.

AB The purpose of this article is to raise some questions and to make some
   observations about the linkages of sociology to its specialties by
   reviewing the changing relationship of sociology and criminology. In the
   United States, the development of criminology as a field of study has
   been closely linked to the development of sociology as a discipline, and
   sociology has given American criminology its distinctive cast.
   Criminology has benefited from theoretical and methodological
   developments in sociology and in tum has contributed to sociology as one
   of its central specialties. In the past two decades, the dominance of
   sociology in criminology has diminished, and criminology has gravitated
   somewhat away from the cen ter of sociology. However, sociology remains
   very much the intellectual 'center of gravity" in criminology, and
   criminology remains an important part of sociology. Both criminology and
   sociology will benefit by a continuation and reinvigoration of their
   prior relationship.

AB This article uses a sociology of knowledge approach to discuss the
   reproduction of inequality within the sociocultural world of clerical
   workers. A model of a semiotic square is used to analyze the experiences
   of bored and busy work. Through this analysis of bored and busy work,
   the author discovered clerical workers' perceptions and activities which
   were both subordinating and empowering. Clerical workers participate in
   the process of subordination through bored/busy work. However, they also
   participate in empowering strategies through not-bored/not-busy work.
   This sociology of knowledge approach shows that people are not
   automatons and strengthens our understanding of the social reproduction
   of inequality as a multi-faceted phenomenon.

AB Drawing on a 3-year ethnography and participant observation study of a
   ghetto gym in Chicago, this article purports to (a) de-exoticize the
   subproletarian bodily craft of boxing by uncovering its embedded social
   logic and meaning, and (b) contribute to a theory of practice that
   escapes the false antinomies associated with rational choice and
   normative models of action. The first part explores the peculiar
   relation of symbiotic opposition that ties the boxing gym to its
   proximate social matrix of the black ghetto and to the masculine street
   culture from which it draws its sustenance and shelters its members. The
   second part treats boxing as a Durkheimian "social art" whose mastery
   involves an intensive, ascetic, and strictly regulated manipulation of
   the body designed to inculcate through direct embodiment the set of
   corporeal, visual, and mental schemata immanent to pugilistic practice.
   The social production of the pugilistic habitus as embodied practical
   reason thus suggests the need to place the socialized lived body at the
   center of the analysis of social action.

AB Previous research contends that when Talcott Parsons developed the
   substantive argument of The Structure of Social Action, he turned away
   from the theoretical emptiness of American social science and drew on
   the ideas of four European social thinkers- Weber, Durkheim, Pareto, and
   Marshall. Such research exemplifies the "content-fit model" of
   predecessor selection, which assumes that intellectual predecessors are
   chosen on the basis of a fit between their ideas and the project of the
   thinker who engages them. This model fails to explain Parsons's
   exclusion of the American institutionalists, most notably his Amherst
   teachers Walton Hamilton and Clarence Ayres, whose work fit directly
   with the argument of The Structure of Social Action. Institutionalist
   work was also characterized, however, by its negative reputation,
   particularly at, Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where
   Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber were thinkers of growing
   reputational standing. Examination of Parsons's involvement in the local
   Harvard network indicates that contemporary reputational judgments
   decisively affected his choice of intellectual predecessors. This
   analysis also brings to light the organizational and institutional
   conditions under which a "reputational model" is required to understand
   the process of predecessor selection.

AB Over the past few years, numerous studies in sociology have concluded
   that foreign investment harms poor nations. These studies have focused
   on the coefficient for foreign capital stock, controlling for "flow"
   (new investment), and-defying logic-have inferred that a negative
   coefficient for stock reflects "dependency effects" that retard economic
   growth. Since capital stock is the denominator for investment rate, the
   greater the stock, the lower the investment rate, for a given level of
   new investment. Hence the negative coefficient for capital stock found
   in dependency studies indicates a beneficial investment effect, not a
   harmful effect. This point is demonstrated by reanalysis of the data
   used in dependency studies. In these data, foreign investment spurs
   growth. Earlier analysts have concluded otherwise only because their
   conclusions have belied their findings.

   Third World education in introductory sociology textbooks. To examine
   this issue, we first provide a content analysis of the chapters on
   education in 22 current texts. This analysis reveals that such texts
   tend to provide an ethnocentric portrayal of education by placing the
   United States and other northern industrialized nations at the center of
   the educational universe while virtually ignoring educational issues in
   relation to the three-quarters of the world's population, those who live
   in Third World nations. We then suggest specific issues regarding Third

AB The use of internships in educating sociology majors has increased in
   recent years so that currently most departments offer some type of
   internship opportunity. Most programs are on a small scale, offering
   three or four hours of course credit. Although a major justification of
   internship programs is that they help students in career choice
   clarification, there has been little hard evidence that small-scale
   programs achieve this end. Using qualitative and quantitative data to
   evaluate a small-scale internship program, this research found that it
   helped students significantly in clarifying career choices, by providing
   information on occupations, reducing indecisiveness and anxiety
   regarding choice, and increasing confidence in the ability to choose.

   addressed an extraordinarily broad array of social phenomena, often of a
   community problem variety, in his research. His research employed a
   social systems analysis frequently focused on the rural context and had
   a strong applied orientation with the result that his findings have been
   widely used as the basis for the formulation of important national and
   international program and policy decisions. Bertrand's work has
   attracted wide attention abroad as well as in the United States. Because
   of his many contributions to the discipline of sociology, he has
   received numerous awards and recognitions and has also been elected to
   various offices in professional societies and associations, including

AB Historical sociologists have criticized their discipline for a tendency
   to ignore the temporal dimensions of social life, either by studying the
   correlates of outcomes rather than the character of temporally connected
   events or by treating events as surface manifestations of large-scale
   and long-term processes of change. These critiques have led to a
   reassessment of the value of narratives and to new methods for mapping
   historical sequences of events. Yet there has been relatively little
   discussion of the concepts needed to create a more event-centered
   historical sociology. This article explores the way in which four
   different concepts of time - duration, pace, trajectory, and cycle -
   have been used in recent historical social science. These concepts allow
   one to analyze the temporal characteristics of connected events that
   constitute long-term historical processes as well as the way in which
   actors understand and experience the temporal flow of events. They are
   most useful, the author argues when employed in a manner that is
   attentive to the understandings of social actors and the problematic
   reconstruction of the past. These concepts constitute building blocks
   for the construction of a more event-centered historical sociology.

AB With the re-emergence of historical sociology as a dominant focus of
   inquiry has come a renewed interest in more general methodological,
   theoretical, and epistemological issues that have long occupied debates
   about the relationship between history and theory. A recently published
   article by Edgar Kiser and Michael Hechter brings to the fore several
   core themes in these debates. Kiser and Hechter claim that comparative
   historical sociologists not only have turned against general theory but
   theories in general. The authors argue that these conclusions are based
   on a narrow definition of the enterprise of historical sociology and on
   an attempt to confine the definition of theory to general laws. In this
   article, they first demonstrate that historical sociologists have not
   forsaken theory. Next, they articulate the dilemmas that general
   theories defined as general laws pose for historical analysis, and
   finally, they delineate what methodologically self-conscious historical
   sociologists have identified as the core elements of a temporally
   grounded historical sociology.

   structure of joint specialization in sociology are derived from four
   general theories of professional and scientific specialization: 
   ideational theory, political-economic theory, professional power theory,
   and intellectual circle/network theory.  We analyze joint specialty
   section memberships using multidimensional scaling techniques and
   produce a spatial model of the discipline's specialty structure.  The
   tightest clusters of specialties arise from the confluence of ideational
   aspects (like shared concepts or subject matter), professional power
   interests, and social characteristics of members.  Although a major
   division in the discipline is embedded in the political-economic
   environment of sociology, three cross-cutting dimensions are required to
   adequately  represent the discipline's structure. The main dimensions of
   differentiation are:  (1) "conflict" versus "applied" perspectives, (2)
   micro versus macro units of analysis, and (3) ascriptive characteristics
   of members. These three dimensions support the validity of
   political-economic, ideational, and professional power theories,
   respectively.

AB Can microcomputers enhance the goals of teaching and learning in
   sociology?  This paper attempts to answer this question.  Aiming
   primarily at nonusers, the author first outlines the negatives and
   positives of using PCs.  Negatives include expense, hassle, and
   uncertainty.  The positives arise from the functional strengths of PCs
   and from the fact that they are interactive, customizable, efficient,
   and open-ended.  Next the author describes her experiences using a PC in
   an introductory sociology classroom:  to prepare and present visual
   materials, to teach basic concepts and analytic strategies, to
   illustrate analytical storylines, and to engage students in posing
   sociological questions and hypotheses explored instantaneously in class.
   The author concludes by suggesting additional applications and by
   reflecting on issues raised by the experience.

AB Chances of realizing a legal rationality that does not fit society are
   limited. Referring to Weber's "Sociology of Law," to related themes in
   the sociology of polity, organizations, and occupations, and to recent
   debates on technocratization, juridification, delegalization, and
   responsive law, this article presents a theoretical discussion of this
   thesis. An empirical case, using the neoclassical concept of sentencing
   guidelines, exemplified by the federal and Minnesota cases, supports the
   argument. The neoclassical movement, aiming to reverse the
   substantivation of law and to correct lack of due process, functional
   failures, disparities, and discrimination, faces considerable
   impediments and may result in counterproductive effects. The article
   demonstrates that (1) societal conditions that caused substantivation
   hamper reformalization in the political process; organizational and
   occupational consequences of substantivation also impede (2) political
   and (3) implementation chances of neoclassical instruments; and (4)
   impediments to reformalization derive from the method of central
   guidance used to reestablish sociologically formal rationality.

AB Today sociologists tend to doubt the rural-urban continuum, the idea

   Based on an ethnographic study of an English exurban village, I argue
   that the continuum remains an important source of identity for country
   residents, one from which they derive social-psychological and material
   benefits. They root this conception of themselves as country people in
   nature, making this identity a particularly secure one. These real
   social consequences suggest that sociology should no longer doubt the
   reality of the rural-urban continuum, at least at the level of the
   definition of the situation. It, therefore, should remain an important
   topic of sociological study.

   theories, geopolitical theories, and institutional theories.  Although
   rarely formulated explicitly, the first three approaches are implicit in
   the existing literature on proliferation.  All three see proliferation
   as the result of rational decision making, although they differ as to
   the locus of these decisions, with strategic-functional theories
   focusing on the nation-state, factional theories on subnational
   interests, and geopolitical theories on global superpowers.  In
   contrast, the institutional approach disputes the rationality of
   procurement, arguing instead that weapons purchases are structured and
   driven by institutionalized normative structures that link advanced
   weaponry with modernization and soverignty.  The policy implications of
   this perspective are discussed, and parallels to recent developments in
   organizational theory are highlighted.

   sociology: total segregation, as in all-male faculties; appointments of
   women in token or solo positions; variations in the departmental faculty
   sex ratio; and the "ghettoization" of women in lower academic ranks and
   positions with heavy committee assignments. These outcomes are analyzed
   at the organizational level as the product of the operation of internal
   and external labor markets in academia. Drawing on a representative 1984
   national survey of sociology departments (N = 230), multivariate
   analyses indicate that a large proportion of the variation in gender
   integration from one department to the next can be predicted from the
   organizational context. Several organizational factors appear to
   militate against total segregation (all-male faculties) while promoting
   balance in the faculty sex ratio and in the distribution of academic
   rank. These include demand for labor in the form of job opportunities,
   especially those created through turnover; women in the institutional
   power structure, including a separate women's studies program; and a
   state legislative climate favoring women's legal and political rights.

AB Blau's (1977) macrostructural theory builds on the assumption that
   social structure affects intergroup relations.  This relationship
   depends upon the opportunity for intergroup contact.  Previous tests of
   Blau's theory, however, treat opportunity as an unmeasured construct. 
   P*, as a measure of opportunity for intergroup contact, not only enables
   a test of that assumption, but also merges general sociological
   principles with specific middle-range ones like those urban sociology
   develops.
   Findings here modestly support Blau's opportunity for contact
   assumption.  Serendipitously, the analysis demonstrates that
   heterogeneity asymmetrically influences opportunities for intergroup
   contact between groups of varying size.  Because increasing
   heterogeneity presupposes an increase in the minority proportion and a
   decrease in the majority, it enhances majority and suppresses minority
   opportunities for intergroup contact.  This suggests that Blau's
   heterogeneity theorem, which assumes a symmetrical effect on contact,
   needs some qualification.

AB It is relatively easy to determine if evidence supports or does not
   support a given theory or conclusion, but a central problem in sociology
   is our inability to go beyond this and develop truly convincing evidence
   about a theory.  Several changes in current practices are vital,
   including the cessation of nonproductive assaults between sociologists
   on the evidence used in the discipline.  More fundamentally, theory
   should not be viewed as one pole of a continuum with research on the
   other end.  A probabilistic view of theory is proposed such that a
   theory may be correct even if there is negative evidence.  This leads to
   a different way of evaluating evidence, a different view of the role of
   examples, a distinction between explanations of particular events as
   opposed to evaluations of theories, skepticism about the possibility of
   developing theories that account for long complex chains of events, and
   a sharp differentiation between the evidence used in applied as opposed
   to basic research.  A new sociological specialty should concern itself
   with epistemological issues that arise in determining the verifiable
   propositions that are the basic building blocks to sociological
   knowledge.

AB In this article, data on home health agencies reveal surprisingly few
   differences between organizations of different tax status (nonprofit vs.
   forprofit). These findings directly contradict economic theories of
   nonprofit organization, as well as third-party government theory from
   political science. Since ecological theory in sociology proposes a
   useful explanation for organizational similarities, the authors search
   for differences between nonprofit and forprofit organizations among
   generalists and specialists. They find that specialists are quite
   similar, regardless of tax status, but generalists are different, a
   disparity that seems to contradict ecological analysis. Since
   institutional theory also explains isomorphism, the authors search for
   differences between organizations that do and do not belong to chains.
   Chains are more similar than nonchains. The discussion of the results
   centers on changes in the institutional context of home health care over
   the last decade, especially cascade effects of prospective payment
   schemes and the advent of new organizational forms. The authors conclude
   that the idea of accommodative isomorphism helps account for
   similarities among nonprofit and for-profit chains.

AB As a result of environmental and agrarian activism and of academic

   agricultural technoscience onto new trajectories. A critical rural
   sociology has played a key role in pushing forward the deconstructive
   project that has been instrumental in creating this space. And rural
   sociologists can be active agents in the reconstruction of the
   alternative science that must emerge from "actually existing" science
   and that must be developed if there is to be a truly alternative
   agriculture. But to be effective in this effort we need to enlarge not
   only the canon of our colleagues in the natural sciences, but our own
   canon as well. This article suggests that the theoretical resources for
   such reconstruction are available in contemporary sociological and

   reconstruction of a "successor science" are to be found in the "local
   knowledge" that is continually produced and reproduced by farmers and
   agricultural workers. Articulations and complementarities between
   theoretical resources are suggested and potentially productive research
   areas are outlined.

AB American norms for the proper timing of events are reflected in a
   preference for academic achievement "on schedule." Unlike most other
   societies with formalized education, however, we also tolerate
   educational late blooming. The preference for blooming "on time" may be
   explained by the positive social functions of scheduling educational
   success. Such rigidity in the American experience, however, would run
   counter to the value we place on higher education as a medium for
   equality of opportunity and would threaten the existence of many
   institutions of higher learning that serve specialized markets. While
   the American tolerance for educational late blooming has created
   opportunities not found in other societies, late blooming may also have
   the latent dysfunction of encouraging "temporal loafing. "

PD FAL 1991
PY 1991
AB This paper situates metatheorizing in a postpositivist approach to
   social science.  Postpositivism contends that social science is
   organized around competing traditions, which are comprised of
   generalized discourse and research programs.  Following an examination
   of the relations between discourse and programs, the dynamics fueling
   social scientific competition are outlined.  Because that competition is
   subject to recurrent distortions and therefore cannot insure that the
   best arguments win, it is proposed that metatheorizing assume an
   adjudicative posture and evaluate the conflicting claims of rival
   schools.  This suggestion is elaborated in the context of Ritzer's
   pioneering work on metatheorizing.

PY 1991
AB The current debates on metatheory in sociology do not account for the
   fact that metatheorizing, as a distinct intellectual activity, is
   unequally distributed throughout the sciences.  As a reflexive and
   critical subspecialty, metatheory and metasociology are more likely to
   routinely accompany work in loosely coupled and highly controversial
   disciplines.  The theory of scientific organizations explains the
   propensity for metatheorizing as the outcome of weak and conversational
   fields that rely mostly on texts to support their discourse.

VL 34

BP 337
EP 357
PD FAL 1991
PY 1991
AB When Parsons derived action theory from Durkheim's sociology, he also
   argued with Durkheim, disputed his claims, and expressly rejected some
   of his fundamental principles.  Accordingly, American functionalism
   contained a hidden "negative image" of Durkheim.  Parsons's student,
   Harold Garfinkel, addressed functionalism at its weak points, eventually
   overthrowing most of what Parsons had to say about society.  Some of
   these weak points were predicated on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim,
   including explicit rejection of Durkheim's equivalences between society,
   morality, and objective reality.  Garfinkel's ethnomethodology therefore
   rejected what had been premised on Parsons's rejection of Durkheim.  In
   so doing, it reversed the negative image of Durkheim back to its
   positive classical form and empirically demonstrated some of Durkheim's
   most troubling principles.  Since Garfinkel did not deliberately recover
   Durkheim in this manner, the dynamics of this case make it an
   interesting study of how theorists read other theorists.

   the three branches of meta-study, though previously unrelated, are now
   rapidly converging, signaling, among other things, the existence of a
   sustained crisis in the discipline.  It concludes that meta-study will
   continue to grow in sociology for some time to come.

EP 235
PD SUM 1991
PY 1991
AB Karl Polanyi remains one of the most trenchant critics of neoclassical
   economics. His "embeddedness" thesis, which holds that all economic
   activities and institutions are enmeshed in social relations and
   institutions, offers a sound theoretical basis for economic sociology.
   Nonetheless, he fails to embed the market concept. This theoretical
   lacuna manifests itself in his classic account of the rise of market
   society in England, The Great Transformation ([1944] 1957), where he
   neglects to consider institutional diversity and discontinuities in
   English commercial development. Polanyi's embeddedness thesis can be
   taken to its logical conclusion; that is, even the market can be
   embedded. "Markets" can be treated as social networks or organizations
   constituted by traders. I offer as an empirical illustration a brief
   case study of the rise of "market society" in England.
